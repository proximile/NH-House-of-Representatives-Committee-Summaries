Bill 113 and I want to thank the uh the
 
00:07:31.869 --> 00:07:31.879 align:start position:0%
bipartisan co-sponsors of that bill I've
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
already indicated to Chairman Vose that
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
I think the best course of action for
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is to be retained in committee
 
00:07:42.990 --> 00:07:43.000 align:start position:0%
to give The Advocates uh more time to
 
00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
try to build the consensus necessary uh
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
for it to move forward so let me just
 
00:07:51.950 --> 00:07:51.960 align:start position:0%
very briefly say what the intent of the
 
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:56.440 align:start position:0%
bill is it is designed to ensure
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
consistency within our uh RPS s in New

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:09.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire with a
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
consistency of alternative compliance
 
00:08:16.029 --> 00:08:16.039 align:start position:0%
payments across the board at
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
$55 I think um passage of this bill
 
00:08:22.589 --> 00:08:22.599 align:start position:0%
would have a very limited um impact on
 
00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:25.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's electricity rates rates
 
00:08:28.629 --> 00:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
excuse me given the low price of
 
00:08:30.869 --> 00:08:30.879 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits today and I
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
think if you look at um some of the
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
documentation from the Public Utilities
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
Commission about the RPS um RPS costs
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
are very very small in the overall
 
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:49.080 align:start position:0%
scheme of electric bills um it makes at
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
$55 across the board alternative
 
00:08:55.310 --> 00:08:55.320 align:start position:0%
compliance payments uh technology
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
neutral which I think is a good way uh
 
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
to encourage competition amongst the
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
best options for technology uh one thing
 
00:09:08.590 --> 00:09:08.600 align:start position:0%
that it does do I think I should point
 
00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:13.200 align:start position:0%
out if you look at um line five of the
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
senate pass version of the bill it adds
 
00:09:20.269 --> 00:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
hydrogen derived from water currently
 
00:09:24.269 --> 00:09:24.279 align:start position:0%
right now um hydrogen does qualify for a
 
00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
wreck credit if it's um comes from um
 
00:09:33.069 --> 00:09:33.079 align:start position:0%
biomass fuels or methane uh there's a
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
new technology that a company in the
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
northern part of New Hampshire is
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
pioneering uh that would make hydrogen
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
from water and so it applies the same
 
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
technology neutral standard for that
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
technology so happy to answer any
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
questions I think there are probably a
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
number of people uh that will testify in
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
favor the bill the Senate to pass this
 
00:10:02.870 --> 00:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
bill I believe on a unanimous Vote or
 
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
almost unanimous vote um and we commend
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
it to you but as I said uh Mr chairman I
 
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
think given the ongoing need to build a
 
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
consensus best option for this bill is
 
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:24.680 align:start position:0%
it okay thank you Senator Bradley for
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
that introduction I do have one quick
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
question for you if we do retain this
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
bill would there be any usefulness in
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
extracting the portion of the bill that
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
talks about hydrogen from water
 
00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:44.320 align:start position:0%
extracting that portion and adding it to
 
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:45.910 align:start position:0%
extracting that portion and adding it to
another

00:10:45.910 --> 00:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh you know what I I think that
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
that would make a lot of sense Mr
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
chairman whether you choose to do it in
 
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:56.360 align:start position:0%
the house or or potentially we choose to
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
do it um in the Senate I think that is
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
is a standalone issue and I um encourage
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
that thank
 
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
you okay why don't you and I uh talk
 
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
about that offline and we'll figure out
 
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:12.120 align:start position:0%
the best way to go with that
 
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:15.160 align:start position:0%
okay chairman the chair now recognizes
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:23.629 --> 00:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
hi thank you Mr chairman
 
00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:26.200 align:start position:0%
um uh and thank you Miss Senator Bradley
 
00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify um Could you um
 
00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:32.440 align:start position:0%
explain to our committee a little bit
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
more the role of the um the um
 
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.670 align:start position:0%
more the role of the um the um
alternative

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:37.680 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
00:11:40.509 --> 00:11:40.519 align:start position:0%
compliance uh payments and how that
 
00:11:43.470 --> 00:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
affects small scale generators right
 
00:11:46.509 --> 00:11:46.519 align:start position:0%
now a different price yeah thank you
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
very much for that question um an
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance payment is
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
something that a distribution utility
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
would enter into if there are not um
 
00:12:00.629 --> 00:12:00.639 align:start position:0%
renewable energy credits available and
 
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
it's a way of um
 
00:12:07.190 --> 00:12:07.200 align:start position:0%
encouraging uh the production of
 
00:12:10.350 --> 00:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
smallscale renewable energy resources in
 
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.790 align:start position:0%
smallscale renewable energy resources in
New

00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so followup Mr chairman follow
 
00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:23.000 align:start position:0%
up so my understanding is that the ACP
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
payment is sort of the floor for price
 
00:12:28.389 --> 00:12:28.399 align:start position:0%
of of of these uh generators is that
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
correct that's
 
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:32.600 align:start position:0%
correct thank
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
you chair recognizes representative Cali
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:43.189 --> 00:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
question good morning Senator uh I
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
looking at uh some of the reports and I
 
00:12:48.509 --> 00:12:48.519 align:start position:0%
I think the last one I looked at was 218
 
00:12:51.470 --> 00:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
we going into 219 and 220 some of the
 
00:12:54.710 --> 00:12:54.720 align:start position:0%
classes that were going to go up to $55
 
00:12:59.949 --> 00:12:59.959 align:start position:0%
are now running now at 26 and and lower
 
00:13:02.629 --> 00:13:02.639 align:start position:0%
So when you say
 
00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:05.560 align:start position:0%
minimal impact or not so much of an
 
00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:06.670 align:start position:0%
minimal impact or not so much of an
impact

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:06.680 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
on rates and on the
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
producers if something is going to go up
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
or Jump by
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
40% almost
 
00:13:20.750 --> 00:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
50% is that going
 
00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:24.440 align:start position:0%
to uh put an undue burden on some of
 
00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.670 align:start position:0%
to uh put an undue burden on some of
these

00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
producers well I wouldn't put an undue
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
burden on the producers and and I the
 
00:13:35.269 --> 00:13:35.279 align:start position:0%
Distributors I would um also
 
00:13:37.389 --> 00:13:37.399 align:start position:0%
remind the
 
00:13:41.110 --> 00:13:41.120 align:start position:0%
committee that um this is similar to
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that covered years 20171 18
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
and 19 which expired so that's why um
 
00:13:53.269 --> 00:13:53.279 align:start position:0%
the price impact would be nominal and I
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%
I would further say and I don't have it
 
00:13:58.110 --> 00:13:58.120 align:start position:0%
in front of me but I believe every
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
October the Public Utilities Commission
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
publishes a report of the impact of the
 
00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:08.920 align:start position:0%
renewable energy portfolio on rates in
 
00:14:12.030 --> 00:14:12.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in a in a pi shaped graph
 
00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
and I think if you look at that graph um
 
00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079 align:start position:0%
the cost of renewable energy credits is
 
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
pretty small in the
 
00:14:23.350 --> 00:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
overall um cost of constructing
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
rates may I follow up you
 
00:14:29.230 --> 00:14:29.240 align:start position:0%
may uh when I'm looking at
 
00:14:30.829 --> 00:14:30.839 align:start position:0%
at at the the
 
00:14:30.839 --> 00:14:32.910 align:start position:0%
at at the the
payments

00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
payments
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
um I think at this point there's in
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
legislation is 35 or
 
00:14:40.629 --> 00:14:40.639 align:start position:0%
$36 and now we're going to go to 55
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
across the board some of them are down
 
00:14:45.389 --> 00:14:45.399 align:start position:0%
to 26 is there a reason that we took
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
that level and put it across the
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
board without letting a due study be
 
00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:53.240 align:start position:0%
done and I know the bill wants to be
 
00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:55.480 align:start position:0%
retained so are you offering or are you
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
saying that we need to retain it until
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
we see the new studies well well I think
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
that you raise a point as to why the
 
00:15:04.389 --> 00:15:04.399 align:start position:0%
committee might want to retain the bill
 
00:15:08.710 --> 00:15:08.720 align:start position:0%
um again the across the board nature of
 
00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:11.320 align:start position:0%
it is designed to make it technology
 
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:15.680 align:start position:0%
neutral fuel neutral um and encourage
 
00:15:18.269 --> 00:15:18.279 align:start position:0%
you know the most competition possible
 
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
and to align you know the classes at
 
00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.350 align:start position:0%
and to align you know the classes at
that

00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:27.240 align:start position:0%
$55 um amount if you look in the bill in
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
the struck out portion
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of the first page of
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
the bill those are the um years in which
 
00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:43.839 align:start position:0%
it was either $45 or um $55 so that when
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
I say it it's returning to you know the
 
00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:50.120 align:start position:0%
status quo prior to uh you can see it
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
right in the
 
00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
bill as it struck out I I had one more
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
question uh yes go ahead the other
 
00:16:02.069 --> 00:16:02.079 align:start position:0%
question was that when I was looking at
 
00:16:04.509 --> 00:16:04.519 align:start position:0%
the and I did read and I did read the
 
00:16:08.990 --> 00:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
rsas and uh refresh my mind but when
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
when this bill comes up it looks to me
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
like it's going to be
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
retroactive and is it proper to pass re
 
00:16:19.639 --> 00:16:21.870 align:start position:0%
retroactive and is it proper to pass re
legislation

00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
retroactively I would think a year or
 
00:16:26.069 --> 00:16:26.079 align:start position:0%
two out would be better but it looks
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
like the way it's written it may go back
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
is that correct well that's my
 
00:16:35.150 --> 00:16:35.160 align:start position:0%
understanding if you look on the second
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
page of the bill the 2020 class rates
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
are those in effect as of December 1
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
2020 right so the bill would in effect
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
retroactively is that that's my
 
00:16:54.910 --> 00:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
understanding please correct me uh you
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
know my brain isn't functioning so
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
well uh
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
um how
 
00:17:05.710 --> 00:17:05.720 align:start position:0%
that comports with
 
00:17:09.429 --> 00:17:09.439 align:start position:0%
lines for instance 28 through 30 on the
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
prior page um where the prior rates were
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
in effect um you would probably be best
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
to ask the anybody testifying from the
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
Pu but it it should um the intent is to
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
maintain those rates that were in effect
 
00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:35.480 align:start position:0%
um prior to the expiration of those
 
00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:39.240 align:start position:0%
rates thank you if I made myself clear
 
00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.830 align:start position:0%
rates thank you if I made myself clear
thank

00:17:40.830 --> 00:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:17:43.029 --> 00:17:43.039 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you the chair now
 
00:17:45.310 --> 00:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative PL for a
 
00:17:48.669 --> 00:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
question and representative PL does not
 
00:17:51.990 --> 00:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
have a mic does not have a mic so hang
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
on thank you um I understand the intent
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
to make it uniform why make it why not
 
00:18:00.070 --> 00:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
make it uniform at a lower price like 30
 
00:18:02.950 --> 00:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
instead of 55 and make make the burden
 
00:18:06.149 --> 00:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
on rate payers easier so
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
representative the point of it at $55 is
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
to provide a floor for um smallscale
 
00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
indigenous New Hampshire resources there
 
00:18:21.549 --> 00:18:21.559 align:start position:0%
are quite a few jobs that you know are
 
00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:25.360 align:start position:0%
dependent on this um it obviously is a
 
00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
diversification of our energy uh
 
00:18:32.310 --> 00:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
resources and again um I think if you go
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
back to the
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
documentation provided to your committee
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
to the Senate um that pi-shaped graph
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
and I wish I had it in front of me I
 
00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't um it's a fairly
 
00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.149 align:start position:0%
apologize I don't um it's a fairly
small

00:18:48.149 --> 00:18:48.159 align:start position:0%
small
 
00:18:52.630 --> 00:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
um cost of the overall cost of a bill
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
and if we do nothing you at $30 you'd
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
basically be
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
maintaining um what's already in effect
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
for class three and class 4 go up
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:14.789 --> 00:19:14.799 align:start position:0%
down okay thank you Senator Bradley uh
 
00:19:16.870 --> 00:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative McGee is recognized for a
 
00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:19.240 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:19:20.909 --> 00:19:20.919 align:start position:0%
thank you senator for coming here to
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
testify today I know you've already
 
00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:25.760 align:start position:0%
answered a few questions about why
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
consistency um among the classes is I
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
think it's a great idea so people can
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually have it in their mind and
 
00:19:34.630 --> 00:19:34.640 align:start position:0%
understand what the rates are instead of
 
00:19:36.270 --> 00:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
them all being different but I was
 
00:19:38.430 --> 00:19:38.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if you knew if other states
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
also priced their um RPS
 
00:19:46.990 --> 00:19:47.000 align:start position:0%
classes the same um in order for I guess
 
00:19:49.029 --> 00:19:49.039 align:start position:0%
the distribution companies to do true up
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
in an easier way uh I I don't know if it
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
simplifies the process and I guess
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm asking is um would it
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
simplify the process if we have a
 
00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:02.000 align:start position:0%
uniform rate well I suspect it would
 
00:20:04.669 --> 00:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
simplify the process but you kind of
 
00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
have me on not knowing the answer to
 
00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:09.000 align:start position:0%
what other states are doing and I
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
apologize for that well that's okay I
 
00:20:14.230 --> 00:20:14.240 align:start position:0%
was just I was just curious if it was a
 
00:20:18.270 --> 00:20:18.280 align:start position:0%
common practice or not to um to to keep
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
the rate agnostic so that they would all
 
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.750 align:start position:0%
the rate agnostic so that they would all
be

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
equal well again I think the rationale
 
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
for for it being technology neutral with
 
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:31.440 align:start position:0%
a uniform rate is to encourage
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
competition and and um the
 
00:20:39.750 --> 00:20:39.760 align:start position:0%
best um use of those dollars um to
 
00:20:42.830 --> 00:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
produce you know the energy at that rate
 
00:20:46.669 --> 00:20:46.679 align:start position:0%
I think technology neutral encourages
 
00:20:49.549 --> 00:20:49.559 align:start position:0%
competition and followup Mr chairman
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
follow up and um and along those lines
 
00:20:56.270 --> 00:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
the the 45 and 55 that were in the
 
00:20:58.190 --> 00:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph that's scratched out at the
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
bottom of page two um those rates were
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
not just arbitrarily set right they were
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
they figured out that that was um an
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate floor when they first set
 
00:21:12.830 --> 00:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
them so so yes I mean that's correct
 
00:21:15.669 --> 00:21:15.679 align:start position:0%
representative uh you know the point of
 
00:21:18.549 --> 00:21:18.559 align:start position:0%
trying to adjust these rates is to make
 
00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
sure that as I keep saying the small
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
scale indigenous New Hampshire renewable
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
energy producers have that um floor and
 
00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:30.230 align:start position:0%
energy producers have that um floor and
and

00:21:30.230 --> 00:21:30.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
obviously um you know with the price
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
pressures that these small scale New
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resources are
 
00:21:43.029 --> 00:21:43.039 align:start position:0%
experiencing um that's what had been
 
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:46.120 align:start position:0%
judged in the past to be necessary the
 
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:49.720 align:start position:0%
$55 is a small bump up but it goes back
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
to what it was in
 
00:21:55.510 --> 00:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
178 and 19 I guess the last thing I
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
would say um this bill I believe in an
 
00:22:03.310 --> 00:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
identical form just updated for the
 
00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
dates um was passed by the house and the
 
00:22:09.269 --> 00:22:09.279 align:start position:0%
Senate last year was in one of the
 
00:22:12.789 --> 00:22:12.799 align:start position:0%
Omnibus bills that did not survive the
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
process okay thank you yep
 
00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:18.679 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi is recognized
 
00:22:23.110 --> 00:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
for a question thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:22:25.269 --> 00:22:25.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator uh I'm going to
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
continue to uh inquire about this this
 
00:22:32.029 --> 00:22:32.039 align:start position:0%
floor and why it's 55 there had to be
 
00:22:34.669 --> 00:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
some logic there had to be some work
 
00:22:39.549 --> 00:22:39.559 align:start position:0%
done to to develop the the basis for
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
that floor I I would like to understand
 
00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
that can you shed light on that for me
 
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
please so I've been saying it's a floor
 
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:51.640 align:start position:0%
it it it really is both a floor and a
 
00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:56.360 align:start position:0%
ceiling at the same time um the price
 
00:22:59.750 --> 00:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
point because of the competitive nature
 
00:23:02.669 --> 00:23:02.679 align:start position:0%
of a renewable energy credit is very
 
00:23:05.909 --> 00:23:05.919 align:start position:0%
unlikely to ever go above the $55 but it
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
does also function as a floor and it is
 
00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:14.360 align:start position:0%
hoped that it will ensure that these
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
renewable energy producers you know can
 
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:21.990 align:start position:0%
renewable energy producers you know can
stay

00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
viable up so was there some kind of
 
00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:30.440 align:start position:0%
analysis done on on that some kind of
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
financial analysis that says this is the
 
00:23:37.269 --> 00:23:37.279 align:start position:0%
floor point that we need to focus on so
 
00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
over the last several years um with a
 
00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
passage I believe of Senate Bill
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
129 that I
 
00:23:48.750 --> 00:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
sponsored uh last year's bill I believe
 
00:23:52.830 --> 00:23:52.840 align:start position:0%
was House Bill 1580 and again now at
 
00:23:56.029 --> 00:23:56.039 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 113 I think the testimony
 
00:23:59.430 --> 00:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
over that um three-year period of time
 
00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
that both you folks in the house and
 
00:24:04.350 --> 00:24:04.360 align:start position:0%
those of us in the Senate have heard is
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
that that price point we hope is what
 
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
keeps those renewable energy providers
 
00:24:14.909 --> 00:24:14.919 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire viable without it
 
00:24:19.070 --> 00:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
having you know a harmful impact on
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
rates thank you thank you thank you uh
 
00:24:26.269 --> 00:24:26.279 align:start position:0%
representative bintel is now recognized
 
00:24:28.990 --> 00:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
for a question
 
00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Senator
 
00:24:35.470 --> 00:24:35.480 align:start position:0%
Bradley um there from what I understand
 
00:24:38.029 --> 00:24:38.039 align:start position:0%
the the right the rates for
 
00:24:43.909 --> 00:24:43.919 align:start position:0%
Rex are way below this 55 or even the
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
$21 price tag here in New Hampshire is
 
00:24:53.350 --> 00:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
anyone actually spending money on acps
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.750 --> 00:24:59.760 align:start position:0%
time um you'd have to ask that question
 
00:25:03.789 --> 00:25:03.799 align:start position:0%
of the puc folks but you're right um the
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
wrecks are available right now at a
 
00:25:12.149 --> 00:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
lower price um and this um at $55 again
 
00:25:15.149 --> 00:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
I keep I feel like I just keep repeating
 
00:25:18.149 --> 00:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
myself but it's designed to try to make
 
00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know those um producers viable and
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
it goes back to you know what cill 129
 
00:25:28.909 --> 00:25:28.919 align:start position:0%
established in I believe it was
 
00:25:32.909 --> 00:25:32.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.470 --> 00:25:37.480 align:start position:0%
19 followup Mr chairman ahead follow up
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
and my other question concerns your
 
00:25:44.789 --> 00:25:44.799 align:start position:0%
your um your desire to have this
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
retained uh to build consensus and I'm
 
00:25:48.039 --> 00:25:49.070 align:start position:0%
retained uh to build consensus and I'm
just

00:25:49.070 --> 00:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
wondering what aspects of this build you
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
need to to get consensus on um it seems
 
00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.510 align:start position:0%
need to to get consensus on um it seems
pretty

00:25:58.510 --> 00:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:26:00.909 --> 00:26:00.919 align:start position:0%
well it's a pretty simple bill so I'm
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
not sure that there's consensus at the
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
$55 um ACP amount and um Mr the sponsor
 
00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
of the bill I'm going to hopefully be
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
able to work with all of you folks and
 
00:26:14.190 --> 00:26:14.200 align:start position:0%
build that consensus so it gets through
 
00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.590 align:start position:0%
build that consensus so it gets through
the

00:26:17.590 --> 00:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
process uh a followup Mr chairman one
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
more question follow up go ahead thank
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman Senator Bradley right
 
00:26:33.190 --> 00:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
now we we made this number 55 35
 
00:26:36.149 --> 00:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
105 um it's kind
 
00:26:40.389 --> 00:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
of not doesn't make any difference
 
00:26:44.029 --> 00:26:44.039 align:start position:0%
because they're not even being used so
 
00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240 align:start position:0%
why not just move forward with this
 
00:26:51.350 --> 00:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
$55 price tag which appears to be
 
00:26:53.789 --> 00:26:53.799 align:start position:0%
reasonable to
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
me um
 
00:26:58.549 --> 00:26:58.559 align:start position:0%
again it I
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
think there's been some controversy
 
00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
about this bill I have heard from a lot
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
of different folks on both sides of the
 
00:27:09.310 --> 00:27:09.320 align:start position:0%
debate both the price point but also the
 
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
need to keep you know these producers
 
00:27:15.110 --> 00:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
viable so I by asking you folks to
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
retain it I think that um offers a
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.110 --> 00:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
consensus thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:27:29.389 --> 00:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
you uh Senator Bradley yep thank you
 
00:27:29.399 --> 00:27:30.230 align:start position:0%
you uh Senator Bradley yep thank you
thank

00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:27:33.070 --> 00:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
you Senator Bradley I have one question
 
00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
for you since the bill sets all the acps
 
00:27:41.830 --> 00:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
to a single price is there any rationale
 
00:27:45.269 --> 00:27:45.279 align:start position:0%
whatsoever for a combining
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
classes in the
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
RPS if we're going to have a single
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
price for acps why not just combine all
 
00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:54.350 align:start position:0%
price for acps why not just combine all
the

00:27:54.350 --> 00:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:56.870 --> 00:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
classes there might be some rationale
 
00:27:58.630 --> 00:27:58.640 align:start position:0%
behind that that that's been an idea
 
00:28:00.789 --> 00:28:00.799 align:start position:0%
that's been explored for some time as
 
00:28:04.110 --> 00:28:04.120 align:start position:0%
you know representative o um I think
 
00:28:06.990 --> 00:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
there just amongst the providers in
 
00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:10.039 align:start position:0%
class one two three and four um there's
 
00:28:13.190 --> 00:28:13.200 align:start position:0%
been some angst about that and
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
opposition to it you know that would be
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
a useful question to ask some of the
 
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
people that will
 
00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:22.039 align:start position:0%
testify behind me but that's been the
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
reason why I don't think it's ever been
 
00:28:26.430 --> 00:28:26.440 align:start position:0%
done in the
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
past okay thank you Senator um actually
 
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:32.760 align:start position:0%
there is no one else uh signed up to
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
testify that's why I asked you that
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
question but I appreciate the your
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
answer and also just before you get out
 
00:28:40.909 --> 00:28:40.919 align:start position:0%
of the building uh just wanted to let
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
you know that picture of Mount podes was
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
taken from Mount Hedgehog well there you
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
go so thank you uh Senator Bradley for
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
your testimony Mr chairman I I see that
 
00:28:54.230 --> 00:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative oxenham has her hand
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
raised ah I see that too okay
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
representative oxum you you're
 
00:28:59.870 --> 00:28:59.880 align:start position:0%
recognized for a
 
00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you very much uh Mr chair
 
00:29:06.029 --> 00:29:06.039 align:start position:0%
U Senator Bradley is it not the case
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
that the different classes were set up
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
in order to provide different incentives
 
00:29:16.750 --> 00:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
for new renewable energy resources to
 
00:29:20.669 --> 00:29:20.679 align:start position:0%
prioritize new resources over already
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
time frame so you know a dozen years ago
 
00:29:28.029 --> 00:29:28.039 align:start position:0%
and at the time you're exactly right
 
00:29:31.430 --> 00:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
um small scale Hydro
 
00:29:35.789 --> 00:29:35.799 align:start position:0%
biomass um had been had had rate orders
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
for a long time in the you know
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
regulated world of of energy
 
00:29:44.830 --> 00:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
production obviously those contracts
 
00:29:47.950 --> 00:29:47.960 align:start position:0%
were bought out at the time but they
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
still existed and and um you know
 
00:29:55.950 --> 00:29:55.960 align:start position:0%
had as you correctly note a lower
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
alternative compliance pay payment class
 
00:30:02.549 --> 00:30:02.559 align:start position:0%
two being solar class one being anything
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
new um were given a greater incentive to
 
00:30:09.430 --> 00:30:09.440 align:start position:0%
encourage more of that production but
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
we've seen significant increases in you
 
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
know that level of production so whether
 
00:30:19.950 --> 00:30:19.960 align:start position:0%
the classes are collapsed into one class
 
00:30:23.909 --> 00:30:23.919 align:start position:0%
which I think you know I would um want
 
00:30:26.669 --> 00:30:26.679 align:start position:0%
to have the testimony of all of of the
 
00:30:31.950 --> 00:30:31.960 align:start position:0%
solar the wind the um biomass and any of
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
the you know newer Technologies
 
00:30:35.039 --> 00:30:36.630 align:start position:0%
the you know newer Technologies
hydrogen

00:30:36.630 --> 00:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
hydrogen
 
00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.509 align:start position:0%
hydrogen
um

00:30:38.509 --> 00:30:38.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:41.110 --> 00:30:41.120 align:start position:0%
thermal I'd want to know what the
 
00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
consensus was amongst those folks before
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
making that judgment I think in
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
answering representative V's question
 
00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
it's a good question and something that
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know may well want to be considered
 
00:30:56.350 --> 00:30:56.360 align:start position:0%
in light of the fact where we are a
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
dozen years later ler but I think it's
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
important that um you folks and those of
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
us in the Senate if we're going to move
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
forward with that kind of an idea make
 
00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
sure that amongst the providers there's
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
broad consensus for it I'm not sure that
 
00:31:18.269 --> 00:31:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:22.269 --> 00:31:22.279 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you Senator Bradley thank
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
you sir seeing no more
 
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
questions and um from the committee and
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions
 
00:31:34.830 --> 00:31:34.840 align:start position:0%
from persons listening in as
 
00:31:37.470 --> 00:31:37.480 align:start position:0%
attendees I guess at this point we can
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing on Senate Bill
 
00:31:45.389 --> 00:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
113 thank you all very much and uh we
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
will uh take a five minute bio break and
 
00:31:52.149 --> 00:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
then we
 
00:31:55.590 --> 00:31:55.600 align:start position:0%
can I think I think we can legally start
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
the work session on Senate bill 78 even
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
though it's not scheduled on the
 
00:32:03.629 --> 00:32:03.639 align:start position:0%
calendar until 11:00 since it's not a
 
00:32:05.350 --> 00:32:05.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing or an exec session I
 
00:32:07.110 --> 00:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
think you can start work sessions at any
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
time but I'll check that during the bio
 
00:32:11.669 --> 00:32:11.679 align:start position:0%
break period and uh so we'll see you
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:56.029 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%

okay everyone it's
 
00:42:29.950 --> 00:42:29.960 align:start position:0%
10:45 I had proposed that we would
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
resume our activity at this time but

simple

00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:56:59.950 --> 00:56:59.960 align:start position:0%
Bill a bill that
 
00:57:02.510 --> 00:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh wants to
 
00:57:06.910 --> 00:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
restore the continuous appropriation of
 
00:57:09.630 --> 00:57:09.640 align:start position:0%
money from the renewable energy
 
00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:11.549 align:start position:0%
money from the renewable energy
fund

00:57:11.549 --> 00:57:11.559 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:57:14.349 --> 00:57:14.359 align:start position:0%
that continuous appropriation was
 
00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
removed by the house back in
 
00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:21.029 align:start position:0%
removed by the house back in
2017

00:57:21.029 --> 00:57:21.039 align:start position:0%
2017
 
00:57:24.349 --> 00:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
and one of the members of the house
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
finance committee who participated in
 
00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:28.710 align:start position:0%
finance committee who participated in
that

00:57:28.710 --> 00:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:32.309 --> 00:57:32.319 align:start position:0%
activity was representative Lynn obber
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
and I invited her to come this morning
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
to our committee meeting to talk to us
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
about why the finance committee thought
 
00:57:42.470 --> 00:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
it was necessary to remove that language
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:57:49.069 --> 00:57:49.079 align:start position:0%
statute this bill of course wants to
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
undo that 2017 action and restore the
 
00:57:56.950 --> 00:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
language of the bill to its
 
00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:00.230 align:start position:0%
language of the bill to its
original

00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.630 --> 00:58:03.640 align:start position:0%
form unfortunately representative obber
 
00:58:05.950 --> 00:58:05.960 align:start position:0%
is not here yet
 
00:58:10.109 --> 00:58:10.119 align:start position:0%
to discuss this with
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
us and what I'm going to attempt to do
 
00:58:17.950 --> 00:58:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.710 --> 00:58:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.589 align:start position:0%
 
this

00:58:27.589 --> 00:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:30.589 --> 00:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
basically what representative over said
 
00:58:30.599 --> 00:58:32.789 align:start position:0%
basically what representative over said
was

00:58:32.789 --> 00:58:32.799 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
that there could be a possibility of a
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
budget veto and as you'll recall there
 
00:58:41.309 --> 00:58:41.319 align:start position:0%
was a budget
 
00:58:44.670 --> 00:58:44.680 align:start position:0%
veto um in
 
00:58:47.549 --> 00:58:47.559 align:start position:0%
201 18 I
 
00:58:52.270 --> 00:58:52.280 align:start position:0%
believe and in the case of a budget veto
 
00:58:56.029 --> 00:58:56.039 align:start position:0%
it's possible that um without this
 
00:58:58.390 --> 00:58:58.400 align:start position:0%
language without the language that was
 
00:59:00.069 --> 00:59:00.079 align:start position:0%
inserted in
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
2017 that the budget for the renewable
 
00:59:08.670 --> 00:59:08.680 align:start position:0%
energy fund or the renewable energy fund
 
00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:10.430 align:start position:0%
energy fund or the renewable energy fund
um

00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:12.750 --> 00:59:12.760 align:start position:0%
monies could
 
00:59:16.430 --> 00:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
be spent without
 
00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
be spent without
legislative

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
Authority

00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason that the
 
00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:30.470 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason that the
house

00:59:30.470 --> 00:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:59:34.309 --> 00:59:34.319 align:start position:0%
um made that change back in
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
if restoring the language that appeared
 
00:59:47.069 --> 00:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
before 2017 was going to be a problem
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
and she said yes she said it could
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
happen again uh that if a budget gets
 
00:59:54.950 --> 00:59:54.960 align:start position:0%
vetoed the house would have no control
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
over the spending um from the renewable
 
00:59:57.960 --> 00:59:59.349 align:start position:0%
over the spending um from the renewable
energy

00:59:59.349 --> 00:59:59.359 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:59:59.359 --> 01:00:01.710 align:start position:0%
energy
fund

01:00:01.710 --> 01:00:01.720 align:start position:0%
fund
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
so there appears to be some reason for
 
01:00:06.990 --> 01:00:07.000 align:start position:0%
continuing to do
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
this I was hoping that representative
 
01:00:11.589 --> 01:00:11.599 align:start position:0%
obber would be here to explain it to you
 
01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
but so far no
 
01:00:16.630 --> 01:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
luck in the
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
meantime uh there are some other folks
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
who want to talk about this so let's
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
first start with representative McGee
 
01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah from what you
 
01:00:31.150 --> 01:00:31.160 align:start position:0%
I think that that was the year that
 
01:00:32.829 --> 01:00:32.839 align:start position:0%
there was
 
01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:34.760 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
believe the reason they were looking at
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
Clause uh for RPS payments was because
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
there was another bill passed that was
 
01:00:49.230 --> 01:00:49.240 align:start position:0%
giving uh the house back Authority for
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
oversight on on monies that were being
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
administered at the Pu so it seems to be
 
01:00:59.029 --> 01:00:59.039 align:start position:0%
be this this ongoing conversation around
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
did we delegate responsibility where we
 
01:01:04.069 --> 01:01:04.079 align:start position:0%
have oversight if we feel like we need
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
to pull something back do they have the
 
01:01:10.309 --> 01:01:10.319 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the RPS funds or or
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
do we because they I thought that they
 
01:01:16.270 --> 01:01:16.280 align:start position:0%
were acting as our agents in that in in
 
01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
that when
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
um in this
 
01:01:24.069 --> 01:01:24.079 align:start position:0%
example monies go into these funds
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
whether lapsing or non-lps and the way
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
this bill was explained to us I thought
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
was that they were saying based on the
 
01:01:35.029 --> 01:01:35.039 align:start position:0%
fiscal year this money would then be
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
unavailable midy year for usage so that
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
programs that were in progress would
 
01:01:46.430 --> 01:01:46.440 align:start position:0%
then have an empty budget line right the
 
01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
money would be there but it would
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
unavailable they couldn't use it so I
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
don't I feel like it's us really gumming
 
01:01:56.109 --> 01:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
up those works and so I I'm trying to
 
01:01:59.269 --> 01:01:59.279 align:start position:0%
figure out I understand what represent
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
you know and I respect representative
 
01:02:02.950 --> 01:02:02.960 align:start position:0%
obber I understand what you
 
01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.910 align:start position:0%
obber I understand what you
explained

01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
explained
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
but where do we have a part in the
 
01:02:10.430 --> 01:02:10.440 align:start position:0%
process if the funds are
 
01:02:13.390 --> 01:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
non-aps right I mean because because
 
01:02:15.069 --> 01:02:15.079 align:start position:0%
what it sounds like what you're saying
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
is if the budget is vetoed then we would
 
01:02:19.470 --> 01:02:19.480 align:start position:0%
have no
 
01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:20.990 align:start position:0%
have no
say

01:02:20.990 --> 01:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:02:24.990 --> 01:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
um but in either case we don't have
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
they aren't they still administering
 
01:02:29.109 --> 01:02:29.119 align:start position:0%
those funds I I I really wish you was
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
here to answer that question because it
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense to me as
 
01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:37.240 align:start position:0%
explained thank you representative McGee
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
I I share your confusion about this and
 
01:02:42.150 --> 01:02:42.160 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry that representative obber is
 
01:02:45.269 --> 01:02:45.279 align:start position:0%
not here I really uh expected that she
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
would be it's possible that the fiscal
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
committee has to
 
01:02:52.349 --> 01:02:52.359 align:start position:0%
approve uh expenditures from the
 
01:02:55.109 --> 01:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund
 
01:02:57.190 --> 01:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not certain about that I that's what
 
01:03:01.109 --> 01:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
I was hoping reprentative Ober could CL
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
clarify for us but until she gets here
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
we'll just have to I think they said
 
01:03:08.670 --> 01:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
that question they said recently that
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
that's going to go back in place next
 
01:03:13.549 --> 01:03:13.559 align:start position:0%
year right that language that we saw
 
01:03:16.670 --> 01:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
this year about either the house or the
 
01:03:18.990 --> 01:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee had to
 
01:03:21.269 --> 01:03:21.279 align:start position:0%
approve that language that we had in one
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
of our bills they were saying that even
 
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
if no matter what happened to that bill
 
01:03:29.390 --> 01:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
as of next year um that process will be
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
in place for approvals of monies I I do
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
remember that does anybody else can
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
anybody help me out here okay well we'll
 
01:03:39.789 --> 01:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
rate for representative Ober if
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
she shows up in the meantime
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
representative Cali pittz is recognized
 
01:03:46.670 --> 01:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:03:51.029 --> 01:03:51.039 align:start position:0%
comment I I seem to realize or recall
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
that one year we had and I'm sure
 
01:03:55.910 --> 01:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative V remembers this we had a
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
a quote unquote crisis and we needed to
 
01:04:02.990 --> 01:04:03.000 align:start position:0%
take money from a dedicated fund now and
 
01:04:05.630 --> 01:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
we had to have an emergency session of
 
01:04:08.430 --> 01:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
the legislature to bring to come in to
 
01:04:13.190 --> 01:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
authorize funds from for heating so a TR
 
01:04:15.109 --> 01:04:15.119 align:start position:0%
a transfer and it had to be the
 
01:04:18.269 --> 01:04:18.279 align:start position:0%
legislature so are we saying that the
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
RPS and the energy funds are not
 
01:04:20.880 --> 01:04:22.150 align:start position:0%
RPS and the energy funds are not
dedicated

01:04:22.150 --> 01:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:25.039 align:start position:0%
funds and when I looked at the report on
 
01:04:29.190 --> 01:04:29.200 align:start position:0%
28 uh from 218 it said there was a
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
report on non-aps funds and I believe it
 
01:04:35.670 --> 01:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
was over a million dollars so I'm I'm
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
not quite sure where this stands and
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
maybe the problem is that we don't
 
01:04:45.630 --> 01:04:45.640 align:start position:0%
consider these dedicated funds do you
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
recall that incident with the heating
 
01:04:51.549 --> 01:04:51.559 align:start position:0%
that we had to bring come in as an
 
01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:53.799 align:start position:0%
emergency measure with the legislature
 
01:04:55.589 --> 01:04:55.599 align:start position:0%
emergenc Merc session to authorize
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
expenditure of those dedicated funds for
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
rec excuse I can't I can't hear
 
01:05:15.190 --> 01:05:15.200 align:start position:0%
you your voice was garbled Mr
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
chair oh I'm sorry I turned off my
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
microphone by accident um what I said
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
was I think that may happened before I
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
became a member of the legislature I
 
01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
remember hearing talk about it but I
 
01:05:31.710 --> 01:05:31.720 align:start position:0%
wasn't I remember not being around when
 
01:05:33.390 --> 01:05:33.400 align:start position:0%
it actually
 
01:05:37.630 --> 01:05:37.640 align:start position:0%
happened so once again representative
 
01:05:39.670 --> 01:05:39.680 align:start position:0%
Ober could really help us if if we I
 
01:05:42.349 --> 01:05:42.359 align:start position:0%
believe this is all in a quest to
 
01:05:45.190 --> 01:05:45.200 align:start position:0%
protect our dedicated
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
funds and suspect you're right I suspect
 
01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:48.950 align:start position:0%
funds and suspect you're right I suspect
you're

01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:05:51.750 --> 01:05:51.760 align:start position:0%
right we have not been
 
01:05:55.630 --> 01:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
successful to date to protect those
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
funds okay let's uh let other folks have
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.990 --> 01:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
pel yeah thank you Mr chairman just uh
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
reiterating on what uh representative uh
 
01:06:14.589 --> 01:06:14.599 align:start position:0%
McGee already said these These
 
01:06:19.190 --> 01:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
are funds they've it they're
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
non-lps so
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
whether they get to be used or not they
 
01:06:29.549 --> 01:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
can't be used for anything else so it
 
01:06:31.309 --> 01:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
just seems to
 
01:06:34.069 --> 01:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
be there's more harm
 
01:06:39.710 --> 01:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
done by uh not making them continuously
 
01:06:44.230 --> 01:06:44.240 align:start position:0%
appropriated than the reverse which you
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
know I don't
 
01:06:51.670 --> 01:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
know what uh what the
 
01:06:54.390 --> 01:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
representative uh is is really trying to
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
prevent how big of an issue is it is
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
it it it's it may be an issue but I
 
01:07:04.470 --> 01:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
don't know if it's such an issue that we
 
01:07:06.789 --> 01:07:06.799 align:start position:0%
uh we gum up the
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
works all the other times which would be
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:19.269 --> 01:07:19.279 align:start position:0%
year okay yeah thank you representative
 
01:07:22.430 --> 01:07:22.440 align:start position:0%
ssuch is recomend for
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
comment thank you Mr chairman um if I
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
recall correctly uh Karen kampton from
 
01:07:33.430 --> 01:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
the Pu testified on this and the way she
 
01:07:36.990 --> 01:07:37.000 align:start position:0%
explained it was apparently
 
01:07:40.670 --> 01:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
um if by a certain time point in the
 
01:07:44.549 --> 01:07:44.559 align:start position:0%
year those funds are not expended even
 
01:07:48.269 --> 01:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
though projects have been already uh U
 
01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
begun under the assumption that monies
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
will be delivered later uh then that
 
01:07:58.349 --> 01:07:58.359 align:start position:0%
money actually ends up sitting in that
 
01:08:02.870 --> 01:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
fund um until the end of the year and uh
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
whatever isn't has not been
 
01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:09.200 align:start position:0%
spent uh stays there
 
01:08:12.069 --> 01:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
forever unless somebody does something
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
but it cannot be turned over into
 
01:08:18.390 --> 01:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
funding in the next next year's uh
 
01:08:21.910 --> 01:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
appropriation or or spending uh so in
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
other words a lot of businesses are out
 
01:08:26.550 --> 01:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
there that have made commitments and the
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
customers that have signed contracts to
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
do things uh unless the paper work isn't
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
processed promptly enough will end up
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
having to wait as much as six months uh
 
01:08:41.709 --> 01:08:41.719 align:start position:0%
for the next year's
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh and in the meantime
 
01:08:45.630 --> 01:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of dead Capital sitting in
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
that account that can't be spent on the
 
01:08:52.269 --> 01:08:52.279 align:start position:0%
purposes for which it was intended so it
 
01:08:54.470 --> 01:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
seems to me I think that we heard the
 
01:08:56.990 --> 01:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I think a lot of us were kind
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
of shaking our heads to say this doesn't
 
01:09:01.269 --> 01:09:01.279 align:start position:0%
make a lot of sense and I think Senator
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
Bradley underscored that that you know
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
this is money for that purpose so if
 
01:09:08.829 --> 01:09:08.839 align:start position:0%
there is some issue with the finance
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
committee it seems to me we should be
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
able to find an Avenue where we can make
 
01:09:15.829 --> 01:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
sure that those funds are spent for the
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
purpose they are dedicated and not to
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
hamper our businesses and our customer
 
01:09:24.070 --> 01:09:24.080 align:start position:0%
and and residents of the state who have
 
01:09:27.229 --> 01:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
engaged and signed contracts so this is
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
the purpose for that fund um it should
 
01:09:33.430 --> 01:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
be predictable for everybody involved
 
01:09:35.149 --> 01:09:35.159 align:start position:0%
and it helps our businesses and our
 
01:09:38.070 --> 01:09:38.080 align:start position:0%
residents so I think whatever the the
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
the uh obstacles involved here I think
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
we should be able to find a a a solution
 
01:09:48.149 --> 01:09:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
sides thank you representative uh next
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.750 --> 01:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't forget to
 
01:10:05.229 --> 01:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
unmute I just unmuted I hope um yes we
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
can hear you the um I think I'm agreeing
 
01:10:12.510 --> 01:10:12.520 align:start position:0%
with uh what representativ some s
 
01:10:14.950 --> 01:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
suggested I think we ought to be able to
 
01:10:18.189 --> 01:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
invent some way to make it uh this
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
problem um impossible make it beo proof
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
or uh somehow
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
um uh preserve the dedicated use of the
 
01:10:34.229 --> 01:10:34.239 align:start position:0%
fund to assigned for without um without
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislative interference in other words
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
we obviously the legislature as a whole
 
01:10:44.990 --> 01:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
could um change that for a specific case
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
but we should make it vetal proof and or
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
make it um
 
01:10:53.910 --> 01:10:53.920 align:start position:0%
reliable somehow and I don't not being a
 
01:10:56.510 --> 01:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
lawyer I have no idea how to do that
 
01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:01.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
possible for example you could have pass
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
a law s requiring the legislative
 
01:11:07.870 --> 01:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
approval in order to divert those funds
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.270 --> 01:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
right okay thank you uh representative
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%

01:11:31.390 --> 01:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
information that could help us with the
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised by
 
01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:34.430 align:start position:0%
questions that were raised by
representative

miss press star six to
 
01:12:17.790 --> 01:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:21.390 --> 01:12:21.400 align:start position:0%
phone there you go hi good morning this
 
01:12:24.189 --> 01:12:24.199 align:start position:0%
is Karen kampton can you hear me yes we
 
01:12:27.709 --> 01:12:27.719 align:start position:0%
can thank you oh good morning thank you
 
01:12:30.510 --> 01:12:30.520 align:start position:0%
so um chairwoman Martin will be joining
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
shortly as well but um I think maybe if
 
01:12:35.430 --> 01:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
I could take just a couple of minutes I
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
can explain uh the renewable energy fund
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
and what the non-line versus lapsing
 
01:12:42.990 --> 01:12:43.000 align:start position:0%
language means along with the
 
01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.310 align:start position:0%
language means along with the
continually

01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
continually
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
appropriated so uh would that be
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
acceptable chair
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
Rose um I don't know that there's much
 
01:12:56.430 --> 01:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
disagreement amongst committee members
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
about about the the use of the renewable
 
01:13:04.189 --> 01:13:04.199 align:start position:0%
energy fund or even whether it should be
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
non-aps and continually appropriated
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
continuously appropriated what we'd be
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
more interested in hearing is why the
 
01:13:15.990 --> 01:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
finance committee thought it was
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
necessary to change the language back in
 
01:13:20.669 --> 01:13:20.679 align:start position:0%
2017 do you have any
 
01:13:24.750 --> 01:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
recollection no okay no I I I do not I
 
01:13:26.510 --> 01:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
believe it was actually part of the
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
budget bill that HB 518 I believe was
 
01:13:32.669 --> 01:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
rolled into the overall budget Bill and
 
01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:34.760 align:start position:0%
that language was inserted but no I'm
 
01:13:36.830 --> 01:13:36.840 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't have the history as to why
 
01:13:39.510 --> 01:13:39.520 align:start position:0%
that was uh why that language was
 
01:13:42.070 --> 01:13:42.080 align:start position:0%
inserted um I know that chairwoman
 
01:13:45.790 --> 01:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
Martin did send a a letter along with
 
01:13:48.990 --> 01:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
myself to the committee uh last week so
 
01:13:50.629 --> 01:13:50.639 align:start position:0%
hopefully you have that it does give the
 
01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
history at least of the amendment that
 
01:13:55.310 --> 01:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
changed the language and it also
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
explains what happens at the end of the
 
01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:00.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year with any funds that remain
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
in the renewable energy fund that are
 
01:14:04.990 --> 01:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
unspent and it tried to give an example
 
01:14:07.270 --> 01:14:07.280 align:start position:0%
of the complications that that causes
 
01:14:10.790 --> 01:14:10.800 align:start position:0%
when we have rebates um and other
 
01:14:12.430 --> 01:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
incentives that need to get paid out
 
01:14:14.709 --> 01:14:14.719 align:start position:0%
from this fiscal year funding with
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
monies that become
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
unaccessible to the commission uh at the
 
01:14:22.550 --> 01:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
end of the fiscal year so that letter I
 
01:14:25.669 --> 01:14:25.679 align:start position:0%
believe was to representative Harrington
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
along with um chairman
 
01:14:31.709 --> 01:14:31.719 align:start position:0%
Bose was that letter not shared with the
 
01:14:31.719 --> 01:14:32.990 align:start position:0%
Bose was that letter not shared with the
entire

01:14:32.990 --> 01:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
entire
 
01:14:35.910 --> 01:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
committee I you know uh chairwoman
 
01:14:37.830 --> 01:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
Martin sent it but I believe she sent it
 
01:14:40.430 --> 01:14:40.440 align:start position:0%
to everybody on St I I think it would
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
just addressed to to you two yeah yes I
 
01:14:45.870 --> 01:14:45.880 align:start position:0%
I believe everybody in the committee had
 
01:14:48.510 --> 01:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
a copy of that letter thank you so
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
chairman V this was my my question I had
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
the floor and I suggested that meline
 
01:14:57.310 --> 01:14:57.320 align:start position:0%
minow could possibly help us and we went
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
to uh Miss Crampton could we possibly go
 
01:15:04.750 --> 01:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
to miss minnow for for some insight as
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
to why that decision was made yes I was
 
01:15:12.030 --> 01:15:12.040 align:start position:0%
just about to recognize Ms Mano oh thank
 
01:15:14.070 --> 01:15:14.080 align:start position:0%
you so much I have allowed her to speak
 
01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:17.120 align:start position:0%
and so I would ask her if she could
 
01:15:19.629 --> 01:15:19.639 align:start position:0%
answer the question do you remember Miss
 
01:15:22.030 --> 01:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
Mano why the finance committee thought
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
this was necessary to make this change
 
01:15:25.669 --> 01:15:25.679 align:start position:0%
back in 2017 do you have any
 
01:15:27.990 --> 01:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
recollection at all of that I can't
 
01:15:30.990 --> 01:15:31.000 align:start position:0%
provide direct Insight on that change
 
01:15:33.790 --> 01:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately but um I would like to
 
01:15:37.669 --> 01:15:37.679 align:start position:0%
speak to Dedicated funds and continuing
 
01:15:39.310 --> 01:15:39.320 align:start position:0%
resolutions or budget
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
vetos um I have looked at quite a few
 
01:15:44.229 --> 01:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
the RAS for quite a few other dedicated
 
01:15:47.229 --> 01:15:47.239 align:start position:0%
funds and none of them contain special
 
01:15:49.070 --> 01:15:49.080 align:start position:0%
Provisions or
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
restrictions on on them being um
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
continually appropriated in the case of
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
a budget veto or continuing resolution
 
01:15:59.830 --> 01:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
so I did want to provide that
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
information that um it does not seem to
 
01:16:05.310 --> 01:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
be something that is done to other
 
01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:07.629 align:start position:0%
be something that is done to other
dedicated

01:16:07.629 --> 01:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
funds very good that's very helpful we
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate you uh doing that research
 
01:16:14.350 --> 01:16:14.360 align:start position:0%
and digging up that
 
01:16:17.390 --> 01:16:17.400 align:start position:0%
information uh standby uh I'm going to
 
01:16:19.950 --> 01:16:19.960 align:start position:0%
let you um stay here to answer
 
01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:21.719 align:start position:0%
additional questions if you would and
 
01:16:24.750 --> 01:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
Karen kampton you to as well happy to do
 
01:16:27.229 --> 01:16:27.239 align:start position:0%
so right now I'm going to turn the floor
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
over to representative crean for a
 
01:16:30.830 --> 01:16:30.840 align:start position:0%
comment or a
 
01:16:33.390 --> 01:16:33.400 align:start position:0%
question thank you chairman um I just
 
01:16:35.669 --> 01:16:35.679 align:start position:0%
had a very brief question um just
 
01:16:37.950 --> 01:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
numbers wise does anyone have a sense of
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
how much money we're talking about um
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
rolling over or going into the the black
 
01:16:47.669 --> 01:16:47.679 align:start position:0%
hole void not getting used uh each year
 
01:16:49.870 --> 01:16:49.880 align:start position:0%
a million dollars miss kampton you want
 
01:16:51.629 --> 01:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
to handle that
 
01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:53.840 align:start position:0%
question certainly thank you chairman
 
01:16:56.830 --> 01:16:56.840 align:start position:0%
Bose um so right now and it's it's an
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
Ever Changing amount but right now there
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
is um approximately for this fiscal year
 
01:17:05.950 --> 01:17:05.960 align:start position:0%
spending so this fiscal year we were
 
01:17:07.950 --> 01:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
allocated through the statement of
 
01:17:10.629 --> 01:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
Appropriations approximately $5 million
 
01:17:13.390 --> 01:17:13.400 align:start position:0%
for our budget we have approximately
 
01:17:17.350 --> 01:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
right now $3 million that is unspent
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
when I say unspent what's important to
 
01:17:21.669 --> 01:17:21.679 align:start position:0%
note is that we do have rebate
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
applications in house for projects that
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
are to be built which we would hope to
 
01:17:27.790 --> 01:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
be able to fund with that money and
 
01:17:29.229 --> 01:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
that's where we would traditionally
 
01:17:31.510 --> 01:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
carry that that those funds over to the
 
01:17:34.189 --> 01:17:34.199 align:start position:0%
next M year to pay those and we also
 
01:17:37.110 --> 01:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
have two open rfps right now that we are
 
01:17:39.510 --> 01:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
developing contracts for that we hope to
 
01:17:41.110 --> 01:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
get through governor and Council by the
 
01:17:43.350 --> 01:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
end of the year which would encumber
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
those funds or a portion of those funds
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
so yeah but about about $3 million I
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
would guess is on hand right now as
 
01:17:55.790 --> 01:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
unspent thank you that kind of tip sorry
 
01:17:57.629 --> 01:17:57.639 align:start position:0%
can I follow
 
01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
up are you asking for a followup yes yes
 
01:18:03.149 --> 01:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead I'm just wonder is that you
 
01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
know typical from year to year
 
01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
um yes I would say it's very typical
 
01:18:10.510 --> 01:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's usually within the you know
 
01:18:13.229 --> 01:18:13.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere from1 to5 million range and I
 
01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:14.800 align:start position:0%
would say it very much depends on the
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
budget but it's typically two to three
 
01:18:19.350 --> 01:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
million and that again are those rebate
 
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
applications that we receive in in the
 
01:18:23.550 --> 01:18:23.560 align:start position:0%
spring where folks want to be able to
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
install renewable energy projects but
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
because of the building season those
 
01:18:28.830 --> 01:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
projects don't end up getting built
 
01:18:31.070 --> 01:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
until the end of the summer or or fall
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
time frame and that's when we would
 
01:18:35.709 --> 01:18:35.719 align:start position:0%
actually release the funds to those
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
applicants that makes a lot of sense
 
01:18:38.950 --> 01:18:38.960 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank
 
01:18:42.030 --> 01:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
you uh chair recognizes representative
 
01:18:46.629 --> 01:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:49.310 --> 01:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
comment I'm going to show my ignorance
 
01:18:52.350 --> 01:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
here I did not understand uh your
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
representation what representative obor
 
01:18:57.430 --> 01:18:57.440 align:start position:0%
said about the the budget and what
 
01:18:59.470 --> 01:18:59.480 align:start position:0%
happens is does does these funds go
 
01:19:01.629 --> 01:19:01.639 align:start position:0%
through the general fund and then get
 
01:19:04.229 --> 01:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
allocated so so that they're dedicated
 
01:19:06.709 --> 01:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
strictly for this purpose I'm not sure
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
what a budget has to do with anything
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
then uh so uh we may have to ask for
 
01:19:14.950 --> 01:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
some input from representative obber
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
outside of this hearing uh and relay it
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
um because I just don't understand and I
 
01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
wonder if there's some way to fix the
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
language here assuming A continuing
 
01:19:28.310 --> 01:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
budget or with if a budget isn't passes
 
01:19:30.310 --> 01:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
alternative action or something like
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
you okay thank you representative PL
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
next up would
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
be see who hasn't spoken yet uh
 
01:19:44.229 --> 01:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
representative partial you're recognized
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you very much chair
 
01:19:51.669 --> 01:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
uh Miss
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
Manel I I see it's part of our job to
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
enable your organization to spend the
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
money that we designate and this seems
 
01:20:01.470 --> 01:20:01.480 align:start position:0%
like a roadblock being put up just
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
because our fiscal calendars are not in
 
01:20:08.430 --> 01:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
alignment and that's is a matter of
 
01:20:10.030 --> 01:20:10.040 align:start position:0%
curiosity if that's an incorrect
 
01:20:12.870 --> 01:20:12.880 align:start position:0%
statement please correct
 
01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.950 align:start position:0%
statement please correct
me

01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:20:17.830 --> 01:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
hear um I think maybe I'm not sure if
 
01:20:19.430 --> 01:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're asking miss krampton our
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
organization does not have anything to
 
01:20:22.830 --> 01:20:22.840 align:start position:0%
do with handling the renewable energy f
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
f um that the public utilities
 
01:20:28.709 --> 01:20:28.719 align:start position:0%
commissions does I would agree that the
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
artificial construct of the FIS the
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year causing a major
 
01:20:37.790 --> 01:20:37.800 align:start position:0%
disruption in the funding cycle is a
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
barrier to spending out these funds in
 
01:20:44.030 --> 01:20:44.040 align:start position:0%
the way that the legislature directed
 
01:20:45.830 --> 01:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
the Pu to
 
01:20:49.990 --> 01:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
do in a way that would um you know it
 
01:20:52.270 --> 01:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
just creates an artificial barrier and
 
01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:56.440 align:start position:0%
Bureau ratic um hurdles to be able to
 
01:20:57.870 --> 01:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
fulfill the direction that the
 
01:21:01.229 --> 01:21:01.239 align:start position:0%
legislature gave in how to spend these
 
01:21:03.430 --> 01:21:03.440 align:start position:0%
funds and do it consistently in a way
 
01:21:05.709 --> 01:21:05.719 align:start position:0%
that's not disruptive well I guess this
 
01:21:08.390 --> 01:21:08.400 align:start position:0%
would would count to a follow question
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
oh please go
 
01:21:11.590 --> 01:21:11.600 align:start position:0%
ahead I was gonna say if I may this is
 
01:21:15.030 --> 01:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
Karen krampton and I agree with what uh
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
meline Mano stated and I would say the
 
01:21:19.550 --> 01:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
other thing that this does is it creates
 
01:21:21.750 --> 01:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
some inefficiencies because we now have
 
01:21:24.669 --> 01:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
to figure out how to handle these rebate
 
01:21:27.030 --> 01:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
applications that come in in one fiscal
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
year but will not get built until
 
01:21:31.510 --> 01:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
another fiscal year so there are
 
01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:33.679 align:start position:0%
inefficiencies involved as
 
01:21:36.350 --> 01:21:36.360 align:start position:0%
well thank you both you for your answers
 
01:21:39.110 --> 01:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
my kind of followup I may or maybe my
 
01:21:41.229 --> 01:21:41.239 align:start position:0%
question I was really driving at yes go
 
01:21:43.950 --> 01:21:43.960 align:start position:0%
ahead uh do we have the same problem uh
 
01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
existing on the federal level do you in
 
01:21:48.310 --> 01:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
fact receive any monies from the federal
 
01:21:51.270 --> 01:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
level and are they uh on a continuous or
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
elapsing basis
 
01:21:56.950 --> 01:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
um not for renewable energy projects
 
01:21:59.070 --> 01:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
there are some federal programs that are
 
01:22:00.709 --> 01:22:00.719 align:start position:0%
managed by the office of strategic
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
initiatives like the weatherization
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
assistance program and fuel assistance
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
programs and I have to admit I am not uh
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
totally sure if if there are um
 
01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:13.159 align:start position:0%
disruptions between one fiscal year to
 
01:22:15.390 --> 01:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
the next in those
 
01:22:18.510 --> 01:22:18.520 align:start position:0%
programs thank you m grampton and if I
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
may yes um thank you chairman um the
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund is 100% funded
 
01:22:28.950 --> 01:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
through alternative compliance payments
 
01:22:31.390 --> 01:22:31.400 align:start position:0%
so they are payments paid by electricity
 
01:22:33.629 --> 01:22:33.639 align:start position:0%
suppliers so there is no federal money
 
01:22:35.550 --> 01:22:35.560 align:start position:0%
at all involved in these
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
programs thank you I have so much to
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
learn and thank you chair for taking my
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
question you're very
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
welcome uh representative Cali pittz
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
you're up next yeah I think I just want
 
01:22:47.159 --> 01:22:48.510 align:start position:0%
you're up next yeah I think I just want
to

01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:53.239 align:start position:0%
um speak to 78 and condense it down to
 
01:22:56.430 --> 01:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
get out of the weeds this is simply a
 
01:23:00.510 --> 01:23:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill to avoid a money grab should
 
01:23:04.430 --> 01:23:04.440 align:start position:0%
something happen to the budget when when
 
01:23:06.070 --> 01:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
we don't have a budget then you have to
 
01:23:09.310 --> 01:23:09.320 align:start position:0%
go flying around looking for money this
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
if those funds are continuously
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
appropriated means that I believe that
 
01:23:16.629 --> 01:23:16.639 align:start position:0%
they can't stick their hand in the
 
01:23:16.639 --> 01:23:17.470 align:start position:0%
they can't stick their hand in the
cookie

01:23:17.470 --> 01:23:17.480 align:start position:0%
cookie
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
jar meaning us and pull that money out
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
and use it for something else as I said
 
01:23:24.910 --> 01:23:24.920 align:start position:0%
in the very beginning I think it's a
 
01:23:29.510 --> 01:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
move to protect this dedicated fund
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
which I believe is correct so I I find
 
01:23:35.550 --> 01:23:35.560 align:start position:0%
nothing wrong with this bill and I think
 
01:23:39.070 --> 01:23:39.080 align:start position:0%
that as a measure if it's a if it's a
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid or a little bit of safety
 
01:23:44.830 --> 01:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
thinking that we may not have a
 
01:23:47.709 --> 01:23:47.719 align:start position:0%
budget uh I think we should just go
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
ahead and move on with it that's all it
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
is it's to prevent a money grab it's
 
01:23:56.550 --> 01:23:56.560 align:start position:0%
nothing more it's nothing
 
01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
less representative Cali pittz those are
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
very insightful comments and um it well
 
01:24:05.149 --> 01:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
they they're to the point they're New
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
York comments let's stop beating about
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
the bush and say what it is it helps me
 
01:24:12.870 --> 01:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
understand now I believe why
 
01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:14.229 align:start position:0%
understand now I believe why
representative

01:24:14.229 --> 01:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:18.600 align:start position:0%
obber um Wanted the language that that
 
01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
currently exists to be in the bill so
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
that the legislature would have the
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
option if a budget got
 
01:24:28.750 --> 01:24:28.760 align:start position:0%
vetoed of finding another source of
 
01:24:31.510 --> 01:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
money to spend on something if it needed
 
01:24:34.830 --> 01:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
to if it needed to and and I think if I
 
01:24:37.870 --> 01:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
may chairman yes go ahead I think that
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
you know we have too long been
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
collecting money for one
 
01:24:46.109 --> 01:24:46.119 align:start position:0%
thing and then using it for another and
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
I think energy is very important right
 
01:24:51.709 --> 01:24:51.719 align:start position:0%
now and the money that people are paying
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
into this fund should not be quote
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
unquote robbed because we're in a fiscal
 
01:25:02.270 --> 01:25:02.280 align:start position:0%
crisis I do believe that the legislature
 
01:25:06.310 --> 01:25:06.320 align:start position:0%
can always come in as a legislature not
 
01:25:09.390 --> 01:25:09.400 align:start position:0%
as three people as a legislature and say
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
we need this money for this and this is
 
01:25:14.990 --> 01:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
an emergency measure we've done it
 
01:25:17.310 --> 01:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
before and I don't know what the
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
Situation's going to be this winter you
 
01:25:21.870 --> 01:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
know with the price of oil going up the
 
01:25:25.510 --> 01:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
way it is and and with people struggling
 
01:25:29.070 --> 01:25:29.080 align:start position:0%
what are we going to need but I believe
 
01:25:31.709 --> 01:25:31.719 align:start position:0%
that's the purview of the legislature as
 
01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
a whole not just it okay we got two
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
million3 million sitting over here let's
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
grab it that that's wrong to me so I
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
think this bill is well worth it at this
 
01:25:44.910 --> 01:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
time because I think we're in a
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
precarious time I don't know about
 
01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
anybody else but I I'm I'm believing
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to get a budget
 
01:25:51.960 --> 01:25:53.550 align:start position:0%
we're probably not going to get a budget
so

01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:25:57.830 --> 01:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay so if your theory is correct
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
then if the legislator needed
 
01:26:02.510 --> 01:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
legislature needed some additional money
 
01:26:04.550 --> 01:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
because a budget got
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
vetoed we have like a hundred million
 
01:26:10.390 --> 01:26:10.400 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund correct that we can get
 
01:26:13.470 --> 01:26:13.480 align:start position:0%
money from we have milon in this fund
 
01:26:15.790 --> 01:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
would be a drop in the bucket compared
 
01:26:18.870 --> 01:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
to that we have many sources where we
 
01:26:22.030 --> 01:26:22.040 align:start position:0%
can get money from but a source like
 
01:26:25.510 --> 01:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
this this is very lwh hanging fruit boom
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
you can pull it out and and I think you
 
01:26:30.030 --> 01:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
know it's there it's like tempting it's
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
like the candy sitting on the on the
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
table I'm G to go eat it I think it's
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
there and you can grab it um and we've
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
done it before and you know you figure
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
what what would $3 million do say to
 
01:26:45.870 --> 01:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
heating assistance would be a lot it
 
01:26:48.629 --> 01:26:48.639 align:start position:0%
would go a long way so I think we need
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
to uh protect this money knowing that
 
01:26:54.790 --> 01:26:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's always there if the entire
 
01:26:57.910 --> 01:26:57.920 align:start position:0%
legislature wants or has to do something
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
with it but I think we need to protect
 
01:27:01.510 --> 01:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
it for the purpose for which it was
 
01:27:05.470 --> 01:27:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:09.229 --> 01:27:09.239 align:start position:0%
me can anyone Envision a situation in
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
which the legislature would be so
 
01:27:13.510 --> 01:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
desperate for
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
money that it would have to come after
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
this $3 million can anybody Envision
 
01:27:21.709 --> 01:27:21.719 align:start position:0%
that yes they did it in 2013 we've done
 
01:27:23.030 --> 01:27:23.040 align:start position:0%
it before
 
01:27:25.870 --> 01:27:25.880 align:start position:0%
once it happened
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
once and we are in a series of unknowns
 
01:27:30.870 --> 01:27:30.880 align:start position:0%
right now we don't know what's going to
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
happen uh I if heating oil would go up
 
01:27:38.270 --> 01:27:38.280 align:start position:0%
to $4 a gallon what's going to happen
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
we're gonna start scrambling and and I
 
01:27:42.270 --> 01:27:42.280 align:start position:0%
think we have
 
01:27:42.280 --> 01:27:45.149 align:start position:0%
think we have
to

01:27:45.149 --> 01:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:48.149 --> 01:27:48.159 align:start position:0%
understand I don't know I in my mind I
 
01:27:50.790 --> 01:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
want to protect what this was meant for
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
and yes the the leg legislature has
 
01:27:55.390 --> 01:27:55.400 align:start position:0%
scrambled before and yes we've done it
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
before was it necessary when we did it
 
01:28:01.430 --> 01:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
yes it was but I think that's up to the
 
01:28:03.470 --> 01:28:03.480 align:start position:0%
legislature to decide not just for
 
01:28:05.109 --> 01:28:05.119 align:start position:0%
somebody to look over and say well well
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
there's a nice pot of money let's take
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
it because they're not using
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
it I think our fiscal picture is pretty
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
healthy right now representative pimel
 
01:28:17.669 --> 01:28:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.830 --> 01:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
comment oh I guess I'm off mute already
 
01:28:24.070 --> 01:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
um m I actually have a question for uh
 
01:28:28.030 --> 01:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Crampton and that concerns
 
01:28:31.870 --> 01:28:31.880 align:start position:0%
procedure I'm curious
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
when as being someone in the building
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
trade I I I
 
01:28:40.390 --> 01:28:40.400 align:start position:0%
remember these monies really were time
 
01:28:43.070 --> 01:28:43.080 align:start position:0%
sensitive as far as when projects would
 
01:28:45.070 --> 01:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
start and when they would have to end
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
and all that sort of thing and I'm just
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
curious if someone is uh approve for a
 
01:28:57.390 --> 01:28:57.400 align:start position:0%
produ project and they don't complete it
 
01:29:00.629 --> 01:29:00.639 align:start position:0%
by the end of the fiscal
 
01:29:00.639 --> 01:29:02.310 align:start position:0%
by the end of the fiscal
year

01:29:02.310 --> 01:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I my guess is that they would not be
 
01:29:11.030 --> 01:29:11.040 align:start position:0%
able to get what has been promised then
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
until the next fiscal year and the
 
01:29:15.669 --> 01:29:15.679 align:start position:0%
question is do they have to reapply for
 
01:29:18.229 --> 01:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
it the next fiscal year or is it
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
automatically going to come to them but
 
01:29:24.350 --> 01:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
they have to wait until the money is
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
allocated at a certain date whether it's
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
six months in the future or a year in
 
01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:30.590 align:start position:0%
six months in the future or a year in
the

01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
future Miss grampton
 
01:29:35.550 --> 01:29:35.560 align:start position:0%
yes thank you chairman go and thank you
 
01:29:38.189 --> 01:29:38.199 align:start position:0%
for the question um it's a little bit
 
01:29:39.629 --> 01:29:39.639 align:start position:0%
difficult to answer that question right
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
now I can tell you that what your
 
01:29:44.910 --> 01:29:44.920 align:start position:0%
stating is correct if somebody send a
 
01:29:47.510 --> 01:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
rebate application on this fiscal year
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
but their project was not built and we
 
01:29:52.030 --> 01:29:52.040 align:start position:0%
did not receive what we call a step two
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
payment application by June 30th um we
 
01:29:59.070 --> 01:29:59.080 align:start position:0%
would not be able to use this year's
 
01:30:01.830 --> 01:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal funding to pay that rebate so
 
01:30:03.790 --> 01:30:03.800 align:start position:0%
then yes the funds are in question and
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
it would be a commissioner level
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
decision as to whether or not um re
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
application would be required or whether
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
or not they would choose
 
01:30:13.480 --> 01:30:14.990 align:start position:0%
or not they would choose
to

01:30:14.990 --> 01:30:15.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:18.390 --> 01:30:18.400 align:start position:0%
um allow this fiscal Year's applications
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
to be paid with next next fiscal Year's
 
01:30:21.119 --> 01:30:22.350 align:start position:0%
to be paid with next next fiscal Year's
money

01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
um so that would be a decision that
 
01:30:25.550 --> 01:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
would need to be made the other thing
 
01:30:27.189 --> 01:30:27.199 align:start position:0%
that I will mention is we are still
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
working with the Department of Justice
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
to figure out ways of um handling this
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
situation so so that explanation could
 
01:30:38.070 --> 01:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
change but the way it is today because
 
01:30:42.030 --> 01:30:42.040 align:start position:0%
these funds are not continually
 
01:30:44.229 --> 01:30:44.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated the monies available this
 
01:30:46.390 --> 01:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year will not be available to pay
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
1st thank you thank you thank you
 
01:30:55.790 --> 01:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative parall you have your hand
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
up do you have another question no okay
 
01:31:04.510 --> 01:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone else have h a question
 
01:31:06.550 --> 01:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative ssuch you have a
 
01:31:09.629 --> 01:31:09.639 align:start position:0%
question uh thank thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:11.430 --> 01:31:11.440 align:start position:0%
and thank you Miss krampton
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
so ju just to clarify what you just said
 
01:31:18.149 --> 01:31:18.159 align:start position:0%
apparently in some cases something as
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
simple as a contract that's already been
 
01:31:23.470 --> 01:31:23.480 align:start position:0%
proposed and not quite completed
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
requires that it be kicked up to the
 
01:31:28.109 --> 01:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
commissioner level to make a decision is
 
01:31:28.119 --> 01:31:31.070 align:start position:0%
commissioner level to make a decision is
that

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
correct Miss
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
Granton yes thank you chairman um for
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
rebate level applications yes that would
 
01:31:41.470 --> 01:31:41.480 align:start position:0%
be correct and it would not be a one by
 
01:31:42.990 --> 01:31:43.000 align:start position:0%
one decision I think it would be an
 
01:31:45.189 --> 01:31:45.199 align:start position:0%
overall budget decision and they
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
actually um had to rule on this this
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
previous fiscal year where we did not
 
01:31:52.510 --> 01:31:52.520 align:start position:0%
have the continually appropriated funds
 
01:31:55.830 --> 01:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
they did Issue an order or a secretary a
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
letter directing staff to use this
 
01:32:01.109 --> 01:32:01.119 align:start position:0%
year's fiscal funding to pay last year's
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
rebat now there is a distinction because
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
you said contracts and and that's very
 
01:32:06.910 --> 01:32:06.920 align:start position:0%
important to know that all of our
 
01:32:10.750 --> 01:32:10.760 align:start position:0%
contracts still Rec require have always
 
01:32:13.229 --> 01:32:13.239 align:start position:0%
required governor and Council approval
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
so and any any contracts that are
 
01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:19.280 align:start position:0%
approved by governor and Council those
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
funds are encumbered and once some is
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
encumbered once funds are encumbered
 
01:32:26.790 --> 01:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
they are available for use in future
 
01:32:30.109 --> 01:32:30.119 align:start position:0%
fiscal years for that specific contract
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
so our larger projects are okay it's
 
01:32:34.830 --> 01:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
really the rebate programs that are
 
01:32:39.390 --> 01:32:39.400 align:start position:0%
caught in this um uh transitional
 
01:32:43.109 --> 01:32:43.119 align:start position:0%
conern thank you thank you very much
 
01:32:45.669 --> 01:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oxam you have a
 
01:32:48.030 --> 01:32:48.040 align:start position:0%
question or a comment yes thank you very
 
01:32:49.830 --> 01:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
much um
 
01:32:52.590 --> 01:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
it trying trying to to pull this
 
01:32:55.350 --> 01:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
together uh it it seems that the
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
situation that we have at the moment is
 
01:33:00.750 --> 01:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
the result of the finance committee not
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
understanding the peculiarities of the
 
01:33:05.709 --> 01:33:05.719 align:start position:0%
renewable energy fund there's no other
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
fund to my knowledge that in under the
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
state control of New Hampshire where you
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a small group of people who pay in
 
01:33:19.149 --> 01:33:19.159 align:start position:0%
um you know it it's it's these are DED
 
01:33:20.990 --> 01:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
they're they're dedicated from the
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
moment they leave the utilities and they
 
01:33:26.070 --> 01:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
go into that fund they are there for one
 
01:33:28.870 --> 01:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
purpose and one purpose only which was
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
established by the legislature they are
 
01:33:34.350 --> 01:33:34.360 align:start position:0%
to be used to finance renewable energy
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
projects so the notion that we need to
 
01:33:38.669 --> 01:33:38.679 align:start position:0%
be you know worrying about this
 
01:33:41.270 --> 01:33:41.280 align:start position:0%
happening or that happening um in the
 
01:33:44.189 --> 01:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
case of a budget that isn't approved it
 
01:33:46.350 --> 01:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
it it's it's just an extraordinary
 
01:33:48.510 --> 01:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
situation and I think that what we need
 
01:33:51.950 --> 01:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
to do is clarify this as Jackie cell pit
 
01:33:54.669 --> 01:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
suggested representative Cali pittz that
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
we take the option available to us and
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
promote this bill and go forward with it
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
because it solves really a a
 
01:34:07.109 --> 01:34:07.119 align:start position:0%
non-existing but the new language that
 
01:34:08.709 --> 01:34:08.719 align:start position:0%
was created by the finance committee
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
created a problem that problem is an
 
01:34:13.510 --> 01:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
obstacle what we need to do is go back
 
01:34:17.070 --> 01:34:17.080 align:start position:0%
to the way it was pass this bill so that
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
we don't have these problems in the
 
01:34:20.350 --> 01:34:20.360 align:start position:0%
future we're not going to solve the
 
01:34:22.430 --> 01:34:22.440 align:start position:0%
problem of raids on dedic ated funds the
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
legislature has always rated dedicated
 
01:34:27.070 --> 01:34:27.080 align:start position:0%
funds and and that's just that's a side
 
01:34:28.669 --> 01:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
issue we need to concentrate on what's
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:35.550 --> 01:34:35.560 align:start position:0%
us okay thank you representative oxenham
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
comment seeing none I would like to
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
thank Miss krampton from the Pu and M
 
01:34:53.350 --> 01:34:53.360 align:start position:0%
Mano for being available to answer our
 
01:34:56.430 --> 01:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
questions and um I think we all have a
 
01:34:58.030 --> 01:34:58.040 align:start position:0%
pretty good sense that this bill should
 
01:35:02.870 --> 01:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
go forward um so I think we can expect
 
01:35:06.270 --> 01:35:06.280 align:start position:0%
that that should happen at exec session
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
time so as I explained at the beginning
 
01:35:11.870 --> 01:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
of our session here earlier
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
today we're going to have exec session
 
01:35:16.109 --> 01:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
bill on May 24th that's a Monday so make
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
plans accordingly if you're not going to
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
be here to vote on the bill make
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
arrangements through your caucus to have
 
01:35:32.590 --> 01:35:32.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:35.070 --> 01:35:35.080 align:start position:0%
substitute appear in your
 
01:35:39.310 --> 01:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
place so that uh your voice can be
 
01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
heard and um we will also be executing
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
on that day Senate Bill
 
01:35:48.750 --> 01:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
91 now we're going to be having a work
 
01:35:51.550 --> 01:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
session on Senate Bill 91 starting at
 
01:35:55.229 --> 01:35:55.239 align:start position:0%
one o'clock this afternoon that piic
 
01:35:57.910 --> 01:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
bill as you'll recall has four sections
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
to it what we're going to do is we're
 
01:36:04.070 --> 01:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
going to go through section
 
01:36:08.030 --> 01:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
one and talk about some language changes
 
01:36:10.870 --> 01:36:10.880 align:start position:0%
that may need to be made in section one
 
01:36:12.390 --> 01:36:12.400 align:start position:0%
when we had the public hearing on that
 
01:36:14.990 --> 01:36:15.000 align:start position:0%
bill Senator Waters who was its primary
 
01:36:17.550 --> 01:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor indicated there were several
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
places in the bill where he thought some
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
language changes were appropriate
 
01:36:25.790 --> 01:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
so we will discuss that first in our
 
01:36:27.870 --> 01:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
work session starting at
 
01:36:30.990 --> 01:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
1:00 sections two and sections three of
 
01:36:34.430 --> 01:36:34.440 align:start position:0%
the bill will'll discuss if need be I
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
think uh they're pretty straightforward
 
01:36:39.550 --> 01:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
and may not require much
 
01:36:42.830 --> 01:36:42.840 align:start position:0%
discussion and then we'll close the uh
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
work session with a extend extensive
 
01:36:47.750 --> 01:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
discussion of section
 
01:36:51.350 --> 01:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
four I sent earlier this morning some
 
01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:54.199 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment text for section four
 
01:36:57.430 --> 01:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
that resolves three significant issues
 
01:37:00.470 --> 01:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
with that section of the bill so we'll
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
have a lengthy discussion of that
 
01:37:05.910 --> 01:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
Clifton Belo will be here to answer
 
01:37:08.990 --> 01:37:09.000 align:start position:0%
questions on that particular proposed
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
language much of which he authored
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
himself um
 
01:37:17.830 --> 01:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
so I I hope you'll all be here for that
 
01:37:22.950 --> 01:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on Senate Bill 91 at one
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
clock representative plet recognized for
 
01:37:28.790 --> 01:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
a question yes I I did think there was a
 
01:37:31.070 --> 01:37:31.080 align:start position:0%
section five still in the bill and there
 
01:37:32.790 --> 01:37:32.800 align:start position:0%
intent maybe to pull it but it hasn't
 
01:37:35.070 --> 01:37:35.080 align:start position:0%
been pulled right is that
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
correct yes thank you for that reminder
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
there is a section five in the bill and
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
we will be uh during the amendment
 
01:37:44.550 --> 01:37:44.560 align:start position:0%
process removing that section from the
 
01:37:48.430 --> 01:37:48.440 align:start position:0%
bill because House Bill 315 which we
 
01:37:51.709 --> 01:37:51.719 align:start position:0%
passed and has been sent to the Senate
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
uh is the complete solution to that
 
01:37:58.350 --> 01:37:58.360 align:start position:0%
problem so we don't need section five of
 
01:38:00.990 --> 01:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
sp91 all right so before we break for
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
lunch does anybody have anything to uh
 
01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
01:38:13.870 --> 01:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
McGee thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to ask if the folks from my
 
01:38:19.229 --> 01:38:19.239 align:start position:0%
caucus on the call could uh could look
 
01:38:23.030 --> 01:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
for a uh Zoom link from me so that we
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.550 --> 01:38:31.560 align:start position:0%

of the Department of energy um as I
 
01:38:43.950 --> 01:38:43.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned to you uh previously it I
 
01:38:45.750 --> 01:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be very helpful if we
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
could uh arrange for some kind of a
 
01:38:50.870 --> 01:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
briefing of this committee uh regarding
 
01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:53.480 align:start position:0%
the plans or the proposed plans for the
 
01:38:55.990 --> 01:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
Department of energy um this would be
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
the right committee to have something
 
01:38:57.679 --> 01:38:58.950 align:start position:0%
the right committee to have something

02:58:54.990 --> 02:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative V this is Gen 4 um I I'm
 
02:58:56.830 --> 02:58:56.840 align:start position:0%
sure you got my message earlier but I
 
02:58:58.990 --> 02:58:59.000 align:start position:0%
have uh Brad Greenland stepping in if
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
you guys have any problems he'll be on
 
02:59:03.349 --> 02:59:03.359 align:start position:0%
the line um while I go to my appointment

02:59:42.840 --> 03:00:03.950 align:start position:0%
 
those

03:00:03.950 --> 03:00:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:07.790 --> 03:00:07.800 align:start position:0%
okay I guess we'll get started now I'd
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
like to formally open the work session
 
03:00:12.750 --> 03:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill
 
03:00:12.760 --> 03:00:14.349 align:start position:0%
on Senate Bill
91

03:00:14.349 --> 03:00:14.359 align:start position:0%
91
 
03:00:16.710 --> 03:00:16.720 align:start position:0%
and I look forward to
 
03:00:19.830 --> 03:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
a productive if somewhat lengthy
 
03:00:23.150 --> 03:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
conversation about this legislation as
 
03:00:26.710 --> 03:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
you know it had five parts when it
 
03:00:29.790 --> 03:00:29.800 align:start position:0%
arrived here from the
 
03:00:32.710 --> 03:00:32.720 align:start position:0%
Senate part one is relative to the
 
03:00:32.720 --> 03:00:34.269 align:start position:0%
Senate part one is relative to the
installation

03:00:34.269 --> 03:00:34.279 align:start position:0%
installation
 
03:00:36.670 --> 03:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
interconnection and use of energy
 
03:00:42.710 --> 03:00:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:42.720 --> 03:00:44.309 align:start position:0%
 
utilities

03:00:44.309 --> 03:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
utilities
 
03:00:50.190 --> 03:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:53.710 --> 03:00:53.720 align:start position:0%
first we will discuss part two and three
 
03:00:55.309 --> 03:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
briefly if
 
03:00:58.269 --> 03:00:58.279 align:start position:0%
needed and then we will discuss part
 
03:01:00.389 --> 03:01:00.399 align:start position:0%
four at
 
03:01:03.510 --> 03:01:03.520 align:start position:0%
length part five we will not discuss
 
03:01:06.429 --> 03:01:06.439 align:start position:0%
because that part of the bill we plan to
 
03:01:10.229 --> 03:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
delete from this legislation and that
 
03:01:13.670 --> 03:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
action was approved by all of the spons
 
03:01:17.590 --> 03:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:23.150 --> 03:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:26.510 --> 03:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
one I hope you all have a copy of the
 
03:01:28.590 --> 03:01:28.600 align:start position:0%
legislation in front of
 
03:01:33.150 --> 03:01:33.160 align:start position:0%
you what I would like to do is go
 
03:01:35.469 --> 03:01:35.479 align:start position:0%
through the
 
03:01:38.950 --> 03:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
legislation and highlight some issues
 
03:01:42.389 --> 03:01:42.399 align:start position:0%
that I see with the wording of the
 
03:01:44.870 --> 03:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
legislation and then discuss with all of
 
03:01:48.380 --> 03:01:48.390 align:start position:0%
you potential corrections to said
 
03:01:48.390 --> 03:01:50.190 align:start position:0%
you potential corrections to said
[Music]

03:01:50.190 --> 03:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
wording so the
 
03:01:54.670 --> 03:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
first area that I see that could use
 
03:01:54.680 --> 03:01:55.630 align:start position:0%
first area that I see that could use
some

03:01:55.630 --> 03:01:55.640 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:02:00.030 --> 03:02:00.040 align:start position:0%
work is on page one of the
 
03:02:04.750 --> 03:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:07.349 --> 03:02:07.359 align:start position:0%
30 there's a sentence that reads such a
 
03:02:10.349 --> 03:02:10.359 align:start position:0%
program shall compensate participating
 
03:02:14.070 --> 03:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
behind the meter energy storage for a
 
03:02:14.080 --> 03:02:15.030 align:start position:0%
behind the meter energy storage for a
fair

03:02:15.030 --> 03:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
fair
 
03:02:18.910 --> 03:02:18.920 align:start position:0%
share as determined by the commission
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
well is it fair to use the word words of
 
03:02:27.269 --> 03:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
the of the legislation for us to give
 
03:02:29.150 --> 03:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
the commission such a
 
03:02:29.160 --> 03:02:30.670 align:start position:0%
the commission such a
vague

03:02:30.670 --> 03:02:30.680 align:start position:0%
vague
 
03:02:35.269 --> 03:02:35.279 align:start position:0%
uh definition as fair share what is a
 
03:02:35.279 --> 03:02:36.110 align:start position:0%
uh definition as fair share what is a
fair

03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
fair
 
03:02:39.229 --> 03:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
share um it seems to me that it would be
 
03:02:43.150 --> 03:02:43.160 align:start position:0%
much more useful to the commission if we
 
03:02:45.740 --> 03:02:45.750 align:start position:0%
gave them some kind
 
03:02:45.750 --> 03:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
gave them some kind
[Music]

03:02:47.990 --> 03:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:02:48.000 --> 03:02:50.950 align:start position:0%
[Music]
of

03:02:50.950 --> 03:02:50.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:02:53.550 --> 03:02:53.560 align:start position:0%
numeric indication of what a fair share
 
03:02:57.389 --> 03:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
might be or tighten up that language
 
03:03:00.150 --> 03:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
somehow fair share just doesn't seem to
 
03:03:01.510 --> 03:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
me to
 
03:03:04.269 --> 03:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
be an adequate definition for the
 
03:03:06.030 --> 03:03:06.040 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
03:03:08.750 --> 03:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
use I'm not even sure exactly what the
 
03:03:10.950 --> 03:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
original authors
 
03:03:13.990 --> 03:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
intended when they said fair share
 
03:03:16.349 --> 03:03:16.359 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to know uh who else on the
 
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee might have an opinion about a
 
03:03:22.349 --> 03:03:22.359 align:start position:0%
what fair share means and B what's a
 
03:03:24.150 --> 03:03:24.160 align:start position:0%
more precise way to define it for the
 
03:03:26.229 --> 03:03:26.239 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
03:03:28.429 --> 03:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative McGee what do you think
 
03:03:33.110 --> 03:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thanks I I actually um when I read
 
03:03:35.469 --> 03:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
the sentence and the sentence before it
 
03:03:38.309 --> 03:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that we're asking them
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
to determine what a reasonable
 
03:03:43.590 --> 03:03:43.600 align:start position:0%
compensation is fair share I think is is
 
03:03:48.309 --> 03:03:48.319 align:start position:0%
referring to you know how do we um Rumer
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
them or compensate them for the value
 
03:03:55.030 --> 03:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they're bringing to the system but
 
03:03:56.790 --> 03:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
I agree with you I mean I'm not sure it
 
03:03:58.469 --> 03:03:58.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be spelled out in numbers
 
03:04:00.710 --> 03:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
because it would be changing it would be
 
03:04:02.429 --> 03:04:02.439 align:start position:0%
transitory they would have to continue
 
03:04:05.070 --> 03:04:05.080 align:start position:0%
to update it I would imagine if we put
 
03:04:08.150 --> 03:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
numbers in there but in the prior
 
03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
sentence on
 
03:04:13.590 --> 03:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
29 uh the leadin says um value to the
 
03:04:15.190 --> 03:04:15.200 align:start position:0%
electricity system particularly in terms
 
03:04:16.670 --> 03:04:16.680 align:start position:0%
of peak reduction and avoided
 
03:04:19.110 --> 03:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution costs so
 
03:04:21.590 --> 03:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
it's asking the commission to make a
 
03:04:23.469 --> 03:04:23.479 align:start position:0%
calculation based on those things which
 
03:04:26.510 --> 03:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
are kind of moving targets so I don't I
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
don't know I don't know if I agree that
 
03:04:30.910 --> 03:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
we need to give them a nu numeric
 
03:04:34.030 --> 03:04:34.040 align:start position:0%
guidance but maybe we need to be more
 
03:04:36.870 --> 03:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
specific about
 
03:04:40.309 --> 03:04:40.319 align:start position:0%
um the language to your
 
03:04:43.830 --> 03:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
point um so I I think what it's saying
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
is a uh reasonable
 
03:04:48.720 --> 03:04:50.429 align:start position:0%
is a uh reasonable
compensation

03:04:50.429 --> 03:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
03:04:54.070 --> 03:04:54.080 align:start position:0%
um I speak I'm I'm unfortunately on a
 
03:04:54.080 --> 03:04:55.710 align:start position:0%
um I speak I'm I'm unfortunately on a
telephone

03:04:55.710 --> 03:04:55.720 align:start position:0%
telephone
 
03:04:59.309 --> 03:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
yep who's that represent Mr
 
03:05:01.950 --> 03:05:01.960 align:start position:0%
CH thank you very
 
03:05:05.790 --> 03:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
much okay yes representative
 
03:05:09.429 --> 03:05:09.439 align:start position:0%
oxam thank you uh this language was
 
03:05:13.710 --> 03:05:13.720 align:start position:0%
agreed to when um HB 715 went to the
 
03:05:17.309 --> 03:05:17.319 align:start position:0%
Senate last year and it was put in at
 
03:05:19.630 --> 03:05:19.640 align:start position:0%
the behest of the Republicans on the
 
03:05:22.830 --> 03:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
senate committee because they felt that
 
03:05:25.790 --> 03:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
they wanted to ensure as you have many
 
03:05:28.790 --> 03:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
times um adjured us to ensure that there
 
03:05:32.710 --> 03:05:32.720 align:start position:0%
was no possibility of a cost shift um
 
03:05:35.309 --> 03:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
the the republ Senate Republicans felt
 
03:05:38.349 --> 03:05:38.359 align:start position:0%
that this language um accomplish that it
 
03:05:42.510 --> 03:05:42.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be read in concert with the
 
03:05:45.790 --> 03:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
language at the top of Page Three which
 
03:05:50.510 --> 03:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
is e uh concerning uh bring your own
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
devices um and it's a little bit it's
 
03:05:56.030 --> 03:05:56.040 align:start position:0%
spelled out OS doesn't let us spell
 
03:05:57.630 --> 03:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
things out twice you have to spell it
 
03:06:00.590 --> 03:06:00.600 align:start position:0%
out once and then a different provision
 
03:06:03.469 --> 03:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
will refer back to another provision so
 
03:06:05.389 --> 03:06:05.399 align:start position:0%
this is the clarification because this
 
03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
is where behind the meter um bod is is
 
03:06:12.790 --> 03:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
discussed and so it says the commission
 
03:06:14.870 --> 03:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
may approve approve mechanisms to
 
03:06:17.590 --> 03:06:17.600 align:start position:0%
compensate projects for a fair share as
 
03:06:20.510 --> 03:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
determined by the commission so it's a
 
03:06:24.110 --> 03:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
fair share of their Peak reduction value
 
03:06:26.070 --> 03:06:26.080 align:start position:0%
as well as any transmission or
 
03:06:30.229 --> 03:06:30.239 align:start position:0%
distribution costs actually avoided and
 
03:06:33.429 --> 03:06:33.439 align:start position:0%
that actually avoided language means it
 
03:06:37.429 --> 03:06:37.439 align:start position:0%
has to be demonstrated that money was
 
03:06:39.510 --> 03:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
you know they they had a bid on this
 
03:06:41.389 --> 03:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
system it would have been five million
 
03:06:42.910 --> 03:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
they had a bid on the other system it
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
was 3 million that demonstrates a cost
 
03:06:49.990 --> 03:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
Savings of $2 million so that would be
 
03:06:53.790 --> 03:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:57.309 --> 03:06:57.319 align:start position:0%
working I hope that helps okay so how
 
03:07:01.110 --> 03:07:01.120 align:start position:0%
would it uh how would this modification
 
03:07:03.590 --> 03:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
to that sentence work such a program
 
03:07:06.429 --> 03:07:06.439 align:start position:0%
shall compensate participating behindth
 
03:07:08.389 --> 03:07:08.399 align:start position:0%
meter energy
 
03:07:11.910 --> 03:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
storage for the value it provides to the
 
03:07:21.349 --> 03:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:24.389 --> 03:07:24.399 align:start position:0%
commission any reaction to that
 
03:07:27.870 --> 03:07:27.880 align:start position:0%
language I'm doing my best um
 
03:07:29.750 --> 03:07:29.760 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I have backed a front
 
03:07:32.550 --> 03:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
print out here very difficult to compare
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
the two side by side um I know that when
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
I checked into this I was directed to
 
03:07:40.750 --> 03:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
look at the language at the top of Page
 
03:07:44.790 --> 03:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
Three and uh that that
 
03:07:48.349 --> 03:07:48.359 align:start position:0%
is that's the language that was pointed
 
03:07:51.830 --> 03:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
out again it was a compromise uh that
 
03:07:55.229 --> 03:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
was agreed to in the S this is not a
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
change that is being produced in this
 
03:08:03.429 --> 03:08:03.439 align:start position:0%
this is not new this is um
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:10.110 --> 03:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
legislation I can't so in section
 
03:08:12.429 --> 03:08:12.439 align:start position:0%
representative representative Bernardi
 
03:08:14.349 --> 03:08:14.359 align:start position:0%
is recognized for a comment thank you
 
03:08:17.269 --> 03:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
chairman I I like uh if you're going to
 
03:08:20.870 --> 03:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
say strike a fair share and substitute
 
03:08:25.229 --> 03:08:25.239 align:start position:0%
the value it actually provides I think
 
03:08:28.190 --> 03:08:28.200 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and I would also note
 
03:08:32.790 --> 03:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
that this fair share bad language also
 
03:08:36.910 --> 03:08:36.920 align:start position:0%
occurs on line 37 of the second
 
03:08:39.910 --> 03:08:39.920 align:start position:0%
page yes the Senate Republicans liked
 
03:08:43.070 --> 03:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
that language Republicans do not like
 
03:08:45.950 --> 03:08:45.960 align:start position:0%
like fair share it has never been a
 
03:08:45.960 --> 03:08:50.469 align:start position:0%
like fair share it has never been a
republican

03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:53.870 --> 03:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
position unfair not that we want unfair
 
03:08:56.830 --> 03:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
but no one ever wants to say what a fair
 
03:09:00.590 --> 03:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:02.750 --> 03:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
is that's correct we're not discussing
 
03:09:02.760 --> 03:09:05.990 align:start position:0%
is that's correct we're not discussing
tax

03:09:05.990 --> 03:09:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:08.309 --> 03:09:08.319 align:start position:0%
rates okay such a program shall
 
03:09:10.630 --> 03:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
compensate participating behind the
 
03:09:13.429 --> 03:09:13.439 align:start position:0%
meter energy storage
 
03:09:16.950 --> 03:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
for the value it actually provides to
 
03:09:19.469 --> 03:09:19.479 align:start position:0%
the electricity system as determined by
 
03:09:19.479 --> 03:09:21.150 align:start position:0%
the electricity system as determined by
the

03:09:21.150 --> 03:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:09:24.030 --> 03:09:24.040 align:start position:0%
commission that sound
 
03:09:28.190 --> 03:09:28.200 align:start position:0%
reason may I point out um in nine D and
 
03:09:31.550 --> 03:09:31.560 align:start position:0%
E there's language that says that costs
 
03:09:34.750 --> 03:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
actually avoided could we just replicate
 
03:09:38.110 --> 03:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
that at the top for consistency or does
 
03:09:40.269 --> 03:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
it need to be different could you point
 
03:09:43.469 --> 03:09:43.479 align:start position:0%
out the line numbers um for me I'm
 
03:09:45.870 --> 03:09:45.880 align:start position:0%
looking unfortunately at the the web
 
03:09:49.469 --> 03:09:49.479 align:start position:0%
version but it's in part one Roman
 
03:09:49.479 --> 03:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
version but it's in part one Roman
n

03:09:52.550 --> 03:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:57.229 --> 03:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:00.790 --> 03:10:00.800 align:start position:0%
PDF it it's it's also on top of Page
 
03:10:04.870 --> 03:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
Three line six actually avoided costs
 
03:10:07.150 --> 03:10:07.160 align:start position:0%
actually avoided I I agree I think
 
03:10:09.229 --> 03:10:09.239 align:start position:0%
that's better than
 
03:10:14.429 --> 03:10:14.439 align:start position:0%
fair share I mean it it says both but
 
03:10:17.790 --> 03:10:17.800 align:start position:0%
yes okay I think we've got that changed
 
03:10:17.800 --> 03:10:21.150 align:start position:0%
yes okay I think we've got that changed
down

03:10:21.150 --> 03:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:24.870 --> 03:10:24.880 align:start position:0%
then now on page
 
03:10:29.349 --> 03:10:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
23 when he testified on this bill
 
03:10:34.309 --> 03:10:34.319 align:start position:0%
representative Clifton
 
03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
Belo suggested that we add some
 
03:10:43.950 --> 03:10:43.960 align:start position:0%
language to line 23 that says that ISO
 
03:10:48.469 --> 03:10:48.479 align:start position:0%
England May operate pursuant to RSA and
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
then he cited an RSA does anybody have
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
in their notes the number of the actual
 
03:10:57.429 --> 03:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
RSA he
 
03:10:59.950 --> 03:10:59.960 align:start position:0%
cited could you repeat the page number
 
03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
that line 23 to which you're referring
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:17.110 align:start position:0%
 
2

03:11:17.110 --> 03:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:18.910 --> 03:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
if we don't have the answer to that
 
03:11:22.469 --> 03:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
question uh The Honorable Clifton voo
 
03:11:24.950 --> 03:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
will be with us in a little while we can
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:36.790 --> 03:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
time I I have a question Mr chairman I
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
think we moved kind of quickly over the
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
actual language um I think we might be
 
03:11:48.790 --> 03:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
um I think we might be changing the
 
03:11:50.870 --> 03:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
meaning of some of the language that was
 
03:11:53.510 --> 03:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
here by avoiding the words fair share as
 
03:11:56.030 --> 03:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
they were intended here because I think
 
03:11:58.110 --> 03:11:58.120 align:start position:0%
what fair share is supposed to
 
03:12:01.150 --> 03:12:01.160 align:start position:0%
encapsulate is the actual avoided Cost
 
03:12:04.710 --> 03:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
Plus other value including um Peak
 
03:12:06.389 --> 03:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
reduction because when you look at the
 
03:12:09.429 --> 03:12:09.439 align:start position:0%
list of stuff that's that's calculated
 
03:12:12.309 --> 03:12:12.319 align:start position:0%
here it seems as though the public
 
03:12:14.070 --> 03:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
utility commission is going to have to
 
03:12:15.990 --> 03:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
do a calculation to determine those
 
03:12:17.950 --> 03:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
costs and they will not all be actual
 
03:12:21.070 --> 03:12:21.080 align:start position:0%
avoided costs they will be avoided costs
 
03:12:21.080 --> 03:12:21.950 align:start position:0%
avoided costs they will be avoided costs
and

03:12:21.950 --> 03:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:12:25.150 --> 03:12:25.160 align:start position:0%
other uh reductions based on the fact
 
03:12:28.830 --> 03:12:28.840 align:start position:0%
that we're not incurring that load so
 
03:12:30.190 --> 03:12:30.200 align:start position:0%
there will be another way that they will
 
03:12:31.670 --> 03:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
have to calculate it and that's why I
 
03:12:34.070 --> 03:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
think they were using that language
 
03:12:37.309 --> 03:12:37.319 align:start position:0%
specifically because actual avoided
 
03:12:38.950 --> 03:12:38.960 align:start position:0%
costs is a
 
03:12:43.070 --> 03:12:43.080 align:start position:0%
subset of what they're calculating it's
 
03:12:44.590 --> 03:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
just I'm just throwing that out there I
 
03:12:47.190 --> 03:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
could be wrong but when I'm reading this
 
03:12:48.790 --> 03:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's a little more
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
complicated and that's why they were
 
03:12:54.510 --> 03:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
using a you know like a placeholder of
 
03:12:56.190 --> 03:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
saying that they have to figure out the
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
fair share that uh should be alloted for
 
03:12:59.120 --> 03:12:59.910 align:start position:0%
fair share that uh should be alloted for
that

03:12:59.910 --> 03:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:13:02.750 --> 03:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
value so I just want to make sure that
 
03:13:05.790 --> 03:13:05.800 align:start position:0%
makes undoing that makes a lot of sense
 
03:13:07.590 --> 03:13:07.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I just don't want to undo what it
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
is that they're intending and maybe we
 
03:13:11.590 --> 03:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
should figure that out before we sarily
 
03:13:13.030 --> 03:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
change it because it sounds sounds like
 
03:13:15.429 --> 03:13:15.439 align:start position:0%
they were trying to figure out a way to
 
03:13:17.630 --> 03:13:17.640 align:start position:0%
accommodate the
 
03:13:20.110 --> 03:13:20.120 align:start position:0%
reality and perhaps Senator Bradley
 
03:13:23.229 --> 03:13:23.239 align:start position:0%
could help us with that if
 
03:13:25.950 --> 03:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well The Language Fair
 
03:13:28.229 --> 03:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
Share just doesn't
 
03:13:32.550 --> 03:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
sound definitive enough to be useful by
 
03:13:34.550 --> 03:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
03:13:37.590 --> 03:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
so that language has got to go Mr
 
03:13:39.750 --> 03:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
chairman in the in the sentence above
 
03:13:43.030 --> 03:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
you've defined representative plat yes
 
03:13:45.790 --> 03:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yeah could we say uh
 
03:13:48.910 --> 03:13:48.920 align:start position:0%
something like for all costs actually
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
avoided I mean I that's to me it's
 
03:13:53.150 --> 03:13:53.160 align:start position:0%
comprehensive it doesn't have to be just
 
03:13:56.389 --> 03:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
T and whoever is
 
03:13:58.710 --> 03:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
avoided that's a reasonable suggestion
 
03:14:01.590 --> 03:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi yes thank you Mr
 
03:14:05.309 --> 03:14:05.319 align:start position:0%
chairman you you use the term value it
 
03:14:08.229 --> 03:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
actually provides and value to me is
 
03:14:11.269 --> 03:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
describing Peak reduction avoided costs
 
03:14:13.150 --> 03:14:13.160 align:start position:0%
avoided distribution cost you're looking
 
03:14:16.070 --> 03:14:16.080 align:start position:0%
at all of those things in the sentence
 
03:14:20.229 --> 03:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
above to determine a value so I think I
 
03:14:22.389 --> 03:14:22.399 align:start position:0%
think the language that you initially
 
03:14:25.750 --> 03:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
struck is makes
 
03:14:29.030 --> 03:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
sense okay thank you I I do think we
 
03:14:32.030 --> 03:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
need to follow this up um and pursue it
 
03:14:32.040 --> 03:14:34.910 align:start position:0%
need to follow this up um and pursue it
because

03:14:34.910 --> 03:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:37.590 --> 03:14:37.600 align:start position:0%
there well I've discussed I don't think
 
03:14:40.110 --> 03:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
we I've discussed all these changes with
 
03:14:42.229 --> 03:14:42.239 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters and he was in agreement
 
03:14:45.469 --> 03:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
with most of them so uh I will run these
 
03:14:48.510 --> 03:14:48.520 align:start position:0%
changes by him again before we um
 
03:14:53.229 --> 03:14:53.239 align:start position:0%
proceed to the amendment drafting stage
 
03:14:56.830 --> 03:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:59.750 --> 03:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
there the next issue that I would uh
 
03:15:02.830 --> 03:15:02.840 align:start position:0%
like to address is also on page
 
03:15:06.590 --> 03:15:06.600 align:start position:0%
two Mr chairman I've got my hand
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
raised did someone say something yes
 
03:15:13.670 --> 03:15:13.680 align:start position:0%
this is um Peter ssuch have my hand
 
03:15:16.469 --> 03:15:16.479 align:start position:0%
raised uh sorry representative ssuch I
 
03:15:20.910 --> 03:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
didn't see that go ahead thank you um I
 
03:15:23.670 --> 03:15:23.680 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to point out that it would
 
03:15:26.469 --> 03:15:26.479 align:start position:0%
be important to clarify this issue with
 
03:15:29.870 --> 03:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
the fair share because like represent
 
03:15:32.070 --> 03:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
oxam pointed out at the top of Page
 
03:15:35.269 --> 03:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
Three the paragraph e that says for
 
03:15:38.309 --> 03:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
behind the meter storage again they use
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
the term fair share and then go on to
 
03:15:46.110 --> 03:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
actually avoid it so great apparently
 
03:15:48.710 --> 03:15:48.720 align:start position:0%
this this term comes up often so it
 
03:15:50.590 --> 03:15:50.600 align:start position:0%
might have more meaning than we think so
 
03:15:54.630 --> 03:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:54.640 --> 03:15:57.510 align:start position:0%
 
this

03:15:57.510 --> 03:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:16:00.150 --> 03:16:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay representative crean did you have a
 
03:16:03.189 --> 03:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
a point to make here no okay all right
 
03:16:06.750 --> 03:16:06.760 align:start position:0%
so the next issue to resolve is on page
 
03:16:09.550 --> 03:16:09.560 align:start position:0%
two starting at line 30 and running
 
03:16:11.309 --> 03:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
through line
 
03:16:11.319 --> 03:16:13.229 align:start position:0%
through line
33

03:16:13.229 --> 03:16:13.239 align:start position:0%
33
 
03:16:15.150 --> 03:16:15.160 align:start position:0%
it says New Hampshire's consumer
 
03:16:18.150 --> 03:16:18.160 align:start position:0%
consumers of electricity have a right to
 
03:16:20.750 --> 03:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
install interconnect and use energy
 
03:16:23.469 --> 03:16:23.479 align:start position:0%
storage systems on their property
 
03:16:25.710 --> 03:16:25.720 align:start position:0%
subject to appropriate size and safety
 
03:16:27.710 --> 03:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
requirements established by the
 
03:16:29.950 --> 03:16:29.960 align:start position:0%
commission without the burden of
 
03:16:32.870 --> 03:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
unnecessary restrictions or regulations
 
03:16:35.550 --> 03:16:35.560 align:start position:0%
and without unduly
 
03:16:38.510 --> 03:16:38.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory rates or
 
03:16:41.830 --> 03:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
fees now this paragraph to me seems to
 
03:16:44.150 --> 03:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
take away way local control as someone
 
03:16:48.070 --> 03:16:48.080 align:start position:0%
who serves on a planning board in my
 
03:16:51.510 --> 03:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
community I don't think it would be uh
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
appropriate for someone to install an
 
03:16:56.870 --> 03:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
energy storage system on their
 
03:16:59.830 --> 03:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
property that violated local zoning
 
03:17:02.750 --> 03:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances for example but this
 
03:17:06.389 --> 03:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
paragraph would seem to indicate
 
03:17:09.389 --> 03:17:09.399 align:start position:0%
that a local planning board wouldn't be
 
03:17:12.750 --> 03:17:12.760 align:start position:0%
able to make a decision about
 
03:17:17.950 --> 03:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
such a sighting so I'm uh wondering if
 
03:17:20.670 --> 03:17:20.680 align:start position:0%
it might be necessary to delete this
 
03:17:23.590 --> 03:17:23.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph or this sentence Al
 
03:17:23.600 --> 03:17:26.150 align:start position:0%
paragraph or this sentence Al
together

03:17:26.150 --> 03:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
together
 
03:17:29.389 --> 03:17:29.399 align:start position:0%
um could you representative
 
03:17:32.990 --> 03:17:33.000 align:start position:0%
flat not only is your point about local
 
03:17:36.309 --> 03:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
zoning uh right on the money but also
 
03:17:38.389 --> 03:17:38.399 align:start position:0%
this take seems to take away from the
 
03:17:42.950 --> 03:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
local utility the uh any uh interconnect
 
03:17:44.590 --> 03:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
requirements they might have to make a
 
03:17:46.630 --> 03:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
safe system this language would say you
 
03:17:47.870 --> 03:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
can put up what anything you want if it
 
03:17:49.189 --> 03:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't interconnect with utility too
 
03:17:52.429 --> 03:17:52.439 align:start position:0%
bad so sad so again I think it worth is
 
03:17:52.439 --> 03:17:53.910 align:start position:0%
bad so sad so again I think it worth is
worth

03:17:53.910 --> 03:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
worth
 
03:17:56.670 --> 03:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
striking well it does say that it's
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
subject to appropriate size and safety
 
03:18:00.750 --> 03:18:00.760 align:start position:0%
requirements established by the
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
commission so one would assume that U
 
03:18:06.870 --> 03:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
that would have been done in conjunction
 
03:18:06.880 --> 03:18:08.150 align:start position:0%
that would have been done in conjunction
with

03:18:08.150 --> 03:18:08.160 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:18:12.830 --> 03:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
utilities but larger question here is
 
03:18:14.830 --> 03:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
does this
 
03:18:19.510 --> 03:18:19.520 align:start position:0%
paragraph abgate or remove local control
 
03:18:23.349 --> 03:18:23.359 align:start position:0%
from local communities can you say can
 
03:18:25.269 --> 03:18:25.279 align:start position:0%
anybody hear me I I'm trying to go
 
03:18:27.269 --> 03:18:27.279 align:start position:0%
between two screens and it's like
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
ridiculous we can hear I haven't called
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
on you so representative Bernardi has
 
03:18:35.910 --> 03:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
the floor yes uh thank I agree that this
 
03:18:39.269 --> 03:18:39.279 align:start position:0%
language as written agregates local
 
03:18:43.229 --> 03:18:43.239 align:start position:0%
zoning uh uh Authority and so we can
 
03:18:47.630 --> 03:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
either eliminate it or alternatively add
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
that uh that the uh installation must
 
03:18:56.710 --> 03:18:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:00.670 --> 03:19:00.680 align:start position:0%
requirements representative Jackie C
 
03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
pittz I can't see anybody well that I
 
03:19:06.309 --> 03:19:06.319 align:start position:0%
think that an ad would be just after
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
going through the commission and local
 
03:19:11.790 --> 03:19:11.800 align:start position:0%
uh permitting process whatever that may
 
03:19:11.800 --> 03:19:13.309 align:start position:0%
uh permitting process whatever that may
be

03:19:13.309 --> 03:19:13.319 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know there are several Le layers in
 
03:19:17.189 --> 03:19:17.199 align:start position:0%
many in many committies historic
 
03:19:20.630 --> 03:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
districts and so I think the add local
 
03:19:25.189 --> 03:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
permitting process would be
 
03:19:28.070 --> 03:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
simple so that the commission first is
 
03:19:31.309 --> 03:19:31.319 align:start position:0%
going to say it's so it it's it fits the
 
03:19:33.229 --> 03:19:33.239 align:start position:0%
needs and it's going to interconnect
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
properly Etc and then local permitting
 
03:19:39.150 --> 03:19:39.160 align:start position:0%
process so how about if we just added to
 
03:19:43.870 --> 03:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
the end of the sentence yeah uh
 
03:19:45.990 --> 03:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
without unduly discriminatory rates or
 
03:19:49.030 --> 03:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
fees comma and must conform to local
 
03:19:52.269 --> 03:19:52.279 align:start position:0%
zoning and per permitting requirements
 
03:19:55.349 --> 03:19:55.359 align:start position:0%
yeah and in accordance with local yeah
 
03:19:58.429 --> 03:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
that's just simple yeah and that way
 
03:20:01.630 --> 03:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
it's up to the local towns to add zoning
 
03:20:01.640 --> 03:20:04.030 align:start position:0%
it's up to the local towns to add zoning
ordinances

03:20:04.030 --> 03:20:04.040 align:start position:0%
ordinances
 
03:20:08.750 --> 03:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:13.550 --> 03:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
needs okay I like that
 
03:20:14.950 --> 03:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
I think that will satisfy the
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that local permitting and
 
03:20:19.269 --> 03:20:19.279 align:start position:0%
Zoning is
 
03:20:22.030 --> 03:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
um is being adhered
 
03:20:22.040 --> 03:20:26.070 align:start position:0%
um is being adhered
[Music]

03:20:26.070 --> 03:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.080 --> 03:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
 
to

03:20:28.229 --> 03:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:20:32.189 --> 03:20:32.199 align:start position:0%
okay so that takes care of that
 
03:20:34.750 --> 03:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
concern I do have my hand
 
03:20:39.550 --> 03:20:39.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
oxum you have the floor Rec repres
 
03:20:41.880 --> 03:20:44.750 align:start position:0%
oxum you have the floor Rec repres
representative

03:20:44.750 --> 03:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:48.269 --> 03:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
oxam yes can you hear me now yes thank
 
03:20:50.070 --> 03:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
you very much I just wanted to point out
 
03:20:52.670 --> 03:20:52.680 align:start position:0%
that this is in fact new language being
 
03:20:55.389 --> 03:20:55.399 align:start position:0%
this is part of the new bill this is
 
03:20:58.189 --> 03:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
Senator waters's language and if you
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
have in fact had success speaking with
 
03:21:02.870 --> 03:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
him about changes to his language then
 
03:21:06.030 --> 03:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
that should pass muster with
 
03:21:10.070 --> 03:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
him yes maybe when I explained that I
 
03:21:12.070 --> 03:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
would be running all these changes
 
03:21:12.080 --> 03:21:18.469 align:start position:0%
would be running all these changes
Senator

03:21:18.469 --> 03:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:20.990 --> 03:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
Waters that's that was my point new
 
03:21:24.630 --> 03:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
material okay thank you next question is
 
03:21:28.309 --> 03:21:28.319 align:start position:0%
on line S uh
 
03:21:31.269 --> 03:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
35 the last three words in that sentence
 
03:21:33.910 --> 03:21:33.920 align:start position:0%
affordable for customers does that need
 
03:21:35.269 --> 03:21:35.279 align:start position:0%
to be
 
03:21:35.279 --> 03:21:36.990 align:start position:0%
to be
defined

03:21:36.990 --> 03:21:37.000 align:start position:0%
defined
 
03:21:40.309 --> 03:21:40.319 align:start position:0%
yes so we're talking here
 
03:21:46.389 --> 03:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:49.670 --> 03:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
rules utility approval processes and any
 
03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
required interconnection reviews of
 
03:21:54.630 --> 03:21:54.640 align:start position:0%
energy storage systems shall be simple
 
03:22:02.110 --> 03:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:04.229 --> 03:22:04.239 align:start position:0%
customers what is the definition of
 
03:22:06.830 --> 03:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
affordable for
 
03:22:09.550 --> 03:22:09.560 align:start position:0%
customers is that something that the Pu
 
03:22:12.189 --> 03:22:12.199 align:start position:0%
can easily determine during a rules
 
03:22:12.199 --> 03:22:15.349 align:start position:0%
can easily determine during a rules
making

03:22:15.349 --> 03:22:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:19.510 --> 03:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
process not unreasonable or in line with
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:28.750 --> 03:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
processes I didn't quite understand what
 
03:22:30.590 --> 03:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
what you said
 
03:22:33.030 --> 03:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative is is there something
 
03:22:34.590 --> 03:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
that we could reference to like are
 
03:22:37.389 --> 03:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
there other approval processes that
 
03:22:39.750 --> 03:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
might we might be able to say in line
 
03:22:45.030 --> 03:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
how about if we just reasonable
 
03:22:51.510 --> 03:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:54.229 --> 03:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
affordable cost effective for
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
who customers for customers yeah but
 
03:23:02.469 --> 03:23:02.479 align:start position:0%
what is the consu when when the when the
 
03:23:05.750 --> 03:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
Pu makes a decision don't they make it
 
03:23:08.189 --> 03:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
in the best interests of instead of
 
03:23:10.550 --> 03:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
affordable or because affordable is very
 
03:23:13.189 --> 03:23:13.199 align:start position:0%
different depending on who you talk
 
03:23:14.670 --> 03:23:14.680 align:start position:0%
well what's affordable for me might not
 
03:23:17.269 --> 03:23:17.279 align:start position:0%
be affordable for you that's exactly
 
03:23:19.950 --> 03:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
right so don't they do the best
 
03:23:22.150 --> 03:23:22.160 align:start position:0%
interests of the customers when they
 
03:23:24.830 --> 03:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
consumer Advocate makes a decision
 
03:23:29.670 --> 03:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:32.590 --> 03:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
case well it's a it's a good question
 
03:23:35.309 --> 03:23:35.319 align:start position:0%
anybody have any thoughts about
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:43.469 --> 03:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
Marshall yes thank thank you uh chair I
 
03:23:45.309 --> 03:23:45.319 align:start position:0%
I'm reading that is that it's not going
 
03:23:47.790 --> 03:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
to be an extra hurdle for the customer
 
03:23:50.189 --> 03:23:50.199 align:start position:0%
to get through right affordable I mean
 
03:23:52.229 --> 03:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
we're putting a system in to begin with
 
03:23:53.429 --> 03:23:53.439 align:start position:0%
and they'll have to determine the cost
 
03:23:55.710 --> 03:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
of putting that system in I think what
 
03:23:57.590 --> 03:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to say is that or
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
this this section is simple
 
03:24:02.950 --> 03:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
streamlined and not Bure
 
03:24:05.510 --> 03:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
bureaucratically weighed down and
 
03:24:06.590 --> 03:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
because every system is going to be
 
03:24:08.189 --> 03:24:08.199 align:start position:0%
different as far as figuring how to
 
03:24:10.429 --> 03:24:10.439 align:start position:0%
interconnect it I would imagine I think
 
03:24:11.750 --> 03:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
what they're trying to do is avoid a
 
03:24:14.790 --> 03:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic hurdle on behalf of the
 
03:24:17.870 --> 03:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
customer and how to put that in language
 
03:24:19.590 --> 03:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
I'm relying on your experience but I
 
03:24:21.510 --> 03:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
don't think it's anything more than that
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
I would
 
03:24:22.880 --> 03:24:25.070 align:start position:0%
I would
say

03:24:25.070 --> 03:24:25.080 align:start position:0%
say
 
03:24:28.349 --> 03:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
agree well the section that this falls
 
03:24:28.359 --> 03:24:29.189 align:start position:0%
agree well the section that this falls
under

03:24:29.189 --> 03:24:29.199 align:start position:0%
under
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
is rules that the Public Utility
 
03:24:35.070 --> 03:24:35.080 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to make or
 
03:24:38.229 --> 03:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
adopt to clarify policy for the for
 
03:24:40.070 --> 03:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
installation and use of these energy
 
03:24:42.630 --> 03:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
storage systems
 
03:24:45.590 --> 03:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
and paragraph C is specifically talking
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
about the utility approval process right
 
03:24:52.030 --> 03:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
and interconnection reviews of energy
 
03:24:54.630 --> 03:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
storage systems
 
03:24:57.510 --> 03:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
so basically it it
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
says this par this this sentence says
 
03:25:03.870 --> 03:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
that the utility approval process must
 
03:25:06.910 --> 03:25:06.920 align:start position:0%
be simple streamlined and affordable for
 
03:25:06.920 --> 03:25:09.229 align:start position:0%
be simple streamlined and affordable for
customers

03:25:09.229 --> 03:25:09.239 align:start position:0%
customers
 
03:25:12.950 --> 03:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
but can the public ities commission
 
03:25:15.670 --> 03:25:15.680 align:start position:0%
dictate to the utility what's affordable
 
03:25:17.870 --> 03:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
and what's not that I guess that would
 
03:25:18.910 --> 03:25:18.920 align:start position:0%
be my
 
03:25:23.229 --> 03:25:23.239 align:start position:0%
question I think having this have
 
03:25:27.110 --> 03:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
a thank you uh Mr chairman yes so
 
03:25:30.110 --> 03:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
earlier this year we reviewed bills with
 
03:25:33.590 --> 03:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
had to head fees for the sighting
 
03:25:35.750 --> 03:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
Authority and remember we reduced the
 
03:25:39.389 --> 03:25:39.399 align:start position:0%
fee for for one particular kind of
 
03:25:41.510 --> 03:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
interaction with the sighting Authority
 
03:25:45.229 --> 03:25:45.239 align:start position:0%
when a when a uh uh a local citizen
 
03:25:49.349 --> 03:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
wanted to get an anybody of whether or
 
03:25:53.229 --> 03:25:53.239 align:start position:0%
not and the uh things were going in
 
03:25:55.349 --> 03:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
accordance with the license
 
03:25:58.349 --> 03:25:58.359 align:start position:0%
requirements um but the fees were all
 
03:26:02.309 --> 03:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
set in that particular legislation I I
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
think what this requires is you you
 
03:26:09.630 --> 03:26:09.640 align:start position:0%
define a fee for this kind of service it
 
03:26:13.309 --> 03:26:13.319 align:start position:0%
is X number of dollars this this this
 
03:26:21.440 --> 03:26:21.450 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:21.450 --> 03:26:22.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:26:25.309 --> 03:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
unacceptable um
 
03:26:27.790 --> 03:26:27.800 align:start position:0%
so how about if we substitute the
 
03:26:28.670 --> 03:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
language that
 
03:26:28.680 --> 03:26:30.830 align:start position:0%
language that
[Music]

03:26:30.830 --> 03:26:30.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:26:34.469 --> 03:26:34.479 align:start position:0%
said utility approval processes and any
 
03:26:36.110 --> 03:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
required interconnection reviews of
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:42.230 align:start position:0%
 
systems

03:26:42.230 --> 03:26:42.240 align:start position:0%

03:26:42.240 --> 03:26:43.469 align:start position:0%

03:26:43.479 --> 03:26:49.150 align:start position:0%
[Music]
shall

03:26:49.150 --> 03:26:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:49.160 --> 03:26:57.229 align:start position:0%
 
be

03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:59.150 --> 03:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
determined I'm thinking out loud here
 
03:27:03.670 --> 03:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
work Mr chairman would I would I i'
 
03:27:08.750 --> 03:27:08.760 align:start position:0%
would like to suggest that uh this this
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
word might be like
 
03:27:13.229 --> 03:27:13.239 align:start position:0%
pornography you you will know when it's
 
03:27:15.670 --> 03:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
not affordable I mean it's you
 
03:27:18.510 --> 03:27:18.520 align:start position:0%
know people can see when something is
 
03:27:21.710 --> 03:27:21.720 align:start position:0%
orous and trying to be an obstacle but
 
03:27:24.229 --> 03:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
it's very hard to determine exactly
 
03:27:27.110 --> 03:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
where that level is but uh I I think
 
03:27:29.150 --> 03:27:29.160 align:start position:0%
people will know if it's very
 
03:27:31.790 --> 03:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
obstructive financially that that's not
 
03:27:33.870 --> 03:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
affordable so I don't know if we can
 
03:27:36.910 --> 03:27:36.920 align:start position:0%
really Define it better than that King
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
chairman V could I say something uh
 
03:27:43.150 --> 03:27:43.160 align:start position:0%
representative FAL yes thank you
 
03:27:45.510 --> 03:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
chairman Vose I I think that uh
 
03:27:48.110 --> 03:27:48.120 align:start position:0%
representative C Pitts really hit it on
 
03:27:51.070 --> 03:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
nail what what they're looking for is is
 
03:27:53.950 --> 03:27:53.960 align:start position:0%
something that is Affordable I mean they
 
03:27:55.550 --> 03:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
specifically say
 
03:27:59.349 --> 03:27:59.359 align:start position:0%
customers and I think that saying in the
 
03:28:01.150 --> 03:28:01.160 align:start position:0%
best interests of
 
03:28:04.950 --> 03:28:04.960 align:start position:0%
customers it's not it really works well
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
I think it it uh it means that they have
 
03:28:10.269 --> 03:28:10.279 align:start position:0%
to look when they're doing it they have
 
03:28:13.790 --> 03:28:13.800 align:start position:0%
to look at the customer to to determine
 
03:28:17.990 --> 03:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's fair so just that
 
03:28:21.150 --> 03:28:21.160 align:start position:0%
language it's very simple and it just
 
03:28:25.790 --> 03:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
directs them that the uh customer is
 
03:28:28.349 --> 03:28:28.359 align:start position:0%
also part of the
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
equation may I speak Mr chair yes
 
03:28:34.189 --> 03:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
representative oxam go ahead thank you
 
03:28:36.710 --> 03:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
very much this section is what uh
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Waters called the energy storage
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights so so it's it's a little
 
03:28:44.830 --> 03:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
bit on I'm almost want to say the
 
03:28:47.269 --> 03:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
flowery side but what he's trying to get
 
03:28:50.309 --> 03:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
at here is what I think many people on
 
03:28:52.349 --> 03:28:52.359 align:start position:0%
his side of the aisle are concerned with
 
03:28:55.030 --> 03:28:55.040 align:start position:0%
that there should be policy direction
 
03:28:58.670 --> 03:28:58.680 align:start position:0%
for the Pu that we that that they should
 
03:29:01.910 --> 03:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
not be making it up as they go along but
 
03:29:04.150 --> 03:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature should go on record and
 
03:29:06.389 --> 03:29:06.399 align:start position:0%
saying this is how we want you to do
 
03:29:09.229 --> 03:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
this sort of thing not micromanage but
 
03:29:11.830 --> 03:29:11.840 align:start position:0%
give them some policy Direction
 
03:29:14.590 --> 03:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
um so cost effective
 
03:29:18.550 --> 03:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
affordable it it's it's it's generic but
 
03:29:21.670 --> 03:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
it does it points in the direction of
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:32.229 --> 03:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
be uh what how about how about cost
 
03:29:35.150 --> 03:29:35.160 align:start position:0%
effective for all
 
03:29:35.160 --> 03:29:39.269 align:start position:0%
effective for all
parties

03:29:39.269 --> 03:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:41.510 --> 03:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
well I guess would speak up up like
 
03:29:42.830 --> 03:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
everybody else has because I've had my
 
03:29:44.830 --> 03:29:44.840 align:start position:0%
hand up for a while can I can I say
 
03:29:49.229 --> 03:29:49.239 align:start position:0%
something yeah go ahead thanks um
 
03:29:52.910 --> 03:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
so um taking what everyone has said so
 
03:29:57.710 --> 03:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
far um this being listed under the
 
03:29:59.309 --> 03:29:59.319 align:start position:0%
guidelines that we're trying to give the
 
03:30:01.710 --> 03:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission for customer
 
03:30:04.469 --> 03:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
energy storage systems I think it makes
 
03:30:10.110 --> 03:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
sense as is written or um because it is
 
03:30:11.469 --> 03:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
guidance for the public Utilities
 
03:30:14.630 --> 03:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
Commission but um to the point that was
 
03:30:17.510 --> 03:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
made earlier about
 
03:30:20.269 --> 03:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
us lowering a fee for the site
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee which is a separate
 
03:30:24.389 --> 03:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
entity that would not apply here because
 
03:30:26.469 --> 03:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
this particular bullet applies to the
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
utilities and we don't we don't wasn't
 
03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
the point yeah yeah but but what I'm
 
03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
saying is we don't we can't put into
 
03:30:37.910 --> 03:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
statute what that affordability of what
 
03:30:39.870 --> 03:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
the utility is going to charge but the
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
does have the relationship where they
 
03:30:45.870 --> 03:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
actually would intercede if they thought
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
the utilities were making it too onerous
 
03:30:49.630 --> 03:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
to another point that was made earlier
 
03:30:53.110 --> 03:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
for customers to be able to do storage
 
03:30:54.670 --> 03:30:54.680 align:start position:0%
in their own homes in their you know
 
03:30:57.990 --> 03:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
have have their own physical facilities
 
03:31:01.590 --> 03:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
so I mean I I I don't feel strongly one
 
03:31:04.349 --> 03:31:04.359 align:start position:0%
way or another about the affordable for
 
03:31:06.550 --> 03:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
customers I think is probably sufficient
 
03:31:08.030 --> 03:31:08.040 align:start position:0%
guidance for the Public Utilities
 
03:31:11.110 --> 03:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
Commission because their role is to make
 
03:31:13.990 --> 03:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
sure that that they're serving the
 
03:31:15.429 --> 03:31:15.439 align:start position:0%
interests of the public which means the
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
rate payers so they're the Arbiter
 
03:31:21.030 --> 03:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
between what the how the utility is
 
03:31:24.269 --> 03:31:24.279 align:start position:0%
administering the statutes and the way
 
03:31:27.670 --> 03:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
the customers end up being charged for
 
03:31:32.389 --> 03:31:32.399 align:start position:0%
it so I I don't know that we wouldn't
 
03:31:35.110 --> 03:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
just be pie in the skying making things
 
03:31:38.269 --> 03:31:38.279 align:start position:0%
up in terms of they have a process for
 
03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
figuring out what's reasonable or
 
03:31:42.429 --> 03:31:42.439 align:start position:0%
affordable so I I don't know how much
 
03:31:44.429 --> 03:31:44.439 align:start position:0%
more specific the language can be
 
03:31:46.990 --> 03:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
because we don't have that process I
 
03:31:48.990 --> 03:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
don't think I'm I'm going to I can't say
 
03:31:50.950 --> 03:31:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm I apologize for that because I
 
03:31:53.070 --> 03:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
have to look at the bill I haven't got a
 
03:31:55.189 --> 03:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
printer working so I'm I'm in the blind
 
03:31:59.590 --> 03:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
here but the I don't think the Pu ever
 
03:31:59.600 --> 03:32:02.510 align:start position:0%
here but the I don't think the Pu ever
goes

03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:04.830 --> 03:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
on what's
 
03:32:07.790 --> 03:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
affordable I think the premise that they
 
03:32:09.870 --> 03:32:09.880 align:start position:0%
use and I hope it is is just and
 
03:32:12.550 --> 03:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable and in the best interest I
 
03:32:14.349 --> 03:32:14.359 align:start position:0%
don't think they can decide what's
 
03:32:16.189 --> 03:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
affordable because if you go down to the
 
03:32:18.750 --> 03:32:18.760 align:start position:0%
next paragraph it talks about how we can
 
03:32:20.349 --> 03:32:20.359 align:start position:0%
you know how we're going to reimburse
 
03:32:23.150 --> 03:32:23.160 align:start position:0%
people for doing this yeah um and I
 
03:32:23.160 --> 03:32:25.030 align:start position:0%
people for doing this yeah um and I
think

03:32:25.030 --> 03:32:25.040 align:start position:0%
think
 
03:32:27.830 --> 03:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
that that's where that's where the
 
03:32:30.990 --> 03:32:31.000 align:start position:0%
problem comes in because if I reimburse
 
03:32:33.550 --> 03:32:33.560 align:start position:0%
you at a higher a much higher rate for
 
03:32:33.560 --> 03:32:34.510 align:start position:0%
you at a higher a much higher rate for
this

03:32:34.510 --> 03:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:32:37.030 --> 03:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
storage which isn't for your own use in
 
03:32:39.030 --> 03:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
case there's a blackout it's it's a sell
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
back to the grid let's face it
 
03:32:44.389 --> 03:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
then it may not
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
be in the best interest of all the
 
03:32:50.070 --> 03:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
customers and it may not be just and
 
03:32:52.550 --> 03:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
when they say customers it's not just to
 
03:32:55.590 --> 03:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
my mind the guy who's putting it up and
 
03:32:58.870 --> 03:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
the guy who's buying it it's everybody
 
03:33:01.150 --> 03:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
right who's affected by it the entire
 
03:33:04.389 --> 03:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
state so I would hope they use adjust
 
03:33:06.229 --> 03:33:06.239 align:start position:0%
and reasonable and I think they do that
 
03:33:08.429 --> 03:33:08.439 align:start position:0%
when they do a rate case somebody puts
 
03:33:11.110 --> 03:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
in for a 20% raise they're going to wait
 
03:33:15.309 --> 03:33:15.319 align:start position:0%
a minute whoa um and then they have to
 
03:33:17.150 --> 03:33:17.160 align:start position:0%
you know figure that all out which is
 
03:33:21.429 --> 03:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
way beyond my paygrade but I think that
 
03:33:24.830 --> 03:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know affordable is such a term that
 
03:33:24.840 --> 03:33:25.910 align:start position:0%
you know affordable is such a term that
is

03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
not you know to me an orange isn't
 
03:33:30.429 --> 03:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
affordable at a buck a piece
 
03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay I I
 
03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
don't but to somebody else a case may be
 
03:33:38.389 --> 03:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
very affordable so I think that
 
03:33:42.150 --> 03:33:42.160 align:start position:0%
affordable term is really out of whack
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
there but it's modifying the utility
 
03:33:47.429 --> 03:33:47.439 align:start position:0%
approval process right so it's saying
 
03:33:49.469 --> 03:33:49.479 align:start position:0%
what the utilities are charging people
 
03:33:51.229 --> 03:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
in order to get them through the process
 
03:33:52.910 --> 03:33:52.920 align:start position:0%
of being able to have storage at their
 
03:33:56.590 --> 03:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
place is supposed to be
 
03:33:59.670 --> 03:33:59.680 align:start position:0%
simple simple streamlined and it should
 
03:34:03.030 --> 03:34:03.040 align:start position:0%
be just and reasonable yeah I I I can
 
03:34:04.349 --> 03:34:04.359 align:start position:0%
understand that I can and I can live
 
03:34:05.910 --> 03:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
with that I think that that that makes
 
03:34:09.030 --> 03:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
sense if if a if affordable is language
 
03:34:12.229 --> 03:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
that really doesn't mean what people are
 
03:34:14.710 --> 03:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
trying to say then we should change it
 
03:34:16.750 --> 03:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
so I I don't know if Justin reasonable
 
03:34:19.950 --> 03:34:19.960 align:start position:0%
is is a is a good compromise but I think
 
03:34:21.469 --> 03:34:21.479 align:start position:0%
that's what it should be because you're
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
going to take into the transmission and
 
03:34:24.590 --> 03:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
all you know they're going to have to
 
03:34:26.790 --> 03:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
hook up to there's all kinds of costs
 
03:34:28.389 --> 03:34:28.399 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
03:34:31.150 --> 03:34:31.160 align:start position:0%
that that's where they have to come back
 
03:34:32.469 --> 03:34:32.479 align:start position:0%
to the commission and say well this is
 
03:34:33.790 --> 03:34:33.800 align:start position:0%
what we're charging and the commission
 
03:34:35.750 --> 03:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
comes back and say that's not that's not
 
03:34:37.870 --> 03:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
just and reasonable according to you
 
03:34:40.910 --> 03:34:40.920 align:start position:0%
know oil here I I don't know yes
 
03:34:42.950 --> 03:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable for all parties too not just
 
03:34:45.830 --> 03:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
for the the purchasing parties but also
 
03:34:49.110 --> 03:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
for the utilities who have to do
 
03:34:51.189 --> 03:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
interconnection of these well and and
 
03:34:52.630 --> 03:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
that would be for all the customers
 
03:34:54.189 --> 03:34:54.199 align:start position:0%
because then they would be a customer
 
03:34:57.389 --> 03:34:57.399 align:start position:0%
right exactly so for all customers just
 
03:34:59.150 --> 03:34:59.160 align:start position:0%
and reasonable for all customers and I
 
03:35:03.229 --> 03:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.550 --> 03:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
thing language for that
 
03:35:10.110 --> 03:35:10.120 align:start position:0%
line so we we move down to line 37 once
 
03:35:14.830 --> 03:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
again we have the ambiguous term fair
 
03:35:19.710 --> 03:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
share so I think we should uh rewrite
 
03:35:24.830 --> 03:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
that to reflect the language of actual
 
03:35:24.840 --> 03:35:26.229 align:start position:0%
that to reflect the language of actual
avoided

03:35:26.229 --> 03:35:26.239 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:30.640 --> 03:35:33.389 align:start position:0%
 
commission

03:35:33.389 --> 03:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:35:35.510 --> 03:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
good yeah I think
 
03:35:38.670 --> 03:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
that's uh Mr chair we we disagreed on
 
03:35:40.750 --> 03:35:40.760 align:start position:0%
that when you brought it up previously
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
ly under representative McGee made the
 
03:35:46.309 --> 03:35:46.319 align:start position:0%
point that the that they're two
 
03:35:48.070 --> 03:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
different things the fair share and the
 
03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
actually avoided cost one is a subset of
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
the other again we're getting into the
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
issue of what what is the value of these
 
03:35:59.110 --> 03:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
systems having more energy storage in
 
03:36:02.229 --> 03:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is a value to everyone in
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we reduce costs and and it
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
flows to the system it's there are the
 
03:36:11.030 --> 03:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
things that are actually
 
03:36:13.590 --> 03:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
we that they that are determinable the
 
03:36:15.229 --> 03:36:15.239 align:start position:0%
way that I gave the previous example
 
03:36:16.389 --> 03:36:16.399 align:start position:0%
about the five million and the three
 
03:36:18.349 --> 03:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
million and the two million and there
 
03:36:20.910 --> 03:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
other things that are not so readily
 
03:36:24.030 --> 03:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
available but the commission recognizes
 
03:36:26.750 --> 03:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
that they provide a value to the system
 
03:36:29.429 --> 03:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
and they we want that to encourage them
 
03:36:32.670 --> 03:36:32.680 align:start position:0%
to do that because it's a benefit to
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in the system that we have more
 
03:36:39.510 --> 03:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
reliability more resiliency and are able
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
to to to go forward with
 
03:36:49.429 --> 03:36:49.439 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair okay so moving on to page
 
03:36:53.389 --> 03:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
three Mr chair I I would go back
 
03:36:55.590 --> 03:36:55.600 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi thank you Mr
 
03:36:58.830 --> 03:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
chair I think the agreement that we came
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
to was that the fair share should be the
 
03:37:05.950 --> 03:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
value it actually provides and value
 
03:37:09.870 --> 03:37:09.880 align:start position:0%
then encompasses all the things that
 
03:37:12.070 --> 03:37:12.080 align:start position:0%
represent roxham and everybody else is
 
03:37:12.080 --> 03:37:14.670 align:start position:0%
represent roxham and everybody else is
talking

03:37:14.670 --> 03:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:18.750 --> 03:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
about yes I agree with that I think I do
 
03:37:23.110 --> 03:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
too so the if you move to page three we
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
once again
 
03:37:28.110 --> 03:37:28.120 align:start position:0%
have uh that ambiguous language on line
 
03:37:33.309 --> 03:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
five fair share so we'll replace that
 
03:37:37.389 --> 03:37:37.399 align:start position:0%
with the agree to language of
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
value Mr chair I just get clarification
 
03:37:43.830 --> 03:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
crean uned myself um so can I just
 
03:37:48.750 --> 03:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
clarify we're keeping fair share but
 
03:37:51.830 --> 03:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
then modifying it to clarify or you're
 
03:37:55.110 --> 03:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
eliminating fair share entirely no the
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
the phrase a fair share will be replaced
 
03:38:00.590 --> 03:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
in every instance where it is found in
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation by language to
 
03:38:08.349 --> 03:38:08.359 align:start position:0%
indicate uh that what we mean is actual
 
03:38:11.469 --> 03:38:11.479 align:start position:0%
avoided costs
 
03:38:14.349 --> 03:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
oh no actually avoided cost is not the
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
ter value is greater value provided was
 
03:38:21.830 --> 03:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
the term
 
03:38:25.550 --> 03:38:25.560 align:start position:0%
right but is it fair to ask the Public
 
03:38:27.389 --> 03:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
Utilities Commission to try to come up
 
03:38:28.469 --> 03:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
with a
 
03:38:30.710 --> 03:38:30.720 align:start position:0%
value uh for something that's not
 
03:38:30.720 --> 03:38:32.990 align:start position:0%
value uh for something that's not
avoided

03:38:32.990 --> 03:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
avoided
 
03:38:35.830 --> 03:38:35.840 align:start position:0%
costs that's what they've been doing in
 
03:38:38.429 --> 03:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
their their studies on the value of
 
03:38:39.990 --> 03:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
solar and the value of distributed
 
03:38:40.000 --> 03:38:42.429 align:start position:0%
solar and the value of distributed
energy

03:38:42.429 --> 03:38:42.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but this par paragraph here talks
 
03:38:48.510 --> 03:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
specifically about Peak reduction
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
values and transmission or distribution
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
cost actually
 
03:38:55.250 --> 03:38:55.260 align:start position:0%
avoided that kind of
 
03:38:55.260 --> 03:38:56.550 align:start position:0%
avoided that kind of
[Music]

03:38:56.550 --> 03:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:39:00.030 --> 03:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
thing yes representative
 
03:39:02.510 --> 03:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
PL yeah I think we're talking some
 
03:39:05.030 --> 03:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
Antics because to me actual avoided cost
 
03:39:07.990 --> 03:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
would include any value coming from Peak
 
03:39:10.030 --> 03:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
reduction but you can't invent value
 
03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's it's you got to demonstrate that
 
03:39:14.229 --> 03:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
there value to the system not only in
 
03:39:15.990 --> 03:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
reduced transmission and distribution
 
03:39:21.630 --> 03:39:21.640 align:start position:0%
but also in in in provid to the
 
03:39:24.189 --> 03:39:24.199 align:start position:0%
system I I'm afraid that was very
 
03:39:26.030 --> 03:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
garbled at the end we couldn't
 
03:39:29.389 --> 03:39:29.399 align:start position:0%
understand what representative PL
 
03:39:32.150 --> 03:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
said maybe the microphone not quite so
 
03:39:33.950 --> 03:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
close to your
 
03:39:38.110 --> 03:39:38.120 align:start position:0%
mouth no you're too close for the ACT
 
03:39:40.189 --> 03:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
avoided cost I think it's it's a prop
 
03:39:42.070 --> 03:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
components can argue to the commission
 
03:39:44.030 --> 03:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
that that close vo reduction in
 
03:39:46.510 --> 03:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution but also
 
03:39:52.309 --> 03:39:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
storage you're too close to the mic it's
 
03:39:55.520 --> 03:39:56.990 align:start position:0%
storage you're too close to the mic it's
all

03:39:56.990 --> 03:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:40:01.510 --> 03:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:04.630 --> 03:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
said so basically representative pl's
 
03:40:08.630 --> 03:40:08.640 align:start position:0%
point was that actual avoided costs can
 
03:40:13.790 --> 03:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:18.870 --> 03:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:23.510 --> 03:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
values it's not just uh the actual
 
03:40:25.590 --> 03:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
transmission or distribution costs that
 
03:40:27.429 --> 03:40:27.439 align:start position:0%
are actually
 
03:40:29.550 --> 03:40:29.560 align:start position:0%
avoided but I think if you put the
 
03:40:32.070 --> 03:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
language in that it has to
 
03:40:32.080 --> 03:40:33.750 align:start position:0%
language in that it has to
be

03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:40:36.150 --> 03:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
exclusively avoided
 
03:40:38.990 --> 03:40:39.000 align:start position:0%
costs there may be other aspects of the
 
03:40:41.269 --> 03:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
value calculation that you cannot then
 
03:40:43.110 --> 03:40:43.120 align:start position:0%
include so I think the language is
 
03:40:46.389 --> 03:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
exclusionary and that makes it wrong the
 
03:40:48.710 --> 03:40:48.720 align:start position:0%
other way like in other words we had
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
language that was too vague but now
 
03:40:52.950 --> 03:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're having language that's that's
 
03:40:55.710 --> 03:40:55.720 align:start position:0%
insisting that if there are other
 
03:40:58.469 --> 03:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
aspects of value that do not come down
 
03:40:59.990 --> 03:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
to actual
 
03:41:02.750 --> 03:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
avoided they won't be calculated list
 
03:41:05.790 --> 03:41:05.800 align:start position:0%
we'd have to enumerate what those other
 
03:41:05.800 --> 03:41:06.670 align:start position:0%
we'd have to enumerate what those other
values

03:41:06.670 --> 03:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
values
 
03:41:06.680 --> 03:41:09.030 align:start position:0%
values
[Music]

03:41:09.030 --> 03:41:09.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:41:12.870 --> 03:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
were well perhaps we can work on that I
 
03:41:16.790 --> 03:41:16.800 align:start position:0%
thought if if I could I did I read
 
03:41:18.750 --> 03:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere that Capital costs or whatever
 
03:41:22.750 --> 03:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
could not be included in this value
 
03:41:25.429 --> 03:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
situation repeat that question when you
 
03:41:29.070 --> 03:41:29.080 align:start position:0%
are reimbursing somebody or figuring out
 
03:41:32.830 --> 03:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
the value that you could not include
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
Capital costs in other words if it cost
 
03:41:37.550 --> 03:41:37.560 align:start position:0%
me $40 to build this transmission thing
 
03:41:39.469 --> 03:41:39.479 align:start position:0%
I can't include that in what the value
 
03:41:41.990 --> 03:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
of it is did I read that or is that in
 
03:41:42.000 --> 03:41:44.469 align:start position:0%
of it is did I read that or is that in
another

03:41:44.469 --> 03:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:47.469 --> 03:41:47.479 align:start position:0%
bill the capital cost could not be
 
03:41:49.550 --> 03:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
included well this bill doesn't talk
 
03:41:53.269 --> 03:41:53.279 align:start position:0%
about Capital costs at all I know but it
 
03:41:55.269 --> 03:41:55.279 align:start position:0%
in the value when you talk about the
 
03:41:57.110 --> 03:41:57.120 align:start position:0%
value of
 
03:41:57.120 --> 03:41:58.750 align:start position:0%
value of
something

03:41:58.750 --> 03:41:58.760 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:42:02.349 --> 03:42:02.359 align:start position:0%
um the construction of of it on its own
 
03:42:04.469 --> 03:42:04.479 align:start position:0%
would have value wouldn't it the value
 
03:42:07.469 --> 03:42:07.479 align:start position:0%
that this bill talks about is mostly the
 
03:42:11.750 --> 03:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
value that it sees avoided transmission
 
03:42:15.750 --> 03:42:15.760 align:start position:0%
and distribution costs right and Eric
 
03:42:18.469 --> 03:42:18.479 align:start position:0%
Johnson of iso New England testified
 
03:42:20.030 --> 03:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
before this committee a couple of weeks
 
03:42:22.429 --> 03:42:22.439 align:start position:0%
ago few weeks ago don't remember exactly
 
03:42:25.750 --> 03:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
when it was that ISO in New England sees
 
03:42:28.990 --> 03:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
no avoided transmission costs no I don't
 
03:42:32.030 --> 03:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
see any either connect to the grid they
 
03:42:36.790 --> 03:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
don't have the uh equipment to see
 
03:42:38.550 --> 03:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission costs but he said
 
03:42:41.189 --> 03:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
they don't see any so
 
03:42:44.149 --> 03:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
uh calculating avoided transmission
 
03:42:44.159 --> 03:42:45.790 align:start position:0%
uh calculating avoided transmission
costs

03:42:45.790 --> 03:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
costs
 
03:42:50.030 --> 03:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
is a difficult process and we'll learn
 
03:42:52.550 --> 03:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
more about that in about a half an hour
 
03:42:54.630 --> 03:42:54.640 align:start position:0%
or whenever we get to it when we talk
 
03:42:56.990 --> 03:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
about section four of this bill because
 
03:42:59.670 --> 03:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
that it becomes an
 
03:43:03.429 --> 03:43:03.439 align:start position:0%
important almost crucial aspect of
 
03:43:06.670 --> 03:43:06.680 align:start position:0%
section four of Senate Bill
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
91 Mr chair it it really is awfully
 
03:43:13.670 --> 03:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
important that people get a chance to to
 
03:43:16.750 --> 03:43:16.760 align:start position:0%
get in
 
03:43:20.229 --> 03:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
where if if I may go forward I know
 
03:43:22.750 --> 03:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
others have their hands up as well yeah
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
continue on thank you very much um the
 
03:43:30.070 --> 03:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
issue of capital costs take an example
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
you could build a substation or you
 
03:43:36.149 --> 03:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
could install battery storage those
 
03:43:37.710 --> 03:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
either one of those are going to be
 
03:43:40.110 --> 03:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
Capital costs so you are certainly going
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
to be including Capital costs in this
 
03:43:47.149 --> 03:43:47.159 align:start position:0%
comparison but the issue two years ago I
 
03:43:48.670 --> 03:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
believe it was when we were first
 
03:43:51.030 --> 03:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking at energy storage we had a panel
 
03:43:53.349 --> 03:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
that came in we had three people who
 
03:43:55.990 --> 03:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
presented we had those charts about the
 
03:43:59.189 --> 03:43:59.199 align:start position:0%
value stack there are many many values
 
03:44:00.950 --> 03:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
they talked about energy storage as a
 
03:44:04.830 --> 03:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
Swiss army knife we don't if if we only
 
03:44:06.149 --> 03:44:06.159 align:start position:0%
include the
 
03:44:09.070 --> 03:44:09.080 align:start position:0%
minimal we are not going to get the
 
03:44:12.870 --> 03:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
maximum value energy storage provides
 
03:44:16.229 --> 03:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
enormous value and I I beg to differ
 
03:44:19.269 --> 03:44:19.279 align:start position:0%
about what Eric Johnson said I had I
 
03:44:21.149 --> 03:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
have in my notes that later in the
 
03:44:23.510 --> 03:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
meeting when we were discussing the
 
03:44:25.469 --> 03:44:25.479 align:start position:0%
difference between what Dees had told us
 
03:44:28.750 --> 03:44:28.760 align:start position:0%
and what what he was saying for ISO he
 
03:44:31.870 --> 03:44:31.880 align:start position:0%
agreed that there were opportunities for
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
such savings so um this is complicated
 
03:44:39.870 --> 03:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult to word Smith um via
 
03:44:43.469 --> 03:44:43.479 align:start position:0%
Zoom but I think we we at we
 
03:44:46.429 --> 03:44:46.439 align:start position:0%
cannot really this if if we change this
 
03:44:48.870 --> 03:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
language to avoid a gos cost we have
 
03:44:52.510 --> 03:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
gutted the bill this this is the
 
03:44:55.389 --> 03:44:55.399 align:start position:0%
probably the most significant section in
 
03:44:59.630 --> 03:44:59.640 align:start position:0%
the bill and the point of providing an
 
03:45:03.229 --> 03:45:03.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity for all the values provided
 
03:45:06.950 --> 03:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
to be counted is the only way in which
 
03:45:08.670 --> 03:45:08.680 align:start position:0%
you're going to
 
03:45:08.680 --> 03:45:11.070 align:start position:0%
you're going to
get

03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
incentivize and have produced and
 
03:45:17.790 --> 03:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
installed the the single most valuable
 
03:45:20.790 --> 03:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
technology we have that takes
 
03:45:23.590 --> 03:45:23.600 align:start position:0%
intermittent distributed resources and
 
03:45:24.910 --> 03:45:24.920 align:start position:0%
makes them
 
03:45:27.469 --> 03:45:27.479 align:start position:0%
available at times when they're not
 
03:45:30.990 --> 03:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
producing it this is so
 
03:45:33.229 --> 03:45:33.239 align:start position:0%
important that's why we have a pu
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
proceeding on this right
 
03:45:39.630 --> 03:45:39.640 align:start position:0%
now okay thank you representative repres
 
03:45:40.710 --> 03:45:40.720 align:start position:0%
representative crean did you have
 
03:45:42.229 --> 03:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
another comment you wanted to
 
03:45:44.630 --> 03:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
make no I'm sorry I keep forgetting to
 
03:45:47.790 --> 03:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
put my hand down representative uh McGee
 
03:45:51.229 --> 03:45:51.239 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman yeah um I just
 
03:45:52.590 --> 03:45:52.600 align:start position:0%
want I just had a comment on what you
 
03:45:55.389 --> 03:45:55.399 align:start position:0%
mentioned about the iso and it's it's a
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
little bit tangential but just so folks
 
03:45:59.990 --> 03:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
can be aware there's a settlement
 
03:46:03.229 --> 03:46:03.239 align:start position:0%
agreement that's just about completed um
 
03:46:04.990 --> 03:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
over at the Public Utilities Commission
 
03:46:07.790 --> 03:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
on the Statewide energy data platform
 
03:46:10.269 --> 03:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
and the whole point of having
 
03:46:13.030 --> 03:46:13.040 align:start position:0%
um a software tool that would allow us
 
03:46:16.990 --> 03:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
to uh see the distributed energy
 
03:46:19.830 --> 03:46:19.840 align:start position:0%
resources behind the meter we don't have
 
03:46:23.229 --> 03:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
that view at this point so we can't see
 
03:46:25.429 --> 03:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
those assets because they're not on the
 
03:46:28.550 --> 03:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
system in terms of iso's calculations
 
03:46:30.670 --> 03:46:30.680 align:start position:0%
and I think that's one of the reasons
 
03:46:33.229 --> 03:46:33.239 align:start position:0%
that our speaker from ISO made that
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
point because they don't they don't
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
count the value of those assets because
 
03:46:39.710 --> 03:46:39.720 align:start position:0%
they can't see them they can't count
 
03:46:42.269 --> 03:46:42.279 align:start position:0%
them we're going to be putting in a a
 
03:46:45.030 --> 03:46:45.040 align:start position:0%
tool that will allow us to see the
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
behind the meter resources and manage
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
them so the value again of what it will
 
03:46:53.790 --> 03:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
mean for us to have our own local uh
 
03:46:56.550 --> 03:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
sustainable generation sources is
 
03:46:58.309 --> 03:46:58.319 align:start position:0%
something that we will have more
 
03:47:01.630 --> 03:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
insights into and more ability to
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
calculate their value we don't have that
 
03:47:06.790 --> 03:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
data right now because we have no way to
 
03:47:09.110 --> 03:47:09.120 align:start position:0%
do it and and a lot of other states are
 
03:47:10.510 --> 03:47:10.520 align:start position:0%
in the same
 
03:47:12.710 --> 03:47:12.720 align:start position:0%
uh place so I think New Hampshire's done
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
a good job of kind of getting ahead of
 
03:47:18.229 --> 03:47:18.239 align:start position:0%
it um and so I just wanted to mention
 
03:47:22.429 --> 03:47:22.439 align:start position:0%
that because it is related um that we
 
03:47:24.910 --> 03:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
have a very limited ability right now to
 
03:47:26.550 --> 03:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
understand what kind of value these
 
03:47:29.630 --> 03:47:29.640 align:start position:0%
these generation assets play okay thank
 
03:47:34.110 --> 03:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
you handle on it okay we got the point
 
03:47:37.830 --> 03:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
okay all right so
 
03:47:41.349 --> 03:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
um the other area of the bill that I
 
03:47:43.590 --> 03:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
just think needs a little language tweak
 
03:47:45.269 --> 03:47:45.279 align:start position:0%
is on page
 
03:47:48.830 --> 03:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:51.990 --> 03:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
25 which says electric generation
 
03:47:54.990 --> 03:47:55.000 align:start position:0%
equipment in this chapter shall exclude
 
03:47:59.590 --> 03:47:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:03.950 --> 03:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
equipment that sentence is technically
 
03:48:08.630 --> 03:48:08.640 align:start position:0%
incorrect so I propose that we uh change
 
03:48:09.950 --> 03:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
the language to
 
03:48:15.710 --> 03:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:19.830 --> 03:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
chapter shall not include storage energy
 
03:48:24.309 --> 03:48:24.319 align:start position:0%
storage equipment for sales
 
03:48:28.670 --> 03:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
purposes otherwise we enshrine in law a
 
03:48:30.590 --> 03:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
definition that's actually
 
03:48:30.600 --> 03:48:34.110 align:start position:0%
definition that's actually
incorrect

03:48:34.110 --> 03:48:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.750 --> 03:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
so with the with the help of legislative
 
03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
Services I'm sure we can fix this line
 
03:48:42.469 --> 03:48:42.479 align:start position:0%
so that it doesn't actually State
 
03:48:43.730 --> 03:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
something that's
 
03:48:43.740 --> 03:48:45.070 align:start position:0%
something that's
[Music]

03:48:45.070 --> 03:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:48:48.670 --> 03:48:48.680 align:start position:0%
technical Mr chair this issue of the
 
03:48:50.990 --> 03:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
definition has come up again and again
 
03:48:53.469 --> 03:48:53.479 align:start position:0%
when dealing with energy storage and
 
03:48:56.229 --> 03:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
what they're saying is for this chapter
 
03:48:58.710 --> 03:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
for this purpose it shall be excluded
 
03:49:00.469 --> 03:49:00.479 align:start position:0%
they're not trying to change the
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
definition elsewhere but there's a
 
03:49:05.910 --> 03:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
reason for this and it has to do with
 
03:49:08.830 --> 03:49:08.840 align:start position:0%
how energy storage equipment is
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
restricted in other rsas that this is
 
03:49:15.469 --> 03:49:15.479 align:start position:0%
simply a clarification that in this
 
03:49:19.389 --> 03:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
particular chapter this term shall not
 
03:49:24.590 --> 03:49:24.600 align:start position:0%
include energy storage it again it it it
 
03:49:26.349 --> 03:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
it it's much more important than it
 
03:49:28.550 --> 03:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
appears to
 
03:49:31.309 --> 03:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
be okay well I'm sure we can find a way
 
03:49:36.309 --> 03:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
to State this that um States what what
 
03:49:38.149 --> 03:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
you're getting at and I understand
 
03:49:40.429 --> 03:49:40.439 align:start position:0%
that's what it's trying to get at that's
 
03:49:42.870 --> 03:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
why I said as generation for sales
 
03:49:48.070 --> 03:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
purposes but fores a definition that's
 
03:49:50.630 --> 03:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
incorrect yes but you're introducing for
 
03:49:54.429 --> 03:49:54.439 align:start position:0%
sales purposes and that that wording is
 
03:49:56.750 --> 03:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
is not here and it is not I don't
 
03:49:57.990 --> 03:49:58.000 align:start position:0%
believe is
 
03:50:00.870 --> 03:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
Germain and it and it could introduce
 
03:50:03.550 --> 03:50:03.560 align:start position:0%
problems with other statutes that's why
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
I suggested that OS will be able to help
 
03:50:10.229 --> 03:50:10.239 align:start position:0%
us come up with the the precise language
 
03:50:12.189 --> 03:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
we need here once they understand the
 
03:50:14.590 --> 03:50:14.600 align:start position:0%
concept well but they're not regul
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
Energy Regulatory lawyers and they may
 
03:50:20.189 --> 03:50:20.199 align:start position:0%
not understand the situation but I I
 
03:50:23.149 --> 03:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
think we do need they are at it further
 
03:50:24.630 --> 03:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
they are professional legislation
 
03:50:24.640 --> 03:50:26.110 align:start position:0%
they are professional legislation
drafters

03:50:26.110 --> 03:50:26.120 align:start position:0%
drafters
 
03:50:29.469 --> 03:50:29.479 align:start position:0%
so yes Jacks of all trade and very good
 
03:50:33.590 --> 03:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
at their jobs they are they are
 
03:50:36.389 --> 03:50:36.399 align:start position:0%
indeed can I can I ask a clarifying
 
03:50:39.229 --> 03:50:39.239 align:start position:0%
question on that definition there so
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
electric generation equipment quote in
 
03:50:45.389 --> 03:50:45.399 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall exclude are they
 
03:50:48.670 --> 03:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
trying to exclude them be storage assets
 
03:50:50.990 --> 03:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
because they're load reducing versus
 
03:50:53.349 --> 03:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
generating is that the is that
 
03:50:55.670 --> 03:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
the distinction they're trying to make
 
03:50:58.389 --> 03:50:58.399 align:start position:0%
here maybe adding the word exclude load
 
03:51:02.149 --> 03:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
reducing energy storage equipment no
 
03:51:05.510 --> 03:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
because mine minnow available to us at
 
03:51:08.110 --> 03:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
this point she might be able to answer
 
03:51:10.670 --> 03:51:10.680 align:start position:0%
that question correct
 
03:51:13.429 --> 03:51:13.439 align:start position:0%
you know a battery is an electrical
 
03:51:15.110 --> 03:51:15.120 align:start position:0%
generation a piece of electrical
 
03:51:17.510 --> 03:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
generation equipment a battery doesn't
 
03:51:20.510 --> 03:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
store electricity a battery is a
 
03:51:23.750 --> 03:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
chemical mechanical and chemical system
 
03:51:27.870 --> 03:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
that actually generates electricity no
 
03:51:27.880 --> 03:51:29.630 align:start position:0%
that actually generates electricity no
as

03:51:29.630 --> 03:51:29.640 align:start position:0%
as
 
03:51:34.030 --> 03:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
uh the chemical process inside the
 
03:51:37.950 --> 03:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
battery uh moves forward it transforms
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't create you have to charge
 
03:51:42.269 --> 03:51:42.279 align:start position:0%
a battery
 
03:51:44.510 --> 03:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
right all that does is reverse the
 
03:51:47.229 --> 03:51:47.239 align:start position:0%
chemical process so that the chemical
 
03:51:50.149 --> 03:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
process can happen again but it's
 
03:51:52.429 --> 03:51:52.439 align:start position:0%
essentially a chemical process chemical
 
03:51:56.149 --> 03:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
and and mechanical process but you get
 
03:51:58.510 --> 03:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
less out than you put in make sure that
 
03:52:00.469 --> 03:52:00.479 align:start position:0%
this language doesn't enshrine in
 
03:52:03.590 --> 03:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
statute something that's not technically
 
03:52:06.110 --> 03:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
correct uh Mr chairman I I would
 
03:52:08.469 --> 03:52:08.479 align:start position:0%
definitely uh underscore the fact that a
 
03:52:11.590 --> 03:52:11.600 align:start position:0%
battery is not an energy generator
 
03:52:14.070 --> 03:52:14.080 align:start position:0%
because the only time I would believe
 
03:52:16.070 --> 03:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
that as a physicist is if you can get
 
03:52:18.590 --> 03:52:18.600 align:start position:0%
more energy out of it then you put in
 
03:52:20.750 --> 03:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's right and it's generating if you
 
03:52:22.990 --> 03:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
get less energy than you put in or the
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
same it's just an energy storage device
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
not a
 
03:52:29.750 --> 03:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
generator but you're right about the
 
03:52:32.149 --> 03:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
chemic reaction part of it yeah you're
 
03:52:34.670 --> 03:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
converting energy into chemical energy
 
03:52:36.429 --> 03:52:36.439 align:start position:0%
and then you're getting energy back out
 
03:52:38.389 --> 03:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
of it but it never brings you more
 
03:52:41.309 --> 03:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
energy than you put
 
03:52:45.149 --> 03:52:45.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:47.590 --> 03:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
CL I'll try to get to the right distance
 
03:52:50.550 --> 03:52:50.560 align:start position:0%
so people actually understand me uh um
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
every generator on the face of the Earth
 
03:52:55.510 --> 03:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
has more energy going in that comes out
 
03:52:58.750 --> 03:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
so so what your your point to me is not
 
03:53:00.950 --> 03:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
on point but I thought that when I heard
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
the language about for load red purposes
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
solves the problem that chairman Vose is
 
03:53:10.070 --> 03:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
trying to fix that it's it's being it's
 
03:53:11.710 --> 03:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
not treated as a generator because it's
 
03:53:13.469 --> 03:53:13.479 align:start position:0%
being used as a load reducer so if you
 
03:53:15.309 --> 03:53:15.319 align:start position:0%
put Lo for load reducing purposes it
 
03:53:17.950 --> 03:53:17.960 align:start position:0%
might fix your concern Mr
 
03:53:17.960 --> 03:53:20.070 align:start position:0%
might fix your concern Mr
chairman

03:53:20.070 --> 03:53:20.080 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:53:22.990 --> 03:53:23.000 align:start position:0%
yeah okay thanks does anybody uh else
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
have any other issues with the language
 
03:53:33.389 --> 03:53:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.950 --> 03:53:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:37.960 --> 03:53:40.309 align:start position:0%
 
please

03:53:40.309 --> 03:53:40.319 align:start position:0%
please
 
03:53:42.510 --> 03:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
if not let's could you give us 30
 
03:53:42.520 --> 03:53:44.950 align:start position:0%
if not let's could you give us 30
seconds

03:53:44.950 --> 03:53:44.960 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
03:54:05.229 --> 03:54:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:10.189 --> 03:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
you we test we test Mak that St a
 
03:54:12.630 --> 03:54:12.640 align:start position:0%
separate class we pass
 
03:54:14.750 --> 03:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
that making that a separate class
 
03:54:18.590 --> 03:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:18.600 --> 03:54:20.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:54:20.910 --> 03:54:20.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:23.670 --> 03:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
storage I was confused where it going
 
03:54:26.510 --> 03:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
here I thought we did okay 30 seconds is
 
03:54:32.429 --> 03:54:32.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
oops I set the timer in case you didn't
 
03:54:35.800 --> 03:54:37.670 align:start position:0%
oops I set the timer in case you didn't
seconds

03:54:37.670 --> 03:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
03:54:41.550 --> 03:54:41.560 align:start position:0%
now now I can't turn it
 
03:54:45.189 --> 03:54:45.199 align:start position:0%
off okay so I guess we're all done with
 
03:54:49.469 --> 03:54:49.479 align:start position:0%
uh section one of Senate Bill 92 now
 
03:54:53.469 --> 03:54:53.479 align:start position:0%
let's move on to part two section two
 
03:54:55.670 --> 03:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
relative to hydroelectric generators
 
03:54:57.670 --> 03:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
that share equipment for purposes of
 
03:55:00.229 --> 03:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
interconnection to the electric
 
03:55:02.870 --> 03:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
grid I don't have any issues with this
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:10.469 align:start position:0%
 
else

03:55:10.469 --> 03:55:10.479 align:start position:0%
else
 
03:55:12.550 --> 03:55:12.560 align:start position:0%

possible for us to have another work
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
session next week where we could have
 
03:55:41.710 --> 03:55:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:43.670 --> 03:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not
 
03:55:46.110 --> 03:55:46.120 align:start position:0%
sure I'll have to check with the house
 
03:55:47.229 --> 03:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
clerk to
 
03:55:47.239 --> 03:55:50.349 align:start position:0%
clerk to
see

03:55:50.349 --> 03:55:50.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:53.469 --> 03:55:53.479 align:start position:0%
uh when we can schedule another section
 
03:55:55.229 --> 03:55:55.239 align:start position:0%
that's proper another session that's
 
03:55:55.239 --> 03:55:56.309 align:start position:0%
that's proper another session that's
properly

03:55:56.309 --> 03:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
properly
 
03:55:59.750 --> 03:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
noticed and it it might be in next
 
03:56:01.389 --> 03:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
Wednesday or Thursday before we could
 
03:56:03.950 --> 03:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
get a get a session scheduled and then
 
03:56:06.269 --> 03:56:06.279 align:start position:0%
I'll have to check with um the
 
03:56:08.790 --> 03:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
schedulers to see if there's any rooms
 
03:56:12.149 --> 03:56:12.159 align:start position:0%
ailable so I can check into that um
 
03:56:15.750 --> 03:56:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'll let you
 
03:56:19.550 --> 03:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
know okay and I guess there's nothing on
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
section two or part two part three Mr
 
03:56:25.710 --> 03:56:25.720 align:start position:0%
chairman uh representative just a
 
03:56:28.670 --> 03:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
question on on part two my notes say
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
that there this essentially applies to
 
03:56:34.389 --> 03:56:34.399 align:start position:0%
only three independent Hydra facilities
 
03:56:37.870 --> 03:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
is that true or do I have that wrong
 
03:56:42.790 --> 03:56:42.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
correct part three of the bill is about
 
03:56:48.590 --> 03:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
low moderate income Community solar
 
03:56:52.510 --> 03:56:52.520 align:start position:0%
projects it fixes a mistake that was
 
03:56:54.830 --> 03:56:54.840 align:start position:0%
introduced into
 
03:56:57.670 --> 03:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
legislation um
 
03:57:00.990 --> 03:57:01.000 align:start position:0%
previously and um I don't have any
 
03:57:03.070 --> 03:57:03.080 align:start position:0%
issues with this one there's anybody
 
03:57:04.870 --> 03:57:04.880 align:start position:0%
else part
 
03:57:07.590 --> 03:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
three part
 
03:57:07.600 --> 03:57:16.070 align:start position:0%
three part
three

03:57:16.070 --> 03:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:20.110 --> 03:57:20.120 align:start position:0%
okay so now we can move on and get to
 
03:57:25.269 --> 03:57:25.279 align:start position:0%
the meet of this work
 
03:57:28.750 --> 03:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
session which is to discuss part four
 
03:57:30.710 --> 03:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
and just a quick reminder to everybody
 
03:57:32.750 --> 03:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
we are going to be deleting the part
 
03:57:35.189 --> 03:57:35.199 align:start position:0%
five from Senate Bill
 
03:57:39.349 --> 03:57:39.359 align:start position:0%
91 so earlier today I sent out a
 
03:57:44.510 --> 03:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
um proposed change
 
03:57:48.910 --> 03:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
to part four of Senate Bill
 
03:57:52.229 --> 03:57:52.239 align:start position:0%
91 and this
 
03:57:56.510 --> 03:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
proposal came from a meeting of a group
 
03:57:59.309 --> 03:57:59.319 align:start position:0%
of two meetings actually of a group of
 
03:58:01.990 --> 03:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders were concerned about
 
03:58:02.000 --> 03:58:02.950 align:start position:0%
uh stakeholders were concerned about
this

03:58:02.950 --> 03:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:58:08.070 --> 03:58:08.080 align:start position:0%
issue uh the issue of limited electrical
 
03:58:08.080 --> 03:58:10.309 align:start position:0%
issue uh the issue of limited electrical
energy

03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
energy
 
03:58:10.319 --> 03:58:12.229 align:start position:0%
energy
producers

03:58:12.229 --> 03:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
producers
 
03:58:16.670 --> 03:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
and I worked with uh The Honorable
 
03:58:20.070 --> 03:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
Clifton Belo to come up with language he
 
03:58:22.309 --> 03:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
came up with most of it I'll confess
 
03:58:25.030 --> 03:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
because he's an excellent drafter of
 
03:58:27.670 --> 03:58:27.680 align:start position:0%
legislation and
 
03:58:31.750 --> 03:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
um this proposed legislation addresses
 
03:58:31.760 --> 03:58:33.910 align:start position:0%
um this proposed legislation addresses
three

03:58:33.910 --> 03:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:58:37.389 --> 03:58:37.399 align:start position:0%
issues one issue is what is the dividing
 
03:58:39.030 --> 03:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
line between
 
03:58:40.590 --> 03:58:40.600 align:start position:0%
the transmission
 
03:58:44.030 --> 03:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
system and the distribution
 
03:58:46.670 --> 03:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
system why is that important because the
 
03:58:50.870 --> 03:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
transmission system is governed by FK
 
03:58:53.990 --> 03:58:54.000 align:start position:0%
and ISO New England and the distribution
 
03:58:57.590 --> 03:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
system is governed by the state and the
 
03:59:02.309 --> 03:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:05.670 --> 03:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
Commission therefore comingling the two
 
03:59:06.990 --> 03:59:07.000 align:start position:0%
runs into
 
03:59:10.389 --> 03:59:10.399 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional questions
 
03:59:13.469 --> 03:59:13.479 align:start position:0%
and this legislation attempts to address
 
03:59:19.469 --> 03:59:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:22.149 --> 03:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
degree the second issue it tries to deal
 
03:59:25.550 --> 03:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
with is the issue of avoided
 
03:59:25.560 --> 03:59:27.389 align:start position:0%
with is the issue of avoided
transmission

03:59:27.389 --> 03:59:27.399 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
costs and whether or not they could be
 
03:59:34.429 --> 03:59:34.439 align:start position:0%
shifted to
 
03:59:34.439 --> 03:59:37.070 align:start position:0%
shifted to
non-limited

03:59:37.070 --> 03:59:37.080 align:start position:0%
non-limited
 
03:59:39.910 --> 03:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
electricity energy
 
03:59:42.910 --> 03:59:42.920 align:start position:0%
producing producers or
 
03:59:45.550 --> 03:59:45.560 align:start position:0%
customers and the solution that this
 
03:59:47.269 --> 03:59:47.279 align:start position:0%
legislation comes up with and we'll talk
 
03:59:50.269 --> 03:59:50.279 align:start position:0%
about the specific language in a minute
 
03:59:55.189 --> 03:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
is to restrict the transaction path of
 
03:59:57.790 --> 03:59:57.800 align:start position:0%
any of these
 
03:59:57.800 --> 04:00:00.030 align:start position:0%
any of these
sales

04:00:00.030 --> 04:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
sales
 
04:00:04.189 --> 04:00:04.199 align:start position:0%
to distribu distribution grid only on
 
04:00:07.070 --> 04:00:07.080 align:start position:0%
the same distribution
 
04:00:09.830 --> 04:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
grid there the transmission system is
 
04:00:16.349 --> 04:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:21.189 --> 04:00:21.199 align:start position:0%
of of jural questions never uh arises
 
04:00:24.910 --> 04:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
because there is no uh conflict between
 
04:00:24.920 --> 04:00:28.630 align:start position:0%
because there is no uh conflict between
the

04:00:28.630 --> 04:00:28.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:33.269 --> 04:00:33.279 align:start position:0%
two and then the third issue that the
 
04:00:35.149 --> 04:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
legislation addresses or the the
 
04:00:37.070 --> 04:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation addresses is the
 
04:00:39.110 --> 04:00:39.120 align:start position:0%
issue of
 
04:00:41.950 --> 04:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
making sure that customers are protected
 
04:00:46.389 --> 04:00:46.399 align:start position:0%
all around and U the legislation
 
04:00:48.790 --> 04:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
addresses that by requiring that the
 
04:00:50.950 --> 04:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
Public Utilities Commission initiate rul
 
04:00:56.110 --> 04:00:56.120 align:start position:0%
making to uh establish the producers the
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
the rules rather for um eliminate
 
04:01:04.070 --> 04:01:04.080 align:start position:0%
enabling limited producers to sell
 
04:01:05.670 --> 04:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
electricity at wholesale within
 
04:01:05.680 --> 04:01:07.229 align:start position:0%
electricity at wholesale within
interstate

04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
interstate
 
04:01:10.870 --> 04:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
commerce and uh so those are the
 
04:01:14.950 --> 04:01:14.960 align:start position:0%
three big questions that this bill tries
 
04:01:14.960 --> 04:01:16.469 align:start position:0%
three big questions that this bill tries
to

04:01:16.469 --> 04:01:16.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:01:20.590 --> 04:01:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:23.710 --> 04:01:23.720 align:start position:0%
uh what I would like to do
 
04:01:23.720 --> 04:01:29.389 align:start position:0%
uh what I would like to do
next

04:01:29.389 --> 04:01:29.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
is is ask the honorable Clifton Belo to
 
04:01:35.110 --> 04:01:35.120 align:start position:0%
walk us
 
04:01:38.830 --> 04:01:38.840 align:start position:0%
through uh the portions of the
 
04:01:41.110 --> 04:01:41.120 align:start position:0%
legislation the proposed legislation
 
04:01:43.429 --> 04:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
that he worked on and explained to us
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
just exactly how it accomplishes its
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
goals so Mr B Belo if you could take
 
04:01:53.389 --> 04:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
over and talk about this bill I'd
 
04:01:56.550 --> 04:01:56.560 align:start position:0%
gratefully appreciate it sure happy to
 
04:02:00.070 --> 04:02:00.080 align:start position:0%
do that uh thank you chairman Vose
 
04:02:03.469 --> 04:02:03.479 align:start position:0%
um um we you know we um I we pulled
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
together um the stakeholders that we
 
04:02:07.309 --> 04:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
could identify which included inviting
 
04:02:09.389 --> 04:02:09.399 align:start position:0%
all the utility clean energy New
 
04:02:12.670 --> 04:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Grand State Hydro uh and both
 
04:02:15.349 --> 04:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
represent V and mcke because mcke
 
04:02:17.189 --> 04:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
represent mcke had sponsored a similar
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
Bill uh as well as all the Senators who
 
04:02:22.510 --> 04:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
were sponsors of the legislation and and
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
that was the group that discussed this
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
and and and eversource does have some of
 
04:02:28.990 --> 04:02:29.000 align:start position:0%
the jurisdictional concerns and we've
 
04:02:31.469 --> 04:02:31.479 align:start position:0%
we've tried to address those to the you
 
04:02:34.429 --> 04:02:34.439 align:start position:0%
know and and kind of air on the side of
 
04:02:38.149 --> 04:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
um this language being um conservative
 
04:02:41.030 --> 04:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
taking a smaller step not uh pushing the
 
04:02:43.030 --> 04:02:43.040 align:start position:0%
bounds of that jurisdictional question
 
04:02:45.990 --> 04:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh too much so um just to walk through
 
04:02:48.070 --> 04:02:48.080 align:start position:0%
it I think you have the PDF I'll refer
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
to those um page and line numbers the
 
04:02:53.429 --> 04:02:53.439 align:start position:0%
first page this in effect this is
 
04:02:55.429 --> 04:02:55.439 align:start position:0%
obviously not a legislative Services
 
04:02:57.630 --> 04:02:57.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment but it it shows really the
 
04:03:01.070 --> 04:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
entire text to part four um as it might
 
04:03:02.830 --> 04:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
possibly be amended here in this
 
04:03:05.189 --> 04:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
proposal uh so the so the first section
 
04:03:08.309 --> 04:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
line 7 through 15 is you know the
 
04:03:10.990 --> 04:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
definition section of the whole chapter
 
04:03:15.309 --> 04:03:15.319 align:start position:0%
it is um it it is making trying to make
 
04:03:18.189 --> 04:03:18.199 align:start position:0%
clear that this um legislation or this
 
04:03:20.070 --> 04:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
uh opportunity as it exists in current
 
04:03:22.469 --> 04:03:22.479 align:start position:0%
law this is a sort of a repeal and
 
04:03:25.630 --> 04:03:25.640 align:start position:0%
replace of the current law um does allow
 
04:03:29.149 --> 04:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
limited producers um which more clearly
 
04:03:32.550 --> 04:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
in this definition are such a size uh
 
04:03:34.790 --> 04:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
that they don't have to register to par
 
04:03:36.790 --> 04:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
participate in the iso New England
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
regulated um uh wholesale electricity
 
04:03:44.110 --> 04:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
Market um and this only adds that
 
04:03:45.870 --> 04:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
clarification that they do not actually
 
04:03:48.229 --> 04:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
participate in either net metering which
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
which is sort of a different way of
 
04:03:52.269 --> 04:03:52.279 align:start position:0%
getting compensated or and are not um
 
04:03:55.269 --> 04:03:55.279 align:start position:0%
registered as a generator or asset or
 
04:03:57.950 --> 04:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
network resource within ISO New England
 
04:03:59.710 --> 04:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
and doesn't participate in F
 
04:04:01.349 --> 04:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional wholesale electricity
 
04:04:03.750 --> 04:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
markets with one exception and that
 
04:04:05.950 --> 04:04:05.960 align:start position:0%
that's one uh that's spelled on on like
 
04:04:07.670 --> 04:04:07.680 align:start position:0%
12 that's new compared to the bill as
 
04:04:09.550 --> 04:04:09.560 align:start position:0%
introduced although I addressed it in my
 
04:04:11.309 --> 04:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
my testimony in the original here on the
 
04:04:13.590 --> 04:04:13.600 align:start position:0%
bill and that says except as an
 
04:04:15.950 --> 04:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
alternative technology regulation
 
04:04:18.030 --> 04:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
resource uh which is actually the term
 
04:04:20.469 --> 04:04:20.479 align:start position:0%
used by ISO New England uh also
 
04:04:24.229 --> 04:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
abbreviation atrr to the extent atrrs
 
04:04:25.790 --> 04:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
are deemed by ISO New England to
 
04:04:27.309 --> 04:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
function as retailer Network load
 
04:04:29.429 --> 04:04:29.439 align:start position:0%
reducers for all other ISO New England
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
purposes so so what that says is ISO New
 
04:04:36.070 --> 04:04:36.080 align:start position:0%
England um has determined that
 
04:04:39.349 --> 04:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
atrrs can be a regulation resource this
 
04:04:42.269 --> 04:04:42.279 align:start position:0%
is primarily battery storage um but not
 
04:04:43.790 --> 04:04:43.800 align:start position:0%
otherwise participating their markets
 
04:04:45.229 --> 04:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
and they're still treated as a load
 
04:04:47.950 --> 04:04:47.960 align:start position:0%
reducer relative to the calculation of
 
04:04:50.950 --> 04:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
cost of of transmission cost allocation
 
04:04:52.790 --> 04:04:52.800 align:start position:0%
and that that was in a slide from an ISO
 
04:04:54.750 --> 04:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
New England presentation that was
 
04:04:56.990 --> 04:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
recently made that makes that
 
04:04:58.510 --> 04:04:58.520 align:start position:0%
distinction and it's in their
 
04:05:00.950 --> 04:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
regulations as well so so it would allow
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
battery uh that only functions as an
 
04:05:05.990 --> 04:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
atrr uh to still function as load
 
04:05:08.870 --> 04:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
reducer to the extent that how ISO New
 
04:05:11.389 --> 04:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
England treats them as well so that
 
04:05:13.670 --> 04:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's a minor point but I just wanted
 
04:05:15.070 --> 04:05:15.080 align:start position:0%
to F
 
04:05:18.389 --> 04:05:18.399 align:start position:0%
that if I guess I Mr chairman I I will
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
sort of pause at each section I'm
 
04:05:22.750 --> 04:05:22.760 align:start position:0%
addressing and see if there's questions
 
04:05:25.070 --> 04:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
does that sound good yes that sounds
 
04:05:28.229 --> 04:05:28.239 align:start position:0%
excellent any questions for um it looks
 
04:05:29.870 --> 04:05:29.880 align:start position:0%
like representative oxenham has a
 
04:05:31.389 --> 04:05:31.399 align:start position:0%
question about that first
 
04:05:34.030 --> 04:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
section thank you very much Mr chairman
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Belo uh could you just walk
 
04:05:40.030 --> 04:05:40.040 align:start position:0%
through that definition again I'm this
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:48.070 --> 04:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
atrr um yes well it's it's defined in a
 
04:05:50.389 --> 04:05:50.399 align:start position:0%
document called op14 operational
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
procedure 14 in which they elaborate all
 
04:05:55.189 --> 04:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
the different ways that any kind of
 
04:05:57.630 --> 04:05:57.640 align:start position:0%
resource might participate in the
 
04:06:00.149 --> 04:06:00.159 align:start position:0%
electricity uh generation ancillary
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
market and capacity markets um so
 
04:06:05.469 --> 04:06:05.479 align:start position:0%
there's a definition for generator uh
 
04:06:08.070 --> 04:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
there's a definition for atrr which
 
04:06:10.349 --> 04:06:10.359 align:start position:0%
which is which as near as I can tell is
 
04:06:11.870 --> 04:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much just batteries although it
 
04:06:14.950 --> 04:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
could be smart inverters um things that
 
04:06:17.349 --> 04:06:17.359 align:start position:0%
can provide um a regulation resource
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
like doing power factor
 
04:06:22.030 --> 04:06:22.040 align:start position:0%
correction or voltage support or
 
04:06:26.110 --> 04:06:26.120 align:start position:0%
frequency regulation uh those are um the
 
04:06:27.950 --> 04:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
type of Regulation resources that are
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
typically delivered by the bulk grid uh
 
04:06:32.830 --> 04:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
but all the market participants have
 
04:06:35.149 --> 04:06:35.159 align:start position:0%
determined that sort of smaller scale
 
04:06:38.149 --> 04:06:38.159 align:start position:0%
storage devices or smart inverters uh
 
04:06:40.349 --> 04:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
could provide some of these resources at
 
04:06:42.389 --> 04:06:42.399 align:start position:0%
the call of iso New England so they've
 
04:06:45.469 --> 04:06:45.479 align:start position:0%
created a special program where these
 
04:06:47.790 --> 04:06:47.800 align:start position:0%
things that aren't really like
 
04:06:49.950 --> 04:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
traditional generators um they're not
 
04:06:51.950 --> 04:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
participating in the generation markets
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
but they can provide some regulation
 
04:06:55.550 --> 04:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
resource where they can call upon them
 
04:06:57.950 --> 04:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
and compensate them and but still allow
 
04:07:00.269 --> 04:07:00.279 align:start position:0%
them to just operate like if they're
 
04:07:02.510 --> 04:07:02.520 align:start position:0%
part of net metering just allow them to
 
04:07:04.030 --> 04:07:04.040 align:start position:0%
operate in the distribution grade
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
because they're small enough scale that
 
04:07:07.469 --> 04:07:07.479 align:start position:0%
they don't otherwise have to participate
 
04:07:08.750 --> 04:07:08.760 align:start position:0%
in those markets and they they could
 
04:07:10.910 --> 04:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
just be selling locally which is what
 
04:07:13.320 --> 04:07:13.330 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to enable thank
 
04:07:13.330 --> 04:07:16.389 align:start position:0%
this bill is trying to enable thank
[Music]

04:07:16.389 --> 04:07:16.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:07:18.750 --> 04:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
you okay I'll move
 
04:07:21.990 --> 04:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
on I've got another question there oh
 
04:07:26.950 --> 04:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
sure uh yes Mr Belo um I I've I've heard
 
04:07:29.910 --> 04:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
it referenced before in this context
 
04:07:31.590 --> 04:07:31.600 align:start position:0%
that some of these services are referred
 
04:07:35.149 --> 04:07:35.159 align:start position:0%
to as ancillary Services is is that the
 
04:07:37.070 --> 04:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
equivalent of what the alternative
 
04:07:39.790 --> 04:07:39.800 align:start position:0%
technology regulation resources because
 
04:07:43.269 --> 04:07:43.279 align:start position:0%
an Services could be um services that
 
04:07:45.309 --> 04:07:45.319 align:start position:0%
provide some type of synchronization or
 
04:07:50.269 --> 04:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
stabilization of the grid right um I I
 
04:07:52.149 --> 04:07:52.159 align:start position:0%
can't answer that definitively because
 
04:07:54.710 --> 04:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not quite as familiar perhaps as I I
 
04:07:57.670 --> 04:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
would like to be about this atrr program
 
04:08:01.389 --> 04:08:01.399 align:start position:0%
but but but it it's a does get called
 
04:08:03.309 --> 04:08:03.319 align:start position:0%
upon to provide some regulation service
 
04:08:05.670 --> 04:08:05.680 align:start position:0%
and that synchronization is part of what
 
04:08:08.229 --> 04:08:08.239 align:start position:0%
what goes on in regulation service and
 
04:08:11.670 --> 04:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
that there are actually markets for that
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
they're really tiny tiny part of the
 
04:08:15.389 --> 04:08:15.399 align:start position:0%
electricity rates but that they're part
 
04:08:17.550 --> 04:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
of the electricity Supply rate and part
 
04:08:19.590 --> 04:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
of that is a voltage support power
 
04:08:22.109 --> 04:08:22.119 align:start position:0%
factor correction frequency regulation
 
04:08:24.030 --> 04:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
um sometimes it's just like very quick
 
04:08:25.830 --> 04:08:25.840 align:start position:0%
response so like if a big generation
 
04:08:28.950 --> 04:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
unit suddenly went offline to keep the
 
04:08:30.910 --> 04:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
grid from destabilizing you want to call
 
04:08:32.870 --> 04:08:32.880 align:start position:0%
upon a bunch of really quick response
 
04:08:36.189 --> 04:08:36.199 align:start position:0%
resources to correct you know to support
 
04:08:39.870 --> 04:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
um how power is being regulated and uh
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
so that that's where they carved out an
 
04:08:43.990 --> 04:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
exception for sort of um otherwise State
 
04:08:46.510 --> 04:08:46.520 align:start position:0%
regulated storage devices and said well
 
04:08:48.710 --> 04:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
if we can just call upon them to help in
 
04:08:50.670 --> 04:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
sort of these emergency situations we'd
 
04:08:52.510 --> 04:08:52.520 align:start position:0%
like to be able to do that but you can
 
04:08:54.109 --> 04:08:54.119 align:start position:0%
still have sort of a regulatory
 
04:08:55.790 --> 04:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
Authority at the State uh level
 
04:08:58.269 --> 04:08:58.279 align:start position:0%
otherwise for these for this particular
 
04:09:00.750 --> 04:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
purpose because because it's valuable
 
04:09:03.189 --> 04:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very
 
04:09:07.109 --> 04:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
much okay Mr bow continue okay at the
 
04:09:10.750 --> 04:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
bottom of page one line 33 um some of
 
04:09:12.389 --> 04:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
that language is was already there in
 
04:09:16.189 --> 04:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
the bill but um I think the chairman um
 
04:09:18.229 --> 04:09:18.239 align:start position:0%
correctly said let's make it clear that
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
the commission does rulle making to set
 
04:09:22.870 --> 04:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
up the parameters for how this works and
 
04:09:24.590 --> 04:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
to be honest I expect that rule making
 
04:09:26.590 --> 04:09:26.600 align:start position:0%
to take quite a while uh because you
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
know could easily take a year more it is
 
04:09:31.149 --> 04:09:31.159 align:start position:0%
part of you know what the commission
 
04:09:32.550 --> 04:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to address as part of grid
 
04:09:35.670 --> 04:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
modernization so so in that sense you
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
know there are issues to be thought
 
04:09:37.199 --> 04:09:38.149 align:start position:0%
know there are issues to be thought
through

04:09:38.149 --> 04:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
through
 
04:09:39.870 --> 04:09:39.880 align:start position:0%
um working with the utilities and the
 
04:09:42.670 --> 04:09:42.680 align:start position:0%
commission and and how this relates um
 
04:09:44.830 --> 04:09:44.840 align:start position:0%
sort of iso to ISO New England as well
 
04:09:46.670 --> 04:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
so this just makes clear the commission
 
04:09:49.950 --> 04:09:49.960 align:start position:0%
initiates rulemaking uh uh to to set the
 
04:09:52.950 --> 04:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
procedures for this uh further establish
 
04:09:54.830 --> 04:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and conditions concerning
 
04:09:57.630 --> 04:09:57.640 align:start position:0%
it um that they deem necessary to avoid
 
04:10:00.269 --> 04:10:00.279 align:start position:0%
substantial risk or uncompensated cost
 
04:10:02.510 --> 04:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
to the electric utility uh in the
 
04:10:04.149 --> 04:10:04.159 align:start position:0%
franchise area where the sales takes
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
place so that that's all in the current
 
04:10:10.590 --> 04:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
bill uh new language here um is to say
 
04:10:12.550 --> 04:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
expressly uh that the commission shall
 
04:10:14.510 --> 04:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
have the authority by rule or by order
 
04:10:16.030 --> 04:10:16.040 align:start position:0%
following notice in hearing this is the
 
04:10:19.510 --> 04:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
top of page two um to determine if there
 
04:10:22.070 --> 04:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
is any unjust or unreasonable cost
 
04:10:24.710 --> 04:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
shifting in transmission rates arising
 
04:10:26.189 --> 04:10:26.199 align:start position:0%
from any credits for avoided
 
04:10:28.070 --> 04:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
transmission charges pursuant to
 
04:10:30.349 --> 04:10:30.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph five that's the next section
 
04:10:33.149 --> 04:10:33.159 align:start position:0%
of of the law and upon find such finding
 
04:10:35.910 --> 04:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
to remediate such cost shifting which
 
04:10:38.030 --> 04:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
may include on a perspective basis
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
reasonably reducing the credit for
 
04:10:42.990 --> 04:10:43.000 align:start position:0%
actual avoided transmission charges so
 
04:10:45.389 --> 04:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
that that's a mouthful but it makes very
 
04:10:49.469 --> 04:10:49.479 align:start position:0%
clear the commission can and and um uh
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
take action uh this this could be on
 
04:10:53.870 --> 04:10:53.880 align:start position:0%
their own initiative or request of
 
04:10:56.349 --> 04:10:56.359 align:start position:0%
utility or the request of any citizen
 
04:10:59.429 --> 04:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
can can initiate um the commission um
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
taking a look at this question of if
 
04:11:03.870 --> 04:11:03.880 align:start position:0%
there's any U cost shifting and and
 
04:11:05.830 --> 04:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
unjust or unreasonable is the term of
 
04:11:07.750 --> 04:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
art just and reasonable are the terms of
 
04:11:09.590 --> 04:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
art that are really well established in
 
04:11:12.670 --> 04:11:12.680 align:start position:0%
case law uh around how the Pu regulates
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
utilities and and the relationship with
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
customers and and generators so um uh
 
04:11:20.830 --> 04:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
that that gives them the authority to do
 
04:11:23.389 --> 04:11:23.399 align:start position:0%
it and and it goes on and makes clear
 
04:11:25.389 --> 04:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
that on a perspective B basis they could
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
reduce the credit uh to make sure that
 
04:11:30.550 --> 04:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
there isn't cost shifting um so right
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
now the way the Bill's written it sort
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
of posi posits there it's the equivalent
 
04:11:37.950 --> 04:11:37.960 align:start position:0%
of a 95% credit to you know 100% of the
 
04:11:40.189 --> 04:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
avoided costs but if the commission said
 
04:11:42.389 --> 04:11:42.399 align:start position:0%
well actually some of those costs come
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
back you know we could reduce that to
 
04:11:46.670 --> 04:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
say 90% but it gives the commission to
 
04:11:50.670 --> 04:11:50.680 align:start position:0%
to adjust that to avoid any uh unjust or
 
04:11:52.070 --> 04:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
unreasonable cost
 
04:11:55.630 --> 04:11:55.640 align:start position:0%
shifting so that is is that's long
 
04:11:59.630 --> 04:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
sentence is at line seven and I'll pause
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
there for a moment if there's any
 
04:12:03.950 --> 04:12:03.960 align:start position:0%
questions on that yes I have a quick
 
04:12:08.349 --> 04:12:08.359 align:start position:0%
question yes on line four
 
04:12:10.469 --> 04:12:10.479 align:start position:0%
where the language
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
says shifting in transmission rates
 
04:12:15.750 --> 04:12:15.760 align:start position:0%
arising arising from any credits for
 
04:12:17.710 --> 04:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission
 
04:12:23.429 --> 04:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
charges yes is transmission rates the
 
04:12:27.070 --> 04:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
proper place to look for cost
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
shifting um I can't see where it would
 
04:12:33.109 --> 04:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
occur otherwise unless you wanted to
 
04:12:35.790 --> 04:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
start counting the additional benefits
 
04:12:37.790 --> 04:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
which sort of has shift in the the other
 
04:12:41.309 --> 04:12:41.319 align:start position:0%
direction um but but they they wouldn't
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
just as an example such um distributed
 
04:12:46.750 --> 04:12:46.760 align:start position:0%
generation that's not participating in
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
the iso New England Market at the same
 
04:12:52.990 --> 04:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
um hour that it might reduce uh
 
04:12:54.670 --> 04:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
transmission charges from what they'd
 
04:12:57.750 --> 04:12:57.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise be it would also produce lower
 
04:13:01.149 --> 04:13:01.159 align:start position:0%
capacity charges to the distribution
 
04:13:04.429 --> 04:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
utility as a whole
 
04:13:07.750 --> 04:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
arguably there might be some credit for
 
04:13:10.790 --> 04:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
that but I I don't think that should
 
04:13:12.790 --> 04:13:12.800 align:start position:0%
occur within the parameters of this
 
04:13:15.630 --> 04:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
statute um because that just kind of
 
04:13:16.910 --> 04:13:16.920 align:start position:0%
complicates thing it's sort of a
 
04:13:16.920 --> 04:13:17.710 align:start position:0%
complicates thing it's sort of a
different

04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:13:20.469 --> 04:13:20.479 align:start position:0%
Market um or or different potential
 
04:13:25.229 --> 04:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
avoided cost um you could for
 
04:13:27.750 --> 04:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
arising I mean you could say for avoided
 
04:13:31.109 --> 04:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
trans arising from any credits I'm not
 
04:13:33.030 --> 04:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
sure where they what they'd arise from
 
04:13:35.309 --> 04:13:35.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise but you could say arising from
 
04:13:38.109 --> 04:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
any credits for void voided transmission
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
charges or or
 
04:13:47.670 --> 04:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
um other cost um or you know for avoided
 
04:13:49.189 --> 04:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
transmission charges pursuant to
 
04:13:52.349 --> 04:13:52.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph five or from any other source
 
04:13:55.550 --> 04:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
or from from any other cost you could
 
04:13:57.550 --> 04:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
say something like that I I just can't
 
04:13:58.469 --> 04:13:58.479 align:start position:0%
think of
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
any and then upon such finding to
 
04:14:05.750 --> 04:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
remediate such cost shifting
 
04:14:08.189 --> 04:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
um there is
 
04:14:09.670 --> 04:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
reason I
 
04:14:12.469 --> 04:14:12.479 align:start position:0%
ra to clarify the reason I raised
 
04:14:16.910 --> 04:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
question is because farther down in line
 
04:14:23.070 --> 04:14:23.080 align:start position:0%
20 we're talking about um these
 
04:14:25.990 --> 04:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
sales happening exclusively on the same
 
04:14:26.000 --> 04:14:27.429 align:start position:0%
sales happening exclusively on the same
distribution

04:14:27.429 --> 04:14:27.439 align:start position:0%
distribution
 
04:14:31.109 --> 04:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
grid yes to avoid involving the
 
04:14:33.030 --> 04:14:33.040 align:start position:0%
transmission grid as much as possible so
 
04:14:35.910 --> 04:14:35.920 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm wondering yes how
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
transmission rates factor into
 
04:14:42.790 --> 04:14:42.800 align:start position:0%
the into the question of avoiding trans
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
you know of avoided
 
04:14:46.800 --> 04:14:46.810 align:start position:0%
transmission charges being shifted
 
04:14:46.810 --> 04:14:49.189 align:start position:0%
transmission charges being shifted
[Music]

04:14:49.189 --> 04:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
somewhere um we can talk about this
 
04:14:54.750 --> 04:14:54.760 align:start position:0%
offline why don't you go ahey well it
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
does go to a point I'm gonna get to in a
 
04:14:59.429 --> 04:14:59.439 align:start position:0%
second um so I'll come back to it in a
 
04:15:01.990 --> 04:15:02.000 align:start position:0%
way but let's go and look at what lines
 
04:15:04.950 --> 04:15:04.960 align:start position:0%
7 through 14 say and this sort of pulls
 
04:15:07.469 --> 04:15:07.479 align:start position:0%
in some language back from the current
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
statute um that the chair thought is
 
04:15:15.229 --> 04:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
important and uh to protect um rate pays
 
04:15:18.710 --> 04:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
retail rate paays in particular uh so I
 
04:15:19.790 --> 04:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
think you know that that it's a
 
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable idea um so what it says is
 
04:15:24.070 --> 04:15:24.080 align:start position:0%
the commission shall review all
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
contracts concerning retail sale of
 
04:15:28.590 --> 04:15:28.600 align:start position:0%
electricity pursuant to this section and
 
04:15:31.309 --> 04:15:31.319 align:start position:0%
I think those words are actually this is
 
04:15:35.189 --> 04:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
actually pretty much current law um just
 
04:15:37.950 --> 04:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
going to glance at it
 
04:15:40.510 --> 04:15:40.520 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah this is pretty much you know
 
04:15:43.830 --> 04:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
pulled right out of the current law um
 
04:15:45.710 --> 04:15:45.720 align:start position:0%
which in its judgment fails to protect
 
04:15:48.309 --> 04:15:48.319 align:start position:0%
both parties against excessive liability
 
04:15:51.830 --> 04:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
or undo risk or B entails substantial
 
04:15:55.349 --> 04:15:55.359 align:start position:0%
cost or risk to the electric utility in
 
04:15:57.109 --> 04:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
whose franchise area their sale takes
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
place or C is inconsistent with the
 
04:16:01.990 --> 04:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
public good and again the public good is
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
one of those words that's used a lot in
 
04:16:07.469 --> 04:16:07.479 align:start position:0%
in the Pu statutes and is um concept
 
04:16:10.990 --> 04:16:11.000 align:start position:0%
that's well established in case law um
 
04:16:13.070 --> 04:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on this is new compared
 
04:16:15.109 --> 04:16:15.119 align:start position:0%
to current statute such review shall not
 
04:16:17.469 --> 04:16:17.479 align:start position:0%
require a contested case meaning you
 
04:16:18.790 --> 04:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
don't have to have an adjudicated
 
04:16:21.590 --> 04:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
proceeding that can take a year more um
 
04:16:23.750 --> 04:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
and failure to disapprove such contract
 
04:16:25.469 --> 04:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of filing with the
 
04:16:27.349 --> 04:16:27.359 align:start position:0%
commission shall constitute approval
 
04:16:29.990 --> 04:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
thereof so so you you know when you can
 
04:16:32.229 --> 04:16:32.239 align:start position:0%
go ahead and execute the contract if
 
04:16:35.349 --> 04:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
they haven't disapproved it the the
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
current statute is written as a negative
 
04:16:39.750 --> 04:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
they may disapprove it it doesn't say
 
04:16:42.429 --> 04:16:42.439 align:start position:0%
they have to approve it so you know 60
 
04:16:43.790 --> 04:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
days and that's what the commission
 
04:16:48.389 --> 04:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
asked for in reviewing um uh electric
 
04:16:51.149 --> 04:16:51.159 align:start position:0%
power aggregation um plans electric
 
04:16:51.159 --> 04:16:52.429 align:start position:0%
power aggregation um plans electric
aggregation

04:16:52.429 --> 04:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
aggregation
 
04:16:55.630 --> 04:16:55.640 align:start position:0%
plans repes PL has a question if you
 
04:16:58.550 --> 04:16:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:02.830 --> 04:17:02.840 align:start position:0%
pause thank you m thank you Mr chair um
 
04:17:07.070 --> 04:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's back on page one lines 33 to 35 I
 
04:17:08.870 --> 04:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't part of your working group I have
 
04:17:11.389 --> 04:17:11.399 align:start position:0%
brought this up but that that language
 
04:17:13.229 --> 04:17:13.239 align:start position:0%
makes no sense to me perhaps you can
 
04:17:15.510 --> 04:17:15.520 align:start position:0%
walk me through it the commission shall
 
04:17:17.030 --> 04:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
initiate rulemaking to establish
 
04:17:19.269 --> 04:17:19.279 align:start position:0%
procedures to enable limited producers
 
04:17:21.710 --> 04:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
electricity at wholesale with inter
 
04:17:24.309 --> 04:17:24.319 align:start position:0%
interestate Commerce and at retail
 
04:17:26.109 --> 04:17:26.119 align:start position:0%
either directly or indirectly through
 
04:17:28.870 --> 04:17:28.880 align:start position:0%
electricity suppliers yes I don't
 
04:17:32.109 --> 04:17:32.119 align:start position:0%
understand that wholesale or retail and
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
what's how how do you do it directly
 
04:17:38.229 --> 04:17:38.239 align:start position:0%
through an electricity supplier um well
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
um I think a a
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
direct sell to sell electricity at
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
wholesale within intra within State
 
04:17:50.910 --> 04:17:50.920 align:start position:0%
Commerce that can be done directly uh to
 
04:17:53.309 --> 04:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
or with an electricity supplier that
 
04:17:56.149 --> 04:17:56.159 align:start position:0%
that's even current law um this this is
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
only um those generators that are not uh
 
04:18:02.229 --> 04:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
participating in the F jurisdictional
 
04:18:04.469 --> 04:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
market and and and hence are not f
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional um and
 
04:18:10.469 --> 04:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
so what it's saying is that there's two
 
04:18:13.469 --> 04:18:13.479 align:start position:0%
ways this could occur um this limited
 
04:18:16.149 --> 04:18:16.159 align:start position:0%
producer it's a limited within State
 
04:18:18.990 --> 04:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
market and they could sell at wholesale
 
04:18:21.189 --> 04:18:21.199 align:start position:0%
uh to A supplier which is a defined term
 
04:18:22.349 --> 04:18:22.359 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statute it's
 
04:18:25.030 --> 04:18:25.040 align:start position:0%
essentially a load serving entity or
 
04:18:27.229 --> 04:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
they could sell at retail direct from
 
04:18:29.389 --> 04:18:29.399 align:start position:0%
producer to Consumer but you would have
 
04:18:33.710 --> 04:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
to go through an electricity supplier um
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
so let me just give you an example um
 
04:18:38.389 --> 04:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
the city of Lebanon is working to
 
04:18:40.550 --> 04:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
develop a one megawatt Landfield Gas
 
04:18:43.269 --> 04:18:43.279 align:start position:0%
Energy project um we
 
04:18:45.790 --> 04:18:45.800 align:start position:0%
could because it would be exactly one
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
megawatt um we could do it with group
 
04:18:51.070 --> 04:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
navig metering um would be one way to do
 
04:18:53.030 --> 04:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
it an alternative way under this statute
 
04:18:55.189 --> 04:18:55.199 align:start position:0%
would be to do that in which case
 
04:18:57.070 --> 04:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
there'd be two possibilities if if say
 
04:18:58.630 --> 04:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
if we had Lebanon Community power up and
 
04:19:00.269 --> 04:19:00.279 align:start position:0%
running and we have a bunch of
 
04:19:02.830 --> 04:19:02.840 align:start position:0%
residential and Commercial customers we
 
04:19:04.469 --> 04:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
could say because this acts like a
 
04:19:05.830 --> 04:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
certain amount of Base load we know our
 
04:19:07.870 --> 04:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
loads always greater than what this
 
04:19:10.229 --> 04:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
producers we we could we could just buy
 
04:19:11.990 --> 04:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
that buy Lebanon Community power to
 
04:19:14.149 --> 04:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
supply customers right here in the city
 
04:19:16.429 --> 04:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
of Lebanon um like we would with group
 
04:19:20.349 --> 04:19:20.359 align:start position:0%
net metering or um there are some we
 
04:19:21.950 --> 04:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
might say well we don't want to take
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
that credit risk for Lebanon Community
 
04:19:26.510 --> 04:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
power because you know we're not sure
 
04:19:28.349 --> 04:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
that that rate's a good one for the long
 
04:19:30.670 --> 04:19:30.680 align:start position:0%
term but we've got some businesses we've
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
got hyperm we got Nova Doris we got
 
04:19:34.149 --> 04:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth College we have the school
 
04:19:36.670 --> 04:19:36.680 align:start position:0%
district we have the city itself um we
 
04:19:38.389 --> 04:19:38.399 align:start position:0%
all be interested in taking strips of
 
04:19:41.990 --> 04:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
that power so we will contract for PPA
 
04:19:45.030 --> 04:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
for strips of that power that we expect
 
04:19:48.309 --> 04:19:48.319 align:start position:0%
is always going to be uh less than than
 
04:19:51.429 --> 04:19:51.439 align:start position:0%
our load and and so 11 can be Power by
 
04:19:53.070 --> 04:19:53.080 align:start position:0%
the balance because you have to be a
 
04:19:54.630 --> 04:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
full service you know full load
 
04:19:56.710 --> 04:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
following service we would buy the
 
04:19:59.109 --> 04:19:59.119 align:start position:0%
balance of that power uh say from the
 
04:20:01.950 --> 04:20:01.960 align:start position:0%
iso New England wholesale Market um but
 
04:20:04.510 --> 04:20:04.520 align:start position:0%
it would be Lebon conven power if it was
 
04:20:07.710 --> 04:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
a load serving entity or competitive
 
04:20:10.429 --> 04:20:10.439 align:start position:0%
electricity supplier who would have to
 
04:20:14.149 --> 04:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
account for all of this who has to um
 
04:20:16.109 --> 04:20:16.119 align:start position:0%
well there's some words elsewhere in in
 
04:20:19.030 --> 04:20:19.040 align:start position:0%
the statute um
 
04:20:22.670 --> 04:20:22.680 align:start position:0%
but uh the electricity supplier it would
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
have to go through them either um
 
04:20:29.630 --> 04:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
directly or indirectly um I I think the
 
04:20:32.510 --> 04:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
indirectly would be if it they're just
 
04:20:35.030 --> 04:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
facilitating a PPA with an individual
 
04:20:37.109 --> 04:20:37.119 align:start position:0%
customer uh and there aren't actually
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
sort of taking title to the power
 
04:20:40.550 --> 04:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
because the customer is taking title to
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
it in real time then that would be
 
04:20:44.510 --> 04:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
indirectly through the electricity
 
04:20:47.269 --> 04:20:47.279 align:start position:0%
supplier or directly would be okay we
 
04:20:49.710 --> 04:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
buy it and we turn around and sell it uh
 
04:20:51.590 --> 04:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
use it as part of our supply obligation
 
04:20:53.870 --> 04:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
for our customer mix right here in
 
04:20:56.950 --> 04:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
Lebanon does that explain
 
04:20:59.830 --> 04:20:59.840 align:start position:0%
it your defining supplier in this case
 
04:21:03.910 --> 04:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
is Lebanon uh entity this Lebanon entity
 
04:21:06.269 --> 04:21:06.279 align:start position:0%
well the in the example I'm giving um
 
04:21:09.830 --> 04:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
but supplier um is defined elsewhere in
 
04:21:12.429 --> 04:21:12.439 align:start position:0%
statute such that what it is in effect
 
04:21:14.109 --> 04:21:14.119 align:start position:0%
it's an entity that has to be registered
 
04:21:18.510 --> 04:21:18.520 align:start position:0%
with the PC um and it is has to be
 
04:21:20.109 --> 04:21:20.119 align:start position:0%
essentially a load serving entity
 
04:21:22.070 --> 04:21:22.080 align:start position:0%
registered with ISO New England as well
 
04:21:24.189 --> 04:21:24.199 align:start position:0%
because you can't provide full load
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
following service unless you're a
 
04:21:27.670 --> 04:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
wholesale Market participant as a load
 
04:21:30.269 --> 04:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
serving entity with ISO New England so
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
that that's a you know the electricity
 
04:21:37.189 --> 04:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
supplier is that kind you know
 
04:21:41.030 --> 04:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
it it's an entity that is a load serving
 
04:21:43.710 --> 04:21:43.720 align:start position:0%
entity both as understood at the state
 
04:21:48.269 --> 04:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:51.630 --> 04:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
level okay thank you uh continue on
 
04:21:51.640 --> 04:21:57.510 align:start position:0%
level okay thank you uh continue on
please

04:21:57.510 --> 04:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:01.750 --> 04:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay um so continuing on um we're on
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
page two at line 15 and there there's
 
04:22:07.070 --> 04:22:07.080 align:start position:0%
actually a deletion here that I'll just
 
04:22:09.229 --> 04:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
call your attention to um because
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
because it's sort of relevant to the
 
04:22:14.510 --> 04:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
last couple of points um says The
 
04:22:14.520 --> 04:22:16.070 align:start position:0%
last couple of points um says The
Limited

04:22:16.070 --> 04:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
Limited
 
04:22:18.229 --> 04:22:18.239 align:start position:0%
producer uh shall receive credit for
 
04:22:20.750 --> 04:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
actual avoided transmission charges and
 
04:22:23.790 --> 04:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
that says only to the extent the current
 
04:22:27.349 --> 04:22:27.359 align:start position:0%
bill okay
 
04:22:31.429 --> 04:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
okay um right I was I think somebody s
 
04:22:36.469 --> 04:22:36.479 align:start position:0%
muted maybe Jackie um just a moment um
 
04:22:40.030 --> 04:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
took care of it okay uh I'm just trying
 
04:22:42.870 --> 04:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
to put my fingers on the Bell as it came
 
04:22:45.269 --> 04:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
to you um so I can make the correct
 
04:22:47.389 --> 04:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
comparison here we
 
04:22:50.670 --> 04:22:50.680 align:start position:0%
go the bill as it came to you said The
 
04:22:53.389 --> 04:22:53.399 align:start position:0%
Limited producer or the purchasers of
 
04:22:55.670 --> 04:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
their output as determined by the
 
04:22:58.070 --> 04:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
commission shall re receive credit for
 
04:23:00.830 --> 04:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
actual voided transmission
 
04:23:03.750 --> 04:23:03.760 align:start position:0%
charges well that's because that's sort
 
04:23:05.670 --> 04:23:05.680 align:start position:0%
of in current law right now it allows
 
04:23:07.990 --> 04:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
the possibility the purchasers could get
 
04:23:10.269 --> 04:23:10.279 align:start position:0%
credit for avoided transmission
 
04:23:12.910 --> 04:23:12.920 align:start position:0%
charges whether there's well actually
 
04:23:14.630 --> 04:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
for for transmission charges whether
 
04:23:16.349 --> 04:23:16.359 align:start position:0%
they're actually avoided or not which is
 
04:23:18.109 --> 04:23:18.119 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with the current law
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
it basically says you could just cancel
 
04:23:23.070 --> 04:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
out your 2.22 cents or 2.5 cents per
 
04:23:25.109 --> 04:23:25.119 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour for
 
04:23:27.550 --> 04:23:27.560 align:start position:0%
transmission um if you're getting that
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
generation from a limited producer and
 
04:23:32.670 --> 04:23:32.680 align:start position:0%
um as a practical matter that would be
 
04:23:34.550 --> 04:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
very hard for the utilities to
 
04:23:36.990 --> 04:23:37.000 align:start position:0%
administer um and it also really
 
04:23:40.910 --> 04:23:40.920 align:start position:0%
confuses how this credit is working so I
 
04:23:42.990 --> 04:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
I suggested to this stakeholder group
 
04:23:44.429 --> 04:23:44.439 align:start position:0%
that maybe it would be better just to
 
04:23:46.990 --> 04:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
take that out of there and and nobody
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
really objected and at least one utility
 
04:23:52.349 --> 04:23:52.359 align:start position:0%
thought that was a good idea on my own I
 
04:23:55.309 --> 04:23:55.319 align:start position:0%
think because they didn't um you know
 
04:23:56.910 --> 04:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
don't want to have to do that kind of
 
04:23:59.269 --> 04:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
calculation uh and it also would
 
04:24:01.309 --> 04:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
implicate the distribution utility and
 
04:24:03.189 --> 04:24:03.199 align:start position:0%
doing more accounting for it than than
 
04:24:06.990 --> 04:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
the supplier um so to make a long story
 
04:24:10.349 --> 04:24:10.359 align:start position:0%
short what what this means is that all
 
04:24:12.630 --> 04:24:12.640 align:start position:0%
customers that receive energy all
 
04:24:14.630 --> 04:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
customers that receive energy would
 
04:24:17.269 --> 04:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
continue to pay the transmission rate
 
04:24:19.309 --> 04:24:19.319 align:start position:0%
whether they their
 
04:24:23.070 --> 04:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
supplier uh is a limited producer um
 
04:24:25.870 --> 04:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't actually cause transmission
 
04:24:29.109 --> 04:24:29.119 align:start position:0%
costs or not and to the extent so in in
 
04:24:32.349 --> 04:24:32.359 align:start position:0%
essence what those customers say say
 
04:24:34.229 --> 04:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
let's just say hypothetically we sold
 
04:24:36.670 --> 04:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
all of our output from
 
04:24:38.830 --> 04:24:38.840 align:start position:0%
um our one megawatt landfill gas to
 
04:24:42.149 --> 04:24:42.159 align:start position:0%
project energy to project to one entity
 
04:24:44.910 --> 04:24:44.920 align:start position:0%
um and actually the only entity that I
 
04:24:46.590 --> 04:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
know that's big enough to take that
 
04:24:49.870 --> 04:24:49.880 align:start position:0%
entire load uh that and it be less than
 
04:24:51.349 --> 04:24:51.359 align:start position:0%
their total load would be either say
 
04:24:53.630 --> 04:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
dhmc the hospital or or Dartmouth
 
04:24:55.710 --> 04:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
College say
 
04:24:58.910 --> 04:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
um um but T take dhmc because it's
 
04:25:01.109 --> 04:25:01.119 align:start position:0%
actually in Lebanon they they always
 
04:25:02.830 --> 04:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
have a megawatt more than a megawatt of
 
04:25:05.429 --> 04:25:05.439 align:start position:0%
load so if we were selling them the
 
04:25:07.030 --> 04:25:07.040 align:start position:0%
entire Mega
 
04:25:08.429 --> 04:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
they would continue to pay their
 
04:25:12.149 --> 04:25:12.159 align:start position:0%
transmission charge but it would
 
04:25:13.870 --> 04:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
essentially most of their what they're
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
paying for transmission would would end
 
04:25:20.229 --> 04:25:20.239 align:start position:0%
up uh going to the gas project which in
 
04:25:23.189 --> 04:25:23.199 align:start position:0%
turn could negotiate a rate that takes
 
04:25:25.030 --> 04:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
that into account and might make it
 
04:25:27.109 --> 04:25:27.119 align:start position:0%
economically feasible compared to say
 
04:25:29.389 --> 04:25:29.399 align:start position:0%
group net metering
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
um so the point is to was to just in and
 
04:25:35.670 --> 04:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
take um credits to the purchaser out of
 
04:25:36.950 --> 04:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
the picture
 
04:25:39.510 --> 04:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
and um so we're always collecting the
 
04:25:42.189 --> 04:25:42.199 align:start position:0%
same amount for transmission charges the
 
04:25:45.309 --> 04:25:45.319 align:start position:0%
question is does that all go to pay
 
04:25:47.229 --> 04:25:47.239 align:start position:0%
actual transmission or does some of it
 
04:25:49.710 --> 04:25:49.720 align:start position:0%
go to compensate avoided transmission at
 
04:25:53.670 --> 04:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
less than the full uh rate if you will
 
04:25:57.710 --> 04:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
um so um just going on from there
 
04:25:59.510 --> 04:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
because this is another long sentence to
 
04:26:03.309 --> 04:26:03.319 align:start position:0%
get an idea important idea cross uh so
 
04:26:06.429 --> 04:26:06.439 align:start position:0%
they would only get credit for actual
 
04:26:09.070 --> 04:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission charges to the
 
04:26:11.630 --> 04:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
extent that transmission charges
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
allocated to the distribution utility
 
04:26:15.189 --> 04:26:15.199 align:start position:0%
are reduced from what they would
 
04:26:17.910 --> 04:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise be absent the electricity
 
04:26:20.469 --> 04:26:20.479 align:start position:0%
exported to the distribution grid by the
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
Limited producer during hours of
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
coincident Peak on which transmission
 
04:26:29.750 --> 04:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
costs are allocated that that's all um
 
04:26:33.630 --> 04:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
you know just a description of how how
 
04:26:35.269 --> 04:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
actual avoided transmission costs can
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
occur and and here's the new language
 
04:26:40.389 --> 04:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
compared to the bill as you got it from
 
04:26:40.399 --> 04:26:41.429 align:start position:0%
compared to the bill as you got it from
the

04:26:41.429 --> 04:26:41.439 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:26:44.630 --> 04:26:44.640 align:start position:0%
Senate and only if the contract or
 
04:26:46.990 --> 04:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
physical path for the electrical energy
 
04:26:49.670 --> 04:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
between limited producer and
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
consumer that is uh the seller to the
 
04:26:54.990 --> 04:26:55.000 align:start position:0%
buyer generator to Consumer seller to
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
buyer can occur exclusively on the same
 
04:27:02.309 --> 04:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
distribution grid such that FK
 
04:27:05.070 --> 04:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional transmission is not
 
04:27:08.590 --> 04:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
required as part of such transaction
 
04:27:12.070 --> 04:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
path um so just I'll just pause right
 
04:27:14.910 --> 04:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
there until I read the uness part um so
 
04:27:16.510 --> 04:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
what that's saying
 
04:27:21.550 --> 04:27:21.560 align:start position:0%
is you know if the producer and the
 
04:27:24.870 --> 04:27:24.880 align:start position:0%
consumer um are actually in the same
 
04:27:27.189 --> 04:27:27.199 align:start position:0%
behind the same interface between the
 
04:27:29.309 --> 04:27:29.319 align:start position:0%
transmission and the distribution grid
 
04:27:31.469 --> 04:27:31.479 align:start position:0%
so that the entire transaction is
 
04:27:33.510 --> 04:27:33.520 align:start position:0%
occurring exclusively within State
 
04:27:35.630 --> 04:27:35.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional distribution grid and
 
04:27:37.550 --> 04:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
with a in the state's authority to
 
04:27:40.990 --> 04:27:41.000 align:start position:0%
regulate inra within State wholesale
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
Commerce but only for generators that
 
04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:45.960 align:start position:0%
aren't participating that in the FK uh
 
04:27:50.590 --> 04:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional Market um then um uh that
 
04:27:52.550 --> 04:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
that that's a new limitation that wasn't
 
04:27:54.670 --> 04:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
in the bill as it came from the Senate
 
04:27:55.910 --> 04:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
um because they only had to be in the
 
04:27:58.910 --> 04:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
same uh franchise area not necessarily
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
in the same part of the distribution
 
04:28:03.429 --> 04:28:03.439 align:start position:0%
grid this came up because the way ever
 
04:28:06.349 --> 04:28:06.359 align:start position:0%
sources uh transmission and distrib
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
assets are arranged in New Hampshire um
 
04:28:10.950 --> 04:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
it's not like they have one big
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
distribution grid what they have is a
 
04:28:17.309 --> 04:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
bunch of FK jurisdictional uh trans
 
04:28:19.309 --> 04:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
transmission that is part of what's
 
04:28:20.790 --> 04:28:20.800 align:start position:0%
called their local network service
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
meaning it primarily serves eversource
 
04:28:26.429 --> 04:28:26.439 align:start position:0%
not other customers u in interstate
 
04:28:30.109 --> 04:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
commerce so a lot of their 115 KV or all
 
04:28:34.030 --> 04:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
their 115 KV and a chunk of their 69 KV
 
04:28:35.790 --> 04:28:35.800 align:start position:0%
uh transmission lines are for
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional and they have somewhere
 
04:28:39.830 --> 04:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
on the order of two or three dozen or
 
04:28:42.229 --> 04:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
more uh different points in which the
 
04:28:44.349 --> 04:28:44.359 align:start position:0%
distribution grid across New Hampshire
 
04:28:46.469 --> 04:28:46.479 align:start position:0%
is interconnected but really only
 
04:28:48.309 --> 04:28:48.319 align:start position:0%
through or primarily through these
 
04:28:51.870 --> 04:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
transmission assets so this is saying
 
04:28:54.590 --> 04:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
that the transactions that get um
 
04:28:57.590 --> 04:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
avoided transmission credit only occurs
 
04:28:59.109 --> 04:28:59.119 align:start position:0%
if they're really in the same part of
 
04:29:01.830 --> 04:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
the grid um you know I wasn't fully
 
04:29:04.510 --> 04:29:04.520 align:start position:0%
aware that they have so many take points
 
04:29:05.990 --> 04:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
um from the transmission into
 
04:29:07.630 --> 04:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
distribution so in a sense they're
 
04:29:10.070 --> 04:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
operating you know several dozen small
 
04:29:11.950 --> 04:29:11.960 align:start position:0%
distribution grids because I'm sort of
 
04:29:13.910 --> 04:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
used to the Liberty Utilities model
 
04:29:16.349 --> 04:29:16.359 align:start position:0%
where the whole um their whole franchise
 
04:29:19.389 --> 04:29:19.399 align:start position:0%
territory here in the Upper Valley um is
 
04:29:22.590 --> 04:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
all behind just um a couple of uh
 
04:29:24.349 --> 04:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
transmission points and and and we're
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
all interconnected as as one
 
04:29:28.710 --> 04:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
distribution grid so our thought was you
 
04:29:30.870 --> 04:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
know um if you if we had a Regional
 
04:29:32.189 --> 04:29:32.199 align:start position:0%
Community power aggregation or a
 
04:29:34.229 --> 04:29:34.239 align:start position:0%
supplier serving the region uh
 
04:29:36.030 --> 04:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
competitive supplier then they could
 
04:29:38.309 --> 04:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
conduct the transition transactions
 
04:29:41.389 --> 04:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
within this part of the territory and
 
04:29:43.990 --> 04:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
the actual physical effect would be to
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
reduce the load on the transmission grid
 
04:29:49.109 --> 04:29:49.119 align:start position:0%
that would also be the contract path is
 
04:29:52.269 --> 04:29:52.279 align:start position:0%
just on the distribution grid and under
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
current um tariffs that are being
 
04:29:56.910 --> 04:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
clarified right now at ISO New England
 
04:29:59.870 --> 04:29:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh that would be would actually function
 
04:30:01.790 --> 04:30:01.800 align:start position:0%
as a load reducer just like Energy
 
04:30:05.309 --> 04:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
Efficiency or demand response um and
 
04:30:08.590 --> 04:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
function to reduce um the network load
 
04:30:10.670 --> 04:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
on which transmission costs are
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
calculated so that's that mouthful and
 
04:30:15.990 --> 04:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
then the unless to finish the sentence
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
is that um unless the commission finds
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
after notice and hearing meaning an
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
adjudicated proceeding where people can
 
04:30:24.309 --> 04:30:24.319 align:start position:0%
present evidence and legal argument uh
 
04:30:27.030 --> 04:30:27.040 align:start position:0%
that such an state within state sales of
 
04:30:28.830 --> 04:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
electricity are within the jurisdiction
 
04:30:31.349 --> 04:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
of the state and commission to regulate
 
04:30:34.990 --> 04:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
and are consistent with RSA 374f colon 3
 
04:30:37.670 --> 04:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 providing for non-discriminatory
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
open access to dist transmission and
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
distribution facilities um so that
 
04:30:45.870 --> 04:30:45.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's a mouthful that particular
 
04:30:47.790 --> 04:30:47.800 align:start position:0%
statute is referenced at the end of the
 
04:30:50.790 --> 04:30:50.800 align:start position:0%
bill on page three uh there's a section
 
04:30:53.710 --> 04:30:53.720 align:start position:0%
six to the bill uh which actually has
 
04:30:55.870 --> 04:30:55.880 align:start position:0%
the it it it says it's repealed and
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
reenacted but but I'm not sure that's
 
04:31:00.550 --> 04:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
necessary because I think this is the
 
04:31:03.070 --> 04:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
entire U language of the current statute
 
04:31:06.510 --> 04:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
as cited um and that was a basic concept
 
04:31:08.990 --> 04:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
that the start of restructuring was that
 
04:31:14.229 --> 04:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
all generators um all uh uh consumers
 
04:31:16.030 --> 04:31:16.040 align:start position:0%
potentially where appropriate wholesale
 
04:31:18.790 --> 04:31:18.800 align:start position:0%
or retail uh should um have
 
04:31:21.070 --> 04:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory open access to the
 
04:31:24.070 --> 04:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
system u meaning you know people like
 
04:31:27.830 --> 04:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
situated are treated in the same way um
 
04:31:30.510 --> 04:31:30.520 align:start position:0%
and uh you know at that time we were
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
saying companies providing transmission
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
should file at firk or or with the state
 
04:31:37.030 --> 04:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
Commission as appropriate comparable
 
04:31:38.990 --> 04:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
service tariffs that provide open access
 
04:31:40.990 --> 04:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
for all competitors and that the
 
04:31:42.269 --> 04:31:42.279 align:start position:0%
commission should monitor those
 
04:31:44.990 --> 04:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
companies providing T andd and take
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
measures to ensure no supplier has an
 
04:31:48.990 --> 04:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
unfair advantage in offering or pricing
 
04:31:51.870 --> 04:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
such services that was you know way back
 
04:31:51.880 --> 04:31:53.389 align:start position:0%
such services that was you know way back
in

04:31:53.389 --> 04:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:31:55.710 --> 04:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
1996 and that was right around the same
 
04:31:57.950 --> 04:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
time FK was operating developing a
 
04:32:01.870 --> 04:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
similar policy under F order 888 uh for
 
04:32:04.590 --> 04:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
open access to transmission um and
 
04:32:06.109 --> 04:32:06.119 align:start position:0%
that's the kind of tarff New England
 
04:32:08.550 --> 04:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
develop uh so the long short of that is
 
04:32:11.229 --> 04:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
is simply to say okay you can't you
 
04:32:13.309 --> 04:32:13.319 align:start position:0%
don't get credit for these kinds of
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
transactions u u unless there's a
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
subsequent determination that that's
 
04:32:19.590 --> 04:32:19.600 align:start position:0%
really within the state's regulatory
 
04:32:21.870 --> 04:32:21.880 align:start position:0%
Authority and it's consistent with our
 
04:32:25.109 --> 04:32:25.119 align:start position:0%
restructuring principles on this matter
 
04:32:27.469 --> 04:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
um and there's so little I'm just going
 
04:32:30.070 --> 04:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
to sort of finish up then then go back
 
04:32:33.990 --> 04:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
to questions if I may um the
 
04:32:36.590 --> 04:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
um there were some a few words deleted
 
04:32:38.510 --> 04:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
here because it used to assume that
 
04:32:40.710 --> 04:32:40.720 align:start position:0%
there was always a meter point between
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
um transmission and distribution that's
 
04:32:46.429 --> 04:32:46.439 align:start position:0%
probably true for Liberty Unitil and the
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
co-op but but it turns out eversource
 
04:32:51.349 --> 04:32:51.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't actually have meter points
 
04:32:54.429 --> 04:32:54.439 align:start position:0%
meters between their tnd interface at
 
04:32:59.070 --> 04:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
least some if not many of their um uh
 
04:33:02.349 --> 04:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
tnd grid uh so you can't actually
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
measure the flow at those locations um
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh so it this just just changed to say
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
The Credits based on measurement of
 
04:33:12.629 --> 04:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
exports to the distribution Grid at the
 
04:33:15.029 --> 04:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
retail meter Point without additional CR
 
04:33:16.230 --> 04:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
credit for avoided line and
 
04:33:18.070 --> 04:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
transformation losses between the retail
 
04:33:20.551 --> 04:33:20.561 align:start position:0%
point and the transmission grid and
 
04:33:22.070 --> 04:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
that's to make sure there's some benefit
 
04:33:24.310 --> 04:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
for for other customers and I've kind of
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
explained this before but in general uh
 
04:33:28.470 --> 04:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's an estimate there's about
 
04:33:30.830 --> 04:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
roughly a 7% transformation and line
 
04:33:33.349 --> 04:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
loss between where power comes over the
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
transmission grid and where it actually
 
04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
gets consumed B retail meters uh so if
 
04:33:40.551 --> 04:33:40.561 align:start position:0%
you if you supply one megawatt at retail
 
04:33:43.269 --> 04:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
you probably have to buy 1.07 megawatts
 
04:33:46.429 --> 04:33:46.439 align:start position:0%
at wholesale um if if you only
 
04:33:48.510 --> 04:33:48.520 align:start position:0%
compensate avoided transmission cost on
 
04:33:50.510 --> 04:33:50.520 align:start position:0%
the one then there's a Delta between
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
that that 100% And 107% if you will um
 
04:33:57.230 --> 04:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be some fraction
 
04:34:00.349 --> 04:34:00.359 align:start position:0%
of a scent or so of of line loss even
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
between the limited producer and the
 
04:34:04.551 --> 04:34:04.561 align:start position:0%
next door neighbor that that will all
 
04:34:06.189 --> 04:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
set load very near buy so there's
 
04:34:08.310 --> 04:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
minimal line losses but still some so
 
04:34:09.551 --> 04:34:09.561 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming there's maybe on the order
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
of five or 6% um savings uh because
 
04:34:15.310 --> 04:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
you're not having to gross up so there's
 
04:34:19.109 --> 04:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
actually sort of um a bit of a financial
 
04:34:21.709 --> 04:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
benefit at at this stage for for
 
04:34:25.869 --> 04:34:25.879 align:start position:0%
non-participants if you will um so
 
04:34:28.029 --> 04:34:28.039 align:start position:0%
that's that's the bulk of the bill the
 
04:34:30.109 --> 04:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
section five of the bill on page three
 
04:34:32.990 --> 04:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
I'll just touch on that briefly uh this
 
04:34:37.070 --> 04:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
is something um that's just there to
 
04:34:40.349 --> 04:34:40.359 align:start position:0%
ensure comparable treatment between
 
04:34:43.789 --> 04:34:43.799 align:start position:0%
generation and storage that participates
 
04:34:46.150 --> 04:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
in that metering and those that might
 
04:34:48.910 --> 04:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
participate as a limited producer uh
 
04:34:50.910 --> 04:34:50.920 align:start position:0%
because right now if you're up to one
 
04:34:52.830 --> 04:34:52.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt and you participate in net
 
04:34:55.750 --> 04:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
metering and group net metering uh you
 
04:34:58.109 --> 04:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
would be exempt from the Statewide
 
04:35:02.150 --> 04:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
utility property tax um and and so line
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
67 89 just clarify that if you're also
 
04:35:08.949 --> 04:35:08.959 align:start position:0%
if you're up to an including one
 
04:35:11.670 --> 04:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt limited producer you would
 
04:35:14.390 --> 04:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
likewise be exemp but if you're in the
 
04:35:16.390 --> 04:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
one to five megawatt range you would not
 
04:35:19.349 --> 04:35:19.359 align:start position:0%
be exempt and that's sort of an
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
important concept because it was thought
 
04:35:22.830 --> 04:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
that that you know this was sort of a
 
04:35:25.750 --> 04:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
thing that was to not lose revenue for
 
04:35:27.869 --> 04:35:27.879 align:start position:0%
the one to five gener megawatt
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
generators that um even you know even if
 
04:35:32.910 --> 04:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
net maning was expanded it it would
 
04:35:35.390 --> 04:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
limit them to one to to this exemption
 
04:35:38.590 --> 04:35:38.600 align:start position:0%
to one megawatt and under so um if for
 
04:35:41.189 --> 04:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
instance our Lan fasta energy project if
 
04:35:43.189 --> 04:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
it were to be privately owned it would
 
04:35:44.789 --> 04:35:44.799 align:start position:0%
be owned by the city as we're planning
 
04:35:47.551 --> 04:35:47.561 align:start position:0%
it now but if it was privately owned and
 
04:35:48.910 --> 04:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
participating group net metering it
 
04:35:50.990 --> 04:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
would be exemp but if it right now under
 
04:35:53.070 --> 04:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
current law if they participated instead
 
04:35:54.910 --> 04:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
in a market-based sale as a limited
 
04:35:59.029 --> 04:35:59.039 align:start position:0%
producer then they would um uh not be
 
04:36:01.070 --> 04:36:01.080 align:start position:0%
exempt and that that alone would would
 
04:36:03.390 --> 04:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
make the limited producer option perhaps
 
04:36:05.910 --> 04:36:05.920 align:start position:0%
um disadvantageous to the point where
 
04:36:07.510 --> 04:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
where nobody under one megawatt would do
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
it so this just tries to ensure
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
comparable treatment for one megawatt
 
04:36:13.830 --> 04:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
producers that function as a load
 
04:36:16.109 --> 04:36:16.119 align:start position:0%
reducer uh you know according to ISO New
 
04:36:18.310 --> 04:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
England generation tariff transmission
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
tariff policies um and as I mentioned
 
04:36:23.629 --> 04:36:23.639 align:start position:0%
section six of the bill that this draft
 
04:36:27.230 --> 04:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
language is is for reference it's unless
 
04:36:29.510 --> 04:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
unless represent V is amended the
 
04:36:31.269 --> 04:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
language it's the same as what's in
 
04:36:34.949 --> 04:36:34.959 align:start position:0%
current statute so I did not uh amend it
 
04:36:34.959 --> 04:36:35.629 align:start position:0%
current statute so I did not uh amend it
I

04:36:35.629 --> 04:36:35.639 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:36:38.510 --> 04:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
misread your email and thought that you
 
04:36:42.670 --> 04:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
did uh rewrite it I added it to the bill
 
04:36:45.230 --> 04:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
so if I hear you correctly we don't need
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
this section no we correct I just put it
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
I put it in the email to you so you
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
could see what what the uh proposed
 
04:36:56.230 --> 04:36:56.240 align:start position:0%
language in the amendment option it uh
 
04:37:00.510 --> 04:37:00.520 align:start position:0%
references okay got it uh representative
 
04:37:04.429 --> 04:37:04.439 align:start position:0%
ssuch has a question sure yes uh thank
 
04:37:05.510 --> 04:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
04:37:08.670 --> 04:37:08.680 align:start position:0%
actually I've got two questions uh as
 
04:37:12.590 --> 04:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
usual uh uh Mr Belo is always so
 
04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
thorough and so detailed that um goes by
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly so so uh on page two uh
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
the section with um 15 through guess
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
24 um you mentioned and I want to
 
04:37:30.990 --> 04:37:31.000 align:start position:0%
clarify what you meant there is you
 
04:37:33.349 --> 04:37:33.359 align:start position:0%
mentioned that all customers would be
 
04:37:37.070 --> 04:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
paying transmission costs yes and then
 
04:37:40.029 --> 04:37:40.039 align:start position:0%
you threw in a little curveball talking
 
04:37:43.029 --> 04:37:43.039 align:start position:0%
something about your landfill gas and
 
04:37:45.629 --> 04:37:45.639 align:start position:0%
that you you could shift shift some of
 
04:37:47.949 --> 04:37:47.959 align:start position:0%
the the cost from the transmission
 
04:37:50.750 --> 04:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
charges to your landfill gas and do
 
04:37:53.390 --> 04:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
something miraculously um can you
 
04:37:55.709 --> 04:37:55.719 align:start position:0%
explain what you meant there and how how
 
04:37:58.349 --> 04:37:58.359 align:start position:0%
does the transmission charges affect
 
04:38:01.310 --> 04:38:01.320 align:start position:0%
everybody and why is that a good
 
04:38:07.349 --> 04:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
idea sure um right now um we have uh
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
very little if any development of 1 to 5
 
04:38:14.869 --> 04:38:14.879 align:start position:0%
megawatt um New Generation new renewable
 
04:38:17.949 --> 04:38:17.959 align:start position:0%
generation and storage in New Hampshire
 
04:38:20.349 --> 04:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
it's it's too big to participate in new
 
04:38:24.150 --> 04:38:24.160 align:start position:0%
net metering and TP and too small uh to
 
04:38:26.390 --> 04:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
be worth participating in the iso New
 
04:38:26.400 --> 04:38:27.910 align:start position:0%
be worth participating in the iso New
England

04:38:27.910 --> 04:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
England
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
markets um this is to try to create a
 
04:38:39.470 --> 04:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
market for those producers
 
04:38:42.551 --> 04:38:42.561 align:start position:0%
um I fully expect they would get a lot
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
less compensation than the generation
 
04:38:47.990 --> 04:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
than the full default service energy
 
04:38:50.709 --> 04:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
rate that you can get under net
 
04:38:54.189 --> 04:38:54.199 align:start position:0%
metering um but but they don't but under
 
04:38:56.429 --> 04:38:56.439 align:start position:0%
net metering if you're more than 100 KW
 
04:38:58.150 --> 04:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
you don't get any credit for any actual
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
voided transmission
 
04:39:03.390 --> 04:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
cost right now all that net meter
 
04:39:06.709 --> 04:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
generation between 100 KW on one
 
04:39:09.510 --> 04:39:09.520 align:start position:0%
megawatt functions almost all of it
 
04:39:11.269 --> 04:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
except except for a few that ever
 
04:39:13.629 --> 04:39:13.639 align:start position:0%
sources registered to be holesale Market
 
04:39:16.551 --> 04:39:16.561 align:start position:0%
participants but but all the rest of it
 
04:39:19.390 --> 04:39:19.400 align:start position:0%
um all of the 100 to one megawatt
 
04:39:21.990 --> 04:39:22.000 align:start position:0%
generation for instance in net net meter
 
04:39:24.510 --> 04:39:24.520 align:start position:0%
generation in Liberties territory it all
 
04:39:27.310 --> 04:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
functions as a load reducer relative to
 
04:39:30.869 --> 04:39:30.879 align:start position:0%
transmission cost allocation so um just
 
04:39:33.510 --> 04:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
to take a hypothetical let let's say we
 
04:39:37.550 --> 04:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
have um 20 megawatts of load in in the
 
04:39:41.708 --> 04:39:41.718 align:start position:0%
Lebanon New Hampshire and 10 of it is
 
04:39:44.270 --> 04:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
being provided by default service and 10
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
of it is being provided uh through
 
04:39:51.910 --> 04:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
Lebanon Community power and um right now
 
04:39:54.070 --> 04:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
if all of that was being served from
 
04:39:56.070 --> 04:39:56.080 align:start position:0%
bulk generators that were buying from
 
04:39:58.110 --> 04:39:58.120 align:start position:0%
ISO New England markets both for default
 
04:40:00.750 --> 04:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
and Lebanon Community power we would pay
 
04:40:02.270 --> 04:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
for 20
 
04:40:05.868 --> 04:40:05.878 align:start position:0%
megawatts um of of at at the
 
04:40:08.230 --> 04:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
transmission rate which is roughly
 
04:40:12.948 --> 04:40:12.958 align:start position:0%
$130 per KW per month or per year um uh
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
so so we'd be paying for transmission
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
costs based on 20
 
04:40:19.788 --> 04:40:19.798 align:start position:0%
megawatts and you might say well that
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
should be megawatt hours but it's
 
04:40:24.788 --> 04:40:24.798 align:start position:0%
actually 100 or 20 megawatts at the
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
single hour of monthly coincident Peak
 
04:40:28.990 --> 04:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
so it's the same as 20 megawatt hours
 
04:40:30.788 --> 04:40:30.798 align:start position:0%
it's it's sort of 20 megawatts of
 
04:40:33.590 --> 04:40:33.600 align:start position:0%
average demand over the peak hour um we
 
04:40:36.150 --> 04:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
would pay that um you know spread out
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
over the course of the Year based on
 
04:40:39.590 --> 04:40:39.600 align:start position:0%
each monthly coincident Peak so that's
 
04:40:43.830 --> 04:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
around 10 11 bucks per kilowatt month um
 
04:40:45.550 --> 04:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
you would pay that to ISO New England
 
04:40:49.310 --> 04:40:49.320 align:start position:0%
for transmission if you reduce that 20
 
04:40:53.030 --> 04:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
megaw to say 19 through Energy
 
04:40:55.350 --> 04:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
Efficiency in the Energy Efficiency
 
04:40:58.230 --> 04:40:58.240 align:start position:0%
programs we would say we can justify the
 
04:41:00.350 --> 04:41:00.360 align:start position:0%
utility investing in Energy Efficiency
 
04:41:03.270 --> 04:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
because they avoid one megawatt of
 
04:41:05.310 --> 04:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
transmission charges and that actually
 
04:41:07.628 --> 04:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
goes into the mathematical calculation
 
04:41:10.350 --> 04:41:10.360 align:start position:0%
for where utility investment Energy
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
Efficiency is is economically justifi if
 
04:41:17.470 --> 04:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
we do the same thing with um uh uh
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
locally based demand response I demand
 
04:41:22.750 --> 04:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
response that's not participating in ISO
 
04:41:26.230 --> 04:41:26.240 align:start position:0%
New England uh markets if we curtail
 
04:41:28.110 --> 04:41:28.120 align:start position:0%
load by one megawatt we also reduce our
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
charges by one
 
04:41:32.830 --> 04:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
megawatt and
 
04:41:36.110 --> 04:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
um if but but that case you know the C
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
the customer well and so in the third
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
instance example if we put on one
 
04:41:43.788 --> 04:41:43.798 align:start position:0%
megawatt of local generation that
 
04:41:46.750 --> 04:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
produces one megawatt at at the system
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
peak hour each month or every month uh
 
04:41:50.868 --> 04:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to do it every month but
 
04:41:52.430 --> 04:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
each month they get a partial credit A
 
04:41:54.868 --> 04:41:54.878 align:start position:0%
month's worth of credit uh if we put on
 
04:41:57.868 --> 04:41:57.878 align:start position:0%
one megawatt of of local uh distributed
 
04:42:01.990 --> 04:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
generation under five megawatts then um
 
04:42:03.708 --> 04:42:03.718 align:start position:0%
what we see for what's called Network
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
load drops from 20 to 19 megawatts for
 
04:42:10.510 --> 04:42:10.520 align:start position:0%
for transmission cost
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
allocation but we're still collecting
 
04:42:15.628 --> 04:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
the same amount from all the consumers
 
04:42:18.590 --> 04:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
because what happens at the Pu is we the
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
pu's obligation the puc controls the
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
rates that retail customers pay
 
04:42:26.430 --> 04:42:26.440 align:start position:0%
including what how generators who are
 
04:42:29.708 --> 04:42:29.718 align:start position:0%
net metered are compensated so the Pu
 
04:42:32.670 --> 04:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
takes what is sort of a demand charge
 
04:42:34.190 --> 04:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
and turns it into a flat rate per
 
04:42:38.070 --> 04:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour so everybody customers
 
04:42:39.390 --> 04:42:39.400 align:start position:0%
don't pay based on their share of the
 
04:42:41.948 --> 04:42:41.958 align:start position:0%
coincident Peak they pay just per
 
04:42:44.070 --> 04:42:44.080 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hour so all the customers
 
04:42:47.030 --> 04:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
continue to pay at the same per kilowatt
 
04:42:50.510 --> 04:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
hour rate but instead of buying 20
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
megawatt hours with what they're paying
 
04:42:55.948 --> 04:42:55.958 align:start position:0%
we're buying 19 from the wholesale
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
market and and we're buying essentially
 
04:43:01.310 --> 04:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
one from from The Limited producer but
 
04:43:03.670 --> 04:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
we're only giving them credit for 95% of
 
04:43:05.310 --> 04:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
what they produce and the Pu could
 
04:43:07.310 --> 04:43:07.320 align:start position:0%
reduce that further if they need to
 
04:43:11.310 --> 04:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
avoid cost shifting um so that's how
 
04:43:14.270 --> 04:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
they avoided cost is sort of being
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
redirected to the generator but for or
 
04:43:20.628 --> 04:43:20.638 align:start position:0%
the storage device but for which we
 
04:43:22.750 --> 04:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
would have had to pay the transmission
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
system does that make sense I I kind of
 
04:43:30.070 --> 04:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to diagram this out visually but
 
04:43:30.080 --> 04:43:31.190 align:start position:0%
wanted to diagram this out visually but
but

04:43:31.190 --> 04:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:43:35.190 --> 04:43:35.200 align:start position:0%
um that's it basically okay thank you so
 
04:43:38.910 --> 04:43:38.920 align:start position:0%
I have a second question um and that is
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
um as you described the eversource
 
04:43:44.750 --> 04:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
transmission and distribution system I
 
04:43:47.628 --> 04:43:47.638 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned that um there is not
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
a meter at the intersection of each
 
04:43:53.948 --> 04:43:53.958 align:start position:0%
transmission line to each distribution
 
04:43:57.430 --> 04:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
line correct does that mean that
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
eversource pretty much uses the
 
04:44:02.750 --> 04:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
transmission lines to distribute its
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
energy to the various distribution uh
 
04:44:10.110 --> 04:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
branches uh so that that is they're
 
04:44:12.628 --> 04:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
using parts of the transmission as a
 
04:44:15.830 --> 04:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
distribution Network as well and um if
 
04:44:17.070 --> 04:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
it's not being
 
04:44:20.430 --> 04:44:20.440 align:start position:0%
metered um how how do they uh assess the
 
04:44:23.510 --> 04:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
transmission cost that way um I think
 
04:44:26.430 --> 04:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
you'd have to ask them that question um
 
04:44:27.948 --> 04:44:27.958 align:start position:0%
what what what I
 
04:44:31.190 --> 04:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
know is BEC let me compare it with
 
04:44:33.350 --> 04:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
Liberty where they do have a meter
 
04:44:33.360 --> 04:44:34.948 align:start position:0%
Liberty where they do have a meter
point

04:44:34.948 --> 04:44:34.958 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:44:36.948 --> 04:44:36.958 align:start position:0%
Liberty still has to estimate what all
 
04:44:39.190 --> 04:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
the retail load is because they don't
 
04:44:40.990 --> 04:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
they like eversource do not have
 
04:44:42.750 --> 04:44:42.760 align:start position:0%
interval meters so they actually don't
 
04:44:45.510 --> 04:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
know who's consuming how much at that
 
04:44:48.310 --> 04:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
hour coincident Peak so they have very
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
complex algorithms mathematical models
 
04:44:55.070 --> 04:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
to take their wholesale meter reading
 
04:44:57.708 --> 04:44:57.718 align:start position:0%
point and guesstimate what the retail
 
04:45:01.150 --> 04:45:01.160 align:start position:0%
meter readings are and and and to figure
 
04:45:04.750 --> 04:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
out what the loss is in between and to
 
04:45:06.788 --> 04:45:06.798 align:start position:0%
um uh to figure their Network load
 
04:45:08.230 --> 04:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
actually the network load is easy to
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
figure because it's all metered it's
 
04:45:12.350 --> 04:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
that wholesale retail I mean distri
 
04:45:14.910 --> 04:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
transmission distribution interface um
 
04:45:16.590 --> 04:45:16.600 align:start position:0%
so they then just have to allocate that
 
04:45:20.310 --> 04:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
out um well I'm kind of jumping between
 
04:45:22.990 --> 04:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
transmission and and uh annual capacity
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
costs let me slow down here um let me
 
04:45:26.760 --> 04:45:28.750 align:start position:0%
costs let me slow down here um let me
see

04:45:28.750 --> 04:45:28.760 align:start position:0%
see
 
04:45:31.868 --> 04:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
um yes so whatever
 
04:45:35.310 --> 04:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
Source I I think there are need meters I
 
04:45:38.990 --> 04:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
suspect there are meters between the
 
04:45:41.788 --> 04:45:41.798 align:start position:0%
regional transmission system which is
 
04:45:44.030 --> 04:45:44.040 align:start position:0%
called the pooled transmission
 
04:45:46.030 --> 04:45:46.040 align:start position:0%
facilities because it's part of What's
 
04:45:47.868 --> 04:45:47.878 align:start position:0%
called the regional network service
 
04:45:52.708 --> 04:45:52.718 align:start position:0%
which is the really true high voltage um
 
04:45:55.990 --> 04:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
Interstate Regional transmission that
 
04:45:58.868 --> 04:45:58.878 align:start position:0%
all load in New Hampshire pay for
 
04:46:00.270 --> 04:46:00.280 align:start position:0%
proportionate to their share of
 
04:46:00.280 --> 04:46:01.590 align:start position:0%
proportionate to their share of
coincident

04:46:01.590 --> 04:46:01.600 align:start position:0%
coincident
 
04:46:04.350 --> 04:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
peak in addition to that we have a bunch
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
of non-pooled transmission facilities
 
04:46:09.030 --> 04:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
which are what's called local network
 
04:46:11.628 --> 04:46:11.638 align:start position:0%
service and it primarily serves
 
04:46:16.788 --> 04:46:16.798 align:start position:0%
customers of one um distrib one parent
 
04:46:20.350 --> 04:46:20.360 align:start position:0%
company I should say so eversource owns
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
transmission primarily in Connecticut
 
04:46:25.910 --> 04:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire a little
 
04:46:28.030 --> 04:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
bit goes into Maine and stuff like that
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
but um that their portion of their
 
04:46:33.510 --> 04:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
transmission that it's not part of the
 
04:46:36.868 --> 04:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
pooled trans transmission facilities is
 
04:46:40.190 --> 04:46:40.200 align:start position:0%
and really operated by ISO New England
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
that portion which is part of their
 
04:46:44.910 --> 04:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
local network it's still an interstate
 
04:46:48.830 --> 04:46:48.840 align:start position:0%
Network though be because it is um well
 
04:46:50.310 --> 04:46:50.320 align:start position:0%
because it's been classified that way
 
04:46:52.628 --> 04:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
primarily but but it also may involve
 
04:46:54.830 --> 04:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
some transmission of of Interstate
 
04:46:58.948 --> 04:46:58.958 align:start position:0%
transmission of electricity um uh so but
 
04:47:00.510 --> 04:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
but it's all sort of pulled together in
 
04:47:02.750 --> 04:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
one rate they they get to charge their
 
04:47:07.230 --> 04:47:07.240 align:start position:0%
local network costs to all of the uh
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
retail uh load that gets power over that
 
04:47:14.750 --> 04:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
so by and large the distribution system
 
04:47:17.110 --> 04:47:17.120 align:start position:0%
don't really interconnect directly with
 
04:47:19.788 --> 04:47:19.798 align:start position:0%
the uh pooled transmission facilities
 
04:47:21.548 --> 04:47:21.558 align:start position:0%
they more typically connect with the
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
regional networks um so like uh Liberty
 
04:47:27.830 --> 04:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
connects to National Grids uh Network
 
04:47:28.868 --> 04:47:28.878 align:start position:0%
you know because they used to own the
 
04:47:30.868 --> 04:47:30.878 align:start position:0%
Distribution Company and and National
 
04:47:32.948 --> 04:47:32.958 align:start position:0%
Grid also serves in you know Rhode
 
04:47:36.750 --> 04:47:36.760 align:start position:0%
Island and Massachusetts as well um I
 
04:47:38.310 --> 04:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
mean it's sort of a leftover artifact
 
04:47:39.430 --> 04:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
from when these were vertically
 
04:47:41.750 --> 04:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
integrated so I believe that there are
 
04:47:43.788 --> 04:47:43.798 align:start position:0%
meter points between the regional
 
04:47:46.590 --> 04:47:46.600 align:start position:0%
Network and the local networks and
 
04:47:47.628 --> 04:47:47.638 align:start position:0%
because they have to be able to
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
calculate the line losses on each
 
04:47:53.868 --> 04:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
Network separately um and so eversource
 
04:47:55.430 --> 04:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
must know what they're paying for from
 
04:47:57.230 --> 04:47:57.240 align:start position:0%
the regional Network and then they have
 
04:47:58.910 --> 04:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
fancy mathematical models that
 
04:48:00.350 --> 04:48:00.360 align:start position:0%
extrapolate from where they do have
 
04:48:02.190 --> 04:48:02.200 align:start position:0%
meters at this interface to where they
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
don't and then does a true up months
 
04:48:06.350 --> 04:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
later once they actually read the
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
monthly bills and they scale it all
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
accordingly and they they have a a way
 
04:48:12.350 --> 04:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
of estimating how much they're actually
 
04:48:14.910 --> 04:48:14.920 align:start position:0%
getting off of their Regional Network um
 
04:48:16.510 --> 04:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
so it's an estimation process that
 
04:48:18.030 --> 04:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's all I know for
 
04:48:20.750 --> 04:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you Mr Belo I think
 
04:48:24.390 --> 04:48:24.400 align:start position:0%
that's enough okay thanks Cliff can't
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
give you a headache KY bits has a
 
04:48:31.110 --> 04:48:31.120 align:start position:0%
question yes I do
 
04:48:34.830 --> 04:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
um I hesitate cliff you know I bring
 
04:48:37.868 --> 04:48:37.878 align:start position:0%
everything down to the re's
 
04:48:41.830 --> 04:48:41.840 align:start position:0%
digest one of the things we heard
 
04:48:45.548 --> 04:48:45.558 align:start position:0%
about renewable energy in general was
 
04:48:50.310 --> 04:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
the uh effect on the grid because of the
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
intermittent energy so if this thing
 
04:48:53.120 --> 04:48:54.350 align:start position:0%
intermittent energy so if this thing
takes

04:48:54.350 --> 04:48:54.360 align:start position:0%
takes
 
04:48:57.708 --> 04:48:57.718 align:start position:0%
off are there going to
 
04:49:01.750 --> 04:49:01.760 align:start position:0%
be winners and losers and and and I say
 
04:49:05.070 --> 04:49:05.080 align:start position:0%
this very simplistically in other words
 
04:49:08.470 --> 04:49:08.480 align:start position:0%
I put a system in my house or on my
 
04:49:11.590 --> 04:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
backyard or wherever that can
 
04:49:15.310 --> 04:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
store X number of energy now there we're
 
04:49:17.750 --> 04:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
in Peak or and we need the
 
04:49:21.670 --> 04:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
energy am I going to be able
 
04:49:25.350 --> 04:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
to give that back at will or is the
 
04:49:28.390 --> 04:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
company going to have to ask me for that
 
04:49:31.750 --> 04:49:31.760 align:start position:0%
and is and again are they going to be
 
04:49:34.310 --> 04:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
winners and losers and is they going to
 
04:49:38.150 --> 04:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
be some control over what's going back
 
04:49:39.708 --> 04:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
onto the
 
04:49:43.990 --> 04:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
grid um and the other the other thing
 
04:49:46.910 --> 04:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
again the read is digest are there going
 
04:49:49.470 --> 04:49:49.480 align:start position:0%
to be contracts for this so if I have
 
04:49:49.480 --> 04:49:50.430 align:start position:0%
to be contracts for this so if I have
the

04:49:50.430 --> 04:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:49:52.628 --> 04:49:52.638 align:start position:0%
system and it's never
 
04:49:55.110 --> 04:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
used or they don't need it or they have
 
04:49:58.670 --> 04:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
too much if this thing really takes
 
04:50:00.990 --> 04:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
off is there going to be a contract with
 
04:50:03.110 --> 04:50:03.120 align:start position:0%
me that well whether we whe whether
 
04:50:05.190 --> 04:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
somehow you put it back or not or
 
04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
whatever we're gonna pay you for it
 
04:50:10.110 --> 04:50:10.120 align:start position:0%
those are two things and you don't maybe
 
04:50:12.670 --> 04:50:12.680 align:start position:0%
have to answer them but they thoughts
 
04:50:14.430 --> 04:50:14.440 align:start position:0%
and there things that I would like
 
04:50:19.190 --> 04:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
clarified in my sure um well first of
 
04:50:20.788 --> 04:50:20.798 align:start position:0%
all you get no credit unless you can
 
04:50:22.190 --> 04:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
actually prove it and that's we're
 
04:50:24.270 --> 04:50:24.280 align:start position:0%
having a revenue grade interval meter
 
04:50:26.470 --> 04:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
comes into place because at the end of
 
04:50:28.990 --> 04:50:29.000 align:start position:0%
the month or some weeks after the end of
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
the month the
 
04:50:34.708 --> 04:50:34.718 align:start position:0%
utilities know in ISO new Eng
 
04:50:37.868 --> 04:50:37.878 align:start position:0%
knows exactly which
 
04:50:40.830 --> 04:50:40.840 align:start position:0%
hour um like right right now we're well
 
04:50:42.510 --> 04:50:42.520 align:start position:0%
we're only 3 days into May sometime
 
04:50:46.230 --> 04:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
later in May they'll have done all their
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
um checks on all the numbers and they'll
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
say with some confidence that back on
 
04:50:55.150 --> 04:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
April you know 17th at hour ending 500m
 
04:50:57.990 --> 04:50:58.000 align:start position:0%
that was the system Peak for April and
 
04:51:00.868 --> 04:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
you only get credit if you actually
 
04:51:03.390 --> 04:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
reduce transmission costes from what
 
04:51:04.548 --> 04:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
they would
 
04:51:07.868 --> 04:51:07.878 align:start position:0%
otherwise be right at that hour so the
 
04:51:10.510 --> 04:51:10.520 align:start position:0%
the winner if you will is the type of
 
04:51:12.990 --> 04:51:13.000 align:start position:0%
resource that can actually be
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
dispatched either by potentially the
 
04:51:18.150 --> 04:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
utility um because they do you know
 
04:51:19.590 --> 04:51:19.600 align:start position:0%
that's what Liberty doing with their
 
04:51:23.788 --> 04:51:23.798 align:start position:0%
battery pilot or by a price signal um or
 
04:51:26.708 --> 04:51:26.718 align:start position:0%
like a a demand response provider that
 
04:51:28.310 --> 04:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
or you're through your supplier I mean
 
04:51:29.708 --> 04:51:29.718 align:start position:0%
that's typically where it happens our
 
04:51:31.510 --> 04:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
supplier our competitive electric
 
04:51:33.470 --> 04:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
supplier for the city of Lebanon does
 
04:51:35.910 --> 04:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
this now for the annual system Peak
 
04:51:38.548 --> 04:51:38.558 align:start position:0%
which is also that month's transmission
 
04:51:40.430 --> 04:51:40.440 align:start position:0%
Peak and they say look we think there's
 
04:51:42.708 --> 04:51:42.718 align:start position:0%
a peak coming you want to curil your
 
04:51:45.510 --> 04:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
load for these three or four hours um if
 
04:51:48.310 --> 04:51:48.320 align:start position:0%
you have battery storage dispatch it to
 
04:51:52.310 --> 04:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
try to meet this peak um and and if you
 
04:51:54.990 --> 04:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
and if you hit that if you actually hit
 
04:51:57.910 --> 04:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
that Peak then you get credit for it if
 
04:52:00.110 --> 04:52:00.120 align:start position:0%
you miss the peak you don't get credit
 
04:52:02.788 --> 04:52:02.798 align:start position:0%
so if if in a sense compared to net
 
04:52:06.708 --> 04:52:06.718 align:start position:0%
metering the loser might be do F south
 
04:52:08.670 --> 04:52:08.680 align:start position:0%
facing solar which
 
04:52:10.868 --> 04:52:10.878 align:start position:0%
optimizes you know produces the most
 
04:52:10.878 --> 04:52:11.990 align:start position:0%
optimizes you know produces the most
kilowatt

04:52:11.990 --> 04:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
kilowatt
 
04:52:14.990 --> 04:52:15.000 align:start position:0%
hours per dollar of investment but it
 
04:52:17.510 --> 04:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
may not do that much to help shave the
 
04:52:20.390 --> 04:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
system Peak because only half of the
 
04:52:22.430 --> 04:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
year is the system Peak even during
 
04:52:26.190 --> 04:52:26.200 align:start position:0%
daylight hours and even in the months
 
04:52:27.990 --> 04:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
where it's daylight hours it's tends to
 
04:52:31.830 --> 04:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
be in the mid to late afternoon um so
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
they may or may not be producing and and
 
04:52:36.470 --> 04:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
if the system Peak moves later and later
 
04:52:38.868 --> 04:52:38.878 align:start position:0%
in the in the day then they there may be
 
04:52:42.270 --> 04:52:42.280 align:start position:0%
less and less credit for a system that
 
04:52:45.788 --> 04:52:45.798 align:start position:0%
can't uh produce if you will you know
 
04:52:47.470 --> 04:52:47.480 align:start position:0%
like where's the beef if you can't
 
04:52:49.430 --> 04:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
produce during the hour of system Peak
 
04:52:51.750 --> 04:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
there is no credit under this and and
 
04:52:53.750 --> 04:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
you're it's just a energy market-based
 
04:52:56.548 --> 04:52:56.558 align:start position:0%
energy transaction between you and
 
04:52:59.110 --> 04:52:59.120 align:start position:0%
another consumer or or supplier on your
 
04:53:01.070 --> 04:53:01.080 align:start position:0%
local part of the distribution grid just
 
04:53:03.110 --> 04:53:03.120 align:start position:0%
like net metering is in many respects
 
04:53:03.120 --> 04:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
like net metering is in many respects
except

04:53:04.390 --> 04:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
except
 
04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
um we're keeping default service and the
 
04:53:10.030 --> 04:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
the distribution utility out of the
 
04:53:11.788 --> 04:53:11.798 align:start position:0%
energy transaction part of this so
 
04:53:13.788 --> 04:53:13.798 align:start position:0%
that's all market-based
 
04:53:16.310 --> 04:53:16.320 align:start position:0%
um that might partially answer your
 
04:53:21.470 --> 04:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:24.270 --> 04:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
control I swear there would have to be a
 
04:53:27.510 --> 04:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
contract between any retail consumer um
 
04:53:29.670 --> 04:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
I would suspect that those would only be
 
04:53:32.590 --> 04:53:32.600 align:start position:0%
large scale at least initially although
 
04:53:34.190 --> 04:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
there might be some community solar
 
04:53:38.350 --> 04:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
programs where people want to um enter
 
04:53:40.510 --> 04:53:40.520 align:start position:0%
into a long-term PPA just like they do
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
for behind the meter those would be
 
04:53:45.070 --> 04:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the P pu if they're going to
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
create problems they could um uh
 
04:53:50.628 --> 04:53:50.638 align:start position:0%
disapprove those contracts
 
04:53:53.830 --> 04:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
um okay I just and the other concern I
 
04:53:55.990 --> 04:53:56.000 align:start position:0%
have is
 
04:53:59.070 --> 04:53:59.080 align:start position:0%
that trying to keep up with all this is
 
04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
is crazy my brain doesn't function that
 
04:54:04.110 --> 04:54:04.120 align:start position:0%
well but how we are
 
04:54:07.470 --> 04:54:07.480 align:start position:0%
intermingling or intermixing our own
 
04:54:09.868 --> 04:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
regulations with what may be coming down
 
04:54:11.670 --> 04:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and what we
 
04:54:15.110 --> 04:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
have done in weeks past so I I think we
 
04:54:18.708 --> 04:54:18.718 align:start position:0%
need to look at that and I I did I did
 
04:54:21.628 --> 04:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
send a send out an email um but only in
 
04:54:24.948 --> 04:54:24.958 align:start position:0%
the hour only during the lunch hour uh
 
04:54:24.958 --> 04:54:25.948 align:start position:0%
the hour only during the lunch hour uh
that

04:54:25.948 --> 04:54:25.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:54:28.590 --> 04:54:28.600 align:start position:0%
includes yeah that includes an image
 
04:54:30.670 --> 04:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
from um an ISO New England presentation
 
04:54:33.470 --> 04:54:33.480 align:start position:0%
from last summer that shows this idea of
 
04:54:35.070 --> 04:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
developing these local markets for
 
04:54:37.548 --> 04:54:37.558 align:start position:0%
distributed energy resources because
 
04:54:40.270 --> 04:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
quite honestly they're like too much for
 
04:54:42.430 --> 04:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
for ISO New England to to want to be
 
04:54:45.030 --> 04:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
concerned about or to have their kind of
 
04:54:47.310 --> 04:54:47.320 align:start position:0%
metering requirements for there are tens
 
04:54:49.430 --> 04:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
and tens of thousands of
 
04:54:52.910 --> 04:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
disted uh generation uh generators now
 
04:54:54.430 --> 04:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
operating under net metering in New
 
04:54:56.590 --> 04:54:56.600 align:start position:0%
England that and this is where ISO New
 
04:54:58.190 --> 04:54:58.200 align:start position:0%
England has sort of complain we don't
 
04:55:00.548 --> 04:55:00.558 align:start position:0%
have visibility into those but if we had
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
this kind of local market particularly
 
04:55:04.030 --> 04:55:04.040 align:start position:0%
for the 1 to 5 megawatt
 
04:55:05.670 --> 04:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
there would be visibility because they
 
04:55:07.390 --> 04:55:07.400 align:start position:0%
would have to have interval metering and
 
04:55:10.270 --> 04:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
you'd see what they're doing when and if
 
04:55:12.070 --> 04:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
they're selling through a producer to a
 
04:55:14.150 --> 04:55:14.160 align:start position:0%
retail customer they're going to want to
 
04:55:15.948 --> 04:55:15.958 align:start position:0%
align their production with the
 
04:55:20.510 --> 04:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
consumption of those customers um so so
 
04:55:22.310 --> 04:55:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I think the only point is yeah this
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
is Tech Technical and complicated but
 
04:55:27.510 --> 04:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
but this is something that a lot of the
 
04:55:29.270 --> 04:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
sort of thought leaders in this field
 
04:55:31.708 --> 04:55:31.718 align:start position:0%
are saying this is something we need to
 
04:55:33.628 --> 04:55:33.638 align:start position:0%
better integrate these intermittent
 
04:55:35.670 --> 04:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
sources where you give the appropriate
 
04:55:38.030 --> 04:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
price signals that that you might want
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
to couple them with storage because
 
04:55:42.110 --> 04:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's more value if you can dispatch
 
04:55:45.190 --> 04:55:45.200 align:start position:0%
that uh stored energy even if it's only
 
04:55:48.070 --> 04:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
one or two megawatts at at system peak
 
04:55:50.430 --> 04:55:50.440 align:start position:0%
times and inevitably to hit the single
 
04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
hour you're going to have to hit a bunch
 
04:55:53.948 --> 04:55:53.958 align:start position:0%
of hours and ultimately this becomes
 
04:55:56.548 --> 04:55:56.558 align:start position:0%
win-win-win because you're encouraging
 
04:55:58.830 --> 04:55:58.840 align:start position:0%
both local production local demand
 
04:56:01.030 --> 04:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
response local storage to help shave our
 
04:56:02.708 --> 04:56:02.718 align:start position:0%
Peaks which typically means we're going
 
04:56:04.030 --> 04:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
to fill the
 
04:56:05.510 --> 04:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
which means we're spreading all the
 
04:56:07.670 --> 04:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
costs for Peak capacity over more
 
04:56:09.430 --> 04:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours rather than fewer
 
04:56:09.440 --> 04:56:10.910 align:start position:0%
kilowatt hours rather than fewer
kilowatt

04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
kilowatt
 
04:56:13.030 --> 04:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
hours that's the
 
04:56:18.708 --> 04:56:18.718 align:start position:0%
idea you all I gotta say uh Cliff is
 
04:56:21.948 --> 04:56:21.958 align:start position:0%
that if all this information exhausts
 
04:56:24.628 --> 04:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
you the way it does the rest of us must
 
04:56:26.190 --> 04:56:26.200 align:start position:0%
be tired all the
 
04:56:30.910 --> 04:56:30.920 align:start position:0%
time here's representative pet he has a
 
04:56:33.750 --> 04:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
question yes with these Limited Energy
 
04:56:36.270 --> 04:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
electric producer contracts who who
 
04:56:38.350 --> 04:56:38.360 align:start position:0%
provides the
 
04:56:40.510 --> 04:56:40.520 align:start position:0%
reserves when the generator can't
 
04:56:42.310 --> 04:56:42.320 align:start position:0%
function are you relying on the system
 
04:56:44.788 --> 04:56:44.798 align:start position:0%
and therefore the transmission well this
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
is called pay pay for performance if you
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
will if if if they don't perform I mean
 
04:56:51.390 --> 04:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
that's the nature of intermittent as
 
04:56:55.910 --> 04:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
well as small scale demand response
 
04:56:58.948 --> 04:56:58.958 align:start position:0%
um um you know the point is if we can
 
04:57:01.150 --> 04:57:01.160 align:start position:0%
systematically and and the fact is the
 
04:57:03.830 --> 04:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
matter is it's partialed out over every
 
04:57:06.150 --> 04:57:06.160 align:start position:0%
month of the year um so you've kind of
 
04:57:07.590 --> 04:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
got to keep
 
04:57:10.830 --> 04:57:10.840 align:start position:0%
performing month in month out as a peak
 
04:57:14.548 --> 04:57:14.558 align:start position:0%
shaver if you don't show up uh just like
 
04:57:17.548 --> 04:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
um if if unexpected load does show up
 
04:57:19.948 --> 04:57:19.958 align:start position:0%
you the overall system needs the
 
04:57:22.990 --> 04:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
reserves for that and so there's still a
 
04:57:25.230 --> 04:57:25.240 align:start position:0%
capacity Market to to make sure we have
 
04:57:27.990 --> 04:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
those reserves what it's sort of a
 
04:57:29.910 --> 04:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
stochastic issue when ISO New England
 
04:57:31.868 --> 04:57:31.878 align:start position:0%
forecasts if they see
 
04:57:36.070 --> 04:57:36.080 align:start position:0%
consistently that Peak demand is not
 
04:57:38.670 --> 04:57:38.680 align:start position:0%
growing as fast or is actually shrinking
 
04:57:40.590 --> 04:57:40.600 align:start position:0%
compared to what they you know had
 
04:57:43.430 --> 04:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
projected a year ago if they see that
 
04:57:46.230 --> 04:57:46.240 align:start position:0%
these distributive resources on
 
04:57:49.270 --> 04:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
average have a certain performance rate
 
04:57:51.390 --> 04:57:51.400 align:start position:0%
that you can count on then they can
 
04:57:54.310 --> 04:57:54.320 align:start position:0%
build that into their forecast for more
 
04:57:56.948 --> 04:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
transmission and generation capacity and
 
04:57:58.548 --> 04:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
that will feed into what they're trying
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
to procure in the forward capacity
 
04:58:03.190 --> 04:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
market so we will continue to procure
 
04:58:05.708 --> 04:58:05.718 align:start position:0%
reserves will just take into account
 
04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
what these resources can actually do on
 
04:58:10.070 --> 04:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
a performance-based
 
04:58:12.990 --> 04:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
metric rather than the problem with net
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
metering to my mind is we have no we
 
04:58:17.590 --> 04:58:17.600 align:start position:0%
have very limited performance-based
 
04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
metrics we're saying all hours are of
 
04:58:22.030 --> 04:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
equal value so all kilowatt hours are of
 
04:58:25.070 --> 04:58:25.080 align:start position:0%
equal value this is a big step towards
 
04:58:28.110 --> 04:58:28.120 align:start position:0%
saying we need to connect what we
 
04:58:30.868 --> 04:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
compensate these resources for to when
 
04:58:33.750 --> 04:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
they actually produce and let value they
 
04:58:37.150 --> 04:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
actually contribute on
 
04:58:41.230 --> 04:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
average okay Mr chairman did that answer
 
04:58:44.708 --> 04:58:44.718 align:start position:0%
your question I'm not sure qu frankly
 
04:58:48.548 --> 04:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
okay well he gave it a good good sure we
 
04:58:51.430 --> 04:58:51.440 align:start position:0%
need to wrap this up Mr chairman I have
 
04:58:53.788 --> 04:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
one more question I promis the committee
 
04:58:56.230 --> 04:58:56.240 align:start position:0%
would be done around three o'clock so I
 
04:58:58.628 --> 04:58:58.638 align:start position:0%
notice representative samic has one more
 
04:59:02.310 --> 04:59:02.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you um well it's just
 
04:59:04.390 --> 04:59:04.400 align:start position:0%
kind of following on what you just said
 
04:59:07.430 --> 04:59:07.440 align:start position:0%
Mr Belo I want to remind people how
 
04:59:09.350 --> 04:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
things have changed what it used to be
 
04:59:12.270 --> 04:59:12.280 align:start position:0%
to have an old electric bill where you
 
04:59:14.070 --> 04:59:14.080 align:start position:0%
could get that every month and it told
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
you exactly how much energy you used and
 
04:59:19.910 --> 04:59:19.920 align:start position:0%
what what the price was that you paid
 
04:59:23.708 --> 04:59:23.718 align:start position:0%
for right now I I have to have my own
 
04:59:25.910 --> 04:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet to make those
 
04:59:27.990 --> 04:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
determinations and the reason for that
 
04:59:31.190 --> 04:59:31.200 align:start position:0%
is a couple first of all the Pu has now
 
04:59:34.150 --> 04:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
allowed you to choose your own energy
 
04:59:37.390 --> 04:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
supplier so the my bill every month
 
04:59:39.788 --> 04:59:39.798 align:start position:0%
contains the bill for the energy
 
04:59:43.190 --> 04:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
supplier then I have solar collectors on
 
04:59:46.270 --> 04:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
my roof which when I'm not using it I
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
put into the grid and then I also have a
 
04:59:52.590 --> 04:59:52.600 align:start position:0%
hybrid vehicle which I charge up uh when
 
04:59:55.510 --> 04:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
the Sun's shining or from the grid and
 
04:59:58.310 --> 04:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
of course I have my home so my electric
 
05:00:01.310 --> 05:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill when it comes every month shows me
 
05:00:05.310 --> 05:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
what my Net usage was from my utility
 
05:00:07.990 --> 05:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
company but that's not really reflective
 
05:00:10.190 --> 05:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
of how much energy I actually used in
 
05:00:12.270 --> 05:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
order for me to calculate that I have to
 
05:00:14.670 --> 05:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
have my own spreadsheet so my question
 
05:00:16.990 --> 05:00:17.000 align:start position:0%
is this with all these new complexities
 
05:00:19.590 --> 05:00:19.600 align:start position:0%
and options that people have it seems to
 
05:00:20.948 --> 05:00:20.958 align:start position:0%
me we're going to have we're going to
 
05:00:23.390 --> 05:00:23.400 align:start position:0%
need a more a more
 
05:00:25.990 --> 05:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh Billing System that
 
05:00:28.390 --> 05:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
people know what's going on because
 
05:00:30.548 --> 05:00:30.558 align:start position:0%
keeping track of it is not
 
05:00:36.868 --> 05:00:36.878 align:start position:0%
easy um that that's a a fair observation
 
05:00:41.830 --> 05:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
um which is why in part um I I suggested
 
05:00:43.510 --> 05:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
you know taking the idea of a credit to
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
the consumer off because that would
 
05:00:49.510 --> 05:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
complicate things for the consumer um I
 
05:00:49.520 --> 05:00:51.150 align:start position:0%
complicate things for the consumer um I
think

05:00:51.150 --> 05:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:00:54.190 --> 05:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
primarily this is going to be of
 
05:00:58.708 --> 05:00:58.718 align:start position:0%
interest to large uh consumers
 
05:01:02.230 --> 05:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
institutions um businesses that want to
 
05:01:04.350 --> 05:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
make long-term commitments to local
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
renewable energy
 
05:01:13.270 --> 05:01:13.280 align:start position:0%
um the you know and it's also designed
 
05:01:15.470 --> 05:01:15.480 align:start position:0%
to try to put the work not on the
 
05:01:16.830 --> 05:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
default service
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
provider such as the case with net
 
05:01:21.948 --> 05:01:21.958 align:start position:0%
metering um which is which is the
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
incumbent utility rather puts the burden
 
05:01:28.350 --> 05:01:28.360 align:start position:0%
to account for this uh really on the
 
05:01:30.910 --> 05:01:30.920 align:start position:0%
suppliers um and and to handle these
 
05:01:33.548 --> 05:01:33.558 align:start position:0%
transactions in the first instance
 
05:01:36.270 --> 05:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
um there will be work for the Pu to to
 
05:01:38.670 --> 05:01:38.680 align:start position:0%
sort of Flesh this out so that that's
 
05:01:40.910 --> 05:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
going to take some time uh but but this
 
05:01:44.350 --> 05:01:44.360 align:start position:0%
is a concept that's been sort of in
 
05:01:48.110 --> 05:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
increasingly talked about and uh this is
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
what happens behind the scenes with any
 
05:01:52.750 --> 05:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
supplier whether it's the company that
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
wins default service or
 
05:01:55.680 --> 05:01:57.230 align:start position:0%
wins default service or
suppliers

05:01:57.230 --> 05:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
suppliers
 
05:02:01.910 --> 05:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
uh you know for the co-op or um comp
 
05:02:03.390 --> 05:02:03.400 align:start position:0%
competitive Supply
 
05:02:05.830 --> 05:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
or Community power aggregations they
 
05:02:10.150 --> 05:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
they all have to align up resources uh
 
05:02:14.070 --> 05:02:14.080 align:start position:0%
to meet their load in real time um and a
 
05:02:16.350 --> 05:02:16.360 align:start position:0%
portion of that a large portion of that
 
05:02:17.990 --> 05:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
most of it is through the Interstate
 
05:02:19.948 --> 05:02:19.958 align:start position:0%
Wholesale Market although some of that's
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
bilateral at that level sometimes it's
 
05:02:24.390 --> 05:02:24.400 align:start position:0%
at the they Hadad in real time so
 
05:02:25.750 --> 05:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of stuff going on behind
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
the scenes and so I think for the retail
 
05:02:31.788 --> 05:02:31.798 align:start position:0%
consumer nothing has to change um it
 
05:02:34.470 --> 05:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
might be that Lebanon Community power
 
05:02:36.910 --> 05:02:36.920 align:start position:0%
once it gets established in a few years
 
05:02:39.030 --> 05:02:39.040 align:start position:0%
says you know we're we're managing our
 
05:02:41.628 --> 05:02:41.638 align:start position:0%
supply on a portfolio basis and we are
 
05:02:43.830 --> 05:02:43.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable uh doing a long-term
 
05:02:46.070 --> 05:02:46.080 align:start position:0%
contract with this solar plus storage
 
05:02:48.350 --> 05:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
project it will probably be with storage
 
05:02:51.230 --> 05:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
because just the solar alone may not
 
05:02:53.390 --> 05:02:53.400 align:start position:0%
help you know shave the system Peak that
 
05:02:56.708 --> 05:02:56.718 align:start position:0%
much um uh and that that's that would be
 
05:02:59.350 --> 05:02:59.360 align:start position:0%
our Peak probably as well so we're
 
05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:01.440 align:start position:0%
trying to create something that the
 
05:03:04.750 --> 05:03:04.760 align:start position:0%
supplier the power aggregation through
 
05:03:08.070 --> 05:03:08.080 align:start position:0%
probably existing vendors uh can support
 
05:03:11.070 --> 05:03:11.080 align:start position:0%
this um and not make it difficult for
 
05:03:13.548 --> 05:03:13.558 align:start position:0%
the individual customer except the
 
05:03:15.430 --> 05:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
customer just might say you know I want
 
05:03:17.230 --> 05:03:17.240 align:start position:0%
10% of my power froming coming from
 
05:03:19.190 --> 05:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
local Renewables and and this is a way
 
05:03:20.510 --> 05:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
to sign up for
 
05:03:23.868 --> 05:03:23.878 align:start position:0%
that and and I fixed part of my rate for
 
05:03:26.190 --> 05:03:26.200 align:start position:0%
the next five years or 10 years you know
 
05:03:28.470 --> 05:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
this would be prly businesses that say
 
05:03:30.150 --> 05:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
you know I I'm willing to enter into a
 
05:03:32.990 --> 05:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 year PPA for some of this power
 
05:03:34.350 --> 05:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
because I know that that portion of my
 
05:03:36.948 --> 05:03:36.958 align:start position:0%
power will be a stable rate and you know
 
05:03:38.670 --> 05:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
and if cost goes up I've got a hedge
 
05:03:41.230 --> 05:03:41.240 align:start position:0%
against that and if cost go down well
 
05:03:42.750 --> 05:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
you know but at least I knew it was a
 
05:03:45.230 --> 05:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
good price at the time and you know and
 
05:03:48.350 --> 05:03:48.360 align:start position:0%
I made that commitment so
 
05:03:52.470 --> 05:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
um thank you very much Mr be Mr chairman
 
05:03:54.590 --> 05:03:54.600 align:start position:0%
if I may my you had a question with
 
05:03:56.030 --> 05:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
regard to part one of the bill and I
 
05:04:02.150 --> 05:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
could quickly answer that um oh okay um
 
05:04:04.470 --> 05:04:04.480 align:start position:0%
you were looking at um oops I don't have
 
05:04:07.548 --> 05:04:07.558 align:start position:0%
the whole Bell here yes I do
 
05:04:10.708 --> 05:04:10.718 align:start position:0%
um it was the
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:21.990 --> 05:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
23 uh Roman numeral 11 po electricity
 
05:04:26.590 --> 05:04:26.600 align:start position:0%
markets means yes and it currently the
 
05:04:29.230 --> 05:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
defin definition is just means energy
 
05:04:31.548 --> 05:04:31.558 align:start position:0%
capacity or ancillary Services Market
 
05:04:34.270 --> 05:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
that ISO New England operates and my
 
05:04:38.150 --> 05:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
suggested add to that was or that may
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
operate pursuant to RSA
 
05:04:45.628 --> 05:04:45.638 align:start position:0%
362a colon 2A which is what we were just
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
05:04:51.470 --> 05:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
um that under current law creates a very
 
05:04:54.470 --> 05:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
limited within State wholesale Market
 
05:04:56.670 --> 05:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
Interstate Wholesale Market as well as a
 
05:04:58.310 --> 05:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
potential retail Market it's never been
 
05:05:00.948 --> 05:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
used before but it does that this bill
 
05:05:02.750 --> 05:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
would update that make it perhaps
 
05:05:05.628 --> 05:05:05.638 align:start position:0%
actually usable the point being the
 
05:05:07.990 --> 05:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
purpose of that definition is because
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
later on it asked the commission to look
 
05:05:12.830 --> 05:05:12.840 align:start position:0%
at how to compensate energy storage
 
05:05:12.840 --> 05:05:14.510 align:start position:0%
at how to compensate energy storage
for

05:05:14.510 --> 05:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
for
 
05:05:17.230 --> 05:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
um um avoided transmission costs when
 
05:05:19.150 --> 05:05:19.160 align:start position:0%
they participate in wholesale markets
 
05:05:21.070 --> 05:05:21.080 align:start position:0%
well the long and short of this is if
 
05:05:22.948 --> 05:05:22.958 align:start position:0%
you participate in the iso New England
 
05:05:24.670 --> 05:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
Market there are no avoided transmission
 
05:05:27.948 --> 05:05:27.958 align:start position:0%
charges because whatever you produce um
 
05:05:30.470 --> 05:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
gets counted um if it's on the
 
05:05:32.190 --> 05:05:32.200 align:start position:0%
distribution grid as part of the network
 
05:05:34.190 --> 05:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
load in other words you can't
 
05:05:35.628 --> 05:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
participate in the iso New England
 
05:05:38.190 --> 05:05:38.200 align:start position:0%
market and get credit for avoiding costs
 
05:05:40.590 --> 05:05:40.600 align:start position:0%
essentially in that market um and the
 
05:05:41.948 --> 05:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
same thing is actually true on energy
 
05:05:43.788 --> 05:05:43.798 align:start position:0%
and capacity if you participate in the
 
05:05:45.788 --> 05:05:45.798 align:start position:0%
iso New England Market there are no
 
05:05:48.788 --> 05:05:48.798 align:start position:0%
avoided uh uh capacity energy or in
 
05:05:51.190 --> 05:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
solary service costs those are all get
 
05:05:53.590 --> 05:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
applied uh because that power is in
 
05:05:55.230 --> 05:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
effect selling into that wholesale
 
05:05:57.910 --> 05:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
market so this just recognizes that
 
05:06:00.868 --> 05:06:00.878 align:start position:0%
under federal law under Supreme Court
 
05:06:03.030 --> 05:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
repeated precedent the state has
 
05:06:05.470 --> 05:06:05.480 align:start position:0%
authority over retail sales and within
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
State wholesale sales we're allowing
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
very limited within-state wholesale
 
05:06:13.708 --> 05:06:13.718 align:start position:0%
sales and those ones may actually be
 
05:06:17.628 --> 05:06:17.638 align:start position:0%
able to avoid those transmission cost
 
05:06:19.948 --> 05:06:19.958 align:start position:0%
um so it's just broadening the
 
05:06:22.150 --> 05:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
definition to recognize
 
05:06:24.830 --> 05:06:24.840 align:start position:0%
that at least legally there can be more
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
than one wholesale electricity Market
 
05:06:28.830 --> 05:06:28.840 align:start position:0%
the interstate one there could also be a
 
05:06:30.750 --> 05:06:30.760 align:start position:0%
within-state wholesale one that's
 
05:06:33.430 --> 05:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
Limited in nature and that is defined in
 
05:06:37.150 --> 05:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
RSA 362a colon 2A essentially part four
 
05:06:38.990 --> 05:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
of this
 
05:06:42.070 --> 05:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
bill okay thank you Cliff I'm gonna wrap
 
05:06:45.430 --> 05:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
up this meeting by asking you one final
 
05:06:49.150 --> 05:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
question to which I would prefer a yes
 
05:06:52.628 --> 05:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
or no answer but I know that'll be
 
05:06:53.948 --> 05:06:53.958 align:start position:0%
difficult for
 
05:06:58.030 --> 05:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
you the question is are you confident
 
05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
that the language in the that we've been
 
05:07:03.270 --> 05:07:03.280 align:start position:0%
discussing here for the last I don't
 
05:07:05.868 --> 05:07:05.878 align:start position:0%
know hour hour
 
05:07:10.270 --> 05:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
plus will a prevent any cough shifting
 
05:07:14.190 --> 05:07:14.200 align:start position:0%
of avoided transmission charges and B
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
protect all the participants in limited
 
05:07:19.750 --> 05:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
electrical energy uh
 
05:07:19.760 --> 05:07:22.670 align:start position:0%
electrical energy uh
production

05:07:22.670 --> 05:07:22.680 align:start position:0%
production
 
05:07:22.680 --> 05:07:24.270 align:start position:0%
production
exchanges

05:07:24.270 --> 05:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
exchanges
 
05:07:28.548 --> 05:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
unequivocally yes okay great thank you
 
05:07:30.470 --> 05:07:30.480 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that one- word
 
05:07:32.910 --> 05:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
answer and with that I well thank you
 
05:07:35.350 --> 05:07:35.360 align:start position:0%
very much for your hard work on this and
 
05:07:37.190 --> 05:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
for participating here with us this
 
05:07:39.628 --> 05:07:39.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon does anybody on the committee
 
05:07:42.590 --> 05:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
have any further uh comments or
 
05:07:44.868 --> 05:07:44.878 align:start position:0%
questions Representative
 
05:07:48.390 --> 05:07:48.400 align:start position:0%
ssuch no sorry I have my hand up but I'm
 
05:07:50.110 --> 05:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
lowering my
 
05:07:53.030 --> 05:07:53.040 align:start position:0%
hand okay representative
 
05:07:55.868 --> 05:07:55.878 align:start position:0%
McGee yes thank you Mr chairman my
 
05:07:58.830 --> 05:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
question is just procedural it's um are
 
05:08:01.788 --> 05:08:01.798 align:start position:0%
we going to then turn this document into
 
05:08:04.030 --> 05:08:04.040 align:start position:0%
an amend and are we going to have a
 
05:08:05.750 --> 05:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
subsequent meeting scheduled I know you
 
05:08:08.070 --> 05:08:08.080 align:start position:0%
had mentioned to representative oxenham
 
05:08:09.390 --> 05:08:09.400 align:start position:0%
earlier that you were going to try and
 
05:08:12.150 --> 05:08:12.160 align:start position:0%
look for scheduled time next
 
05:08:15.548 --> 05:08:15.558 align:start position:0%
week yes a good question and thank you
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
for that here's what I propose to do I
 
05:08:22.270 --> 05:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
will take the discussions that we had
 
05:08:29.150 --> 05:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
here today on uh part one of the S
 
05:08:35.830 --> 05:08:35.840 align:start position:0%
sp91 uh and I will draft a document that
 
05:08:38.430 --> 05:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
contains the proposed language
 
05:08:41.750 --> 05:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
changes I won't go to
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
OS the the
 
05:08:49.868 --> 05:08:49.878 align:start position:0%
um legislative olss I won't go to OS
 
05:08:52.868 --> 05:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
with them I will just draft them so that
 
05:08:55.390 --> 05:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
they look like a drafted Bill language
 
05:08:58.070 --> 05:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
and then I will send it out to the
 
05:09:01.430 --> 05:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
committee and I will do the same thing
 
05:09:05.750 --> 05:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
with language for part four um there
 
05:09:07.910 --> 05:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
were only a couple of minor changes I
 
05:09:10.948 --> 05:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
think that we want to make to the
 
05:09:14.350 --> 05:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
language that U that that we've been
 
05:09:16.750 --> 05:09:16.760 align:start position:0%
discussing for the last hour and a
 
05:09:20.788 --> 05:09:20.798 align:start position:0%
half for example removing lines 10
 
05:09:24.948 --> 05:09:24.958 align:start position:0%
through 19 on page three that's not
 
05:09:28.270 --> 05:09:28.280 align:start position:0%
necessary so we'll pull that out and
 
05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
I'll get some clarification with Mr Belo
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
on question I had had about some wording
 
05:09:38.390 --> 05:09:38.400 align:start position:0%
in line four on page two and then I'll
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
recirculate uh those two
 
05:09:43.788 --> 05:09:43.798 align:start position:0%
documents uh to the committee and we can
 
05:09:48.470 --> 05:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
talk about them via email um to some
 
05:09:51.230 --> 05:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
degree then I will also
 
05:09:54.750 --> 05:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
search or try to get house committee
 
05:09:57.628 --> 05:09:57.638 align:start position:0%
services to search for additional
 
05:09:59.788 --> 05:09:59.798 align:start position:0%
meeting times that we might be able to
