deborah sumner
 
00:07:44.790 --> 00:07:44.800 align:start position:0%
is the brains of this operation
 
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh for for those of you who have been
 
00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
following uh election law uh apparently
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
this is the fourth time a bill similar
 
00:07:55.909 --> 00:07:55.919 align:start position:0%
to this has been submitted
 
00:07:58.390 --> 00:07:58.400 align:start position:0%
um and ms sumner has been the
 
00:07:58.400 --> 00:07:59.350 align:start position:0%
um and ms sumner has been the
um

00:07:59.350 --> 00:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:01.029 --> 00:08:01.039 align:start position:0%
the the leading
 
00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh citizen activist uh pushing it
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
i think um
 
00:08:09.029 --> 00:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
that would trigger the question well you
 
00:08:12.629 --> 00:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
know four times in a row what's changed
 
00:08:14.309 --> 00:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
and what i think
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
has changed and why this bill
 
00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
takes on a new light and should be
 
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:20.960 align:start position:0%
looked at differently than perhaps it
 
00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:22.720 align:start position:0%
has been historically
 
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:24.080 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:08:27.430 --> 00:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
in this past november election
 
00:08:28.869 --> 00:08:28.879 align:start position:0%
in states
 
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:31.120 align:start position:0%
not new hampshire but
 
00:08:34.310 --> 00:08:34.320 align:start position:0%
um there was reason for
 
00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
local populations in particular cities
 
00:08:38.550 --> 00:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
within states
 
00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
to become this is very suspicious of the
 
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:42.949 align:start position:0%
to become this is very suspicious of the
process

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
uh pole uh watchers
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
had been pushed way out of a normal
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
distance and
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
and were denied an ability to oversee
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
the counting of the of the ballots and
 
00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:57.680 align:start position:0%
the whole process of introducing ballots
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
to the count
 
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:00.070 align:start position:0%
to the count
and

00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
so in many
 
00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.519 align:start position:0%
cities across the country
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
there is a a
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
great concern
 
00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:08.550 align:start position:0%
great concern
that

00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
the ballots
 
00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
weren't treated properly and
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
and so what this bill would do
 
00:09:17.590 --> 00:09:17.600 align:start position:0%
would be to give new hampshire residents
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
the assurance
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
that there is a method
 
00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.750 align:start position:0%
that there is a method
for

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
local citizens to
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
get involved in
 
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the counts
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
after the fact after the recounts
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
but to take a look at the ballots uh by
 
00:09:39.269 --> 00:09:39.279 align:start position:0%
making the cast ballots
 
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
part of what is discoverable under 91a
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh right now the cast ballots are are
 
00:09:49.509 --> 00:09:49.519 align:start position:0%
hidden from view from the public and are
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
not able to be seen
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
other than in a recount situation
 
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
and um and and as we're
 
00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
and um and and as we're
witnessing

00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
witnessing
 
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
um that's probably not a sufficient
 
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
amount of transparency
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
to adapt
 
00:10:08.949 --> 00:10:08.959 align:start position:0%
to a wide range of potential situations
 
00:10:11.110 --> 00:10:11.120 align:start position:0%
in which the public interest in the cast
 
00:10:14.150 --> 00:10:14.160 align:start position:0%
ballots are is particularly keen
 
00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
so what this bill
 
00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:17.680 align:start position:0%
is wanting to do
 
00:10:19.910 --> 00:10:19.920 align:start position:0%
is to shine sunlight
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
on the election process
 
00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.040 align:start position:0%
and i think in doing so
 
00:10:27.030 --> 00:10:27.040 align:start position:0%
the first thing that would happen would
 
00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
be that the public would become more
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
confident in the results
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
knowing that they could check
 
00:10:36.310 --> 00:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
the mechanics and the in the counts
 
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:37.670 align:start position:0%
the mechanics and the in the counts
themselves

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
so so public trust would be enhanced and
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
i think public trust is essential to
 
00:10:46.870 --> 00:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
acceptance of being governed
 
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:48.000 align:start position:0%
and is
 
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.160 align:start position:0%
useful to just maintaining domestic
 
00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.990 align:start position:0%
useful to just maintaining domestic
tranquility

00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
tranquility
 
00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
the other thing that could happen
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
is if there was ever a situation in
 
00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.150 align:start position:0%
is if there was ever a situation in
which

00:10:58.150 --> 00:10:58.160 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
somebody had a poll
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
wished to do something nefarious
 
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
they would know that they probably ought
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
not to do it because there's a
 
00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:09.110 align:start position:0%
not to do it because there's a
possibility

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
that would be introduced with this bill
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that they could be
 
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.949 align:start position:0%
there's a possibility that they could be
caught

00:11:14.949 --> 00:11:14.959 align:start position:0%
caught
 
00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
other than
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
if an if a candidate requested a recount
 
00:11:22.949 --> 00:11:22.959 align:start position:0%
and so it's always good to just keep
 
00:11:24.389 --> 00:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
people honest
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
knowing that there may be a way to to
 
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
check up on them
 
00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:32.240 align:start position:0%
so um this bill i think has been opposed
 
00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:34.640 align:start position:0%
historically by the secretary of state's
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
office i've not talked to um the
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
secretary or state or uh
 
00:11:40.399 --> 00:11:41.269 align:start position:0%
secretary or state or uh
or

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:11:44.230 --> 00:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
his deputy mr scanlon about the bill
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
um i understand from the sumner that
 
00:11:48.389 --> 00:11:48.399 align:start position:0%
there have been three
 
00:11:51.910 --> 00:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
issues um that the secretary of state uh
 
00:11:53.990 --> 00:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
is concerned about one of them being
 
00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.350 align:start position:0%
is concerned about one of them being
privacy

00:11:55.350 --> 00:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
privacy
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i i think
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
that there ought to be a way
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
to uh deal with the secretary of state's
 
00:12:03.519 --> 00:12:05.110 align:start position:0%
to uh deal with the secretary of state's
issues

00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:12:06.949 --> 00:12:06.959 align:start position:0%
in an amendment so
 
00:12:10.389 --> 00:12:10.399 align:start position:0%
um so i i would hope that the the
 
00:12:13.829 --> 00:12:13.839 align:start position:0%
committee would look favorably on 480
 
00:12:15.829 --> 00:12:15.839 align:start position:0%
and because it's such a
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
nice cornerstone to
 
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:20.240 align:start position:0%
public trust and the fidelity of our
 
00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
elections i i would hope that the
 
00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
concept would be
 
00:12:24.800 --> 00:12:26.310 align:start position:0%
concept would be
appreciated

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
appreciated
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
in and if we were uh if this bill were
 
00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
to be retained so that we could work out
 
00:12:34.150 --> 00:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
details with the secretary of state i i
 
00:12:35.990 --> 00:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
would i would love to work with my
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
friend mr scanlon and my new friend ms
 
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
sumner to to figure out uh how to
 
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.710 align:start position:0%
sumner to to figure out uh how to
uh

00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
you know round the square
 
00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.230 align:start position:0%
you know round the square
so

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
with that uh i'll take questions if
 
00:12:53.590 --> 00:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
there are any i'll probably end up
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
deferring to ms sumner though
 
00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:57.509 align:start position:0%
deferring to ms sumner though
okay

00:12:57.509 --> 00:12:57.519 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:13:01.030 --> 00:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
questions for representative edwards
 
00:13:04.550 --> 00:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
so people in here meanwhile or online
 
00:13:06.550 --> 00:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative ward
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for taking my
 
00:13:09.519 --> 00:13:10.629 align:start position:0%
representative edwards for taking my
question

00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a number of cities where
 
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:13.670 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a number of cities where
you

00:13:13.670 --> 00:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:13:16.069 --> 00:13:16.079 align:start position:0%
mentioned irregularities in a viewing in
 
00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
viewing the
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
ballots and so forth could you provide
 
00:13:21.910 --> 00:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
your source and cite a few specific
 
00:13:25.829 --> 00:13:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
i i certainly can um
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
but i i think it's a
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
common public knowledge that's out in
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
the public domain
 
00:13:37.990 --> 00:13:38.000 align:start position:0%
that we've seen videos of
 
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.949 align:start position:0%
that we've seen videos of
people

00:13:38.949 --> 00:13:38.959 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
at the polls
 
00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:41.990 align:start position:0%
at the polls
um

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:44.320 align:start position:0%
segregating poll watchers
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
putting them behind lines where
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
they that were not typical for that
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
polling site and and and rendering them
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
unable to uh participate as a poll
 
00:13:57.030 --> 00:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
watcher and so
 
00:13:59.910 --> 00:13:59.920 align:start position:0%
i i i won't be providing examples
 
00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
because i don't want to create
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
a controversy over trump
 
00:14:07.829 --> 00:14:07.839 align:start position:0%
this is not about trump this is about
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:13.199 align:start position:0%
and making sure that we anticipate
 
00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
potential problems
 
00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.110 align:start position:0%
potential problems
and

00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
provide for a safety valve
 
00:14:23.189 --> 00:14:23.199 align:start position:0%
should those problems ever occur here
 
00:14:26.150 --> 00:14:26.160 align:start position:0%
and follow up mr chair
 
00:14:27.430 --> 00:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:28.310 align:start position:0%
yes okay
just

00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
be very helpful to the committee i think
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
if you could cite where you saw these
 
00:14:31.839 --> 00:14:33.350 align:start position:0%
if you could cite where you saw these
videos

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
videos
 
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
can you do that
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
you know i don't think i will and and
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
the reason i don't think i will is
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
because i think it just opens up a level
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
of distraction
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
um and and i think we just should stay
 
00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:46.949 align:start position:0%
um and and i think we just should stay
focused

00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
focused
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
on uh the potential or the or the value
 
00:14:53.110 --> 00:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
that we can see implicitly
 
00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
in allowing public transparency we have
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
91a for a reason it's because the state
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
has a strong belief in
 
00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
corporate access to records and
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
transparencies and the in the vast range
 
00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:08.160 align:start position:0%
of benefits that are brought about by
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
uh having transparency in our governing
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
processes and so we're we're taking a
 
00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:16.160 align:start position:0%
very well understood aspect of new
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire's culture
 
00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:18.629 align:start position:0%
hampshire's culture
and

00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
injecting it a little deeper into the
 
00:15:24.389 --> 00:15:24.399 align:start position:0%
way in which we conduct our elections
 
00:15:27.269 --> 00:15:27.279 align:start position:0%
and i i think i think uh that ought to
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
be sufficient
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:33.750 --> 00:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you so representative bergeron
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
oh well remember how i can do it for us
 
00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:39.360 align:start position:0%
sorry oh thank thank you i i that either
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
way it's fine thank you so much mr chair
 
00:15:43.269 --> 00:15:43.279 align:start position:0%
and um thank you representative edwards
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
for taking my question too i
 
00:15:46.870 --> 00:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to um
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
revisit that statement i think i heard
 
00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:50.240 align:start position:0%
you say which is that this bill is
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
trying to solve problems that exist in
 
00:15:53.110 --> 00:15:53.120 align:start position:0%
other parts of the country but that
 
00:15:54.949 --> 00:15:54.959 align:start position:0%
don't exist in new hampshire is did i
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:00.310 --> 00:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
you could you could have heard what i
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
said and interpreted it in that way
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
that's a that's not a bad interpretation
 
00:16:06.949 --> 00:16:06.959 align:start position:0%
but so i appreciate the question and the
 
00:16:09.590 --> 00:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify
 
00:16:11.430 --> 00:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
and let's let's bring this home a little
 
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:12.870 align:start position:0%
and let's let's bring this home a little
bit

00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
bit
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
we know
 
00:16:17.189 --> 00:16:17.199 align:start position:0%
that there's great public concern
 
00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
about the votes in windham in november
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
we know this
 
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
because we pay attention to the media
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
and we know that the senate thought it
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
was so important that they passed a bill
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
24 to nothing to take a deeper look at
 
00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
what it what what on and window
 
00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
now why do we know that there was even a
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
problem in wyndham we know because
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
it happened
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the erroneous vote vote tallies
 
00:16:46.870 --> 00:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
were so close that one of the
 
00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
candidates requested a recount
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
had a recount not been requested or not
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
been appropriate
 
00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.310 align:start position:0%
been appropriate
the

00:16:56.310 --> 00:16:56.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:56.320 --> 00:16:58.310 align:start position:0%
the
obvious

00:16:58.310 --> 00:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
obvious
 
00:17:00.629 --> 00:17:00.639 align:start position:0%
issues in windham would not have been
 
00:17:03.509 --> 00:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
exposed to the public
 
00:17:05.750 --> 00:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
um i know that there were people
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
in windham who've been watching uh the
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
results of their elections for years and
 
00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640 align:start position:0%
years who
 
00:17:14.309 --> 00:17:14.319 align:start position:0%
that night of the election when they saw
 
00:17:15.990 --> 00:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
the results they believed something was
 
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.669 align:start position:0%
the results they believed something was
wrong

00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:17:19.429 --> 00:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
there not been a recount they never
 
00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
would have gotten satisfaction to their
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
question so this opens up
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
again a safety valve
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
to just make sure that our citizens have
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to verify
 
00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.590 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to verify
results

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
results
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
and you know there's a saying you know
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
trust but verify
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
i i think in new hampshire we're able to
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
lend our election officials across the
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
state a great deal of trust
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
but there are those situations where
 
00:17:51.669 --> 00:17:51.679 align:start position:0%
the verification
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
process potential
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
is is would be beneficial i hope that
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
answers your question sir
 
00:18:05.029 --> 00:18:05.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman representative
 
00:18:09.909 --> 00:18:09.919 align:start position:0%
edwards said a couple quick questions if
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
i may
 
00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
i may
um

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
supposing some individuals came in to
 
00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
examine the ballots and they did their
 
00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.750 align:start position:0%
examine the ballots and they did their
own

00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
own
 
00:18:20.150 --> 00:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
count of ballots cast for a race or
 
00:18:22.150 --> 00:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
multiple races
 
00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
in a ward i come from nashua
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
and they come up with a number that's
 
00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.549 align:start position:0%
and they come up with a number that's
different

00:18:28.549 --> 00:18:28.559 align:start position:0%
different
 
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:30.640 align:start position:0%
than what was reported on the official
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
return of votes form
 
00:18:35.430 --> 00:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
there's no saying it's accurate
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
but what happens if then these folks
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
go to the press and say well we found a
 
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:42.400 align:start position:0%
different number
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
than was recorded with the secretary of
 
00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.669 align:start position:0%
than was recorded with the secretary of
state

00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
the information's out there the claim is
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
out there but what happens next
 
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
well so
 
00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
that's a great question really a great
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
question and and it could be really uh
 
00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:00.390 align:start position:0%
question and and it could be really uh
stimulative

00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
stimulative
 
00:19:03.510 --> 00:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
of of some discussion around a potential
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
amendment to this bill and speaks to
 
00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
why retaining it might be the right
 
00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:19:13.909 --> 00:19:13.919 align:start position:0%
um the in the first instance even before
 
00:19:15.510 --> 00:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
we get to to
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the heart of your question
 
00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.390 align:start position:0%
to the heart of your question
is

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
if there really is
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
has been a problem
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
is society benefited by ignorance
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
if there was a problem but nobody is
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
aware of it are we better off than we
 
00:19:34.470 --> 00:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
would be if we knew there was a problem
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
or thought there was a problem and it
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
gave us something actionable to look at
 
00:19:41.110 --> 00:19:41.120 align:start position:0%
and i would say
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
that i am
 
00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.230 align:start position:0%
that i am
anti-ignorance

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
anti-ignorance
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
i am pro
 
00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:47.830 align:start position:0%
i am pro
information

00:19:47.830 --> 00:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:50.160 align:start position:0%
and if they do the count we have
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
additional relevant important
 
00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
additional relevant important
information

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:19:56.789 --> 00:19:56.799 align:start position:0%
what we do with that information
 
00:19:59.430 --> 00:19:59.440 align:start position:0%
i think would depend on
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
a number of factors that get into a
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of hypotheticals that i i don't
 
00:20:07.350 --> 00:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
know if i can address on the fly
 
00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
but if uh it's a credible enough set of
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
information to where it appears as
 
00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.070 align:start position:0%
information to where it appears as
though

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:20:15.669 --> 00:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
00:20:18.870 --> 00:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
serious errors or or crime occurred then
 
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
i imagine the ag office could step in at
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
that point and conduct a separate
 
00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.870 align:start position:0%
that point and conduct a separate
investigation

00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:25.750 align:start position:0%
investigation
but

00:20:25.750 --> 00:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:29.430 --> 00:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
i i prefer sunlight i i prefer
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
information over ignorance and i think
 
00:20:36.310 --> 00:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
we could figure out what to do
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
with that information
 
00:20:41.110 --> 00:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
either prospectively as we look at this
 
00:20:42.789 --> 00:20:42.799 align:start position:0%
bill or
 
00:20:44.870 --> 00:20:44.880 align:start position:0%
maybe in the years to come as we have
 
00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
some experience with
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
it for the question mr chairman
 
00:20:53.029 --> 00:20:53.039 align:start position:0%
okay and and this is my last question
 
00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:55.350 align:start position:0%
okay and and this is my last question
um

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:55.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:57.350 --> 00:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
the bill says that towns and cities may
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
request reimbursement of additional
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
expenses i'm not quite sure what
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
additional expenses means but
 
00:21:06.470 --> 00:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
i would estimate in nashua for
 
00:21:09.029 --> 00:21:09.039 align:start position:0%
individuals to come into city hall
 
00:21:09.039 --> 00:21:10.870 align:start position:0%
individuals to come into city hall
examine

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
examine
 
00:21:12.710 --> 00:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
ballots for four hours for whatever
 
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.070 align:start position:0%
ballots for four hours for whatever
purpose

00:21:14.070 --> 00:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:15.520 align:start position:0%
the city clerk would probably have to
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
have three people on staff to
 
00:21:20.870 --> 00:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
assist them and monitor their behavior
 
00:21:23.350 --> 00:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
uh so the cost could prob and and the
 
00:21:25.350 --> 00:21:25.360 align:start position:0%
ballot boxes would have to be retrieved
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
and returned from off-site storage
 
00:21:30.549 --> 00:21:30.559 align:start position:0%
um i would expect that the cost would be
 
00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
about five hundred dollars for a
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
four-hour uh block of time
 
00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:35.830 align:start position:0%
four-hour uh block of time
uh

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
and and this can be done multiple times
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
for the same ballots by different people
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
over the course of 22 months in the case
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
of a federal election
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
so who's going to pay for it
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
should it be the people requesting
 
00:21:50.390 --> 00:21:50.400 align:start position:0%
access to the ballot should it be the
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
towns and cities should it be the
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.440 align:start position:0%
you know i'm i'm not exactly sure what's
 
00:22:00.870 --> 00:22:00.880 align:start position:0%
in uh what 480 says to that particular
 
00:22:04.390 --> 00:22:04.400 align:start position:0%
question of who pays i think it cites
 
00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:06.310 align:start position:0%
question of who pays i think it cites
um

00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
some fund
 
00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039 align:start position:0%
that's at the state level that i haven't
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
double checked to make sure that that is
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
a funded line and how much money is in
 
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
a funded line and how much money is in
there

00:22:16.310 --> 00:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:22:18.149 --> 00:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
uh i i would think that if i were
 
00:22:19.990 --> 00:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
sitting down and working it out with you
 
00:22:22.230 --> 00:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
i would i would want
 
00:22:25.830 --> 00:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
um the people requesting the survey uh
 
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
or the the review of the ballots to to
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
have a substantial if not 100
 
00:22:35.029 --> 00:22:35.039 align:start position:0%
uh requirement to pay for the
 
00:22:36.789 --> 00:22:36.799 align:start position:0%
incremental costs
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
and i would want some assurance that the
 
00:22:42.789 --> 00:22:42.799 align:start position:0%
costs uh were indeed fair
 
00:22:46.149 --> 00:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
and incremental and and not intended to
 
00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
be so high
 
00:22:49.590 --> 00:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
that nobody ever challenged it so
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
there's there
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
you'd have to walk i think a line there
 
00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:55.510 align:start position:0%
you'd have to walk i think a line there
to

00:22:55.510 --> 00:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
protect the taxpayer and also protect
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
the right of the public for access
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative edwards
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:23:06.950 --> 00:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
anyone else any other committee members
 
00:23:08.789 --> 00:23:08.799 align:start position:0%
wish to ask representative edwards a
 
00:23:11.350 --> 00:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
question on this
 
00:23:12.870 --> 00:23:12.880 align:start position:0%
when you're in the committee room anyone
 
00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:15.350 align:start position:0%
when you're in the committee room anyone
online

00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:16.950 --> 00:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
seeing john i guess we're all set
 
00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much yes
 
00:23:21.029 --> 00:23:21.039 align:start position:0%
sir thank you uh and thank you to the
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee thank you
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
and uh to nominate a seminar uh if you'd
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
like to testify i'd already upgraded you
 
00:23:31.669 --> 00:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
if you want to run you you may proceed
 
00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
yes okay
 
00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.590 align:start position:0%
yes okay
um

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes um deborah sumner and um i would say
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
that in
 
00:23:43.990 --> 00:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
tries we have actually made some
 
00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:45.270 align:start position:0%
tries we have actually made some
progress

00:23:45.270 --> 00:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
progress
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
and i think if representative cody
 
00:23:50.390 --> 00:23:50.400 align:start position:0%
remembers my first try
 
00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:51.190 align:start position:0%
remembers my first try
i

00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:54.960 align:start position:0%
i spoke way too long and he was very um
 
00:23:58.070 --> 00:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
very polite and finally wrapping me up
 
00:23:59.750 --> 00:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
so i've learned to read most of my
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
testimony from from then on
 
00:24:04.710 --> 00:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
so if you have copies of my testimony
 
00:24:06.630 --> 00:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
what i'll try to do is skip through and
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
try to um
 
00:24:10.230 --> 00:24:10.240 align:start position:0%
representative edwards did a wonderful
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
job i i would like to hire him
 
00:24:15.669 --> 00:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
to do my presentations next year thank
 
00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:17.600 align:start position:0%
you very much representative edwards
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
that was very impressive i think you
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
know a lot more than you think you do
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
about this subject
 
00:24:25.029 --> 00:24:25.039 align:start position:0%
okay so i'll skip my introduction and i
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
would just say um i've been to state
 
00:24:29.510 --> 00:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
court twice to ask to review ballots in
 
00:24:32.390 --> 00:24:32.400 align:start position:0%
my town for november 2010
 
00:24:34.470 --> 00:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
and november 2012
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
if i'd been able to raise 10 to 15 000
 
00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
to pay an attorney i would have asked to
 
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
review ballots for one questionable
 
00:24:45.029 --> 00:24:45.039 align:start position:0%
contest in november 2016.
 
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:48.320 align:start position:0%
okay yes election transparency
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
representative edwards already dealt
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
with that election transparency equals
 
00:24:55.029 --> 00:24:55.039 align:start position:0%
trust in elections trusting government
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
so we say we believe in transparency but
 
00:24:59.430 --> 00:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
what does that actually mean when we
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
look at ballots that are counted inside
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
a computer
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
instead of required to be voted to be
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
founded in public as our constitution
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
and law is required
 
00:25:13.110 --> 00:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
so i hope the legislature will expect
 
00:25:15.029 --> 00:25:15.039 align:start position:0%
and direct the secretary of state to
 
00:25:16.310 --> 00:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
shift from his
 
00:25:19.590 --> 00:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
power over style of winning at any cost
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
to one of power with emphasis in
 
00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
cooperation problem solving with local
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
communities and citizens
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
the likely result would be better use of
 
00:25:31.029 --> 00:25:31.039 align:start position:0%
all of our time energy and money and
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
elections we voters have reason to trust
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
and be proud of
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
developing mutual trust and respect
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
between citizens and our government
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
needs work on both sides and we
 
00:25:43.269 --> 00:25:43.279 align:start position:0%
acknowledge that
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
if you directed mr scanlon to work with
 
00:25:47.750 --> 00:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
me and representative edwards on
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
specific language i believe we can
 
00:25:51.590 --> 00:25:51.600 align:start position:0%
easily resolve the three remaining
 
00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.789 align:start position:0%
easily resolve the three remaining
concerns

00:25:52.789 --> 00:25:52.799 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
00:25:55.510 --> 00:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
from hb 1390 which was sent to study
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
committee last year
 
00:25:59.909 --> 00:25:59.919 align:start position:0%
uh vote buying intimidation schemes
 
00:26:02.310 --> 00:26:02.320 align:start position:0%
security of voted ballots
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
good policy question mark
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
so i'll skip through one and two you can
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
read that i think those are really
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
non-issues that are resolvable with
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
just compliance with current law
 
00:26:16.710 --> 00:26:16.720 align:start position:0%
so number three
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
mr scanlon believes hiding evidence of
 
00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
problems in our elections including the
 
00:26:23.430 --> 00:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
possibility fraud occurred is good
 
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.549 align:start position:0%
possibility fraud occurred is good
policy

00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
policy
 
00:26:27.750 --> 00:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
i strongly disagree and i find no basis
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
for that position in our constitution
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
laws are what defines good policy
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
in states where ballots are public
 
00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:35.909 align:start position:0%
in states where ballots are public
records

00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
records
 
00:26:38.070 --> 00:26:38.080 align:start position:0%
citizens have found problems and can
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
make recommendations to policymakers of
 
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
how to fix them
 
00:26:44.149 --> 00:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
elections belong to the public
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
without information we can't do our job
 
00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
as citizens
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
our right to know is our right to truth
 
00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
and a protected protected free speech
 
00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:53.350 align:start position:0%
and a protected protected free speech
right

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
policy makers are deprived of accurate
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
information to make good public policy
 
00:27:01.990 --> 00:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
and this is something that i think is um
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
common to people who are involved with
 
00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
right to know issues we are seen as the
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
enemy of government we citizens are
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
often seen as the enemy that we are
 
00:27:12.630 --> 00:27:12.640 align:start position:0%
troublemakers instead of starting to
 
00:27:15.430 --> 00:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
work in partnership to make things
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
better for all of us to start having
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
more of a cooperative instead of an
 
00:27:22.070 --> 00:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
adversarial relationship so this is not
 
00:27:24.390 --> 00:27:24.400 align:start position:0%
unique to this particular situation this
 
00:27:26.230 --> 00:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
is an issue we are trying to deal with
 
00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:28.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the with right to know
 
00:27:31.110 --> 00:27:31.120 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
 
00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:31.830 align:start position:0%
throughout the state
so

00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:33.600 align:start position:0%
examples of
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
how um citizens how we can do better
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
make get use information cooperatively
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
and make better choices
 
00:27:43.510 --> 00:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
we know that dust in the scanner can
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
cause false overvote readings because in
 
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:48.240 align:start position:0%
wisconsin where ballots and images are
 
00:27:50.950 --> 00:27:50.960 align:start position:0%
public records citizens investigated
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
that issue
 
00:27:55.269 --> 00:27:55.279 align:start position:0%
number two specific to new hampshire the
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
sos mag successfully argued against the
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
court granting the access to november
 
00:28:04.230 --> 00:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
2012 jaffrey ballots that showed a 2.5
 
00:28:06.549 --> 00:28:06.559 align:start position:0%
over voted ballot rate if i had been
 
00:28:08.549 --> 00:28:08.559 align:start position:0%
able to look at ballots i knew if two
 
00:28:11.190 --> 00:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
fraud possibilities at that time i know
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
of four now
 
00:28:14.389 --> 00:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
i might have
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
i might have found no evidence of fraud
 
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:20.320 align:start position:0%
but that voter intent on 68 of the 71
 
00:28:22.789 --> 00:28:22.799 align:start position:0%
ballot showed they contained legal votes
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
that would have been counted in a hand
 
00:28:27.269 --> 00:28:27.279 align:start position:0%
count town or recount i could have come
 
00:28:30.389 --> 00:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
to you sooner than 2018 and maybe that
 
00:28:32.070 --> 00:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
problem could have been corrected
 
00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:33.830 align:start position:0%
problem could have been corrected
earlier

00:28:33.830 --> 00:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
in his recent testimony on
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
sb-79 mr scanlon acknowledged two to two
 
00:28:43.269 --> 00:28:43.279 align:start position:0%
to three percent of votes not counted by
 
00:28:44.470 --> 00:28:44.480 align:start position:0%
the scanner
 
00:28:46.389 --> 00:28:46.399 align:start position:0%
are legal votes
 
00:28:49.029 --> 00:28:49.039 align:start position:0%
and hb 491 which will be your next
 
00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:51.600 align:start position:0%
hearing will attempt to correct that
 
00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:52.950 align:start position:0%
hearing will attempt to correct that
problem

00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:28:54.630 --> 00:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has been asked to
 
00:28:57.269 --> 00:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
investigate specific issues in windham
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
and derry from november 2020 election
 
00:29:02.789 --> 00:29:02.799 align:start position:0%
but seems to be confused about his
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
statutory authority to do so
 
00:29:08.789 --> 00:29:08.799 align:start position:0%
citizens and local citizens
 
00:29:10.870 --> 00:29:10.880 align:start position:0%
should be able to investigate election
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
questions themselves because elections
 
00:29:16.149 --> 00:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
are under public local control and the
 
00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility of each community
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk more about the overvote
 
00:29:20.559 --> 00:29:21.990 align:start position:0%
and we'll talk more about the overvote
situation

00:29:21.990 --> 00:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
in dairy in the next hearing
 
00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
these two links regarding the 2010
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
governor's race in bridgeport
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
connecticut showed how bridgeport
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
officials the media and citizens work
 
00:29:36.149 --> 00:29:36.159 align:start position:0%
together to investigate and recommend
 
00:29:38.549 --> 00:29:38.559 align:start position:0%
improvements including better training
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
more time for officials to determine and
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
report results and election law
 
00:29:45.830 --> 00:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement they found no evidence of
 
00:29:49.269 --> 00:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay the better idea which i've
 
00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned to our representative edwards
 
00:29:55.669 --> 00:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
but we decided to just bring it to your
 
00:29:57.990 --> 00:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
attention and we'll see what you think
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
um this is
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
an idea from a house judiciary committee
 
00:30:02.870 --> 00:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
member um
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
he suggested it it adds two lines to rsa
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
91 a five
 
00:30:12.149 --> 00:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with the exemptions
 
00:30:14.070 --> 00:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
ballot shall not be available for public
 
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
inspection until after the recount
 
00:30:18.149 --> 00:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
period or any legal challenge to an
 
00:30:20.070 --> 00:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
election has ended
 
00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
the records custodian may request that
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
the attorney general or secretary of
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
state personnel supervise the review
 
00:30:29.669 --> 00:30:29.679 align:start position:0%
that would allow local officials the
 
00:30:31.750 --> 00:30:31.760 align:start position:0%
option of asking for the attorney
 
00:30:34.630 --> 00:30:34.640 align:start position:0%
general or super sos to supervise the
 
00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:36.799 align:start position:0%
review that will address both one and
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
two of the secretary of state's concerns
 
00:30:42.149 --> 00:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
and allow very busy town city clerks to
 
00:30:45.269 --> 00:30:45.279 align:start position:0%
attend to their other important duties
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
rsa already deals with exemptions for
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate privacy reasons towns and
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
cities have processes in place to deal
 
00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
with public records requests and there's
 
00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:56.240 align:start position:0%
no question that our right to know is a
 
00:30:58.789 --> 00:30:58.799 align:start position:0%
burden for public officials again i'm a
 
00:31:00.470 --> 00:31:00.480 align:start position:0%
former reporter so i know it from that
 
00:31:02.950 --> 00:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
perspective as well
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
but our job is citizens
 
00:31:05.840 --> 00:31:06.950 align:start position:0%
but our job is citizens
and

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
our job
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
as citizens and government is to
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
continually work to make this less
 
00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:13.590 align:start position:0%
continually work to make this less
burdensome

00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
burdensome
 
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
and with electronic records um that's
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
becoming more and more possible
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately
 
00:31:20.559 --> 00:31:22.070 align:start position:0%
uh unfortunately
without

00:31:22.070 --> 00:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
without
 
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
the light shining things can happen that
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we are an essential check and
 
00:31:29.830 --> 00:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
balance in keeping uh government open
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
and accountable even though we can be a
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
pain at times and we acknowledge that
 
00:31:38.470 --> 00:31:38.480 align:start position:0%
and we can try to do better on that too
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
i've included information from last
 
00:31:42.389 --> 00:31:42.399 align:start position:0%
year's testimony at the end and i'll
 
00:31:45.669 --> 00:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
just skip to the very last paragraph on
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
page four
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
about why
 
00:31:51.269 --> 00:31:51.279 align:start position:0%
ballots were exempted in new hampshire
 
00:31:54.470 --> 00:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
after the march 2016 supreme opinion in
 
00:31:56.789 --> 00:31:56.799 align:start position:0%
my case i found evidence of why dave
 
00:31:58.789 --> 00:31:58.799 align:start position:0%
scanlon and bud fitch
 
00:32:02.230 --> 00:32:02.240 align:start position:0%
wanted ballots removed from rsa 91a in
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
legislative history for another 2003
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
however required bill h.b 577.
 
00:32:10.630 --> 00:32:10.640 align:start position:0%
they said a superior court had granted
 
00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
the petitioner access to ballots because
 
00:32:14.870 --> 00:32:14.880 align:start position:0%
they hadn't been exempted that was the
 
00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:15.990 align:start position:0%
they hadn't been exempted that was the
reason

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
the senate sponsor of the non-german
 
00:32:21.509 --> 00:32:21.519 align:start position:0%
amendment to h.b 627 misled the senate
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
saying it was needed to comply with
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
federal law
 
00:32:27.029 --> 00:32:27.039 align:start position:0%
probably most legislators and no one in
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
the public were aware it had been added
 
00:32:32.149 --> 00:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
after the public hearing on the bill so
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%
there was no specific reason
 
00:32:37.110 --> 00:32:37.120 align:start position:0%
um for re-exempting them in the first
 
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
place all right so it was right to know
 
00:32:41.669 --> 00:32:41.679 align:start position:0%
if anybody has
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
some experience with that you need to
 
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
have a good reason to exempt
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
a record you can't just do it because
 
00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:49.840 align:start position:0%
it's inconvenient
 
00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:52.080 align:start position:0%
or it might cause some embarrassment if
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
someone found something that some
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
official didn't want them to find all
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
right so this that there has to be a
 
00:32:59.909 --> 00:32:59.919 align:start position:0%
good reason if you're going to exempt
 
00:33:03.830 --> 00:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
something any any it public records
 
00:33:03.840 --> 00:33:05.669 align:start position:0%
something any any it public records
um

00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:05.679 --> 00:33:06.630 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
i've added a link that summarizes how
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
other states are dealing with ballots
 
00:33:20.950 --> 00:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
and images as public records
 
00:33:23.830 --> 00:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
um and in some states by the way there
 
00:33:25.909 --> 00:33:25.919 align:start position:0%
they are traceable to
 
00:33:27.830 --> 00:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
to voters because there are bar codes
 
00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:30.080 align:start position:0%
that are added to ballots to keep track
 
00:33:31.509 --> 00:33:31.519 align:start position:0%
of the ballots
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
and especially on mailing
 
00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
ballots so that could be a privacy
 
00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:36.710 align:start position:0%
ballots so that could be a privacy
reason

00:33:36.710 --> 00:33:36.720 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:33:38.470 --> 00:33:38.480 align:start position:0%
that's being contested because it should
 
00:33:40.389 --> 00:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
there should not be any way to trace any
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
ballot to a voter we don't have to have
 
00:33:44.230 --> 00:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
that problem in new hampshire but that
 
00:33:46.710 --> 00:33:46.720 align:start position:0%
is why some states specifically like
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
washington state has exempted ballots
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
from public records because they are
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
traceable to voters because of the
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
the bar codes on the on the ballots
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
um all right so if you care about public
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
trust in our elections and in government
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
i know we can make this work
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
so um is there any questions
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr any questions and committee
 
00:34:14.069 --> 00:34:14.079 align:start position:0%
members here in the world
 
00:34:16.550 --> 00:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from our members of
 
00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
participating remote
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
could i just add one more um
 
00:34:24.470 --> 00:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
response to our representative
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
bergeron's question earlier in terms of
 
00:34:28.550 --> 00:34:28.560 align:start position:0%
what happens if you find a different
 
00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:29.430 align:start position:0%
what happens if you find a different
number

00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
um that happens at times okay the the
 
00:34:34.149 --> 00:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
ballots that are public records
 
00:34:37.030 --> 00:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes they will find discrepancies
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
um you know again what you would hope
 
00:34:40.869 --> 00:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
people would do with that information is
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
then go to your officials see if you can
 
00:34:46.550 --> 00:34:46.560 align:start position:0%
figure out why there was a discrepancy
 
00:34:48.710 --> 00:34:48.720 align:start position:0%
and remember the ballots are your facts
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
okay i mean two different people count
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
the same ballots and get different
 
00:34:55.510 --> 00:34:55.520 align:start position:0%
numbers okay that can happen a few all
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
right you could be off by a few but if
 
00:35:00.069 --> 00:35:00.079 align:start position:0%
you're finding a significant discrepancy
 
00:35:02.310 --> 00:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
in that count you would hope people
 
00:35:04.870 --> 00:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
would go to your people like what
 
00:35:06.870 --> 00:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
they've tried to do in wyndham to figure
 
00:35:08.950 --> 00:35:08.960 align:start position:0%
out what happened there it's like what
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
we would like to find out with in derry
 
00:35:13.910 --> 00:35:13.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of those overvoted ballots why
 
00:35:16.390 --> 00:35:16.400 align:start position:0%
are were there so many and can we do
 
00:35:17.990 --> 00:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
something to prevent it from happening
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
again we're not going to try to contest
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
an election
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
and the only way you can overturn an
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
election by the way is if there is
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraud and if there is
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
evidence of fraud i'm not going to be
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
able to bring that case it would be the
 
00:35:34.069 --> 00:35:34.079 align:start position:0%
party of the person who feels that they
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
are affected by that
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
discovery that would then take action on
 
00:35:40.630 --> 00:35:40.640 align:start position:0%
that we have processes in place to deal
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
with each of these questions and what we
 
00:35:45.109 --> 00:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
need to do is see are we really going to
 
00:35:47.990 --> 00:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
have a problem with opening up ballots
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
as public records in new hampshire i
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
mean vermont doesn't have a problem they
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
have one person a year
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's looking
 
00:35:58.310 --> 00:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
asking to look at balance for research
 
00:35:58.320 --> 00:35:59.589 align:start position:0%
asking to look at balance for research
purposes

00:35:59.589 --> 00:35:59.599 align:start position:0%
purposes
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't have to be a problem all
 
00:36:03.990 --> 00:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
right and what we need to do is find
 
00:36:06.790 --> 00:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
cooperative ways of working together to
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
make it something that's positive as
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
opposed to negative
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
thank you miss sumner i think you've
 
00:36:13.990 --> 00:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
covered that subject matter very well
 
00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.870 align:start position:0%
covered that subject matter very well
and

00:36:14.870 --> 00:36:14.880 align:start position:0%

ease
 
00:37:48.630 --> 00:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
election integrity is a crucial part of
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
a functioning government
 
00:37:52.630 --> 00:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
more transparency leads to more
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
accountability which in turn instills
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
trust without transparency and
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
accountability granite staters will lose
 
00:38:03.750 --> 00:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
the last vestiges of trust in the system
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire constitution says our
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
government shall be open accessible
 
00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
transparent and responsive
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
in 1977 the legislature added a preamble
 
00:38:18.470 --> 00:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
to that statement saying
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
openness and the conduct of public
 
00:38:24.069 --> 00:38:24.079 align:start position:0%
business is essential to a democratic
 
00:38:26.310 --> 00:38:26.320 align:start position:0%
society the purpose of this chapter
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
that's 91.8 is to ensure both the
 
00:38:32.710 --> 00:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
greatest possible public access to the
 
00:38:36.870 --> 00:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
actions discussions and records of all
 
00:38:39.670 --> 00:38:39.680 align:start position:0%
public bodies and their accountability
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
to the people
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
house bill 480 increases accountability
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
by increasing checks and balances
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
in night uh in 2018 i was the republican
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
candidate for state senate in district
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
20. during the primary the libertarian
 
00:38:57.910 --> 00:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
party launched a writing campaign
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
meaning if i got 30 write-ins i would
 
00:39:03.270 --> 00:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
appear as a fusion candidate on both the
 
00:39:06.069 --> 00:39:06.079 align:start position:0%
republican and libertarian
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
as the you know republican libertarian
 
00:39:11.430 --> 00:39:11.440 align:start position:0%
candidate on the election ballot
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
district 20 has six wards and i picked
 
00:39:16.950 --> 00:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
up about 20 something write-ins in five
 
00:39:20.310 --> 00:39:20.320 align:start position:0%
of the wards but i only got one write-in
 
00:39:23.430 --> 00:39:23.440 align:start position:0%
in board 11 which is my home ward and i
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
know a lot of voters there and i knew
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
people were writing me it so it was
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
clear to me
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
that when ward 11's results came in
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
something was horribly a mess
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
i filed for a recount and yes something
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
was a miss the moderators somehow failed
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
to record any of the write-ins correctly
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
and i did in fact receive enough votes
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
to qualify as a fusion candidate
 
00:39:50.950 --> 00:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
my question was why were there write-in
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
votes that were recorded incorrectly i'm
 
00:39:56.230 --> 00:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
sure it was as everyone else says a
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
mistake or an oversight or something
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
went wrong and fortunately the checks
 
00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
and balances that we had in place
 
00:40:05.990 --> 00:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
because of the recount did mean that we
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
caught the problem
 
00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
but why did the system fail in the first
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
place why was the original tally wrong
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
and how often does this happen and where
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
does it happen
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
everyone on this committee
 
00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
is aware of the current investigation of
 
00:40:24.470 --> 00:40:24.480 align:start position:0%
the wyndham incident where more than 300
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
votes for were found for each of three
 
00:40:30.550 --> 00:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
republican candidates during a recount
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
much like in my case this raises more
 
00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
questions than it answers
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
house bill 480 will help address these
 
00:40:40.550 --> 00:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
sorts of troubling scenarios by allowing
 
00:40:44.069 --> 00:40:44.079 align:start position:0%
follow-up audits by ordinary concerned
 
00:40:46.630 --> 00:40:46.640 align:start position:0%
citizens by our granite staters who are
 
00:40:49.349 --> 00:40:49.359 align:start position:0%
registered voters and this will help us
 
00:40:52.230 --> 00:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
have the most unimpeachable and solid
 
00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839 align:start position:0%
election process
 
00:40:56.230 --> 00:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
this would help us to identify say if
 
00:40:58.550 --> 00:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
there's an isolated polling station
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
where there's a problem or maybe there
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
is you know some kind of repeat offender
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
and part of this goal of this bill is to
 
00:41:09.510 --> 00:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
ensure the accuracy of the vote count
 
00:41:13.109 --> 00:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
and to evaluate the performance of
 
00:41:15.990 --> 00:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
election officials in other words it's a
 
00:41:18.790 --> 00:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
check and balance on the check and
 
00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
balance that the recount already gives
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
us it gives us that opportunity to see
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
if there's weird and strange stuff
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
happening it seems like this seems to be
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
happening more and more so i think the
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
time is now to try and pass this bill
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
obviously increasing transparency serves
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
accountability and trust so let's
 
00:41:41.910 --> 00:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
empower our citizens let's empower our
 
00:41:44.710 --> 00:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
granite staters to exercise their own
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
audits to ensure that that trust remains
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
um i want to address one question that
 
00:41:53.270 --> 00:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
came up from the gentleman from nashua
 
00:41:55.109 --> 00:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
um and sort of something that deborah
 
00:41:56.790 --> 00:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
summers said as well
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh regarding this this notion i think
 
00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:02.720 align:start position:0%
you know there's this this idea now that
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
people who want government to be open
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
and transparent are troublemakers and i
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
think we do need to move beyond that i
 
00:42:11.430 --> 00:42:11.440 align:start position:0%
know certainly in nashua there is a sort
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
of conflict that's going on right now uh
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
which i think you know leads to that
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
idea of this has to be so expensive i
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
think that if we work with municipal we
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
can actually you know if we just pivot
 
00:42:24.390 --> 00:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
the way people look at this instead of
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
saying it's this head-to-head thing but
 
00:42:28.390 --> 00:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
rather hey guys we're all in the same
 
00:42:30.790 --> 00:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
boat let's see if we can you know get
 
00:42:32.710 --> 00:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
the real information to get the real
 
00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
answer but to the question of costs
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
maybe one thing the committee could
 
00:42:37.680 --> 00:42:39.030 align:start position:0%
maybe one thing the committee could
consider

00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
is um to say
 
00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:43.200 align:start position:0%
to build in some kind of incentive
 
00:42:45.750 --> 00:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
structure so basically if there is a
 
00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:47.270 align:start position:0%
structure so basically if there is a
discrepancy

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
discrepancy
 
00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
in the vote count then the state must
 
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:50.870 align:start position:0%
in the vote count then the state must
pay

00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
but if there is no discrepancy found
 
00:42:54.870 --> 00:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
maybe there's a flat fee that the
 
00:42:57.270 --> 00:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
citizen group or the citizen must pay
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
this might be a way that you would both
 
00:43:02.069 --> 00:43:02.079 align:start position:0%
uh sort of counteract just willy-nilly
 
00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:04.160 align:start position:0%
you know people just going in and filing
 
00:43:06.790 --> 00:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
these audits for no apparent reason so
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
it would create the right incentive
 
00:43:10.390 --> 00:43:10.400 align:start position:0%
structure so that people
 
00:43:11.990 --> 00:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh you know would have to really think
 
00:43:14.230 --> 00:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
about does you know is there a reason
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
why we would do this audit in this case
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
um so that's pretty much where i'm at i
 
00:43:23.589 --> 00:43:23.599 align:start position:0%
ask you to please support house bill 480
 
00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:25.520 align:start position:0%
to increase the election transparency
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
accountability and trust i thank you for
 
00:43:29.030 --> 00:43:29.040 align:start position:0%
your time and i'm happy to take
 
00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.069 align:start position:0%
your time and i'm happy to take
questions

00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
questions from ms garrett from committee

other um
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
a lot of them mentioned recently about
 
00:43:46.630 --> 00:43:46.640 align:start position:0%
the price of this
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
what do you think is the price of people
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
not having faith in our elections
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
i mean it's priceless or
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know integrity in our government
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
systems is is what you know greases the
 
00:44:00.790 --> 00:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
wheels and makes everything work so i i
 
00:44:07.109 --> 00:44:07.119 align:start position:0%

i just uh my name is alvin c i live in
 
00:44:44.230 --> 00:44:44.240 align:start position:0%
loudoun and i am strong supporter of the
 
00:44:45.430 --> 00:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
right to know
 
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560 align:start position:0%
i think this also allows for
 
00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:53.750 align:start position:0%
i think this also allows for
uh

00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
inspection or um
 
00:44:57.750 --> 00:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
checking the account
 
00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:58.950 align:start position:0%
checking the account
for

00:44:58.950 --> 00:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:02.550 --> 00:45:02.560 align:start position:0%
races that uh people chose not to
 
00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:03.430 align:start position:0%
races that uh people chose not to
uh

00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:05.200 align:start position:0%
the candidate chose not to have a
 
00:45:07.430 --> 00:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
recount maybe he was
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
a bit too far and would have been
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
expensive or something like that but
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody wanted to do that or
 
00:45:17.670 --> 00:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
look at several districts of a statewide
 
00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
race or something like that just to
 
00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.030 align:start position:0%
race or something like that just to
uh

00:45:21.030 --> 00:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:45:23.829 --> 00:45:23.839 align:start position:0%
get a feel for whether it was
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
everything was all in the up and up i i
 
00:45:28.550 --> 00:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
see no compelling reason to hide ballots
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:45:30.319 --> 00:45:31.670 align:start position:0%
from the
public

00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
public
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
so i think this should uh pass
 
00:45:36.790 --> 00:45:36.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
one uh thing uh miss garrick was
 
00:45:42.230 --> 00:45:42.240 align:start position:0%
talking about uh
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
write-ins i happen to have looked at
 
00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:48.230 align:start position:0%
write-ins i happen to have looked at
writing

00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
summaries for the town album
 
00:45:53.750 --> 00:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
for the past several elections
 
00:45:56.150 --> 00:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
and the clerk had
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
written up a list of names of the people
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
who were written in for the various
 
00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.950 align:start position:0%
who were written in for the various
offices

00:46:00.950 --> 00:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
offices
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
but those names and the numbers of those
 
00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:04.470 align:start position:0%
but those names and the numbers of those
votes

00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
votes
 
00:46:05.430 --> 00:46:05.440 align:start position:0%
did not
 
00:46:07.270 --> 00:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
agree with the
 
00:46:09.190 --> 00:46:09.200 align:start position:0%
number of write-ins that showed up on
 
00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
the tally on the accuvope machine
 
00:46:15.190 --> 00:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
i asked about that and
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
she told me that
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
several of those were
 
00:46:21.030 --> 00:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
crude comments and other things like
 
00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:22.880 align:start position:0%
that so she didn't bother writing them
 
00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
that so she didn't bother writing them
down

00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:25.190 align:start position:0%
down
but

00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
in particular in the
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
primary this past year
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
there was a specific
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
campaign for a republican candidate for
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.390 align:start position:0%
 
and

00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
in that my town report did not report
 
00:46:46.630 --> 00:46:46.640 align:start position:0%
that person even though
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
we had known of about 20 people going
 
00:46:52.230 --> 00:46:52.240 align:start position:0%
into the polls that they had written
 
00:46:53.829 --> 00:46:53.839 align:start position:0%
that person in
 
00:46:53.839 --> 00:46:54.870 align:start position:0%
that person in
and

00:46:54.870 --> 00:46:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:46:57.109 --> 00:46:57.119 align:start position:0%
even after asking about it
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
um that was never corrected
 
00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:01.109 align:start position:0%
um that was never corrected
so

00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%

well christie laureate received 99 votes
 
00:47:57.589 --> 00:47:57.599 align:start position:0%
more than than the votes that were
 
00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:00.480 align:start position:0%

point zero zero five percent to nine
 
00:48:05.670 --> 00:48:05.680 align:start position:0%
point six percent this is the largest
 
00:48:08.950 --> 00:48:08.960 align:start position:0%

be moving in the proper direction
 
00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
election integrity is the most pressing
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
press most pressing issue to we the
 
00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:23.349 align:start position:0%
press most pressing issue to we the
people

00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
without free and fair elections there is
 
00:48:27.430 --> 00:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
no republic
 
00:48:29.109 --> 00:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
this isn't a state issue it's an
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
american issue
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
the right to vote used to mean something
 
00:48:35.670 --> 00:48:35.680 align:start position:0%
it used to be the most patriotic act you
 
00:48:37.270 --> 00:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
could commit
 
00:48:40.230 --> 00:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
but now that trust in the election
 
00:48:44.470 --> 00:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
and we must turn it back if we want
 
00:48:50.390 --> 00:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
a way forward a way to unite us patriots
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
we must pass hb 40
 
00:48:55.430 --> 00:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
and therefore giving a little power back
 
00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
we the people must be able to trust our
 
00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
we the people must be able to trust our
elections

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:49:07.190 --> 00:49:07.200 align:start position:0%

00:51:06.069 --> 00:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
never made and i just want to make that
 
00:51:11.990 --> 00:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:13.910 --> 00:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
there are obviously competing public
 
00:51:17.589 --> 00:51:17.599 align:start position:0%
interests in in this topic
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.349 align:start position:0%
you know
people

00:51:19.349 --> 00:51:19.359 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:51:20.870 --> 00:51:20.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire have the right
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
to know how their government operates
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
they have the right to see certain
 
00:51:25.119 --> 00:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
they have the right to see certain
documents

00:51:26.950 --> 00:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
but in the case of elections
 
00:51:32.150 --> 00:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
it is a different situation
 
00:51:34.309 --> 00:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
ballots have never been available for
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
public inspection after an election and
 
00:51:41.030 --> 00:51:41.040 align:start position:0%
after the recount process has been over
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
there was
 
00:51:45.990 --> 00:51:46.000 align:start position:0%
a law that passed a few years ago that
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
it did make ballots specifically exempt
 
00:51:50.230 --> 00:51:50.240 align:start position:0%
from the right to know law and that was
 
00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.349 align:start position:0%
from the right to know law and that was
because

00:51:51.349 --> 00:51:51.359 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
at the time when the retention period
 
00:51:55.270 --> 00:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
for holding ballots
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
was up and and when the ballots would be
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
to be destroyed
 
00:52:01.030 --> 00:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
there were some academic requests to
 
00:52:03.190 --> 00:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
take a look at those ballots to see if
 
00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:04.640 align:start position:0%
they could determine
 
00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:07.680 align:start position:0%
certain voting trends in new hampshire
 
00:52:10.150 --> 00:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
those requests were not honored but to
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
make it perfectly clear
 
00:52:15.030 --> 00:52:15.040 align:start position:0%
that ballots were not in a subject
 
00:52:17.109 --> 00:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
to public inspection
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
that statute was was created
 
00:52:22.309 --> 00:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
i disagree with the version that ms
 
00:52:22.319 --> 00:52:23.349 align:start position:0%
i disagree with the version that ms
sumner

00:52:23.349 --> 00:52:23.359 align:start position:0%
sumner
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
described on how uh uh
 
00:52:28.630 --> 00:52:28.640 align:start position:0%
you know that law was established you
 
00:52:30.710 --> 00:52:30.720 align:start position:0%
know she's connecting some dots that
 
00:52:33.270 --> 00:52:33.280 align:start position:0%
simply are not there and
 
00:52:35.190 --> 00:52:35.200 align:start position:0%
and i have expressed this in the four or
 
00:52:37.109 --> 00:52:37.119 align:start position:0%
five times that this bill has been
 
00:52:39.589 --> 00:52:39.599 align:start position:0%
before the legislature in the past
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
and the two court cases uh sumner v
 
00:52:45.030 --> 00:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
secretary of state that she took all of
 
00:52:48.230 --> 00:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
the away to the supreme court twice
 
00:52:50.790 --> 00:52:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh and the
 
00:52:53.589 --> 00:52:53.599 align:start position:0%
she lost in every every court along the
 
00:52:53.599 --> 00:52:54.470 align:start position:0%
she lost in every every court along the
way

00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:52:57.030 --> 00:52:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh citing these same issues
 
00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
so why is it important that ballots are
 
00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:01.589 align:start position:0%
so why is it important that ballots are
are

00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:53:03.190 --> 00:53:03.200 align:start position:0%
exempt from the right to know law and
 
00:53:06.150 --> 00:53:06.160 align:start position:0%
they are to be kept private
 
00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:07.030 align:start position:0%
they are to be kept private
first

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
there is a process after an election
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
where it is very easy for a candidate
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
involved in the election to request a
 
00:53:14.079 --> 00:53:15.829 align:start position:0%
involved in the election to request a
recount

00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
recount
 
00:53:17.829 --> 00:53:17.839 align:start position:0%
after the recount is over if there are
 
00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:18.790 align:start position:0%
after the recount is over if there are
still

00:53:18.790 --> 00:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:53:21.349 --> 00:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
unresolved issues
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
the the candidate can appeal to the
 
00:53:25.190 --> 00:53:25.200 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission
 
00:53:27.510 --> 00:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
the ballot law commission will review
 
00:53:29.190 --> 00:53:29.200 align:start position:0%
whatever evidence it is that the
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
candidates bring forward
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
in determining the final outcome of the
 
00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:33.670 align:start position:0%
in determining the final outcome of the
race

00:53:33.670 --> 00:53:33.680 align:start position:0%
race
 
00:53:35.670 --> 00:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
and when they make a decision
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
after that ballots are sealed and they
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
are not to be reopened unless there's an
 
00:53:45.270 --> 00:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
act of the legislature
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
and that currently is underway in the
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
windham situation that uh you heard
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
mentioned before or unless a court says
 
00:53:53.910 --> 00:53:53.920 align:start position:0%
open the ballots
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
they have to find that there is a valid
 
00:53:59.109 --> 00:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
reason for doing so but a court can do
 
00:53:59.119 --> 00:54:00.870 align:start position:0%
reason for doing so but a court can do
that

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:03.680 align:start position:0%
it is incredibly important that there is
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
finality to the election after it's over
 
00:54:08.710 --> 00:54:08.720 align:start position:0%
so that the elected
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
officials can assume their office
 
00:54:14.230 --> 00:54:14.240 align:start position:0%
and uh and carry on their work in new
 
00:54:16.309 --> 00:54:16.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire they have very little time to
 
00:54:18.790 --> 00:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
do that job as all of you know
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
you you hold your position for two years
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
and then you're up for election again
 
00:54:25.589 --> 00:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
and and you get to go through the cycle
 
00:54:27.349 --> 00:54:27.359 align:start position:0%
all over again
 
00:54:29.990 --> 00:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
we all know that that there are groups
 
00:54:31.910 --> 00:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
and agencies and
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
and entities out there that will do
 
00:54:36.150 --> 00:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
surveys in polls and the outcome of
 
00:54:38.710 --> 00:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
those polls
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
can be biased i mean the the they can
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
come up with findings that suit their
 
00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.990 align:start position:0%
come up with findings that suit their
positions

00:54:45.990 --> 00:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.750 --> 00:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
over somebody else's
 
00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
based on looking at the same information
 
00:54:51.670 --> 00:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
the same would be true
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
if we allowed groups to go in
 
00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:56.480 align:start position:0%
and assess what happened with uh you
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
know with the ballots in election they
 
00:55:00.790 --> 00:55:00.800 align:start position:0%
can they can use different standards for
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
counting the ballots in a race and the
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
conclusions can be different from
 
00:55:05.589 --> 00:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
another group they may want to look at
 
00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
those ballots and do the same thing
 
00:55:11.109 --> 00:55:11.119 align:start position:0%
that is not helpful all that does is so
 
00:55:13.270 --> 00:55:13.280 align:start position:0%
doubt into the into the outcome of the
 
00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:14.309 align:start position:0%
doubt into the into the outcome of the
election

00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:55:15.750 --> 00:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh which should already have been
 
00:55:19.349 --> 00:55:19.359 align:start position:0%
decided that is a very important public
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
interest that
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
we need to uphold
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
the other issue
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is the privacy of the
 
00:55:28.240 --> 00:55:29.190 align:start position:0%
that comes to mind is the privacy of the
voter

00:55:29.190 --> 00:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
voter
 
00:55:31.030 --> 00:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
there are ballots that if they are
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
opened up can be tied to a voter
 
00:55:37.589 --> 00:55:37.599 align:start position:0%
and the easy examples to make are
 
00:55:39.430 --> 00:55:39.440 align:start position:0%
ballots that we receive back from our
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
military and overseas personnel
 
00:55:44.950 --> 00:55:44.960 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:46.960 align:start position:0%
those are ballots that they receive
 
00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.870 align:start position:0%
those are ballots that they receive
electronically

00:55:48.870 --> 00:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
electronically
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
when they're overseas or or
 
00:55:53.670 --> 00:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
doing their military service
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
they print the ballot off on using
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
whatever paper they have on whatever
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
printer they have and whatever font is
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
being used the ballots are printed they
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
fill them out and then they have to mail
 
00:56:06.789 --> 00:56:06.799 align:start position:0%
them in
 
00:56:09.670 --> 00:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
the ballot is unique and there may be a
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
way to tie that ballot to the voter that
 
00:56:13.750 --> 00:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
cast it
 
00:56:16.069 --> 00:56:16.079 align:start position:0%
in similar fashion we have accessible
 
00:56:19.030 --> 00:56:19.040 align:start position:0%
voting equipment in the polling places
 
00:56:19.040 --> 00:56:19.990 align:start position:0%
voting equipment in the polling places
um

00:56:19.990 --> 00:56:20.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:22.630 --> 00:56:22.640 align:start position:0%
that has come a long way so that those
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
ballots are now actual ballots and a
 
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:27.680 align:start position:0%
ballot marking device uh is used on
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
those ballots
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
the ballot marking device does a very
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
clean job filling in the oval but to the
 
00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:36.319 align:start position:0%
extent that you can see that that oval
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
has been uh marked by uh that device
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
and let's say you have five or six or
 
00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.190 align:start position:0%
and let's say you have five or six or
eight

00:56:43.190 --> 00:56:43.200 align:start position:0%
eight
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
voters that
 
00:56:48.870 --> 00:56:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
you can identify those ballots
 
00:56:54.470 --> 00:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
if all of those voters voted the same
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
way for a particular office
 
00:57:00.390 --> 00:57:00.400 align:start position:0%
you can identify how a voter that used
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
that device
 
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:04.710 align:start position:0%

voted
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's inappropriate
 
00:57:09.109 --> 00:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
i have personally seen ballots where the
 
00:57:11.510 --> 00:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
voter has gone in and actually sign
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
their name to them
 
00:57:15.430 --> 00:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
that is uh not legal because you're not
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
supposed to put identifying marks on the
 
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.150 align:start position:0%
supposed to put identifying marks on the
ballot

00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
but there are voters that feel strongly
 
00:57:22.069 --> 00:57:22.079 align:start position:0%
about their vote they actually sign the
 
00:57:22.079 --> 00:57:23.829 align:start position:0%
about their vote they actually sign the
ballot

00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
that would be visible under this type of
 
00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:32.069 --> 00:57:32.079 align:start position:0%
and then the next the next item that i
 
00:57:34.230 --> 00:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
will move on to is is actually a form of
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
voter fraud that was prevalent in the
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
late 1800s
 
00:57:41.109 --> 00:57:41.119 align:start position:0%
before there was a movement
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
across the united states including new
 
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.910 align:start position:0%

00:57:50.230 --> 00:57:50.240 align:start position:0%
vote buying was a very common procedure
 
00:57:54.390 --> 00:57:54.400 align:start position:0%
prior to the to the 1893-1894
 
00:57:55.750 --> 00:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
period where
 
00:57:57.430 --> 00:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
the ballots were not printed by the
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
state they were actually printed by the
 
00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:01.520 align:start position:0%
candidates or the political parties
 
00:58:04.870 --> 00:58:04.880 align:start position:0%
and a voter would walk in and
 
00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:06.559 align:start position:0%
and they would cast the party ticket for
 
00:58:08.950 --> 00:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
example they would they could hold up
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
the ballot when they went into the
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
polling place so that
 
00:58:13.589 --> 00:58:13.599 align:start position:0%
voters could see that ballot before it
 
00:58:16.230 --> 00:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
got dropped into the box
 
00:58:18.789 --> 00:58:18.799 align:start position:0%
and party officials knowing that seeing
 
00:58:20.630 --> 00:58:20.640 align:start position:0%
that could give the payoff for that
 
00:58:23.829 --> 00:58:23.839 align:start position:0%
voter once once that was done
 
00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
a similar a similar type of activity
 
00:58:28.549 --> 00:58:28.559 align:start position:0%
could occur
 
00:58:31.030 --> 00:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
if we allow anybody to go in after an
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
election and review the ballots and it
 
00:58:35.589 --> 00:58:35.599 align:start position:0%
would be simply as saying
 
00:58:38.069 --> 00:58:38.079 align:start position:0%
uh you know i wanna i want your vote i'm
 
00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
willing to pay you ten dollars for it
 
00:58:42.870 --> 00:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
um and here's what i want you to do
 
00:58:44.710 --> 00:58:44.720 align:start position:0%
i want you to vote for
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
so and so for uh president or governor
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
and then on the right in line for county
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner i want you to write in
 
00:58:55.030 --> 00:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
josiah bartlett
 
00:58:57.270 --> 00:58:57.280 align:start position:0%
and when i have the opportunity then to
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
open those ballots and go back through
 
00:58:58.880 --> 00:58:59.829 align:start position:0%
open those ballots and go back through
them

00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:59:02.069 --> 00:59:02.079 align:start position:0%
when i find josiah bartlett and i see
 
00:59:04.230 --> 00:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
that there were votes cast the way that
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
that i wanted to see them for president
 
00:59:07.910 --> 00:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
and governor
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh i could hand off the ten dollars
 
00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
and make your payment
 
00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
um again that certainly is not in the
 
00:59:16.390 --> 00:59:16.400 align:start position:0%
public interest and is a primary reason
 
00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:17.430 align:start position:0%
public interest and is a primary reason
why

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:18.430 align:start position:0%
ballast should remain
 
00:59:18.430 --> 00:59:19.829 align:start position:0%
ballast should remain

00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:25.670 --> 00:59:25.680 align:start position:0%
one way to address the concerns that
 
00:59:28.470 --> 00:59:28.480 align:start position:0%
have been raised is to come up with a
 
00:59:30.870 --> 00:59:30.880 align:start position:0%
meaningful audit process
 
00:59:33.670 --> 00:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
after an election is over of of not only
 
00:59:36.069 --> 00:59:36.079 align:start position:0%
machine count towns but also hand count
 
00:59:36.079 --> 00:59:37.109 align:start position:0%
machine count towns but also hand count
towns

00:59:37.109 --> 00:59:37.119 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
um that process does not exist it has
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
been proposed several times in the past
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
but there has never been agreement on on
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
what that process would look like
 
00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.150 align:start position:0%
what that process would look like
um

00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:52.150 --> 00:59:52.160 align:start position:0%
i i think that uh
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
that pretty much covers everything that
 
00:59:55.510 --> 00:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
i've covered in the past on this topic
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
but i just wanted to reiterate that
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
there are very valid reasons for
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
the practice
 
01:00:04.630 --> 01:00:04.640 align:start position:0%
of not making the ballots public
 
01:00:05.990 --> 01:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
after an election
 
01:00:08.549 --> 01:00:08.559 align:start position:0%
and we would encourage this committee in
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
the legislature to find this bill and
 
01:00:16.230 --> 01:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:18.150 --> 01:00:18.160 align:start position:0%
any questions with deputy stanland from

thank you mr chairman uh deputy chairman
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any other states that
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
allow this and is there anything in
 
01:00:33.430 --> 01:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
federal law that allows or prohibits
 
01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:34.789 align:start position:0%
federal law that allows or prohibits
this

01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh we're
 
01:00:37.990 --> 01:00:38.000 align:start position:0%
growing i believe that there are other
 
01:00:39.910 --> 01:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
states that
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
that make the ballots after the election
 
01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:43.750 align:start position:0%
that make the ballots after the election
um

01:00:43.750 --> 01:00:43.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh available to the public
 
01:00:49.030 --> 01:00:49.040 align:start position:0%
you know each st each state has its own
 
01:00:50.549 --> 01:00:50.559 align:start position:0%
election system
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
um and uh
 
01:00:54.549 --> 01:00:54.559 align:start position:0%
you know i think that each state would
 
01:00:56.150 --> 01:00:56.160 align:start position:0%
have to be reviewed individually to see
 
01:00:58.150 --> 01:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
if that practice makes
 
01:01:00.309 --> 01:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
sense or not there are there are many
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
states that are now counting their
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
ballots using digital scanning
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
technology where an actual image of the
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
ballot is stored on the computer new
 
01:01:11.190 --> 01:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not do that
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
because we use optical scan
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
the digital scan states
 
01:01:19.349 --> 01:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
it can actually isolate the individual
 
01:01:21.030 --> 01:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
marks on the ballot so that you don't
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
have to look at the ballot itself uh in
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
aggregate but you can see how the marks
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
are being made and
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
it will identify marks that are
 
01:01:32.950 --> 01:01:32.960 align:start position:0%
unusual and
 
01:01:35.430 --> 01:01:35.440 align:start position:0%
and need some adjudication to determine
 
01:01:37.270 --> 01:01:37.280 align:start position:0%
what the voter intent was
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
on them so
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
that that information is stored in some
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
states and is available
 
01:01:47.829 --> 01:01:47.839 align:start position:0%
uh in others

to support

people to have faith
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
in our election
 
01:03:14.319 --> 01:03:15.430 align:start position:0%
in our election
because

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:15.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:03:17.029 --> 01:03:17.039 align:start position:0%
we have to be able let's say somebody
 
01:03:19.990 --> 01:03:20.000 align:start position:0%
give me a fake bill for like a dollar
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
bill and i say this is fake so the other
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
person should be able to hold that fake
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
bill or real bill we have to hold it and
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
inspect it not through a computer not
 
01:03:31.510 --> 01:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
through an image
 
01:03:34.549 --> 01:03:34.559 align:start position:0%
and the the explanation from that last
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
gentleman saying like some people they
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
for military they sign up and stuff like
 
01:03:41.029 --> 01:03:41.039 align:start position:0%
that their privacy is important but that
 
01:03:44.309 --> 01:03:44.319 align:start position:0%
is a small percentage and the privacy
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
and the public trust weight is way off
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
so we do need to have access
 
01:03:54.069 --> 01:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
to this ballot directly
 
01:03:55.750 --> 01:03:55.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not just
 
01:03:59.109 --> 01:03:59.119 align:start position:0%
for the candidate that lost a win the
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
public have a vast
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
interest in this process of who they
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
voted for that representing them so it's
 
01:04:09.750 --> 01:04:09.760 align:start position:0%
not just personally to those candidates
 
01:04:12.150 --> 01:04:12.160 align:start position:0%
that involved is involved to the whole
 
01:04:15.589 --> 01:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
public and we the people have the right
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
to know and touch those ballots
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%

also uh
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
penn barnes has uh
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
his hand raised
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
oh good am i unmuted yes

allowing me to speak at this important
hearing

hearing
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
i support hb 480 and i hope you will
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
vote it out of committee ought to pass
 
01:05:10.069 --> 01:05:10.079 align:start position:0%
uh it's
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
very important to our democracy i think
 
01:05:15.510 --> 01:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
the greatest gift that we as americans
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
and we as granite staters have
 
01:05:19.829 --> 01:05:19.839 align:start position:0%
is the democracy
 
01:05:19.839 --> 01:05:20.630 align:start position:0%
is the democracy
that

01:05:20.630 --> 01:05:20.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
we are
 
01:05:24.470 --> 01:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
blessed to live under and the key to to
 
01:05:27.910 --> 01:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
making a democracy functional is
 
01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:29.109 align:start position:0%
making a democracy functional is
voting

01:05:29.109 --> 01:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
voting
 
01:05:32.390 --> 01:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
fair elections and our ability to
 
01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:33.510 align:start position:0%
fair elections and our ability to
actually

01:05:33.510 --> 01:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:05:36.069 --> 01:05:36.079 align:start position:0%
the pup for the people of the state to
 
01:05:38.069 --> 01:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
choose who the
 
01:05:39.910 --> 01:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
represent who our representatives will
 
01:05:42.069 --> 01:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
be and who will be making the policies
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
that govern our lives
 
01:05:43.760 --> 01:05:44.549 align:start position:0%
that govern our lives
and

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:44.559 --> 01:05:45.510 align:start position:0%
and
i

01:05:45.510 --> 01:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
think that the importance of election
 
01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
integrity is not only crucial to public
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
trust of the process as a lot of
 
01:05:57.829 --> 01:05:57.839 align:start position:0%
speakers have said because it certainly
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
would go a long way to restoring public
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
trust but we have a long way to go after
 
01:06:05.190 --> 01:06:05.200 align:start position:0%
that public trust isn't just about
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
transparency but
 
01:06:09.029 --> 01:06:09.039 align:start position:0%
without transparency
 
01:06:09.039 --> 01:06:10.150 align:start position:0%
without transparency
we

01:06:10.150 --> 01:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
can't know whether
 
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.109 align:start position:0%
can't know whether
the

01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
election process has actually
 
01:06:18.950 --> 01:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
produced the right results we can
 
01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.829 align:start position:0%
produced the right results we can
uh

01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:06:22.710 --> 01:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
the machines are fallible machines are
 
01:06:26.309 --> 01:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
always fallible and uh in particular
 
01:06:28.950 --> 01:06:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh the counting process is fallible
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh the the recent example of windham
 
01:06:31.920 --> 01:06:33.589 align:start position:0%
uh the the recent example of windham
demonstrates

01:06:33.589 --> 01:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
demonstrates
 
01:06:33.599 --> 01:06:35.109 align:start position:0%
demonstrates
that

01:06:35.109 --> 01:06:35.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
we who may have taken
 
01:06:40.870 --> 01:06:40.880 align:start position:0%
the voting machines for granted
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
were wrong and
 
01:06:44.150 --> 01:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
01:06:46.630 --> 01:06:46.640 align:start position:0%
there are huge errors whether it changes
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
the outcome of the election in this
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
particular election is not the point the
 
01:06:51.829 --> 01:06:51.839 align:start position:0%
point is
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the machine counting process
 
01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:56.150 align:start position:0%
that the machine counting process
is

01:06:56.150 --> 01:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:06:59.430 --> 01:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
potentially fallible as
 
01:07:01.829 --> 01:07:01.839 align:start position:0%
the woman who was the former republican
 
01:07:01.839 --> 01:07:02.950 align:start position:0%
the woman who was the former republican
candidate

01:07:02.950 --> 01:07:02.960 align:start position:0%
candidate
 
01:07:05.510 --> 01:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh talked about you know you get results
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
that are anonymous anomalous and but for
 
01:07:08.799 --> 01:07:10.309 align:start position:0%
that are anonymous anomalous and but for
somebody

01:07:10.309 --> 01:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
somebody
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
either requesting a recount or
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
some other way
 
01:07:18.309 --> 01:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
we'll never know unless the public
 
01:07:20.230 --> 01:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
is there to
 
01:07:25.270 --> 01:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.829 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:31.910 --> 01:07:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh scanners make mistakes and uh
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
can't be relied on and
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
the people
 
01:07:38.549 --> 01:07:38.559 align:start position:0%
being present
 
01:07:38.559 --> 01:07:39.829 align:start position:0%
being present
who

01:07:39.829 --> 01:07:39.839 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:07:43.190 --> 01:07:43.200 align:start position:0%
look at the ballot uh the woman who just
 
01:07:45.589 --> 01:07:45.599 align:start position:0%
testified talked about uh we have the
 
01:07:48.150 --> 01:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
right to see and touch the ballots it's
 
01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.029 align:start position:0%
right to see and touch the ballots it's
it's

01:07:49.029 --> 01:07:49.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
uh she's absolutely right on
 
01:07:52.160 --> 01:07:53.029 align:start position:0%
uh she's absolutely right on
the

01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:55.510 --> 01:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
access part it's not but it's not about
 
01:07:57.029 --> 01:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
touching them it's about
 
01:07:59.910 --> 01:07:59.920 align:start position:0%
assuring the public that
 
01:08:01.430 --> 01:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh the vote
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
cap that's reported
 
01:08:03.680 --> 01:08:04.630 align:start position:0%
cap that's reported
is

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:04.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:08:06.549 --> 01:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
what the voters actually wanted and
 
01:08:07.750 --> 01:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
voted for
 
01:08:09.829 --> 01:08:09.839 align:start position:0%
and i just have to say that uh in
 
01:08:11.589 --> 01:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
response to uh
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker from the secretary of
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
state's office deputy scanlan
 
01:08:17.749 --> 01:08:17.759 align:start position:0%
um you know he
 
01:08:20.550 --> 01:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh gave us a parade of horribles of
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
things that could
 
01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
go wrong and those are the usual
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
parade which is trotted out against any
 
01:08:31.349 --> 01:08:31.359 align:start position:0%
kind of public access
 
01:08:31.359 --> 01:08:32.470 align:start position:0%
kind of public access
government

01:08:32.470 --> 01:08:32.480 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:08:33.829 --> 01:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
accountability but government
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
transparency uh and government
 
01:08:40.550 --> 01:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
um it's always a little harder to be in
 
01:08:42.950 --> 01:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
a democracy it's always a little harder
 
01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.149 align:start position:0%
a democracy it's always a little harder
to

01:08:44.149 --> 01:08:44.159 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
have the people
 
01:08:48.470 --> 01:08:48.480 align:start position:0%
to whom our elected officials are
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
responsible they rep you all represent
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
us after all
 
01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.590 align:start position:0%
us after all
um

01:08:53.590 --> 01:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
it's harder and as somebody said it may
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
cost a little more money but
 
01:08:58.719 --> 01:08:59.430 align:start position:0%
cost a little more money but
uh

01:08:59.430 --> 01:08:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:00.870 --> 01:09:00.880 align:start position:0%
the process
 
01:09:02.550 --> 01:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
of a democracy
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
is worth
 
01:09:07.110 --> 01:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
a little more we our chaotic election
 
01:09:07.120 --> 01:09:08.149 align:start position:0%
a little more we our chaotic election
season

01:09:08.149 --> 01:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
season
 
01:09:09.669 --> 01:09:09.679 align:start position:0%
you know some people around the world
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
think we're crazy as americans to
 
01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:13.749 align:start position:0%
think we're crazy as americans to
uh

01:09:13.749 --> 01:09:13.759 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:16.149 --> 01:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
put up with all of this
 
01:09:19.990 --> 01:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
huge expense and uh chaotic
 
01:09:22.149 --> 01:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
give and take back and forth
 
01:09:25.349 --> 01:09:25.359 align:start position:0%
um but that's what a democracy is it
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
doesn't not that it should be uh with
 
01:09:30.630 --> 01:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
personal invective but we have a robust
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
debate and then we transition
 
01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
power and
 
01:09:34.560 --> 01:09:35.590 align:start position:0%
power and
move

01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
move
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
move on and the will of the people is
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
put into place with representatives like
 
01:09:42.309 --> 01:09:42.319 align:start position:0%
you folks and
 
01:09:43.749 --> 01:09:43.759 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:09:45.749 --> 01:09:45.759 align:start position:0%
why it's worth putting up with all the
 
01:09:48.390 --> 01:09:48.400 align:start position:0%
chaos and the expense that we americans
 
01:09:51.030 --> 01:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
and grant staters put up with to to
 
01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.390 align:start position:0%
and grant staters put up with to to
participate

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
participate
 
01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:53.510 align:start position:0%
participate
in

01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
a fair voting system
 
01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:57.830 align:start position:0%
a fair voting system
the

01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:01.110 --> 01:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
this particular bill 480
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
talking about public
 
01:10:05.590 --> 01:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh access to the ballots to
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh check and make sure they're
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
accurately counted
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
is the alternative to the alternative
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
that the secretary of state's office
 
01:10:15.430 --> 01:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
wants is to
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
how did he put it um
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
a candidate can request a recount
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
and if it's denied
 
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:23.990 align:start position:0%
and if it's denied
uh

01:10:23.990 --> 01:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
by uh the town
 
01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
the recount
 
01:10:30.950 --> 01:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
that it goes to um the ballot commission
 
01:10:33.030 --> 01:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
and the bow commission decides yay or
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
nay and then it's over
 
01:10:39.110 --> 01:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
and uh mr scanlan said it has to be over
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's very important to be over quickly
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
because otherwise uh it'll drag out and
 
01:10:45.669 --> 01:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
you representatives won't be able to
 
01:10:47.430 --> 01:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
take office and do your jobs well i

01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
showed us very clearly that
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have to drag out and take
 
01:11:00.310 --> 01:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
forever to
 
01:11:01.990 --> 01:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh have
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh public checking of the accuracy of

ballots they did
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
three recounts hand recounts of every
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
single ballot of millions of ballots and
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
they were done in a matter of weeks uh
 
01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.189 align:start position:0%
they were done in a matter of weeks uh
didn't

01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
01:11:18.310 --> 01:11:18.320 align:start position:0%
so in our state uh the the boogeyman of
 
01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:20.189 align:start position:0%
so in our state uh the the boogeyman of
uh

01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%

01:11:24.709 --> 01:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
not be able to take their office and do
 
01:11:26.470 --> 01:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
their jobs if

looks over the ballots and and checks
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
for accuracy that's just not reality and
 
01:11:36.550 --> 01:11:36.560 align:start position:0%
i don't think the committee should be
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%

okay i certainly support this bill and i
 
01:13:28.870 --> 01:13:28.880 align:start position:0%
had no idea in the four years that i was
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
on election law that there were so many
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
discrepancies going on in hand counting
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
and i cause always are up in salem it's
 
01:13:39.830 --> 01:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
all machine counted and i forgot that
 
01:13:42.790 --> 01:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
you still have to do some hand counting
 
01:13:45.669 --> 01:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
and after going to a recount that's very
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
carefully supervised by the secretary of
 
01:13:50.630 --> 01:13:50.640 align:start position:0%
state's office in concord and it was so
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
impressive how it is carefully done and
 
01:13:55.590 --> 01:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
well observed
 
01:13:57.430 --> 01:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
it just didn't dawn on me that we didn't
 
01:13:59.750 --> 01:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
get that kind of care
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
guaranteed in all the towns that
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
do have all count hand count and some so
 
01:14:11.189 --> 01:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.110 --> 01:14:13.120 align:start position:0%

anomalies as the previous speaker just

01:16:27.990 --> 01:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
bill election integrity is essential
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
should votes be counted accurately or
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
are large error rates okay i think the
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
answer is obvious large vote tally
 
01:16:35.830 --> 01:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
errors of the type uncovered in the
 
01:16:37.669 --> 01:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
windham recount should cause us all
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
great concern an error pattern that
 
01:16:41.910 --> 01:16:41.920 align:start position:0%
systematically disfavors republican
 
01:16:43.590 --> 01:16:43.600 align:start position:0%
candidates and favors a democrat
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
candidate looks suspicious we must
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
determine how these large errors happen
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
might this have been caused by
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
malfunctioning voting machines if so
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
due to erroneous software algorithms or
 
01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
deliberately misprogrammed algorithms or
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
were the numbers manually changed
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
somehow and if so by whom
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
computer software is a key area of
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
security vulnerability software is a
 
01:17:07.830 --> 01:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
black box unless we have access to the
 
01:17:09.910 --> 01:17:09.920 align:start position:0%
source code we do not know exactly what
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
it does
 
01:17:12.950 --> 01:17:12.960 align:start position:0%
is software driven voting machines
 
01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
reliable do they count consistently and
 
01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
accurately the windham machines must be
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
tested in a methodical and public way to
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
see if the erroneous counts are
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
repeatable on these machines
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
if the machines are proven to count
 
01:17:27.990 --> 01:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
consistently and accurately then what
 
01:17:29.510 --> 01:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
might the election's original vote
 
01:17:31.750 --> 01:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
tallies have been altered elsewhere
 
01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr smith that is your minute
 
01:17:35.669 --> 01:17:35.679 align:start position:0%
do what i understand and my recollection
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
is you actually did submit what you were
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
speaking and written testimony to the
 
01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.030 align:start position:0%
speaking and written testimony to the
committee

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%

i feel like i'm on a cell phone
commercial

01:18:58.390 --> 01:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair members of the
 
01:19:02.790 --> 01:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
committee it's good to see you all again
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is marjorie
 
01:19:06.070 --> 01:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
porter and i represent hillsborough
 
01:19:08.709 --> 01:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
district one the people of antrim
 
01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
hillsborough in windsor and i'm here to
 
01:19:13.110 --> 01:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill to you
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
back in the days when i taught and
 
01:19:17.430 --> 01:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
administered standardized machine scored
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
tests to the children the directions i
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
read told them
 
01:19:23.590 --> 01:19:23.600 align:start position:0%
if they changed their answers to make
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
sure to completely erase the oval they
 
01:19:28.950 --> 01:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
had marked incorrectly or else their
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
answer would be marked wrong
 
01:19:33.830 --> 01:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
also never make stray marks on that
 
01:19:36.070 --> 01:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
answer sheet the machine can't read your
 
01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.430 align:start position:0%
answer sheet the machine can't read your
mind

01:19:37.430 --> 01:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
mind
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
this always comes to mind when i think
 
01:19:41.189 --> 01:19:41.199 align:start position:0%
about over voted ballots
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
as you know an overboat happens when
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
there are marks in both ovals in a
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
two-person race for example
 
01:19:50.870 --> 01:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
either by accident or due to a voter
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
changing her mind
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes voters will put a big x
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
through that wrong vote and just move on
 
01:19:59.189 --> 01:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
down the ballot
 
01:20:01.510 --> 01:20:01.520 align:start position:0%
when ballots are hand counted the poll
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
workers can see that x and give the vote
 
01:20:06.070 --> 01:20:06.080 align:start position:0%
to the other candidate
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
with vote counting machines however a
 
01:20:10.870 --> 01:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
problem is created if there are marks in
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
both ovals the machine reads it as an
 
01:20:16.070 --> 01:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
overvote and unfortunately in new
 
01:20:18.630 --> 01:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire now the machine accepts the
 
01:20:21.990 --> 01:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
ballot but does not count that vote
 
01:20:25.110 --> 01:20:25.120 align:start position:0%
the voter and the candidate they chose
 
01:20:27.110 --> 01:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
lose that vote
 
01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
however our machines can be programmed
 
01:20:32.950 --> 01:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
to reject that over voted ballot
 
01:20:35.030 --> 01:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
spitting it back to the voter so
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
corrections can be made
 
01:20:39.430 --> 01:20:39.440 align:start position:0%
in fact in massachusetts and vermont we
 
01:20:41.350 --> 01:20:41.360 align:start position:0%
use the same type of machines that we
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
use that is exactly what they do
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
the voter can then make corrections or
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
simply place it into a separate ballot
 
01:20:52.390 --> 01:20:52.400 align:start position:0%
box to be hand counted later
 
01:20:54.390 --> 01:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
this bill requires that our vote
 
01:20:57.030 --> 01:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
counting machines be programmed in that
 
01:20:58.229 --> 01:20:58.239 align:start position:0%
same way
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
so voters have a chance to fix the error
 
01:21:03.030 --> 01:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
if they made one
 
01:21:04.950 --> 01:21:04.960 align:start position:0%
what is particularly concerning to me
 
01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.830 align:start position:0%
what is particularly concerning to me
now

01:21:05.830 --> 01:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:21:08.149 --> 01:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
is there is some evidence which others
 
01:21:10.790 --> 01:21:10.800 align:start position:0%
who are testifying later will explain
 
01:21:13.590 --> 01:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
that in november the november election a
 
01:21:16.470 --> 01:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
quite large percentage of absentee
 
01:21:19.669 --> 01:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
ballots were counted as overvoted by
 
01:21:21.430 --> 01:21:21.440 align:start position:0%
some of our machines
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
this is possibly because the folds in
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
those ballots created shadows that the
 
01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:28.640 align:start position:0%
machine read as marx
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
we had some very close races in november
 
01:21:33.750 --> 01:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
and it's possible these votes could have
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
changed the outcome
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
every voter's vote counts
 
01:21:41.430 --> 01:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
especially in these times it is vital
 
01:21:44.790 --> 01:21:44.800 align:start position:0%
that every voter's vote is counted
 
01:21:46.950 --> 01:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
no one should be disenfranchised because
 
01:21:49.750 --> 01:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
they made a mistake changed their mind
 
01:21:52.470 --> 01:21:52.480 align:start position:0%
made a stray mark or folded their ballot
 
01:21:54.629 --> 01:21:54.639 align:start position:0%
to fit into an envelope
 
01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
and i hope you will favorably consider
 
01:21:59.189 --> 01:21:59.199 align:start position:0%
hb 491
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
and madam chair there are some people
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
behind me who have more details who have
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
done the research on this and have more
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
details and might be able to answer
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
questions better than i can but i'll
 
01:22:10.870 --> 01:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
give it a try
 
01:22:12.070 --> 01:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody in the community room have
 
01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:16.130 align:start position:0%
a question representative
 
01:22:16.130 --> 01:22:17.750 align:start position:0%
a question representative
[Music]

01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh how do you anticipate this will be
 
01:22:25.110 --> 01:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
handled in towns that do not use the
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting machines
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
towns where
 
01:22:31.510 --> 01:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
the votes are hand counted
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
i would anticipate that they would not
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
have this this problem the machines are
 
01:22:35.679 --> 01:22:36.870 align:start position:0%
have this this problem the machines are
what's

01:22:36.870 --> 01:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
what's
 
01:22:39.350 --> 01:22:39.360 align:start position:0%
causing the problem usually with a hand
 
01:22:41.189 --> 01:22:41.199 align:start position:0%
counted ballot you can look at it and
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
make a determination of what the voter
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
intended with that vote
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
i have a follow-up man follow-up
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that mean that the the people
 
01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
at the in the communities that do hand
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
counts would have to see the ballot of
 
01:22:56.159 --> 01:22:56.950 align:start position:0%
counts would have to see the ballot of
the

01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:59.590 --> 01:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
voter right at that moment and wouldn't
 
01:23:02.070 --> 01:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
that violate their privacy
 
01:23:04.709 --> 01:23:04.719 align:start position:0%
i no representative i don't believe so
 
01:23:06.870 --> 01:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
because what we're asking is that the
 
01:23:10.149 --> 01:23:10.159 align:start position:0%
machines be reprogrammed so that they
 
01:23:12.950 --> 01:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
will spit out over voted ballots it
 
01:23:15.830 --> 01:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't pertain to hand counted ballots
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
at all
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions for
 
01:23:21.590 --> 01:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
committee members representative
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
certainly all voters have a right to
 
01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:29.830 align:start position:0%
certainly all voters have a right to
vote

01:23:29.830 --> 01:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
but with that right comes a
 
01:23:33.910 --> 01:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
responsibility to be informed and follow
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
the directions on the ballot um
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
so my question is
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
it seems if this legislation passes some
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
people will get a second chance to
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
correct an error they may have made but
 
01:23:47.430 --> 01:23:47.440 align:start position:0%
others may not for example i could see
 
01:23:49.350 --> 01:23:49.360 align:start position:0%
with the absentee ballot
 
01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.550 align:start position:0%
with the absentee ballot
individual

01:23:50.550 --> 01:23:50.560 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:52.070 align:start position:0%
individual
getting

01:23:52.070 --> 01:23:52.080 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:23:55.830 --> 01:23:55.840 align:start position:0%
the chance to be contacted to get that
 
01:23:58.470 --> 01:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
potential error they may change that
 
01:23:59.830 --> 01:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
somebody else that voted in person
 
01:24:01.990 --> 01:24:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't so how do you justify
 
01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:02.870 align:start position:0%
probably wouldn't so how do you justify
the

01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:03.669 align:start position:0%
the
the

01:24:03.669 --> 01:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
franchise you know
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
maybe over franchising one group and
 
01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
under franchising another if this
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
legislation passes
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
well i believe in the legislation um
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
it's online 10 it says ballots of
 
01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
absentee voters and those who choose not
 
01:24:22.950 --> 01:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
to correct or replace the ballot shall
 
01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:25.679 align:start position:0%
be placed in an auxiliary compartment
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
and counted by election officials
 
01:24:28.080 --> 01:24:29.510 align:start position:0%
and counted by election officials
so

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:24:32.070 --> 01:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
that would be how it would be handled
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
but you know to be honest it's easy to
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
make a stray mark on a ballot it was
 
01:24:38.229 --> 01:24:38.239 align:start position:0%
easy for those kids in school to put
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
their pencil down too hard and make a
 
01:24:42.550 --> 01:24:42.560 align:start position:0%
mark on the wrong answer and believe me
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
i looked over my kids test scores my
 
01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.229 align:start position:0%
i looked over my kids test scores my
test

01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
test
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
papers after they had been scored
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
by machine and i saw one of them had a
 
01:24:53.910 --> 01:24:53.920 align:start position:0%
raw ex
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
incorrect answer when i looked at his
 
01:24:57.590 --> 01:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
paper it was because there was a stray
 
01:25:00.470 --> 01:25:00.480 align:start position:0%
market it was very light but the machine
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
read it as a wrong answer so it does
 
01:25:05.350 --> 01:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
happen that way uh no fault of the of
 
01:25:06.390 --> 01:25:06.400 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
or no change in his mind just a stray
 
01:25:11.270 --> 01:25:11.280 align:start position:0%
mark on the paper
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from people
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
in the committee room
 
01:25:19.910 --> 01:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
i need you to speak up if you're online
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
i have a question madam chair
 
01:25:29.030 --> 01:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
if you're able to hear me
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
yes we are go ahead
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman thank you
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:25:38.310 --> 01:25:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh you're absolutely right that voters
 
01:25:41.270 --> 01:25:41.280 align:start position:0%
do make mistakes on their ballots
 
01:25:43.510 --> 01:25:43.520 align:start position:0%
can you tell me if a voter
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
is aware that they've made a mistake do
 
01:25:47.430 --> 01:25:47.440 align:start position:0%
they have an option
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
of notifying somebody at the polls
 
01:25:53.110 --> 01:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
uh getting a new ballot having that one
 
01:25:56.070 --> 01:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
marked and if so how does that relate to
 
01:25:57.750 --> 01:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
01:25:59.030 --> 01:25:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative thank you for the
 
01:26:00.870 --> 01:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
question i do think they have that
 
01:26:03.110 --> 01:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
option but that option is not told to
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
them when they're handed their ballot um
 
01:26:08.070 --> 01:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
for example when i go in and get my
 
01:26:10.550 --> 01:26:10.560 align:start position:0%
ballot and i mark it no one has ever
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
said to me representative marjorie you
 
01:26:13.750 --> 01:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
can get a new ballot if you make a
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
mistake so
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
don't worry i go in i mark my ballot and
 
01:26:19.430 --> 01:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
i put it away um
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that members of the public
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
might be aware that they could ask for a
 
01:26:24.790 --> 01:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
second ballot
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
to fix it um so
 
01:26:29.830 --> 01:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
unless that's specifically stated to
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
them at some point when they're handed
 
01:26:32.790 --> 01:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
their ballot
 
01:26:34.629 --> 01:26:34.639 align:start position:0%
i don't think they a lot of people would
 
01:26:37.110 --> 01:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:26:38.709 --> 01:26:38.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
01:26:44.310 --> 01:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
i'm not hearing any i'm almost to the
 
01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
point where i can see if there are any
 
01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.830 align:start position:0%
point where i can see if there are any
so

01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:26:51.990 --> 01:26:52.000 align:start position:0%

till i'm from derry new hampshire and i
 
01:28:41.350 --> 01:28:41.360 align:start position:0%
rise in support of house bill 491
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
as dairytown moderator from 2016 to 2020
 
01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
i am very familiar with the problem of
 
01:28:50.870 --> 01:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:54.310 --> 01:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
in counting votes moderators are
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
guided by the standard of the intent of
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
the voter
 
01:29:00.070 --> 01:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
this standard was recognized by the new
 
01:29:02.390 --> 01:29:02.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire supreme court in 2003 in the
 
01:29:05.110 --> 01:29:05.120 align:start position:0%
mcdonald case and is further reinforced
 
01:29:07.350 --> 01:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
by the secretary of state in the
 
01:29:09.590 --> 01:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
election procedure manual
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
in derry in november 2020 one of the
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
accu-vote machines that exclusively
 
01:29:17.350 --> 01:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
processed absentee ballots recorded over
 
01:29:19.229 --> 01:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
votes on more than
 
01:29:21.430 --> 01:29:21.440 align:start position:0%
570 ballots
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
taken together the eight accuvote
 
01:29:26.430 --> 01:29:26.440 align:start position:0%
machines used in derry recorded nearly
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
850 over-voted ballots
 
01:29:32.229 --> 01:29:32.239 align:start position:0%
these are big numbers and if they all or
 
01:29:34.550 --> 01:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
most of them impact the same race as
 
01:29:37.189 --> 01:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
with a crease they could easily swing an
 
01:29:37.199 --> 01:29:38.470 align:start position:0%
with a crease they could easily swing an
election

01:29:38.470 --> 01:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:29:41.189 --> 01:29:41.199 align:start position:0%
section 301 of the help america vote act
 
01:29:43.669 --> 01:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
specifically calls out this issue
 
01:29:45.910 --> 01:29:45.920 align:start position:0%
it requires that the voter be notified
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the problem informed of the
 
01:29:50.629 --> 01:29:50.639 align:start position:0%
consequences and given an opportunity to
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
correct the problem including completing
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
a new ballot
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire could easily and quickly
 
01:29:59.030 --> 01:29:59.040 align:start position:0%
instruct lhs to
 
01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:02.400 align:start position:0%
include code it has already created for
 
01:30:05.350 --> 01:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and vermont to return an
 
01:30:08.149 --> 01:30:08.159 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballot the secretary of state
 
01:30:10.709 --> 01:30:10.719 align:start position:0%
has resisted requesting this
 
01:30:12.950 --> 01:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
this code because he says he does not
 
01:30:15.669 --> 01:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
want to embarrass the voter whose ballot
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
is returned
 
01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:18.149 align:start position:0%
is returned
really

01:30:18.149 --> 01:30:18.159 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:30:20.310 --> 01:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know about you i'd rather have
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
the problem point it out to me than lose
 
01:30:23.510 --> 01:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
my vote
 
01:30:26.550 --> 01:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
besides the evidence indicates
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the voter is clear on
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of so-called overvotes
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
the problem is the machine reading error
 
01:30:37.270 --> 01:30:37.280 align:start position:0%
this is a serious issue with an easy
 
01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
solution it is time to take steps to
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that every vote counts please
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass on house bill 491
 
01:30:47.910 --> 01:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to answer any questions
 
01:30:50.149 --> 01:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
you may have and will send a copy of my
 
01:30:52.390 --> 01:30:52.400 align:start position:0%
full testimony to the clerk to be

included in the record thank you miss
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
till it sounded like you had written
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
testimony so thank you for sending a
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
question of representative cooper
 
01:31:02.629 --> 01:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
o'brien thank you madam chair
 
01:31:04.390 --> 01:31:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question ms
 
01:31:04.400 --> 01:31:05.350 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question ms
till

01:31:05.350 --> 01:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
till
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh am i first of all am i correct that
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
not every community uses electronic
 
01:31:14.070 --> 01:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines in new
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
hampshire and how
 
01:31:18.629 --> 01:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
would voters in those communities that
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
do not use electronic ballot counting
 
01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:21.590 align:start position:0%
do not use electronic ballot counting
machines

01:31:21.590 --> 01:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
machines
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
be given the same opportunity that that
 
01:31:26.870 --> 01:31:26.880 align:start position:0%
those with uh electronic ballot counting
 
01:31:28.830 --> 01:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
machines would have under this
 
01:31:32.870 --> 01:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
bill well the bill is designed to
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
deal with an issue that is specific to
 
01:31:38.629 --> 01:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot counting machines and
 
01:31:41.590 --> 01:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
the towns that use them
 
01:31:44.550 --> 01:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
people who vote in hand count towns
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
already have the opportunity to have
 
01:31:49.669 --> 01:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
their ballot reviewed by
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
election officials and as i pointed out
 
01:31:55.030 --> 01:31:55.040 align:start position:0%
in my testimony the vast vast majority
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
of over voted ballots or so-called
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballots
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
are not the fault of the voter but
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
rather an inability of the machine to
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
read the intention of the voter
 
01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:08.080 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you a
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
follow-up on that how exactly would they
 
01:32:15.430 --> 01:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
have it reviewed does that mean that
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
every voter who brings their ballot
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
to the to the ballot box in a
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
town that does hand counts not
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
electronic not using electronic ballot
 
01:32:28.149 --> 01:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
counting machines that the
 
01:32:30.229 --> 01:32:30.239 align:start position:0%
the moderator or election officials on
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
site look at their ballot when they pass
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
it in
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
they look they look at their ballots
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
after the election is closed and the
 
01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
hand count begins a hand count means
 
01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:42.390 align:start position:0%
hand count begins a hand count means
that

01:32:42.390 --> 01:32:42.400 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:44.310 --> 01:32:44.320 align:start position:0%
human beings look at the ballot and
 
01:32:46.709 --> 01:32:46.719 align:start position:0%
decide what the voter intent was for
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
each race
 
01:32:50.550 --> 01:32:50.560 align:start position:0%
thank you miss till point taken i
 
01:32:54.550 --> 01:32:54.560 align:start position:0%

online our president in the committee
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
room i think i've got my computer stuff

promoted to a panelist if you on view we
 
01:33:13.270 --> 01:33:13.280 align:start position:0%
will be we welcome your testimony and
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%

01:33:18.310 --> 01:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
okay i was prepared to speak for five
 
01:33:20.709 --> 01:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
minutes and i will try to um hit the
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
high spots you do have copies of my
 
01:33:25.590 --> 01:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
testimony i thought i saw something from
 
01:33:27.110 --> 01:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
you so why don't we just have two
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
minutes of the high spots and that would
 
01:33:31.669 --> 01:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
be a big thing i'll i'll you can cut me
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
off when you think i've gone too far
 
01:33:35.430 --> 01:33:35.440 align:start position:0%
i'll put you back for two minutes just
 
01:33:37.430 --> 01:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
mention that the second time that i went
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
to court was to find out why 2.5 percent
 
01:33:42.870 --> 01:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
of jeffrey ballon
 
01:33:45.270 --> 01:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i also want to respond to some prior
 
01:33:47.910 --> 01:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
questions mr you just got very very
 
01:33:50.550 --> 01:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
faint i can't hear you well can you hear
 
01:33:54.310 --> 01:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:57.030 --> 01:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
i haven't done i haven't been saying
 
01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
it's not minutes miss sumner i can't
 
01:34:00.149 --> 01:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
hear you
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
um let me let me try to speak a little
 
01:34:05.189 --> 01:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
louder and see if that helps yeah
 
01:34:07.350 --> 01:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
now you're back okay go ahead
 
01:34:11.350 --> 01:34:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay there was a question in terms of um
 
01:34:13.750 --> 01:34:13.760 align:start position:0%
hand count towns and optical scan towns
 
01:34:16.709 --> 01:34:16.719 align:start position:0%
there has been research done in terms of
 
01:34:19.189 --> 01:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
which technology
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
produces the the fewest number of
 
01:34:24.550 --> 01:34:24.560 align:start position:0%
overvoted ballots and the research that
 
01:34:27.110 --> 01:34:27.120 align:start position:0%
has been done shows that hand count
 
01:34:29.430 --> 01:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
towns and optical scans when they are
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
programmed to return those over voted
 
01:34:34.229 --> 01:34:34.239 align:start position:0%
ballots have the lowest rate of
 
01:34:36.790 --> 01:34:36.800 align:start position:0%
overvotes the touch screens the punch
 
01:34:38.550 --> 01:34:38.560 align:start position:0%
card ballots
 
01:34:41.030 --> 01:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
the lever machines all had higher
 
01:34:43.510 --> 01:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
overvotes than the optical scan
 
01:34:46.870 --> 01:34:46.880 align:start position:0%
programmed and hand counts the other
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
issue in terms of new hampshire is that
 
01:34:50.709 --> 01:34:50.719 align:start position:0%
when we were using the lever machines
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
and this goes back to 1800s
 
01:34:57.110 --> 01:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
the law required those lever machines
 
01:34:59.990 --> 01:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
not to allow over voted ballots all
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
right that was one of the sales pitches
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
for buying the lever machines is it did
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
not allow voters to vote for too many
 
01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.830 align:start position:0%
not allow voters to vote for too many
candidates

01:35:07.830 --> 01:35:07.840 align:start position:0%
candidates
 
01:35:10.950 --> 01:35:10.960 align:start position:0%
okay so back to my testimony here okay
 
01:35:13.110 --> 01:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
the problem currently
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire has two
 
01:35:14.719 --> 01:35:16.790 align:start position:0%
is that new hampshire has two
contradictory

01:35:16.790 --> 01:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
contradictory
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
policies rsa 659 colon 6-4
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
voter intent is the legal standard in
 
01:35:25.270 --> 01:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire and every other state that
 
01:35:26.629 --> 01:35:26.639 align:start position:0%
i'm aware of
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's policy
 
01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:30.470 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's policy
is

01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:32.950 --> 01:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
or mr scanlon mr fitch and i interpret
 
01:35:35.189 --> 01:35:35.199 align:start position:0%
the federal requirement differently but
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
i believe we agree neither the new
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire attorney general nor the u.s
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
department of justice is enforcing the
 
01:35:45.510 --> 01:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
law saying this is a policy question for
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
the legislature to decide
 
01:35:50.070 --> 01:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
the research anecdotal evidence shows
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
less experienced voters those of lower
 
01:35:54.870 --> 01:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
income and education are more likely to
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
be disenfranchised by over voted ballots
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
this has been known since the 2000
 
01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
general election and reported by the
 
01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
election assistance commission and i can
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
give you a specific example from jeffrey
 
01:36:08.950 --> 01:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
if you're interested ms sumner if you
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
could give those in the written
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
testimony that would be terrific you
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
have 15 seconds
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
um i think representative porter
 
01:36:19.350 --> 01:36:19.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned in terms of the educational
 
01:36:22.229 --> 01:36:22.239 align:start position:0%
aspects of it and the data okay we've
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
asked the attorney general to
 
01:36:25.830 --> 01:36:25.840 align:start position:0%
investigate derry of why there were so
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
many overvoted ballots
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
you have received copy of that
 
01:36:32.790 --> 01:36:32.800 align:start position:0%
communication of that request he has not
 
01:36:34.950 --> 01:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
responded at all other than he had
 
01:36:37.030 --> 01:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
received the request all right so we
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
have an enforcement problem and we don't
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
know why there were so many overvoted
 
01:36:43.430 --> 01:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
ballots we just know that a lot of
 
01:36:46.709 --> 01:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
people in derry lost their votes
 
01:36:48.629 --> 01:36:48.639 align:start position:0%
for one or more contests and there's no
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
way to know uh how or why that happened
 
01:36:53.510 --> 01:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
if you could finish up please that would
 
01:36:55.030 --> 01:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
be terrific
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
november 2016 races and you can see um
 
01:37:01.750 --> 01:37:01.760 align:start position:0%
the information in the packet
 
01:37:03.990 --> 01:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
he acknowledged two to three percent of
 
01:37:06.790 --> 01:37:06.800 align:start position:0%
all ballots are not read by the scanner
 
01:37:08.709 --> 01:37:08.719 align:start position:0%
are legal votes
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
and you can see the margin of victory
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
for the president u.s and governor's
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
race in 2016.
 
01:37:17.669 --> 01:37:17.679 align:start position:0%
all of those came within that two to
 
01:37:20.790 --> 01:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
three percent possibility that over
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
votes alone might have caused a
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
different winner in each of those three
 
01:37:28.629 --> 01:37:28.639 align:start position:0%
contests thank you for that background
 
01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
excuse me i have one more thing
 
01:37:33.510 --> 01:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
representative griffin i did sign up for
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh five minutes and i've spent a lot of
 
01:37:37.830 --> 01:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
time on this issue thank you very much
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure you'll give mr scanlon all
 
01:37:42.070 --> 01:37:42.080 align:start position:0%
the time he needs to respond
 
01:37:43.830 --> 01:37:43.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'm going to just add on here what
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
i hope he will improve in the bill
 
01:37:47.830 --> 01:37:47.840 align:start position:0%
representative porter was very good in
 
01:37:49.830 --> 01:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
putting this in at the last minute there
 
01:37:51.430 --> 01:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
were some things that would make this
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill better and that's on page two
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
that's what i hope you will add to the
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
bill to improve it to make it comparable
 
01:38:01.590 --> 01:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
to what connecticut vermont and
 
01:38:03.910 --> 01:38:03.920 align:start position:0%
massachusetts are all doing now for
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
their voters we deserve the same
 
01:38:09.830 --> 01:38:09.840 align:start position:0%
respect for our votes as those states
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
are showing for theirs
 
01:38:13.189 --> 01:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i'm guessing
 
01:38:15.189 --> 01:38:15.199 align:start position:0%

01:40:56.550 --> 01:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
hb 491 and i would like to say that

if it is all possible
 
01:41:01.350 --> 01:41:01.360 align:start position:0%
um you know it would be great for all of
 
01:41:03.189 --> 01:41:03.199 align:start position:0%
us americans to have
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
hand counting everything and no machine
 
01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
please because the technologies
 
01:41:12.070 --> 01:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
is like too advanced
 
01:41:14.709 --> 01:41:14.719 align:start position:0%
that we the regular citizens have no
 
01:41:17.590 --> 01:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
idea of what it can do like for example
 
01:41:19.830 --> 01:41:19.840 align:start position:0%
my credit card can just be in my pocket
 
01:41:21.510 --> 01:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
and somebody can just walk by and they
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
can just steal all of my information and
 
01:41:26.310 --> 01:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
that that's a couple years old
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
information already and most people out
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
there don't even know that so we don't
 
01:41:33.189 --> 01:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
know what these machines doing we don't
 
01:41:34.950 --> 01:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
know what these software that they
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
update are doing so we have no clue so
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
we would prefer
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
hand counting if possible please thank

it won't take a minute to tell you that
 
01:42:59.350 --> 01:42:59.360 align:start position:0%
this sounds like a great bill and all
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
the for all the reasons that have been
 
01:43:03.750 --> 01:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
told to us and the fact that i'm not
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
worried anymore about somebody's privacy
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
being in
 
01:43:10.149 --> 01:43:10.159 align:start position:0%
embarrassed if by a machine kicking out
 
01:43:12.070 --> 01:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
a bill uh of
 
01:43:12.080 --> 01:43:13.109 align:start position:0%
a bill uh of
a

01:43:13.109 --> 01:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:43:15.750 --> 01:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
a ballot because there's ways to keep
 
01:43:17.750 --> 01:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
that private there's there's a way to
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
shield that and the person it's going to
 
01:43:22.390 --> 01:43:22.400 align:start position:0%
be so fast that a person could be
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
standing there and you just say wait a
 
01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:24.709 align:start position:0%
standing there and you just say wait a
second

01:43:24.709 --> 01:43:24.719 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:43:24.719 --> 01:43:25.669 align:start position:0%
second
because

01:43:25.669 --> 01:43:25.679 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:43:27.590 --> 01:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
it's obvious that some of the reasons
 
01:43:29.590 --> 01:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
it's not somebody being careless and
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
voting for too many people it's because
 
01:43:34.550 --> 01:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
of the machine reading reading something
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
incorrectly so i think it's a really
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
good idea so please vote for 491 thank
 
01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:40.550 align:start position:0%

committee i'm david scanlan deputy
 
01:44:12.470 --> 01:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and i'm here in
 
01:44:15.189 --> 01:44:15.199 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 491
 
01:44:18.470 --> 01:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh earlier in testimony you heard that
 
01:44:21.189 --> 01:44:21.199 align:start position:0%
section 301 of the help america vote act
 
01:44:23.590 --> 01:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
requires that overvoted absentee ballots
 
01:44:26.070 --> 01:44:26.080 align:start position:0%
be rejected what you were not told is
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
that there is an exemption that applies
 
01:44:29.590 --> 01:44:29.600 align:start position:0%
to the state of new hampshire
 
01:44:31.990 --> 01:44:32.000 align:start position:0%
in section b that says a state or
 
01:44:33.910 --> 01:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction that uses a paper ballot
 
01:44:36.870 --> 01:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
voting system which new hampshire does
 
01:44:40.790 --> 01:44:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:42.719 align:start position:0%
by establishing a voter education
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
program specific to that voting system
 
01:44:47.350 --> 01:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
that notifies each voter of the effect
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
of casting multiple votes for an office
 
01:44:51.750 --> 01:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
and providing the voter with
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
instructions on how to correct the
 
01:44:56.070 --> 01:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
ballot before it is cast and counted
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does both of those things
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
when a voter receives their ballot i
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
have a copy right here this section up
 
01:45:05.109 --> 01:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
here is the instructions to voters on
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
how to mark their ballot and what
 
01:45:08.550 --> 01:45:08.560 align:start position:0%
happens if they
 
01:45:10.950 --> 01:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
market improperly additionally when the
 
01:45:13.510 --> 01:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
voter goes into the voting booth there's
 
01:45:14.950 --> 01:45:14.960 align:start position:0%
one of these
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
informational posters that are that
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
should be hanging in the booth which
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
does the same thing so
 
01:45:22.550 --> 01:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire does satisfy the
 
01:45:25.030 --> 01:45:25.040 align:start position:0%
requirements that allow us to have an
 
01:45:27.030 --> 01:45:27.040 align:start position:0%
exemption from that provision of the
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
help america vote act
 
01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.390 align:start position:0%
help america vote act
uh

01:45:30.390 --> 01:45:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:45:32.310 --> 01:45:32.320 align:start position:0%
representative doma brian touched on the
 
01:45:34.390 --> 01:45:34.400 align:start position:0%
other really important component of this
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
issue and that is if you allow overvotes
 
01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
to be rejected
 
01:45:41.189 --> 01:45:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh by a machine
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
so that the voter can correct the
 
01:45:43.119 --> 01:45:44.390 align:start position:0%
so that the voter can correct the
mistake

01:45:44.390 --> 01:45:44.400 align:start position:0%
mistake
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
you are recl you are creating different
 
01:45:48.310 --> 01:45:48.320 align:start position:0%
classes of voters in the state of new
 
01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.430 align:start position:0%
classes of voters in the state of new
hampshire

01:45:49.430 --> 01:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
a voter that is voting on a hand count
 
01:45:54.870 --> 01:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
paper ballot makes their marks
 
01:45:56.790 --> 01:45:56.800 align:start position:0%
the ballot gets folded it's handed it to
 
01:45:58.870 --> 01:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
the moderator and that ballot gets
 
01:46:00.470 --> 01:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
dropped in the box the moderator does
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
not open that ballot up and look at it
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
and inform the voter if they've over
 
01:46:07.189 --> 01:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
voted giving the voter an opportunity to
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
go back and fix their ballot that simply
 
01:46:12.149 --> 01:46:12.159 align:start position:0%
does not happen that ballot whether the
 
01:46:14.149 --> 01:46:14.159 align:start position:0%
voter over voted on or not goes in the
 
01:46:16.149 --> 01:46:16.159 align:start position:0%
box and gets counted at the end of the
 
01:46:16.159 --> 01:46:17.189 align:start position:0%
box and gets counted at the end of the
night

01:46:17.189 --> 01:46:17.199 align:start position:0%
night
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
the same thing is true of voters that
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
vote by absentee whether it's in a hand
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
count town or whether it's in a machine
 
01:46:25.990 --> 01:46:26.000 align:start position:0%
count town when they over vote or if
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
they ever vote on their ballot that's
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
the way it is they do not have another
 
01:46:31.910 --> 01:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to correct
 
01:46:34.629 --> 01:46:34.639 align:start position:0%
any issues so to make sure that voters
 
01:46:36.629 --> 01:46:36.639 align:start position:0%
are treated the same way uniformly
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
across the board new hampshire does not
 
01:46:40.950 --> 01:46:40.960 align:start position:0%
reject the overvoted ballots that go
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
through the machine i think that's under
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
two minutes mountain chair i'll be happy
 
01:46:45.270 --> 01:46:45.280 align:start position:0%

01:46:48.390 --> 01:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
over but the timer is going to go off in
 
01:46:51.030 --> 01:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
five but so i'm gonna
 
01:46:53.669 --> 01:46:53.679 align:start position:0%
say ask if anybody here in the committee
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
room has a question for deputy scanlon
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
does anybody attending online you have a
 
01:47:04.390 --> 01:47:04.400 align:start position:0%

that the secretary of state's office

should have any kind of say in this
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
matter due to their lack of action and
 
01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.550 align:start position:0%
matter due to their lack of action and
integrity

01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
the screen
 
01:49:34.629 --> 01:49:34.639 align:start position:0%
representative so people know where you
 
01:49:36.310 --> 01:49:36.320 align:start position:0%
are because the screen is sort of hard
 
01:49:37.590 --> 01:49:37.600 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
01:49:41.189 --> 01:49:41.199 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative tim lang
 
01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:43.040 align:start position:0%
representing belknap four which are the
 
01:49:45.030 --> 01:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
towns of tilton sanderton i'm also a
 
01:49:46.470 --> 01:49:46.480 align:start position:0%
town moderator for the town of san
 
01:49:48.390 --> 01:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
britain have been so for nearly a decade
 
01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.189 align:start position:0%
britain have been so for nearly a decade
now

01:49:49.189 --> 01:49:49.199 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:49:52.629 --> 01:49:52.639 align:start position:0%
um that makes me feel old um so this
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
bill is pretty straightforward i'm not
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
going to walk through the details um i'm
 
01:49:58.390 --> 01:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
sure you could read it just ask me
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
questions if you'd like
 
01:50:01.990 --> 01:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
but what this bill does is just it's i
 
01:50:04.390 --> 01:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
consider an election integrity bill um
 
01:50:08.550 --> 01:50:08.560 align:start position:0%
in a in a november 2020 nbc news poll
 
01:50:10.870 --> 01:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
56 of americans decided they were not
 
01:50:12.629 --> 01:50:12.639 align:start position:0%
confident in the election process in
 
01:50:14.149 --> 01:50:14.159 align:start position:0%
that polling summary
 
01:50:14.159 --> 01:50:14.950 align:start position:0%
that polling summary
um

01:50:14.950 --> 01:50:14.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.790 --> 01:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
in reading that kind of activity i'm
 
01:50:18.709 --> 01:50:18.719 align:start position:0%
looking at how we can possibly restore
 
01:50:20.950 --> 01:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
faith in the electoral process and i
 
01:50:22.229 --> 01:50:22.239 align:start position:0%
think one of the things we always look
 
01:50:23.430 --> 01:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
at in almost everything we do in the
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
legislature especially when we're
 
01:50:25.830 --> 01:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
involving money and things that are
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
important because we do an audit um so
 
01:50:30.229 --> 01:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
this bill just allows a verification
 
01:50:32.310 --> 01:50:32.320 align:start position:0%
pound of polling places to act as an
 
01:50:35.109 --> 01:50:35.119 align:start position:0%
audit um but we know that there is an
 
01:50:37.189 --> 01:50:37.199 align:start position:0%
issue with faith you know in the process
 
01:50:39.189 --> 01:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
and the goal is to have this bill act as
 
01:50:41.430 --> 01:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
a as a fix for that and to start
 
01:50:43.669 --> 01:50:43.679 align:start position:0%
restoring faith in the process by having
 
01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:44.629 align:start position:0%
restoring faith in the process by having
a

01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:50:47.510 --> 01:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
quantitative and qualitative proof
 
01:50:49.350 --> 01:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
of election integrity in the ballots by
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
having uh these verification accounts
 
01:50:54.310 --> 01:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
done immediately following the election
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
um i will be happy to take questions but
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
i think like i said the bill itself is
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
pretty straightforward
 
01:51:02.629 --> 01:51:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you anybody in the committee
 
01:51:04.950 --> 01:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
room who has a question
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any representative mooney
 
01:51:09.430 --> 01:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
01:51:10.950 --> 01:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
and sponsoring the bill uh my question
 
01:51:15.990 --> 01:51:16.000 align:start position:0%
is this say for example a district
 
01:51:18.229 --> 01:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
requests a recount an individual
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
requests a recount could that be
 
01:51:23.669 --> 01:51:23.679 align:start position:0%
considered one of the random locations
 
01:51:25.109 --> 01:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
chosen by the
 
01:51:25.119 --> 01:51:27.189 align:start position:0%
chosen by the
sos

01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
sos
 
01:51:27.199 --> 01:51:28.390 align:start position:0%
sos
so

01:51:28.390 --> 01:51:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
i would say if it happened to be
 
01:51:32.070 --> 01:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
selected by the set uh by the secretary
 
01:51:34.550 --> 01:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
of state as one of his is random um
 
01:51:37.270 --> 01:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
options and then somebody request while
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
the recount period starts after this
 
01:51:40.790 --> 01:51:40.800 align:start position:0%
process starts after the recompense but
 
01:51:42.709 --> 01:51:42.719 align:start position:0%
again um
 
01:51:44.470 --> 01:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
they could use that but understand that
 
01:51:46.390 --> 01:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
this recount is not of a single race so
 
01:51:49.109 --> 01:51:49.119 align:start position:0%
this verification vote uh count is not
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
of a single race it's of the entire
 
01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
ballot um because as we know and i i was
 
01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:56.719 align:start position:0%
educated last night by the vice chairman
 
01:51:59.350 --> 01:51:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the last 50 years we've only had two
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
statewide recounts
 
01:52:03.030 --> 01:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
and that occurred in the 90s and in the
 
01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:04.470 align:start position:0%
and that occurred in the 90s and in the
70s

01:52:04.470 --> 01:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
70s
 
01:52:06.390 --> 01:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
it's never been done it rarely is done
 
01:52:08.070 --> 01:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
when you take an office like a
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
congressional district or governor's
 
01:52:11.830 --> 01:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
race or a presidential race um they're
 
01:52:13.430 --> 01:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
not recounting so we actually have no
 
01:52:15.350 --> 01:52:15.360 align:start position:0%
real data on what recounts look like in
 
01:52:17.910 --> 01:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
those races by doing this verification
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
vote it would it would capture all races
 
01:52:23.270 --> 01:52:23.280 align:start position:0%
on that ballot
 
01:52:27.030 --> 01:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman uh thank you
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
for taking my question representative
 
01:52:31.990 --> 01:52:32.000 align:start position:0%
lang this is
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
a question related to uh line six excuse
 
01:52:37.990 --> 01:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
me in line five
 
01:52:40.550 --> 01:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
where it says immediately preceding each
 
01:52:42.790 --> 01:52:42.800 align:start position:0%
state general election
 
01:52:44.310 --> 01:52:44.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i understand what that word
 
01:52:46.870 --> 01:52:46.880 align:start position:0%
means in that context proceeding
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
so it is immediately following you after
 
01:52:51.830 --> 01:52:51.840 align:start position:0%
so as soon as the election is done
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
if you look at the um line 24 on there
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
it talks about the verification count
 
01:52:59.910 --> 01:52:59.920 align:start position:0%
needs to be completed 21 days post
 
01:53:01.510 --> 01:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
election within that period of time from
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
when the election ends and 21 days later
 
01:53:04.629 --> 01:53:04.639 align:start position:0%
i just wasn't sure what the word
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
proceeding that that context thank you
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
any other questions from community
 
01:53:11.030 --> 01:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
members representatives
 
01:53:12.629 --> 01:53:12.639 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
representative lang
 
01:53:17.430 --> 01:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
why did you choose five there is none
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
done now and then it just jumped up to
 
01:53:21.109 --> 01:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
five but
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
where did that number come from thank
 
01:53:25.910 --> 01:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
you for your question so again in 2020
 
01:53:27.990 --> 01:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
we had over 800 thousand ballots cast
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
and the record in the state of new
 
01:53:31.830 --> 01:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
hampshire um i used a two percent margin
 
01:53:33.350 --> 01:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
saying i wanted if we were to count two
 
01:53:34.950 --> 01:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
percent of those ballots what number
 
01:53:35.990 --> 01:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
would that be
 
01:53:37.430 --> 01:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
and if you do the math based on the
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
number of five polling places in the way
 
01:53:41.589 --> 01:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
we've broken it up the minimum number if
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state took the easiest
 
01:53:45.910 --> 01:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
score possible he would hit 17 500
 
01:53:47.750 --> 01:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
ballots would be hand-counted
 
01:53:49.350 --> 01:53:49.360 align:start position:0%
and that would represent just over two
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
percent of the uh
 
01:53:53.510 --> 01:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
of the ballots total cast in the 2020
 
01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:55.589 align:start position:0%
of the ballots total cast in the 2020
election

01:53:55.589 --> 01:53:55.599 align:start position:0%
election
 
01:53:57.189 --> 01:53:57.199 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you
 
01:53:57.199 --> 01:53:58.550 align:start position:0%
a follow-up thank you
so

01:53:58.550 --> 01:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:02.950 --> 01:54:02.960 align:start position:0%
you say the easiest path do you mean if
 
01:54:04.950 --> 01:54:04.960 align:start position:0%
communities that were very small were
 
01:54:06.950 --> 01:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
chosen that would equal
 
01:54:06.960 --> 01:54:08.950 align:start position:0%
chosen that would equal
17

01:54:08.950 --> 01:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
17
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
500 what if
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
larger communities were chosen because
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
this is done randomly so what if it was
 
01:54:17.910 --> 01:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
nashua manchester conquered derry
 
01:54:20.310 --> 01:54:20.320 align:start position:0%
portsmouth so again if you in the in the
 
01:54:21.750 --> 01:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
context of the bill and maybe i should
 
01:54:23.270 --> 01:54:23.280 align:start position:0%
have went through it um there are five
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
basis places selected one of which has
 
01:54:27.030 --> 01:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
to be a polling place between two
 
01:54:29.030 --> 01:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
thousand and four thousand another one
 
01:54:30.629 --> 01:54:30.639 align:start position:0%
has to be a polling place between four
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
thousand and seventy five hundred
 
01:54:34.390 --> 01:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
another one has to be above seventy five
 
01:54:37.030 --> 01:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
hundred the other two could be any any
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
towns of any size so if you take the
 
01:54:40.870 --> 01:54:40.880 align:start position:0%
minimum numbers which is two thousand
 
01:54:42.390 --> 01:54:42.400 align:start position:0%
four thousand seventy five hundred you
 
01:54:44.470 --> 01:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
had those and then he added two more
 
01:54:46.310 --> 01:54:46.320 align:start position:0%
small towns of two thousand each you
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
still get the seventeen thousand five
 
01:54:50.390 --> 01:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
hundred ballots being counted
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien next question
 
01:55:02.070 --> 01:55:02.080 align:start position:0%
thank you how long would this take our
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
state officials to do so in the in the
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note that's attached the
 
01:55:08.070 --> 01:55:08.080 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office says he
 
01:55:09.430 --> 01:55:09.440 align:start position:0%
would need eight teams to do this and he
 
01:55:21.430 --> 01:55:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:21.440 --> 01:55:22.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

thank you representative for introducing
 
01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:25.350 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for introducing

representative paul desar you are with
 
01:55:51.510 --> 01:55:51.520 align:start position:0%

okay thank you uh this is representative
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
madam chair and this is representative
 
01:55:59.030 --> 01:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
albal the sow rock damn county district
 
01:56:02.310 --> 01:56:02.320 align:start position:0%
five londonderry and i am uh testifying
 
01:56:04.629 --> 01:56:04.639 align:start position:0%
from an undisclosed location
 
01:56:04.639 --> 01:56:05.510 align:start position:0%
from an undisclosed location
um

01:56:05.510 --> 01:56:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:08.790 --> 01:56:08.800 align:start position:0%
but anyways i i i definitely support of
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
this bill and one of the reasons why and
 
01:56:11.990 --> 01:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be quick is
 
01:56:14.149 --> 01:56:14.159 align:start position:0%
i've got more phone calls from people
 
01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
questioning the integrity of our vote
 
01:56:18.070 --> 01:56:18.080 align:start position:0%
that has gone on in the past
 
01:56:20.310 --> 01:56:20.320 align:start position:0%
and whether it's uh fair election or
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether it's not we'll never know
 
01:56:25.189 --> 01:56:25.199 align:start position:0%
i think the secretary of state uh needed
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
this authorization because like wyndham
 
01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
i was there for the recount they should
 
01:56:30.950 --> 01:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
have been somebody should have been on
 
01:56:33.189 --> 01:56:33.199 align:start position:0%
that right then and there a week later
 
01:56:35.669 --> 01:56:35.679 align:start position:0%
and got wyndham done the overvotes in
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
derry should have been uh audited right
 
01:56:40.950 --> 01:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
off the bat uh so this is a long overdue
 
01:56:43.030 --> 01:56:43.040 align:start position:0%
bill and i definitely support and i
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
thank representative blaine for bringing
 
01:56:46.629 --> 01:56:46.639 align:start position:0%
it forward and that's all i have thank
 
01:56:48.950 --> 01:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
any questions for representative
 
01:56:57.120 --> 01:56:57.130 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:57.130 --> 01:57:07.350 align:start position:0%
 
[Applause]

01:57:07.350 --> 01:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:10.390 --> 01:57:10.400 align:start position:0%
mr barnes i am promoting you to panelist
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
if you can unmute we'd love to hear from
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:19.270 --> 01:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh i'll be brief i
 
01:57:19.280 --> 01:57:20.310 align:start position:0%
uh i'll be brief i
support

01:57:20.310 --> 01:57:20.320 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:57:24.390 --> 01:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
this bill and random audits i would like
 
01:57:24.400 --> 01:57:25.910 align:start position:0%
this bill and random audits i would like
to

01:57:25.910 --> 01:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:57:28.070 --> 01:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
have faith in the secretary of state's
 
01:57:31.430 --> 01:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
office to do random audits that are
 
01:57:32.870 --> 01:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
thorough and
 
01:57:37.270 --> 01:57:37.280 align:start position:0%
protect the accuracy of the boats
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
again as i said earlier this morning i
 
01:57:43.350 --> 01:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the machine count votes are
 
01:57:46.310 --> 01:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:49.430 --> 01:57:49.440 align:start position:0%
well tampering fraud mistake error
 
01:57:52.709 --> 01:57:52.719 align:start position:0%
and all kinds of uh inaccuracies that
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
will undermine or could
 
01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.550 align:start position:0%
will undermine or could
undermine

01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
undermine
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
the uh accuracy of the vote count and
 
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.119 align:start position:0%
and that means of our democracy and
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
the more
 
01:58:07.030 --> 01:58:07.040 align:start position:0%
checking that there is on the accuracy
 
01:58:09.270 --> 01:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
of the vote that the better
 
01:58:11.990 --> 01:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
i supported the voters the public's
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
rights to come and uh review
 
01:58:16.629 --> 01:58:16.639 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
ballots as well and i think that random
 
01:58:21.109 --> 01:58:21.119 align:start position:0%
checks from the secretary of state's
 
01:58:21.119 --> 01:58:21.990 align:start position:0%
checks from the secretary of state's
office

01:58:21.990 --> 01:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:58:23.910 --> 01:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
would also
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
not only be able to catch some
 
01:58:28.709 --> 01:58:28.719 align:start position:0%
machine errors
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
but also
 
01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:33.189 align:start position:0%
but also
would

01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
gets served as a deterrent to districts
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:41.910 --> 01:58:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh districts to use
 
01:58:45.750 --> 01:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
machines that are not subject to
 
01:58:47.189 --> 01:58:47.199 align:start position:0%
such issues
 
01:58:49.350 --> 01:58:49.360 align:start position:0%
as somebody mentioned in an earlier
 
01:58:50.790 --> 01:58:50.800 align:start position:0%
hearing the
 
01:58:52.709 --> 01:58:52.719 align:start position:0%
software of the machines
 
01:58:54.550 --> 01:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
is the biggest problem it's proprietary
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
software usually nobody knows what
 
01:58:58.870 --> 01:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
what's in it how it works or who can
 
01:59:00.229 --> 01:59:00.239 align:start position:0%
tamper with it
 
01:59:02.390 --> 01:59:02.400 align:start position:0%
and just to have some
 
01:59:04.629 --> 01:59:04.639 align:start position:0%
actual checks on it
 
01:59:07.510 --> 01:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
and shedding some light on errors like
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
occurred in windham
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:59:12.470 --> 01:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to
 
01:59:15.990 --> 01:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
have public checks on the machines thank
 
01:59:18.870 --> 01:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
you that will yield no time and
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
i appreciate you hearing me
 
01:59:22.709 --> 01:59:22.719 align:start position:0%
hope you vote for pass
 
01:59:24.629 --> 01:59:24.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr barnes for staying with us
 
01:59:26.310 --> 01:59:26.320 align:start position:0%

01:59:29.189 --> 01:59:29.199 align:start position:0%
questions for mr barnes

i see none in the committee room and i'm
 
01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%

panelists if you can fund you you should
 
01:59:58.070 --> 01:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
can you hear me i can thank you welcome
 
02:00:02.229 --> 02:00:02.239 align:start position:0%
two minutes
 
02:00:04.390 --> 02:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you madam chair so my
 
02:00:06.629 --> 02:00:06.639 align:start position:0%
name is still mary jill and i'm from
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
derry i rise in support of house bill
 
02:00:12.149 --> 02:00:12.159 align:start position:0%
524 i applaud representative lang's
 
02:00:14.709 --> 02:00:14.719 align:start position:0%
effort to address the need to verify the
 
02:00:17.350 --> 02:00:17.360 align:start position:0%
machine count after the election it is
 
02:00:19.109 --> 02:00:19.119 align:start position:0%
long past time
 
02:00:21.910 --> 02:00:21.920 align:start position:0%
that we stop blindly
 
02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
that the machine count is infallible
 
02:00:26.229 --> 02:00:26.239 align:start position:0%
i would like to share some suggestions
 
02:00:28.070 --> 02:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
for strengthening the bill
 
02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
one to remove any suspicion that the
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
secretary of state purposely selected
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
favorable polling places i suggest that
 
02:00:36.950 --> 02:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
all the polling places be publicly and
 
02:00:39.270 --> 02:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
randomly selected within the criteria
 
02:00:41.109 --> 02:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
described in the bill
 
02:00:42.870 --> 02:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
second if the secretary of state is
 
02:00:44.629 --> 02:00:44.639 align:start position:0%
given 21 days to complete the
 
02:00:47.030 --> 02:00:47.040 align:start position:0%
verification count the law needs to
 
02:00:48.950 --> 02:00:48.960 align:start position:0%
define what happens if a different
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
winner is identified perhaps we should
 
02:00:53.669 --> 02:00:53.679 align:start position:0%
delay the final certification date until
 
02:00:56.149 --> 02:00:56.159 align:start position:0%
after the verification count
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
third the bill calls for further
 
02:01:00.149 --> 02:01:00.159 align:start position:0%
investigation if a two percent
 
02:01:02.229 --> 02:01:02.239 align:start position:0%
difference is found most highly
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
contested races in new hampshire result
 
02:01:06.310 --> 02:01:06.320 align:start position:0%
in differences of far less than two
 
02:01:08.870 --> 02:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
percent perhaps one percent is a better
 
02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
standard and finally the average number
 
02:01:13.589 --> 02:01:13.599 align:start position:0%
of ballots involved because of their
 
02:01:16.629 --> 02:01:16.639 align:start position:0%
criteria allowed and allowed in the bill
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
representative lang indicated with 17
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
500 minimum an average of at least 20
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
000 and as he pointed out
 
02:01:27.990 --> 02:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
with 12 races on each ballot it could
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
take days to finish the recount this
 
02:01:33.270 --> 02:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
raises a couple of issues if the counts
 
02:01:35.109 --> 02:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
are to occur in concord over multiple
 
02:01:37.350 --> 02:01:37.360 align:start position:0%
days the likelihood of public oversight
 
02:01:39.990 --> 02:01:40.000 align:start position:0%
will be minimal people have jobs and
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
lives to attend to also to
 
02:01:45.750 --> 02:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
02:01:48.149 --> 02:01:48.159 align:start position:0%
the number the designated races would be
 
02:01:51.270 --> 02:01:51.280 align:start position:0%
randomly selected such that every okay
 
02:01:53.109 --> 02:01:53.119 align:start position:0%
the number of races could be limited to
 
02:01:55.430 --> 02:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
one federal one state and one county
 
02:01:57.589 --> 02:01:57.599 align:start position:0%
race for each polling place the
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
designated races
 
02:02:01.589 --> 02:02:01.599 align:start position:0%
would be randomly selected such that
 
02:02:03.669 --> 02:02:03.679 align:start position:0%
every race is verified in at least one
 
02:02:06.070 --> 02:02:06.080 align:start position:0%
polling place again i believe this bill
 
02:02:08.229 --> 02:02:08.239 align:start position:0%

i have
 
02:02:47.910 --> 02:02:47.920 align:start position:0%

offer my support for this bill after
 
02:03:14.790 --> 02:03:14.800 align:start position:0%
this the nightmare across the nation
 
02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
from this last election i think we could
 
02:03:20.070 --> 02:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
set a standard in new hampshire for care
 
02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
in documenting and making sure things
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
are verified so this is really
 
02:03:29.109 --> 02:03:29.119 align:start position:0%
this i'm just very happy to hear so many
 
02:03:31.830 --> 02:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
bills that are so well thought out and
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
we know we have lots of people who offer
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
to do recounts but i would want to make
 
02:03:39.510 --> 02:03:39.520 align:start position:0%
sure that all the recounts that are done
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
are done with the same care that the
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office has always
 
02:03:46.550 --> 02:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
done with multiple people watching of
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
multiple parties uh so that there's
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
nobody walking out and say they cheated
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
you know they'll they're there so i
 
02:03:58.629 --> 02:03:58.639 align:start position:0%
really appreciate this so otp thank you
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%

02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:06.950 align:start position:0%

02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
i also appear to have a telephone that
 
02:04:12.790 --> 02:04:12.800 align:start position:0%

and
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%

what you've hit when you're on the phone
 
02:04:22.870 --> 02:04:22.880 align:start position:0%

bolia i represent tilton and samberton
 
02:04:40.709 --> 02:04:40.719 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to speak briefly on
 
02:04:42.870 --> 02:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
the bill good morning and thank you for
 
02:04:45.669 --> 02:04:45.679 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to address the committee
 
02:04:47.750 --> 02:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
as lawmakers i believe it is our mission
 
02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
now more than ever to strengthen
 
02:04:52.310 --> 02:04:52.320 align:start position:0%
democracy for all our voters by
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
promoting transparency in our elections
 
02:04:57.669 --> 02:04:57.679 align:start position:0%
not only is election cyber security
 
02:04:59.990 --> 02:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
important in every state but as a first
 
02:05:02.070 --> 02:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
in the nation primary state new
 
02:05:03.910 --> 02:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire is a top tier target for
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
election fraud
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
one way to promote the responsible use
 
02:05:10.310 --> 02:05:10.320 align:start position:0%
of technology which introduces risk
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
election risk
 
02:05:14.550 --> 02:05:14.560 align:start position:0%
is the implementation of audits to
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
counter that risk
 
02:05:20.550 --> 02:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
i ask the committee to vote ought to
 
02:05:24.070 --> 02:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
pass on house bill 524 which requires
 
02:05:27.109 --> 02:05:27.119 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state to conduct random
 
02:05:29.510 --> 02:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
verification counts of polling place
 
02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:31.109 align:start position:0%
verification counts of polling place
results

02:05:31.109 --> 02:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
results
 
02:05:33.750 --> 02:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
i was alarmed when i learned that we do
 
02:05:35.669 --> 02:05:35.679 align:start position:0%
not have a system of audits in new
 
02:05:35.679 --> 02:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
not have a system of audits in new
hampshire

02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
02:05:38.790 --> 02:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
with informed voters in mind i launched
 
02:05:41.030 --> 02:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
a website entitled the new hampshire
 
02:05:43.270 --> 02:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
election integrity project
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
at nh elections dot us to provide voters
 
02:05:49.109 --> 02:05:49.119 align:start position:0%
with information about our voting
 
02:05:51.910 --> 02:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
machines and transparency issues
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
i raise this issue not to promote the
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
website but to emphasize that election
 
02:05:57.990 --> 02:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
and integrity should be a new hampshire
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
state project
 
02:06:01.189 --> 02:06:01.199 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
02:06:03.270 --> 02:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
i researched audits in other states and
 
02:06:05.109 --> 02:06:05.119 align:start position:0%
found to my surprise that new hampshire
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
is one of the few states with no audits
 
02:06:08.950 --> 02:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
in place
 
02:06:11.830 --> 02:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
even massachusetts conducts audits
 
02:06:14.229 --> 02:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
one argument against the audits was that
 
02:06:17.030 --> 02:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
recounts happen anyway post-election as
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
candidates contest results
 
02:06:21.189 --> 02:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
that may be so but i asked the committee
 
02:06:23.430 --> 02:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
when a recount of federal election
 
02:06:26.390 --> 02:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
candidates has last taken place
 
02:06:29.510 --> 02:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
risk limiting audits such as this one
 
02:06:32.069 --> 02:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
are a common tool used by many other
 
02:06:34.709 --> 02:06:34.719 align:start position:0%
states to mitigate risk
 
02:06:36.470 --> 02:06:36.480 align:start position:0%
i have faith that the election law
 
02:06:38.709 --> 02:06:38.719 align:start position:0%
committee will do the right thing
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
and i'd like to thank representative
 
02:06:42.790 --> 02:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
lang for writing this bill and as i said
 
02:06:45.030 --> 02:06:45.040 align:start position:0%

02:06:47.430 --> 02:06:47.440 align:start position:0%

[Music]

02:07:46.310 --> 02:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:47.910 --> 02:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
we're having a little technical
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.430 --> 02:07:53.440 align:start position:0%

hear me you can thank you welcome
 
02:07:58.870 --> 02:07:58.880 align:start position:0%
hey just a quick couple quick comments
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
you know i'm a winter new hampshire
 
02:08:02.310 --> 02:08:02.320 align:start position:0%
resident and i've been following what's
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
going on here very closely and i you
 
02:08:07.270 --> 02:08:07.280 align:start position:0%
know with all due respect to this
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office i don't
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
think they're in touch with what's
 
02:08:12.629 --> 02:08:12.639 align:start position:0%
currently going on in new hampshire
 
02:08:15.350 --> 02:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
voter confidence is extremely low and i
 
02:08:18.229 --> 02:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
think there's a crisis right now of low
 
02:08:20.550 --> 02:08:20.560 align:start position:0%
voter confidence in new hampshire and i
 
02:08:22.310 --> 02:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
think you know what may have been an
 
02:08:24.310 --> 02:08:24.320 align:start position:0%
excuse in the past just doesn't count
 
02:08:26.950 --> 02:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
anymore i think that now we need to
 
02:08:29.430 --> 02:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
support all of these bills that point
 
02:08:31.589 --> 02:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
towards more intelligent election
 
02:08:31.599 --> 02:08:32.790 align:start position:0%
towards more intelligent election
integrity

02:08:32.790 --> 02:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
integrity
 
02:08:34.709 --> 02:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%

02:08:38.790 --> 02:08:38.800 align:start position:0%

we had 121 people sign up to support
 
02:09:05.119 --> 02:09:06.229 align:start position:0%
we had 121 people sign up to support
10

02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%

and
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
uh i think if we if
 
02:09:15.360 --> 02:09:21.030 align:start position:0%
uh i think if we if
mr

02:09:29.109 --> 02:09:29.119 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair and members of
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
the committee this is uh former
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative jeff oligney and no
 
02:09:36.310 --> 02:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
worries on the last name um i know it's
 
02:09:38.229 --> 02:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
easy to pronounce and you did better
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
than most um i'll speak very briefly in
 
02:09:44.709 --> 02:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
support of the bill and the premier
 
02:09:47.109 --> 02:09:47.119 align:start position:0%
previous representatives comments about
 
02:09:49.510 --> 02:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
ongoing random audits
 
02:09:52.870 --> 02:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
my career about 35 years and and going
 
02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
is as an engineer particularly
 
02:09:56.629 --> 02:09:56.639 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineer
 
02:09:59.750 --> 02:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
very deep into manufacturing quality and
 
02:10:02.709 --> 02:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
program management and a real quick
 
02:10:02.719 --> 02:10:03.669 align:start position:0%
program management and a real quick
story

02:10:03.669 --> 02:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
story
 
02:10:07.030 --> 02:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
of something that happened in 1950-ish
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
was a doctor by the name of j edward
 
02:10:12.149 --> 02:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
deming and he was a statistician and he
 
02:10:14.870 --> 02:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
tried to teach the americans how to make
 
02:10:17.189 --> 02:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
sure that their manufacturing processes
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
were in control and yielding the desired
 
02:10:20.239 --> 02:10:21.350 align:start position:0%
were in control and yielding the desired
results

02:10:21.350 --> 02:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
results
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the americans were too
 
02:10:27.109 --> 02:10:27.119 align:start position:0%
proud and had too much ego to listen to
 
02:10:30.069 --> 02:10:30.079 align:start position:0%
him so he went to japan
 
02:10:31.910 --> 02:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
this is the time when
 
02:10:33.350 --> 02:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you're if you're old
 
02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
enough like me to recall
 
02:10:38.390 --> 02:10:38.400 align:start position:0%
the uh the cars made by honda
 
02:10:39.910 --> 02:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
were junk
 
02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:40.709 align:start position:0%
were junk
um

02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
they and however after dr deming got a
 
02:10:45.589 --> 02:10:45.599 align:start position:0%
hold of the japanese manufacturing
 
02:10:48.470 --> 02:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
executives and after a number of years
 
02:10:51.030 --> 02:10:51.040 align:start position:0%
he implemented these random audits and
 
02:10:53.030 --> 02:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
process control measures to make sure
 
02:10:55.030 --> 02:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
that they're yielding the proper results
 
02:10:56.550 --> 02:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
from their efforts
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
and as you know as you well know today
 
02:11:01.750 --> 02:11:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh honda is one of the highest quality
 
02:11:04.229 --> 02:11:04.239 align:start position:0%
most most desirable vehicles that you
 
02:11:05.350 --> 02:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
can buy
 
02:11:07.589 --> 02:11:07.599 align:start position:0%
but the point of the story is that
 
02:11:10.390 --> 02:11:10.400 align:start position:0%
despite uh how we might think we know
 
02:11:14.149 --> 02:11:14.159 align:start position:0%
better uh the the statistics don't lie
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
and there are experts in this field and
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
i named one dr deming who
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
dramatically improved the performance of
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
an entire nation
 
02:11:26.069 --> 02:11:26.079 align:start position:0%
japan and um and
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
a brand obviously of the honda
 
02:11:29.750 --> 02:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
automobile brand
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
through their use of random audits if
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
you are not continuously monitoring your
 
02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.069 align:start position:0%
you are not continuously monitoring your
process

02:11:36.069 --> 02:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:11:36.079 --> 02:11:36.830 align:start position:0%
process
for

02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
performance in this case random audits
 
02:11:41.109 --> 02:11:41.119 align:start position:0%
is the way to do it
 
02:11:42.629 --> 02:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
then you really don't know how well
 
02:11:44.550 --> 02:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
you're performing and like likewise i'll
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
end with this i don't think we really
 
02:11:49.430 --> 02:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
know how big a problem voter fraud is or
 
02:11:52.310 --> 02:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
election integrity is unless we have
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
some real-time ongoing and that means
 
02:11:55.679 --> 02:11:57.030 align:start position:0%
some real-time ongoing and that means
forever

02:11:57.030 --> 02:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
forever
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
um ongoing random audits they don't have
 
02:12:01.910 --> 02:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
to be we don't audit every every polling
 
02:12:04.229 --> 02:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
place but we pick them at random and
 
02:12:07.109 --> 02:12:07.119 align:start position:0%
again the statistics don't lie anomalies
 
02:12:09.189 --> 02:12:09.199 align:start position:0%
will come forward and that will give us
 
02:12:11.750 --> 02:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to improve performance
 
02:12:14.790 --> 02:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
and correct some causes of anomalies so
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's it for me thanks for entertaining
 
02:12:19.430 --> 02:12:19.440 align:start position:0%
me and uh i highly support the bill um
 
02:12:20.290 --> 02:12:20.300 align:start position:0%
best to you all
 
02:12:20.300 --> 02:12:21.589 align:start position:0%
best to you all

thank you
um

02:12:23.910 --> 02:12:23.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:12:25.830 --> 02:12:25.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for mr
 
02:12:25.840 --> 02:12:27.589 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for mr

02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
olympia
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
all right at this time i'm going to ask
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
everybody in attendance to raise their
 
02:12:33.910 --> 02:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
hand because i'm going to close off
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
public comment if your hand is not
 
02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
raised at this point
 
02:12:40.709 --> 02:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
for house bill 524 you will not be
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
recognized i have one person raising
 
02:12:45.510 --> 02:12:45.520 align:start position:0%
their hand or someone who signed up
 
02:12:48.310 --> 02:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
um previously and i have a mr todd you
 
02:12:50.310 --> 02:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
each have two minutes to speak to this
 
02:12:54.550 --> 02:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill mr o'brien welcome to our panel
 
02:12:56.069 --> 02:12:56.079 align:start position:0%
welcome back
 
02:12:56.079 --> 02:12:57.510 align:start position:0%
welcome back

and you are with us if you want you
 
02:13:03.669 --> 02:13:03.679 align:start position:0%
you have two minutes but we are on 5 24
 
02:13:05.990 --> 02:13:06.000 align:start position:0%
regarding random verification counts of
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:12.870 --> 02:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
mr brian if you can unmute
 
02:13:14.870 --> 02:13:14.880 align:start position:0%
apologies manager my computer cut out
 
02:13:17.030 --> 02:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
for a moment um thank you madam chair
 
02:13:18.229 --> 02:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
michael o'brien i'm here i a lobbyist
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
with pretty strategies and representing
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
uh america votes here today i'm here in
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
support of the audit bill we have seen
 
02:13:29.750 --> 02:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
um audit bills in front of this
 
02:13:32.550 --> 02:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
committee in the past and do believe um
 
02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
that they are a good check um
 
02:13:38.709 --> 02:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
on elections i will say for this bill in
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
particular just to um to get into it a
 
02:13:42.790 --> 02:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
little bit um
 
02:13:44.390 --> 02:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
i would encourage the committee i've
 
02:13:45.990 --> 02:13:46.000 align:start position:0%
spent some time talking with some folks
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
who are experts around audits in
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
preparation of this bill um i do think
 
02:13:52.950 --> 02:13:52.960 align:start position:0%
there are some ways uh five locations is
 
02:13:55.189 --> 02:13:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably not enough to get a statistical
 
02:13:58.390 --> 02:13:58.400 align:start position:0%
um real cystic field for uh for the
 
02:13:59.589 --> 02:13:59.599 align:start position:0%
state so i'm not sure we need to audit
 
02:13:59.599 --> 02:14:00.550 align:start position:0%
state so i'm not sure we need to audit
every

02:14:00.550 --> 02:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
every
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
one but examining how many uh would be
 
02:14:03.440 --> 02:14:04.229 align:start position:0%
one but examining how many uh would be
good

02:14:04.229 --> 02:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
good
 
02:14:04.239 --> 02:14:06.149 align:start position:0%
good
um

02:14:06.149 --> 02:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
second requiring a full hand recount of
 
02:14:09.589 --> 02:14:09.599 align:start position:0%
every ballot is not necessarily the most
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
efficient way to conduct an audit it can
 
02:14:13.510 --> 02:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
be done more efficiently and reach the
 
02:14:14.950 --> 02:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
same level of confidence about the
 
02:14:16.550 --> 02:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
outcome by randomly selecting sample
 
02:14:18.709 --> 02:14:18.719 align:start position:0%
ballots from all the balance casts this
 
02:14:21.510 --> 02:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
will both save time um certainly in the
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
process but
 
02:14:24.870 --> 02:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
is is a good way and sort of a more
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
productive way to do that i would
 
02:14:28.629 --> 02:14:28.639 align:start position:0%
encourage uh everyone to interested in
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
this to look at some research done by
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
the democracy fund i think they do a
 
02:14:33.830 --> 02:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
good job uh summarizing the audits and
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
and lastly and quickly i'll just say
 
02:14:38.629 --> 02:14:38.639 align:start position:0%
we hear a lot about voter fraud and the
 
02:14:40.310 --> 02:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
statistics of people who believe that
 
02:14:43.030 --> 02:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
fraud is real um we just went through a
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
really divisive election in which fraud
 
02:14:46.149 --> 02:14:46.159 align:start position:0%
was mentioned every day on our
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
television screens um for at least six
 
02:14:51.109 --> 02:14:51.119 align:start position:0%
months um if not more than that it's not
 
02:14:52.629 --> 02:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
surprising that people believe that
 
02:14:55.430 --> 02:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
fraud is real based just on what they
 
02:14:57.750 --> 02:14:57.760 align:start position:0%
see and what they hear regardless of how
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
much truth or not truth there is to
 
02:14:59.440 --> 02:15:00.550 align:start position:0%
much truth or not truth there is to
those

02:15:00.550 --> 02:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
accusations so i think as we look at
 
02:15:05.669 --> 02:15:05.679 align:start position:0%
things that can help increase uh
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
people's belief in the system we should
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
be doing that knowing in the background
 
02:15:11.510 --> 02:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
that we also need to be very much aware
 
02:15:13.189 --> 02:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
of what our words are and what we say
 
02:15:14.790 --> 02:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
because they do impact people's faith as
 
02:15:14.800 --> 02:15:15.589 align:start position:0%
because they do impact people's faith as
well

02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%

in the manufacturing field as an
 
02:16:05.270 --> 02:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
engineer and uh one of the one of the
 
02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
stories that we learned during our
 
02:16:09.830 --> 02:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing courses is that uh this
 
02:16:12.470 --> 02:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
story of this uh statistician that left
 
02:16:16.870 --> 02:16:16.880 align:start position:0%

02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
percent a true story

my experience in the manufacturing field
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
and say that mr alignee is absolutely
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
correct we are constantly bouncing our
 
02:16:39.030 --> 02:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
processes off of our prints and making
 
02:16:40.469 --> 02:16:40.479 align:start position:0%
sure that we are yielding the correct
 
02:16:43.990 --> 02:16:44.000 align:start position:0%
results and uh this is a i 100 support a
 
02:16:46.469 --> 02:16:46.479 align:start position:0%
random audit and that audit should be
 
02:16:49.349 --> 02:16:49.359 align:start position:0%
bouncing our results off of what we said
 
02:16:51.429 --> 02:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
should be happening right how we're
 
02:16:53.589 --> 02:16:53.599 align:start position:0%
running it and what the uh and what the
 
02:16:55.110 --> 02:16:55.120 align:start position:0%
results are making sure we're yielding
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
the correct results and that's all i had
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%

house rules

that was on a different subject
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%

see in front of you
 
02:20:31.990 --> 02:20:32.000 align:start position:0%

02:21:53.910 --> 02:21:53.920 align:start position:0%

apologize for the late start it is my
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
intent to try to go on this for another
 
02:22:04.070 --> 02:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
hour before taking a short recess
 
02:22:06.070 --> 02:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
um when we take that short recess we
 
02:22:08.790 --> 02:22:08.800 align:start position:0%

02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%

02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh for members of the public and
 
02:22:14.790 --> 02:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
committee members we do have executive
 
02:22:16.550 --> 02:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
sessions scheduled today
 
02:22:19.910 --> 02:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
and it is my open intent that given i
 
02:22:22.309 --> 02:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
understand there seems to be a consensus
 
02:22:24.630 --> 02:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
and agreement as to how to proceed with
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
these issues raised by the wind and
 
02:22:28.950 --> 02:22:28.960 align:start position:0%
voting results that we will indeed be
 
02:22:31.510 --> 02:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
able to get our business done because
 
02:22:33.270 --> 02:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
there are a number of people who have
 
02:22:35.670 --> 02:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
done a lot of hard work
 
02:22:39.830 --> 02:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:39.840 --> 02:22:40.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%

this i want to thank senator gaida for
 
02:23:50.790 --> 02:23:50.800 align:start position:0%

all the work that he's done
it's

02:23:51.910 --> 02:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:23:53.750 --> 02:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
it's unbelievable how much time and
 
02:23:56.389 --> 02:23:56.399 align:start position:0%
effort he's put into this
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
this concern
 
02:23:59.910 --> 02:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
and finding a solution to it over the
 
02:24:01.429 --> 02:24:01.439 align:start position:0%
past couple of months
 
02:24:03.510 --> 02:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to make sure that our
 
02:24:03.520 --> 02:24:04.870 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to make sure that our
elections

02:24:04.870 --> 02:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:24:08.790 --> 02:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
mean something that our votes count and
 
02:24:10.309 --> 02:24:10.319 align:start position:0%
i think without the work of senator
 
02:24:12.790 --> 02:24:12.800 align:start position:0%
gaida we wouldn't be here today
 
02:24:15.030 --> 02:24:15.040 align:start position:0%
i also want to thank
 
02:24:17.270 --> 02:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state gardner
 
02:24:19.429 --> 02:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
i reached out to him
 
02:24:21.349 --> 02:24:21.359 align:start position:0%
on my own yesterday
 
02:24:23.910 --> 02:24:23.920 align:start position:0%
realizing that when me
 
02:24:25.429 --> 02:24:25.439 align:start position:0%
when the hearing happened today that
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
there might be a lot of people that
 
02:24:28.150 --> 02:24:28.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak that there might be
 
02:24:28.160 --> 02:24:29.670 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak that there might be
different

02:24:29.670 --> 02:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:24:31.590 --> 02:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
consensus as to which way to move
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward and it was my concern that maybe
 
02:24:34.800 --> 02:24:36.150 align:start position:0%
forward and it was my concern that maybe
maybe

02:24:36.150 --> 02:24:36.160 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:24:36.160 --> 02:24:37.190 align:start position:0%
maybe
this

02:24:37.190 --> 02:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
solution might get derailed so i reached
 
02:24:41.349 --> 02:24:41.359 align:start position:0%
out to the secretary
 
02:24:42.950 --> 02:24:42.960 align:start position:0%
to see what his concerns were and to
 
02:24:44.469 --> 02:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
share mine
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
and i was very surprised and pleased
 
02:24:47.120 --> 02:24:48.309 align:start position:0%
and i was very surprised and pleased
that

02:24:48.309 --> 02:24:48.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:24:50.550 --> 02:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
we spoke for about three hours and we we
 
02:24:52.550 --> 02:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
literally just had a conversation and it
 
02:24:54.230 --> 02:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
was very cordial
 
02:24:56.389 --> 02:24:56.399 align:start position:0%
and it was very uh heartwarming
 
02:24:59.830 --> 02:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
to hear and to understand that
 
02:25:01.910 --> 02:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
his his major concern was that he did
 
02:25:03.510 --> 02:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
not want to
 
02:25:05.510 --> 02:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
create a precedent that would be carried
 
02:25:07.910 --> 02:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
forward where a recount of a recount
 
02:25:09.349 --> 02:25:09.359 align:start position:0%
took place
 
02:25:12.389 --> 02:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
and and after talking about that we
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
go to address some of the issues that
 
02:25:15.830 --> 02:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
were of concern
 
02:25:18.389 --> 02:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i believe we found
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
a process that addresses
 
02:25:23.429 --> 02:25:23.439 align:start position:0%
all of my concerns and all the concerns
 
02:25:25.349 --> 02:25:25.359 align:start position:0%
that i've heard from others
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
and so i'd like to just go through that
 
02:25:30.630 --> 02:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
so that everybody can understand where
 
02:25:32.630 --> 02:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
we're at and i'm very pleased that
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
chairman griffin is on board and that
 
02:25:38.550 --> 02:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
all the uh all the other people
 
02:25:38.560 --> 02:25:39.670 align:start position:0%
all the uh all the other people
involved

02:25:39.670 --> 02:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
involved
 
02:25:41.910 --> 02:25:41.920 align:start position:0%
to this point of my knowledge are
 
02:25:43.590 --> 02:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
completely on board
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
so before i get into that though i also
 
02:25:47.830 --> 02:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
want to acknowledge dr dave strang he
 
02:25:49.750 --> 02:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
spent an awful lot of time with the
 
02:25:51.349 --> 02:25:51.359 align:start position:0%
senator and myself
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
and tom murray as well
 
02:25:53.040 --> 02:25:54.469 align:start position:0%
and tom murray as well
working

02:25:54.469 --> 02:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
working
 
02:25:57.190 --> 02:25:57.200 align:start position:0%
doing the data and just
 
02:25:58.950 --> 02:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
defining what the concerns are and what
 
02:26:01.110 --> 02:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
the possible solutions are
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
so as i said so just a quick recap i'm
 
02:26:05.270 --> 02:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
sure everybody knows that there was a
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
huge discrepancy between november 3rd
 
02:26:09.190 --> 02:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
and november 12th
 
02:26:12.790 --> 02:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
and you know people are concerned about
 
02:26:14.630 --> 02:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
different possible reasons for that my
 
02:26:16.150 --> 02:26:16.160 align:start position:0%
concern has always been we don't know
 
02:26:18.150 --> 02:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
the answer and in order to get the
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
answer we need to do a thorough and
 
02:26:22.469 --> 02:26:22.479 align:start position:0%
complete analysis
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
and i'm really
 
02:26:27.030 --> 02:26:27.040 align:start position:0%
happy with the fact that um
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know we've come up with something
 
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
it might take a slightly different path
 
02:26:33.110 --> 02:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
than what others
 
02:26:35.830 --> 02:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
have have in their minds but i i urge
 
02:26:37.590 --> 02:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
you to wait until i'm done reading what
 
02:26:39.510 --> 02:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to and think about it
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
because like i said i believe this
 
02:26:44.150 --> 02:26:44.160 align:start position:0%
addresses every issue thoroughly and
 
02:26:44.160 --> 02:26:45.750 align:start position:0%
addresses every issue thoroughly and
completely

02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
completely
 
02:26:49.429 --> 02:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:51.590 --> 02:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know the bottom line for me is do
 
02:26:54.550 --> 02:26:54.560 align:start position:0%
wintam's voting machines work properly
 
02:26:56.389 --> 02:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
and and that's what this is going to
 
02:26:56.399 --> 02:26:57.670 align:start position:0%
and and that's what this is going to
address

02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%
address
 
02:27:01.110 --> 02:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
so from there i want to read
 
02:27:03.429 --> 02:27:03.439 align:start position:0%
uh oh no i also want to include uh the
 
02:27:05.830 --> 02:27:05.840 align:start position:0%

and he's been uh he's he's been
 
02:27:16.630 --> 02:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
wonderful we had a meeting
 
02:27:20.550 --> 02:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
uh last monday to discuss
 
02:27:21.910 --> 02:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:27:24.630 --> 02:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
and uh this all the entire select board
 
02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.560 align:start position:0%
was in complete agreement and there were
 
02:27:28.950 --> 02:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
people there who shared their thoughts
 
02:27:31.030 --> 02:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
and even the vendor who takes care of
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
our machines and one of our moderators
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
we're in complete support of a full
 
02:27:36.230 --> 02:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
forensic audit on our machines and
 
02:27:37.670 --> 02:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
ballots so
 
02:27:39.270 --> 02:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
this is an issue where everybody's on
 
02:27:41.750 --> 02:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
board and and i'm really glad that we're
 
02:27:44.309 --> 02:27:44.319 align:start position:0%
here so i'm going to read through what
 
02:27:45.170 --> 02:27:45.180 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to
 
02:27:45.180 --> 02:27:46.230 align:start position:0%
we've agreed to
[Music]

02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:27:47.830 --> 02:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then i'll come back and i'll just
 
02:27:50.070 --> 02:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
give a couple thoughts uh as to what
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
this is and then
 
02:27:53.510 --> 02:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
i think everybody will have a good
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
understanding and hopefully feel good
 
02:27:56.830 --> 02:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
about this
 
02:27:59.990 --> 02:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
so there's three three items here the
 
02:28:02.309 --> 02:28:02.319 align:start position:0%
first one is all four of the windham new
 
02:28:04.309 --> 02:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
hampshire accuvote voting machines and
 
02:28:07.270 --> 02:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
ballots will be analyzed by a team of
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
forensic analysts
 
02:28:11.190 --> 02:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
one forensic analyst will be chosen from
 
02:28:13.110 --> 02:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
each of the two groups below to perform
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
a full forensic analysis
 
02:28:18.630 --> 02:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
group a and the secretary will pick the
 
02:28:20.710 --> 02:28:20.720 align:start position:0%
person from this group this
 
02:28:24.230 --> 02:28:24.240 align:start position:0%
includes harry hirsty ron rivest
 
02:28:26.630 --> 02:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
and andrew appel
 
02:28:28.309 --> 02:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
these are people that the secretary has
 
02:28:30.389 --> 02:28:30.399 align:start position:0%
worked with in the past and he feels
 
02:28:32.230 --> 02:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
very comfortable with i'm actually
 
02:28:34.630 --> 02:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
familiar with the first name on the list
 
02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:35.750 align:start position:0%
familiar with the first name on the list
and

02:28:35.750 --> 02:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:28:38.389 --> 02:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
and i trust that the secretary's
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
analysis of the others are also very
 
02:28:40.560 --> 02:28:41.830 align:start position:0%
analysis of the others are also very
accurate

02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
02:28:43.670 --> 02:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
and the secretary has graciously allowed
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
me to pick the name from the second list
 
02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
and on that is colonel phil waldron and
 
02:28:51.429 --> 02:28:51.439 align:start position:0%
dr shiva ayadure
 
02:28:53.750 --> 02:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
and they will work together in addition
 
02:28:55.349 --> 02:28:55.359 align:start position:0%
there'll be a third person working on
 
02:28:57.349 --> 02:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
the team and that is jovan hutton
 
02:28:57.359 --> 02:28:58.710 align:start position:0%
the team and that is jovan hutton
pulitzer

02:28:58.710 --> 02:28:58.720 align:start position:0%
pulitzer
 
02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
who will also be a member of the
 
02:29:01.670 --> 02:29:01.680 align:start position:0%
forensic team
 
02:29:04.630 --> 02:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
the forensic analysts will determine in
 
02:29:06.630 --> 02:29:06.640 align:start position:0%
their own discretion the process that
 
02:29:08.389 --> 02:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
will be followed
 
02:29:10.950 --> 02:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
for the forensic analysis so this is an
 
02:29:13.750 --> 02:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
independent forensic analysis
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire secretary of state and
 
02:29:18.230 --> 02:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
the town of windham will provide the
 
02:29:19.910 --> 02:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
forensic analysts with whatever
 
02:29:19.920 --> 02:29:21.110 align:start position:0%
forensic analysts with whatever
resources

02:29:21.110 --> 02:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
resources
 
02:29:23.429 --> 02:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
the analysts need necessary to perform a
 
02:29:25.990 --> 02:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
complete and thorough forensic analysis
 
02:29:28.150 --> 02:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
including but not limited to
 
02:29:32.469 --> 02:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
full access to the accuvote machines
 
02:29:34.309 --> 02:29:34.319 align:start position:0%
and all of the ballots from the windham
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:40.550 --> 02:29:40.560 align:start position:0%
i want to point out
 
02:29:42.469 --> 02:29:42.479 align:start position:0%
that i'm going to deviate from the
 
02:29:44.150 --> 02:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
script just a little bit i want to point
 
02:29:45.670 --> 02:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
out that the machines will remain in the
 
02:29:49.830 --> 02:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
custody of the windham town officials
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
audit will take place
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
in a location other than windham where
 
02:29:57.030 --> 02:29:57.040 align:start position:0%
the customary recount locations
 
02:30:00.550 --> 02:30:00.560 align:start position:0%
for the secretary of state
 
02:30:02.790 --> 02:30:02.800 align:start position:0%
right now what's being proposed is the
 
02:30:04.790 --> 02:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
police standards and training facility
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
in concord because it's set up to handle
 
02:30:09.750 --> 02:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
a process of this size and there's a lot
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
of cameras
 
02:30:13.030 --> 02:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
that can be made available to
 
02:30:14.630 --> 02:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
ensure the integrity and the
 
02:30:17.030 --> 02:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
transparency of the process which is
 
02:30:21.750 --> 02:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
the forensic team will produce a report
 
02:30:25.750 --> 02:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
of their findings and present to the
 
02:30:27.270 --> 02:30:27.280 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
02:30:29.910 --> 02:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
who will make it available to the public
 
02:30:29.920 --> 02:30:32.150 align:start position:0%
who will make it available to the public
forthwith

02:30:32.150 --> 02:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
forthwith
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
number two all of the windham new
 
02:30:36.550 --> 02:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire ballots from the november 3
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
2020 election will be tallied through
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
each of windham's four accuvote machines
 
02:30:44.550 --> 02:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
the paper tapes from all four machines
 
02:30:47.270 --> 02:30:47.280 align:start position:0%
will show the results for all races
 
02:30:49.510 --> 02:30:49.520 align:start position:0%
be compared with each other
 
02:30:51.910 --> 02:30:51.920 align:start position:0%
and be included with in the forensic
 
02:30:51.920 --> 02:30:53.510 align:start position:0%
and be included with in the forensic
report

02:30:53.510 --> 02:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
report
 
02:30:54.790 --> 02:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
number three
 
02:30:57.190 --> 02:30:57.200 align:start position:0%
a hand count by the secretary of state's
 
02:31:00.550 --> 02:31:00.560 align:start position:0%
office will be performed on two races
 
02:31:02.469 --> 02:31:02.479 align:start position:0%
other than the rockingham county
 
02:31:05.750 --> 02:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
district 7 state rep race
 
02:31:05.760 --> 02:31:06.710 align:start position:0%
district 7 state rep race
so

02:31:06.710 --> 02:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
some people might think that we need to
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
do another recount on that rate so
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
that's it that's that's what we've
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
agreed to and i just want to provide
 
02:31:16.230 --> 02:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
just a couple comments
 
02:31:18.469 --> 02:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
to allay what what people might think
 
02:31:21.830 --> 02:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.230 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
by not doing a second recount on the
 
02:31:27.270 --> 02:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
district 7 state rep race we've met the
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
concerns of secretary of state gardner
 
02:31:30.560 --> 02:31:31.510 align:start position:0%
concerns of secretary of state gardner
and

02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
i believe that whatever answers are not
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
provided with that particular race not
 
02:31:39.270 --> 02:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
being recounted
 
02:31:41.030 --> 02:31:41.040 align:start position:0%
we're still going to have a recount by
 
02:31:42.950 --> 02:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office which
 
02:31:45.030 --> 02:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
can then be compared with the results
 
02:31:47.510 --> 02:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
from the four hacky vote machines and
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
all of those paper tape ballots will be
 
02:31:51.349 --> 02:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
made available so we can compare them
 
02:31:51.359 --> 02:31:52.790 align:start position:0%
made available so we can compare them
ourselves

02:31:52.790 --> 02:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
in addition to that we are going to have
 
02:31:57.110 --> 02:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
a full forensic
 
02:32:00.469 --> 02:32:00.479 align:start position:0%
audit and analysis of all the ballots
 
02:32:02.469 --> 02:32:02.479 align:start position:0%
and all the machines
 
02:32:02.479 --> 02:32:03.750 align:start position:0%
and all the machines
so

02:32:03.750 --> 02:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:06.150 --> 02:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
the people involved there
 
02:32:06.160 --> 02:32:07.830 align:start position:0%
the people involved there
are

02:32:07.830 --> 02:32:07.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:32:10.389 --> 02:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
that i've spoken to so far i've spoken
 
02:32:13.349 --> 02:32:13.359 align:start position:0%
to three people but um colonel waldron i
 
02:32:15.190 --> 02:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
spoke with this morning he's he's
 
02:32:17.910 --> 02:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
available he can he can perform this
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
audit within the next 45 days as will be
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
mandated by this bill
 
02:32:24.469 --> 02:32:24.479 align:start position:0%
i've been in contact with joe von hutton
 
02:32:27.110 --> 02:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
bulwitzer uh he's a paper guy he's the
 
02:32:28.550 --> 02:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
ballot guy so
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
from my perspective
 
02:32:31.750 --> 02:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
this is covered
 
02:32:31.760 --> 02:32:32.790 align:start position:0%
this is covered
with

02:32:32.790 --> 02:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:32:34.150 --> 02:32:34.160 align:start position:0%

um
 
02:35:22.550 --> 02:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
we'll work on that i'm not quite sure
 
02:35:22.560 --> 02:35:23.750 align:start position:0%
we'll work on that i'm not quite sure
why

02:35:23.750 --> 02:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
why
 
02:35:25.670 --> 02:35:25.680 align:start position:0%
people are coming through
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be all right does anybody
 
02:35:29.270 --> 02:35:29.280 align:start position:0%
else on the committee have a question
 
02:35:31.510 --> 02:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
for mr ring and when we get i don't
 
02:35:34.230 --> 02:35:34.240 align:start position:0%
think mr iron is going anywhere so if we
 
02:35:36.150 --> 02:35:36.160 align:start position:0%
figure it out we can go back to
 
02:35:38.389 --> 02:35:38.399 align:start position:0%
representative lane representative ryan
 
02:35:38.399 --> 02:35:41.670 align:start position:0%
representative lane representative ryan

02:35:43.030 --> 02:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
i'm can you hear me now
 
02:35:48.389 --> 02:35:48.399 align:start position:0%
everything's fine okay all right so i i
 
02:35:50.150 --> 02:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
i put in my headsets i don't know what i
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
did but um
 
02:35:53.190 --> 02:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm sorry um
 
02:35:55.910 --> 02:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
i i came in just a few minutes late and
 
02:35:58.070 --> 02:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm just is this a bill that is
 
02:36:00.150 --> 02:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
being proposed to us and have we
 
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
received copies of it or is this
 
02:36:04.710 --> 02:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
we're not going to have a hearing on the
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
bills and the amendments
 
02:36:09.429 --> 02:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
you representative lane for your
 
02:36:13.349 --> 02:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
question if you look at the bill for sb
 
02:36:15.670 --> 02:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
uh 43 and it's one of the reasons that
 
02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
senator gray is still online i hope
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
um there is sort of um a general
 
02:36:24.150 --> 02:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
overview and this has certainly gotten
 
02:36:26.309 --> 02:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
much more specific as to what's going to
 
02:36:27.429 --> 02:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
be done
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
um there has not been a specific
 
02:36:31.830 --> 02:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
amendment worked out
 
02:36:33.990 --> 02:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
um there was some question between
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
people as to whether the amendment the
 
02:36:36.399 --> 02:36:37.349 align:start position:0%
people as to whether the amendment the
bill

02:36:37.349 --> 02:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:36:39.910 --> 02:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
sb 43 as we have it
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
um is sufficient to cover everything
 
02:36:43.990 --> 02:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
that has been agreed
 
02:36:46.870 --> 02:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
it is my suspicion that the committee
 
02:36:48.790 --> 02:36:48.800 align:start position:0%
after hearing from people will think
 
02:36:50.630 --> 02:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
that an amendment to address the
 
02:36:53.670 --> 02:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
specifics of what is being proposed is
 
02:36:55.750 --> 02:36:55.760 align:start position:0%
probably appropriate
 
02:36:58.790 --> 02:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and that uh something else will be done
 
02:37:01.990 --> 02:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
for the committee for its deliberation
 
02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
but given the the
 
02:37:05.920 --> 02:37:07.110 align:start position:0%
but given the the
issues

02:37:07.110 --> 02:37:07.120 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
there were some people thought that sb
 
02:37:11.670 --> 02:37:11.680 align:start position:0%
43 in its current form before the
 
02:37:14.309 --> 02:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
committee would be sufficient
 
02:37:16.550 --> 02:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
um to cover what we're talking about
 
02:37:18.469 --> 02:37:18.479 align:start position:0%
today so i think the committee will need
 
02:37:21.030 --> 02:37:21.040 align:start position:0%
to have some discussion as to whether an
 
02:37:22.950 --> 02:37:22.960 align:start position:0%
amendment is appropriate after we hear
 
02:37:22.960 --> 02:37:25.590 align:start position:0%
amendment is appropriate after we hear
everything

02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
adam chairman i interject briefly that
 
02:37:29.590 --> 02:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment that was
 
02:37:31.670 --> 02:37:31.680 align:start position:0%
circulated to all the committee members
 
02:37:34.550 --> 02:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
last night at 7 00 p.m there are a
 
02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
number of amendments that have been
 
02:37:38.389 --> 02:37:38.399 align:start position:0%
circulated to committee members and none
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
of them have been generated in
 
02:37:41.910 --> 02:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
accordance with what we're talking about
 
02:37:44.389 --> 02:37:44.399 align:start position:0%
this morning okay that is my
 
02:37:44.399 --> 02:37:46.230 align:start position:0%
this morning okay that is my
understanding

02:37:46.230 --> 02:37:46.240 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
um we have amendments from and senator
 
02:37:51.990 --> 02:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
guy will be hearing from this morning
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
um we have some something that's been
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
proposed by a representative from
 
02:37:56.880 --> 02:37:57.990 align:start position:0%
proposed by a representative from
windham

02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
windham
 
02:38:00.550 --> 02:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
uh there have been a number of
 
02:38:02.870 --> 02:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
amendments forwarded to committee
 
02:38:04.230 --> 02:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
members so
 
02:38:06.870 --> 02:38:06.880 align:start position:0%
um at this point talking about the bill
 
02:38:09.670 --> 02:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
which is before us sb 43
 
02:38:12.230 --> 02:38:12.240 align:start position:0%
and what has been agreed
 
02:38:12.240 --> 02:38:13.429 align:start position:0%
and what has been agreed
okay

02:38:13.429 --> 02:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:38:15.750 --> 02:38:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and i apologize
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
for having missed the first few minutes
 
02:38:20.790 --> 02:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
i i do have a question could i do a
 
02:38:23.110 --> 02:38:23.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
 
02:38:23.120 --> 02:38:24.389 align:start position:0%
follow-up sure
um

02:38:24.389 --> 02:38:24.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:27.110 --> 02:38:27.120 align:start position:0%
i did hear that the the goal was do
 
02:38:29.590 --> 02:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
windham's machines work
 
02:38:29.600 --> 02:38:30.950 align:start position:0%
windham's machines work
properly

02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:38:32.309 --> 02:38:32.319 align:start position:0%
is there
 
02:38:34.150 --> 02:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
and i understand the focus is on the
 
02:38:36.630 --> 02:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
machines but what if the machines are
 
02:38:41.270 --> 02:38:41.280 align:start position:0%
fine but we still have this discrepancy
 
02:38:45.670 --> 02:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:48.150 --> 02:38:48.160 align:start position:0%
oh wait if mr ellering i'm gonna allow
 
02:38:49.990 --> 02:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
you to address the answer to that
 
02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:51.110 align:start position:0%
you to address the answer to that
question

02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
okay well it's my thought and it's my
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
belief that if we
 
02:38:58.710 --> 02:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
allow these forensic analysts to come in
 
02:39:01.110 --> 02:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
that they'll they'll do a thorough job
 
02:39:03.190 --> 02:39:03.200 align:start position:0%
and they'll find whatever
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%

the
 
02:40:10.870 --> 02:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
friday before the
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
runoff election for the senate
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
and uh he was testifying in their senate
 
02:40:18.309 --> 02:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
hearing committee about elections and
 
02:40:21.030 --> 02:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
while that hearing was going on his team
 
02:40:22.389 --> 02:40:22.399 align:start position:0%

to one of the polling places

to one of the polling places
live

02:40:26.550 --> 02:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:40:29.110 --> 02:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
and saw that saw the voting taking place
 
02:40:32.070 --> 02:40:32.080 align:start position:0%
in real time and also with data packets
 
02:40:35.110 --> 02:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
being transmitted over to china and back
 
02:40:35.120 --> 02:40:35.990 align:start position:0%
being transmitted over to china and back
and

02:40:35.990 --> 02:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:37.910 --> 02:40:37.920 align:start position:0%
and he reported that to the committee so
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
these people have impeccable
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the equipment of the
 
02:40:45.670 --> 02:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
technology standpoint they're going to
 
02:40:46.950 --> 02:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
look at the machines they're going to
 
02:40:48.630 --> 02:40:48.640 align:start position:0%
check the scanners
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
they'll check the programs on the
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
machines they'll compare them across
 
02:40:53.349 --> 02:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
each machine
 
02:40:53.359 --> 02:40:54.710 align:start position:0%
each machine
and

02:40:54.710 --> 02:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:56.230 --> 02:40:56.240 align:start position:0%
and they'll also look at the ballots
 
02:40:57.910 --> 02:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
they're going to scan the ballots with a
 
02:40:59.590 --> 02:40:59.600 align:start position:0%
third-party device
 
02:41:00.710 --> 02:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:41:02.309 --> 02:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
that'll be a cross-reference to make
 
02:41:05.349 --> 02:41:05.359 align:start position:0%
sure that the results uh came back
 
02:41:07.830 --> 02:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
accurately with the machines that we use
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
in all of our elections and at that
 
02:41:12.469 --> 02:41:12.479 align:start position:0%
point we're going to eliminate uh the
 
02:41:14.790 --> 02:41:14.800 align:start position:0%
ballots and the technology and if the
 
02:41:16.389 --> 02:41:16.399 align:start position:0%
questions haven't been answered then
 
02:41:18.070 --> 02:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
it'll be up to the secretary of state's
 
02:41:20.389 --> 02:41:20.399 align:start position:0%
office to try to and and our town
 
02:41:22.150 --> 02:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
election officials to try to figure out
 
02:41:24.309 --> 02:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
where the issue occurred but you know
 
02:41:25.910 --> 02:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
for my concern and i think from the
 
02:41:28.469 --> 02:41:28.479 align:start position:0%
concern of many people in the public is
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure that our votes
 
02:41:33.110 --> 02:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
as they're being tabulated by machines
 
02:41:35.750 --> 02:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
are accurately calculated and totaled so
 
02:41:37.830 --> 02:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we know who won so
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the people that we're voting for
 
02:41:43.670 --> 02:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:45.190 --> 02:41:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:41:46.870 --> 02:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
thank you too
 
02:41:48.710 --> 02:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative cody
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes ma'am chad i i guess i'm trying to
 
02:41:52.870 --> 02:41:52.880 align:start position:0%
figure out what in what context the
 
02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
gentleman's remarks are taking place we
 
02:41:56.790 --> 02:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
have the bill before us we have several
 
02:41:56.800 --> 02:41:58.550 align:start position:0%
have the bill before us we have several
amendments

02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
02:42:01.429 --> 02:42:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh could he help me with that
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
no he probably couldn't i don't know
 
02:42:05.670 --> 02:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
that he has seen all the amendments some
 
02:42:07.510 --> 02:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
of what is being
 
02:42:10.230 --> 02:42:10.240 align:start position:0%
there are people who believe that
 
02:42:13.590 --> 02:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
nothing needs to be amended in sb 43 to
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
proceed as it is
 
02:42:15.680 --> 02:42:16.469 align:start position:0%
proceed as it is
so

02:42:16.469 --> 02:42:16.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
it is my hope that given the issue the
 
02:42:21.830 --> 02:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
importance and the agreement
 
02:42:25.030 --> 02:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
that the committee is able to attend to
 
02:42:27.590 --> 02:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
what representatives who are directly
 
02:42:30.630 --> 02:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
involved in this process or would be
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
have to say about the process that
 
02:42:35.270 --> 02:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
senator ray who is here from the senate
 
02:42:37.349 --> 02:42:37.359 align:start position:0%
indicates that
 
02:42:39.990 --> 02:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
either there is a further amendment that
 
02:42:41.670 --> 02:42:41.680 align:start position:0%
he thinks it's appropriate or this
 
02:42:44.150 --> 02:42:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee thinks is appropriate um i
 
02:42:46.150 --> 02:42:46.160 align:start position:0%
understand it is confusing to have a
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
number of amendments down and if
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to speak to their
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
amendment as we proceed
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
um i think we can do that but i
 
02:42:57.349 --> 02:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
apologize for the confusion but uh given
 
02:42:58.950 --> 02:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
the circumstances
 
02:43:01.429 --> 02:43:01.439 align:start position:0%
this committee will do the best it can
 
02:43:03.590 --> 02:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
i excuse me manchester i wasn't asking
 
02:43:05.429 --> 02:43:05.439 align:start position:0%
his opinion of the amendments i was
 
02:43:07.830 --> 02:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
asking for the content context of his
 
02:43:07.840 --> 02:43:11.750 align:start position:0%
asking for the content context of his
discussion

02:43:11.750 --> 02:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
how does his proposal fit into what we
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
are supposed to do
 
02:43:23.030 --> 02:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:25.270 --> 02:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's up to our committee to
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
decide i think there was concern about
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
getting something on the record as to
 
02:43:31.270 --> 02:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
what actually
 
02:43:33.349 --> 02:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
is going to occur
 
02:43:33.359 --> 02:43:34.230 align:start position:0%
is going to occur
and

02:43:34.230 --> 02:43:34.240 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
i think our committee has the option of
 
02:43:40.630 --> 02:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
drafting an amendment with the specifics
 
02:43:42.790 --> 02:43:42.800 align:start position:0%
if it feels necessary
 
02:43:44.550 --> 02:43:44.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm trying to figure out whose
 
02:43:47.349 --> 02:43:47.359 align:start position:0%
auspices these discussions took place
 
02:43:49.510 --> 02:43:49.520 align:start position:0%
and who was involved with them
 
02:43:51.429 --> 02:43:51.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:43:55.670 --> 02:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:59.030 --> 02:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
i thought uh mr eyring said who he had
 
02:44:00.630 --> 02:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
spoken to but
 
02:44:03.750 --> 02:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps not representative
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
question of the chairman
 
02:44:08.070 --> 02:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so
 
02:44:10.230 --> 02:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
what we heard was aaron discussed in the
 
02:44:12.230 --> 02:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
agreement that uh
 
02:44:14.070 --> 02:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
and set forth
 
02:44:16.230 --> 02:44:16.240 align:start position:0%
just want to clarify that is that is
 
02:44:18.309 --> 02:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
separate from the hearing on this bill
 
02:44:20.150 --> 02:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
in essence am i understanding that
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
correctly or not
 
02:44:23.030 --> 02:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
i think what we're hearing is what's
 
02:44:26.389 --> 02:44:26.399 align:start position:0%
being proposed as the
 
02:44:30.070 --> 02:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
as the remedy to be performed whether it
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
is directly as a result of sb 43 as it
 
02:44:35.670 --> 02:44:35.680 align:start position:0%
stands in words now or whether it is
 
02:44:35.680 --> 02:44:41.670 align:start position:0%
stands in words now or whether it is
amended

02:44:41.670 --> 02:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:43.830 --> 02:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
thank you ma'am chairman i wonder if we
 
02:44:48.150 --> 02:44:48.160 align:start position:0%
could just ask the previous speaker to
 
02:44:50.630 --> 02:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
submit in writing the summary that he
 
02:44:52.389 --> 02:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
read or
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
stated to us so that we have a better
 
02:44:56.710 --> 02:44:56.720 align:start position:0%
understanding about the details for
 
02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
example i heard
 
02:45:00.790 --> 02:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
frequent references to machines but does
 
02:45:02.469 --> 02:45:02.479 align:start position:0%
that include the memory cards that are
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
used in those machines will it be an
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
analysis done to those uh so in short if
 
02:45:09.750 --> 02:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
if he could give us a summary of a
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
written summary what he discussed that
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful
 
02:45:15.030 --> 02:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that will be possible i do
 
02:45:16.790 --> 02:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
think some of the specificity that i
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
know committee members like to
 
02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:19.910 align:start position:0%

leaving the details to the forensic

audit team given their standing because
 
02:45:31.110 --> 02:45:31.120 align:start position:0%

02:45:33.110 --> 02:45:33.120 align:start position:0%
get into too many specifics in regards
 
02:45:34.630 --> 02:45:34.640 align:start position:0%
to what's going on
 
02:45:37.190 --> 02:45:37.200 align:start position:0%
um if we miss something then it becomes
 
02:45:38.870 --> 02:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
02:45:41.990 --> 02:45:42.000 align:start position:0%

going to take some some time to complete
and

02:50:42.870 --> 02:50:42.880 align:start position:0%

have any sort of clue
 
02:51:57.990 --> 02:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
or is this we're in the dark we need
 
02:51:59.510 --> 02:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill to try to figure out what
 
02:52:03.990 --> 02:52:04.000 align:start position:0%

no i i i don't i was going to today
 
02:52:22.550 --> 02:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
02:52:24.790 --> 02:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
the recounts that we've done
 
02:52:24.800 --> 02:52:25.830 align:start position:0%
the recounts that we've done
uh

02:52:25.830 --> 02:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:25.840 --> 02:52:26.790 align:start position:0%
uh
that

02:52:26.790 --> 02:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:52:29.190 --> 02:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
you know because there's been a lot of
 
02:52:30.790 --> 02:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
chatter about
 
02:52:33.750 --> 02:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
was this the biggest discrepancy ever or
 
02:52:38.630 --> 02:52:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:41.110 --> 02:52:41.120 align:start position:0%
and the answer is no
 
02:52:43.830 --> 02:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
and were there many recounts that had
 
02:52:46.469 --> 02:52:46.479 align:start position:0%
percentages higher than this yes
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:50.000 --> 02:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:52:51.990 --> 02:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:52:54.070 --> 02:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
so but it it
 
02:52:56.630 --> 02:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
it obviously has
 
02:52:58.950 --> 02:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
generated a lot of concern
 
02:53:00.630 --> 02:53:00.640 align:start position:0%
and interest
 
02:53:00.640 --> 02:53:02.710 align:start position:0%
and interest
and

02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:08.389 --> 02:53:08.399 align:start position:0%
we'll have some answers
 
02:53:08.399 --> 02:53:11.670 align:start position:0%
we'll have some answers
uh

02:53:11.670 --> 02:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:11.680 --> 02:53:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
it's

02:53:14.550 --> 02:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:17.190 --> 02:53:17.200 align:start position:0%
some sometimes it's hard
 
02:53:18.950 --> 02:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
to get the answers
 
02:53:18.960 --> 02:53:19.990 align:start position:0%
to get the answers
and

02:53:19.990 --> 02:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:53:22.550 --> 02:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
this is going to be an attempt
 
02:53:27.830 --> 02:53:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:36.070 --> 02:53:36.080 align:start position:0%

thank you madam chairman thank you
 
02:54:08.230 --> 02:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
to christy governor taking my question
 
02:54:10.469 --> 02:54:10.479 align:start position:0%
if we follow the plan that was just
 
02:54:14.630 --> 02:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
and if
 
02:54:16.160 --> 02:54:17.190 align:start position:0%
and if
this

02:54:17.190 --> 02:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:54:19.429 --> 02:54:19.439 align:start position:0%
focus on the voting machines indicates
 
02:54:21.190 --> 02:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
that the voting machines function
 
02:54:21.200 --> 02:54:23.670 align:start position:0%
that the voting machines function
properly

02:54:23.670 --> 02:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
properly
 
02:54:27.030 --> 02:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
will we have gained any insight into
 
02:54:31.110 --> 02:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
why the 300 roughly 300 vote discrepancy
 
02:54:33.750 --> 02:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
occurred in those state rep
 
02:54:33.760 --> 02:54:35.349 align:start position:0%
occurred in those state rep
recounts

02:54:35.349 --> 02:54:35.359 align:start position:0%
recounts
 
02:54:37.910 --> 02:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that
 
02:54:39.590 --> 02:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
machines work properly then there is
 
02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
still more investigation to be done to
 
02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
determine the exact cause of the
 
02:54:44.000 --> 02:54:45.429 align:start position:0%
determine the exact cause of the
discrepancy

02:54:45.429 --> 02:54:45.439 align:start position:0%
discrepancy
 
02:54:47.830 --> 02:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
the rockingham center recounts so will i
 
02:54:47.840 --> 02:54:49.349 align:start position:0%
the rockingham center recounts so will i
know

02:54:49.349 --> 02:54:49.359 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:54:51.030 --> 02:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
what caused that
 
02:54:55.510 --> 02:54:55.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:57.830 --> 02:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
well i certainly
 
02:55:00.309 --> 02:55:00.319 align:start position:0%
hope that we will
 
02:55:02.469 --> 02:55:02.479 align:start position:0%
that's uh
 
02:55:04.630 --> 02:55:04.640 align:start position:0%
and i think that this
 
02:55:04.640 --> 02:55:06.630 align:start position:0%
and i think that this
is

02:55:06.630 --> 02:55:06.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
the best
 
02:55:11.190 --> 02:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:14.950 --> 02:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:16.389 --> 02:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the follow-up madam

chairman uh
 
02:55:20.070 --> 02:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
i noted the plan is describing me for
 
02:55:21.269 --> 02:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
which i've not yet seen any
 
02:55:23.910 --> 02:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
documentation that it says there'll be
 
02:55:27.349 --> 02:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
no second recount of uh rockingham seven
 
02:55:29.670 --> 02:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
if i understood that correctly so if the
 
02:55:31.349 --> 02:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
machines are shown
 
02:55:33.510 --> 02:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
have worked properly i'm not sure how i
 
02:55:35.830 --> 02:55:35.840 align:start position:0%
would get the answer to what exactly
 
02:55:38.950 --> 02:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
happened in rocket games
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
i'd like to understand that better
 
02:55:40.399 --> 02:55:41.349 align:start position:0%
i'd like to understand that better
please

02:55:41.349 --> 02:55:41.359 align:start position:0%

uh
 
02:55:46.479 --> 02:55:47.910 align:start position:0%
uh
is

02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:47.920 align:start position:0%

a second recount
 
02:55:56.240 --> 02:55:57.510 align:start position:0%
a second recount
it's

02:55:57.510 --> 02:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:55:57.520 --> 02:55:58.630 align:start position:0%
it's
called

02:55:58.630 --> 02:55:58.640 align:start position:0%
called
 
02:56:00.870 --> 02:56:00.880 align:start position:0%

between
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
the winner and the loser and changes

that occurred at the recount that
 
02:57:50.389 --> 02:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
have been
 
02:57:53.269 --> 02:57:53.279 align:start position:0%
greater than this one
 
02:57:53.279 --> 02:57:56.150 align:start position:0%
greater than this one
uh

02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:56.160 --> 02:57:57.110 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:57:57.110 --> 02:57:57.120 align:start position:0%

02:58:03.030 --> 02:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
difference
 
02:58:04.950 --> 02:58:04.960 align:start position:0%
that the
 
02:58:04.960 --> 02:58:06.230 align:start position:0%
that the
one

02:58:06.230 --> 02:58:06.240 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:58:08.230 --> 02:58:08.240 align:start position:0%
only one candidate
 
02:58:09.990 --> 02:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
of eight
 
02:58:13.510 --> 02:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
on the ballot for state representative
 
02:58:17.429 --> 02:58:17.439 align:start position:0%
lost votes in this recount only one
 
02:58:19.590 --> 02:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
every other candidate three of the
 
02:58:21.590 --> 02:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
democrats and four of the republicans
 
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
all gained votes
 
02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:25.590 align:start position:0%
all gained votes
and

02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:58:27.910 --> 02:58:27.920 align:start position:0%
that in combination
 
02:58:27.920 --> 02:58:29.030 align:start position:0%
that in combination
with

02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:58:31.349 --> 02:58:31.359 align:start position:0%
the increase
 
02:58:33.349 --> 02:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
uh number of
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
votes that we found at the recount
 
02:58:39.030 --> 02:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
makes it a little bit
 
02:58:42.710 --> 02:58:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:45.830 --> 02:58:45.840 align:start position:0%
in a small way but but it does make it
 
02:58:48.550 --> 02:58:48.560 align:start position:0%
unique and
 
02:58:48.560 --> 02:58:52.230 align:start position:0%
unique and
uh

02:58:52.230 --> 02:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:52.240 --> 02:58:53.750 align:start position:0%
 
there's

02:58:53.750 --> 02:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
there's
 
02:58:57.510 --> 02:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of concern about it and
 
02:58:59.590 --> 02:58:59.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of people feel really strongly
 
02:59:01.110 --> 02:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
about it and
 
02:59:04.550 --> 02:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
you know you listen to the debate about
 
02:59:09.110 --> 02:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:09.120 --> 02:59:09.910 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:59:09.910 --> 02:59:09.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:09.920 --> 02:59:11.990 align:start position:0%
and
this

02:59:11.990 --> 02:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:59:12.000 --> 02:59:14.550 align:start position:0%
this
uh

02:59:14.550 --> 02:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:17.910 --> 02:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
this meme that they had in wyndham
 
02:59:19.830 --> 02:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
a really
 
02:59:24.389 --> 02:59:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:26.790 --> 02:59:26.800 align:start position:0%
talking about it bringing it
 
02:59:29.510 --> 02:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
some of the things that uh
 
02:59:31.830 --> 02:59:31.840 align:start position:0%
were known down there but might not have
 
02:59:33.830 --> 02:59:33.840 align:start position:0%
been known known in other parts of the
 
02:59:33.840 --> 02:59:34.710 align:start position:0%
been known known in other parts of the
state

02:59:34.710 --> 02:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
state
 
02:59:34.720 --> 02:59:35.990 align:start position:0%
state
and

02:59:35.990 --> 02:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:59:36.000 --> 02:59:37.910 align:start position:0%
and
so

02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:37.920 --> 02:59:39.910 align:start position:0%
so
it's

02:59:39.910 --> 02:59:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:59:42.710 --> 02:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
i think this is the appropriate way and
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's a good way to do it and it's a way
 
02:59:45.600 --> 02:59:46.790 align:start position:0%
it's a good way to do it and it's a way
that

02:59:46.790 --> 02:59:46.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
hopefully we're going to end up with
 
02:59:50.870 --> 02:59:50.880 align:start position:0%
answers sometimes you just can't
 
02:59:50.880 --> 02:59:53.349 align:start position:0%
answers sometimes you just can't
get

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:55.349 --> 02:59:55.359 align:start position:0%
a definitive answer
 
02:59:57.269 --> 02:59:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you secretary gardner further
 
02:59:58.790 --> 02:59:58.800 align:start position:0%
questions for secretary gardner
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
representative barry uh yes
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner um
 
03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
does your office
 
03:00:08.469 --> 03:00:08.479 align:start position:0%
understand that there are a large
 
03:00:10.710 --> 03:00:10.720 align:start position:0%
percent of the voting electorate that
 
03:00:13.030 --> 03:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
are skeptical of our elections the way
 
03:00:15.269 --> 03:00:15.279 align:start position:0%
we conduct them and do you believe that
 
03:00:16.630 --> 03:00:16.640 align:start position:0%
this audit
 
03:00:18.550 --> 03:00:18.560 align:start position:0%
would help alleviate some of those fears
 
03:00:20.230 --> 03:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
and concerns which i believe are very
 
03:00:20.240 --> 03:00:23.110 align:start position:0%
and concerns which i believe are very
legitimate

03:00:23.110 --> 03:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:25.110 --> 03:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
yes i would
 
03:00:26.870 --> 03:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
all right representative
 
03:00:28.230 --> 03:00:28.240 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:00:29.590 --> 03:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner for taking the
 
03:00:29.600 --> 03:00:31.030 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner for taking the
question

03:00:31.030 --> 03:00:31.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:00:33.830 --> 03:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
is it safe to say that if um the
 
03:00:35.429 --> 03:00:35.439 align:start position:0%
candidate in windham had asked for
 
03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
recount had not asked the recount we
 
03:00:39.830 --> 03:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
would admit never have known of any
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
potential anomalies in that
 
03:00:43.439 --> 03:00:46.630 align:start position:0%
potential anomalies in that
election

03:00:46.630 --> 03:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:48.710 --> 03:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask for clarification
 
03:00:50.950 --> 03:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
as to what you need for
 
03:00:50.960 --> 03:00:51.830 align:start position:0%
as to what you need for
trojan anomalies

03:00:51.830 --> 03:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
trojan anomalies
 
03:00:53.990 --> 03:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's been significant discussion in
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
the public sphere as to anomalies but
 
03:00:58.469 --> 03:00:58.479 align:start position:0%
those had to do with the machine council
 
03:01:00.070 --> 03:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
had nothing to do with free counseling
 
03:01:03.110 --> 03:01:03.120 align:start position:0%
let me rephrase the question then
 
03:01:04.550 --> 03:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
the reason
 
03:01:06.389 --> 03:01:06.399 align:start position:0%
and maybe i'm wrong in this i'm trying
 
03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
to get clarification
 
03:01:08.000 --> 03:01:08.950 align:start position:0%
to get clarification
um

03:01:08.950 --> 03:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:11.269 --> 03:01:11.279 align:start position:0%
if the candidate
 
03:01:12.950 --> 03:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
that asked for recount
 
03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
the state rep candidate in windham had
 
03:01:17.670 --> 03:01:17.680 align:start position:0%
never asked for a recount
 
03:01:19.349 --> 03:01:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's safe to say we would never been
 
03:01:21.269 --> 03:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
aware of any
 
03:01:21.279 --> 03:01:23.190 align:start position:0%
aware of any
particular

03:01:23.190 --> 03:01:23.200 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:01:24.630 --> 03:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
i'm using it normally because that's
 
03:01:26.230 --> 03:01:26.240 align:start position:0%
what we're calling it but
 
03:01:26.240 --> 03:01:26.590 align:start position:0%
what we're calling it but
um

03:01:26.590 --> 03:01:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:01:26.600 --> 03:01:29.830 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

03:01:29.830 --> 03:01:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:32.830 --> 03:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
potentially yeah go
 
03:01:35.670 --> 03:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
ahead you know a potential problem with
 
03:01:38.389 --> 03:01:38.399 align:start position:0%
the results in other words
 
03:01:40.389 --> 03:01:40.399 align:start position:0%
i understand if we had if they hadn't
 
03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
asked for recount we would have never
 
03:01:43.349 --> 03:01:43.359 align:start position:0%
known there was a problem there maybe
 
03:01:46.309 --> 03:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
that's a better way to ask it
 
03:01:47.670 --> 03:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
well i would
 
03:01:49.269 --> 03:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:01:50.790 --> 03:01:50.800 align:start position:0%
nothing would happen
 
03:01:52.790 --> 03:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:01:55.590 --> 03:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
because in this case the winner
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
i mean the most first of all
 
03:01:59.990 --> 03:02:00.000 align:start position:0%
what's first and foremost
 
03:02:03.110 --> 03:02:03.120 align:start position:0%
is that we make sure that every person
 
03:02:06.150 --> 03:02:06.160 align:start position:0%
who serves an elected office
 
03:02:08.630 --> 03:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
was the duly elected person for that
 
03:02:08.640 --> 03:02:10.070 align:start position:0%
was the duly elected person for that
office

03:02:10.070 --> 03:02:10.080 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:02:12.070 --> 03:02:12.080 align:start position:0%
and i can
 
03:02:14.230 --> 03:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
unequivocally say that
 
03:02:16.469 --> 03:02:16.479 align:start position:0%
in my years
 
03:02:19.750 --> 03:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
every person who has served has been the
 
03:02:19.760 --> 03:02:20.870 align:start position:0%
every person who has served has been the
person

03:02:20.870 --> 03:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
person
 
03:02:24.070 --> 03:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
who got the most votes
 
03:02:24.080 --> 03:02:25.429 align:start position:0%
who got the most votes
and

03:02:25.429 --> 03:02:25.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:02:28.150 --> 03:02:28.160 align:start position:0%
in a case where you have a recount and
 
03:02:30.469 --> 03:02:30.479 align:start position:0%
the winner on election night is also the
 
03:02:32.230 --> 03:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
winner after the
 
03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:36.469 align:start position:0%
winner after the
recount

03:02:36.469 --> 03:02:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
those instances
 
03:02:39.279 --> 03:02:40.469 align:start position:0%
those instances
usually

03:02:40.469 --> 03:02:40.479 align:start position:0%
usually
 
03:02:44.070 --> 03:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
just end right there
 
03:02:46.389 --> 03:02:46.399 align:start position:0%
i can add that
 
03:02:49.670 --> 03:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
if you go back to 2000 yeah i've done
 
03:02:53.110 --> 03:02:53.120 align:start position:0%
just about 600 recounts over the years
 
03:02:54.870 --> 03:02:54.880 align:start position:0%
so i've seen
 
03:02:56.309 --> 03:02:56.319 align:start position:0%
i've i've
 
03:02:59.349 --> 03:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
overseen 11 recounts that ended in a tie
 
03:02:59.359 --> 03:03:00.870 align:start position:0%
overseen 11 recounts that ended in a tie
vote

03:03:00.870 --> 03:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:03:04.469 --> 03:03:04.479 align:start position:0%
i've overseen 32 recounts that ended in
 
03:03:07.349 --> 03:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
a person winning by one
 
03:03:07.359 --> 03:03:09.269 align:start position:0%
a person winning by one
vote

03:03:09.269 --> 03:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
vote
 
03:03:11.590 --> 03:03:11.600 align:start position:0%
over 200 of them were single because
 
03:03:13.349 --> 03:03:13.359 align:start position:0%
recounts tend to be
 
03:03:13.359 --> 03:03:14.950 align:start position:0%
recounts tend to be
close

03:03:14.950 --> 03:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
close
 
03:03:16.870 --> 03:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
but there has been
 
03:03:20.150 --> 03:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
an example of what you're
 
03:03:21.590 --> 03:03:21.600 align:start position:0%
asking about
 
03:03:23.990 --> 03:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
in 2008
 
03:03:26.630 --> 03:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
we had a recount in windham
 
03:03:29.590 --> 03:03:29.600 align:start position:0%
for a state representative race
 
03:03:31.429 --> 03:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
in a primary
 
03:03:33.750 --> 03:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
that a candidate
 
03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
received 430 votes
 
03:03:39.750 --> 03:03:39.760 align:start position:0%
on election night
 
03:03:42.349 --> 03:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
and after the recount the candidate had
 
03:03:45.429 --> 03:03:45.439 align:start position:0%
621 votes
 
03:03:46.429 --> 03:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
that was
 
03:03:51.670 --> 03:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
191 votes that is far greater
 
03:03:55.830 --> 03:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
difference than this particular recount
 
03:03:55.840 --> 03:03:56.630 align:start position:0%
difference than this particular recount
but

03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:03:58.150 --> 03:03:58.160 align:start position:0%
it was a
 
03:03:58.160 --> 03:04:00.469 align:start position:0%
it was a
multi-candidate

03:04:00.469 --> 03:04:00.479 align:start position:0%
multi-candidate
 
03:04:04.469 --> 03:04:04.479 align:start position:0%
race and the person was
 
03:04:06.230 --> 03:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
if the person didn't
 
03:04:08.630 --> 03:04:08.640 align:start position:0%
get those additional votes the person
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
still would have
 
03:04:12.630 --> 03:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
uh one
 
03:04:15.429 --> 03:04:15.439 align:start position:0%
so it depends on the situation that
 
03:04:15.439 --> 03:04:16.710 align:start position:0%
so it depends on the situation that
uh

03:04:16.710 --> 03:04:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:04:18.630 --> 03:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:04:20.710 --> 03:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
when you have
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
the number of human beings that we have
 
03:04:24.710 --> 03:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
involved in our
 
03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:28.160 align:start position:0%
elections we have over 6 000
 
03:04:31.910 --> 03:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:34.309 --> 03:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
humans as we know can make a
 
03:04:36.710 --> 03:04:36.720 align:start position:0%
mathematical error there can be a human
 
03:04:39.269 --> 03:04:39.279 align:start position:0%
error here or there
 
03:04:42.790 --> 03:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
not that it's deliberate
 
03:04:44.710 --> 03:04:44.720 align:start position:0%
but it happens
 
03:04:44.720 --> 03:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
but it happens
and

03:04:46.070 --> 03:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:04:47.429 --> 03:04:47.439 align:start position:0%
you can't get
 
03:04:47.439 --> 03:04:50.070 align:start position:0%
you can't get
perfection

03:04:50.070 --> 03:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
perfection
 
03:04:53.429 --> 03:04:53.439 align:start position:0%
but what you want for perfection is that
 
03:04:55.269 --> 03:04:55.279 align:start position:0%
the right person
 
03:04:58.150 --> 03:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
actually was able to win the nomination
 
03:05:00.309 --> 03:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
and be on the ballot in november or win
 
03:05:01.750 --> 03:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
the election
 
03:05:03.429 --> 03:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
and serve
 
03:05:07.510 --> 03:05:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:09.190 --> 03:05:09.200 align:start position:0%
thank you secretary gardner further
 
03:05:14.389 --> 03:05:14.399 align:start position:0%

senator gaia
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
senator gaia i believe
 
03:05:28.309 --> 03:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
you're all set to join us this morning
 
03:05:29.990 --> 03:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
03:05:32.070 --> 03:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and um members
 
03:05:33.510 --> 03:05:33.520 align:start position:0%
of the committee
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
um we meet today to reaffirm the
 
03:05:37.990 --> 03:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
integrity of our elections it's that
 
03:05:38.000 --> 03:05:39.190 align:start position:0%
integrity of our elections it's that
simple

03:05:39.190 --> 03:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
simple
 
03:05:41.110 --> 03:05:41.120 align:start position:0%
the chronology and the extant facts that
 
03:05:42.790 --> 03:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
brought us here are well documented and
 
03:05:45.590 --> 03:05:45.600 align:start position:0%
public they don't require repeating
 
03:05:47.590 --> 03:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
one race in one community produced a
 
03:05:49.590 --> 03:05:49.600 align:start position:0%
significant vote count disparity
 
03:05:52.309 --> 03:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
captured during a subsequent recount
 
03:05:53.750 --> 03:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
that disparity would not have been
 
03:05:55.910 --> 03:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
discovered without that recount why is
 
03:05:57.110 --> 03:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
it important
 
03:05:59.670 --> 03:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
to find out the cause because 85 percent
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
of the towns and cities in this state
 
03:06:03.030 --> 03:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
use the accuvolt machine which produced
 
03:06:03.040 --> 03:06:04.309 align:start position:0%
use the accuvolt machine which produced
it

03:06:04.309 --> 03:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:06:06.389 --> 03:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
our citizens as i'm sure you well know
 
03:06:08.710 --> 03:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
are demanding to know and we're bound by
 
03:06:10.710 --> 03:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
our shared commitment to the sanctity of
 
03:06:12.389 --> 03:06:12.399 align:start position:0%
our elections to ensure
 
03:06:14.150 --> 03:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
that the machines and the process by
 
03:06:16.230 --> 03:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
which our citizens elect us and shape
 
03:06:19.349 --> 03:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
our future can be trusted
 
03:06:21.190 --> 03:06:21.200 align:start position:0%
we meet today because at least existing
 
03:06:23.110 --> 03:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
law was interpreted to deny the state's
 
03:06:24.790 --> 03:06:24.800 align:start position:0%
obligation to investigate what caused
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
this very large and as yet unexplained
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
shift in votes between the machine count
 
03:06:30.469 --> 03:06:30.479 align:start position:0%
and the subsequent hand recount in the
 
03:06:34.309 --> 03:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:36.070 --> 03:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
our assembly here today
 
03:06:37.670 --> 03:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
is an affirmation that our citizen
 
03:06:39.670 --> 03:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
legislature understands the critical
 
03:06:41.349 --> 03:06:41.359 align:start position:0%
importance of the sanctity of every
 
03:06:43.670 --> 03:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
ballot cast in every election it's an
 
03:06:45.110 --> 03:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
affirmation that we understand the
 
03:06:46.950 --> 03:06:46.960 align:start position:0%
critical importance of public trust in
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
our elections
 
03:06:49.590 --> 03:06:49.600 align:start position:0%
and it's an affirmation that our
 
03:06:51.590 --> 03:06:51.600 align:start position:0%
citizens armed with facts and driven by
 
03:06:53.750 --> 03:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
a thirst for truth can trust us to
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
ascertain that truth
 
03:06:57.110 --> 03:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
i'm compelled to speak of the
 
03:06:59.670 --> 03:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
extraordinary efforts of dr david strang
 
03:07:01.269 --> 03:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
and what i consider to be nothing less
 
03:07:03.510 --> 03:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
than the heroic efforts of citizen ken
 
03:07:05.110 --> 03:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
eyring of windham
 
03:07:06.790 --> 03:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
to move this issue forward to the point
 
03:07:08.309 --> 03:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
that it needs to be and that is right
 
03:07:09.429 --> 03:07:09.439 align:start position:0%
here in front of you to make that
 
03:07:09.439 --> 03:07:11.510 align:start position:0%
here in front of you to make that
determination

03:07:11.510 --> 03:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
determination
 
03:07:13.269 --> 03:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
we seek a way forward that will sustain
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
our faith in elections by addressing the
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
windham vote count disparity that way
 
03:07:19.830 --> 03:07:19.840 align:start position:0%
forward has been suggested
 
03:07:22.870 --> 03:07:22.880 align:start position:0%

the duties of his office
 
03:07:36.070 --> 03:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
since my first term in the house 20

years ago
 
03:07:39.030 --> 03:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
i've watched him without prejudice and

having heard his thoughts on how he

this process
 
03:08:18.870 --> 03:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
do any committee members have questions
 
03:08:23.590 --> 03:08:23.600 align:start position:0%

burnham choosing looking on my screen
 
03:08:34.870 --> 03:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's senator gaida um
 
03:08:36.389 --> 03:08:36.399 align:start position:0%
would it be your
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
opinion that the senate
 
03:08:42.389 --> 03:08:42.399 align:start position:0%
would also support this uh plan that is
 
03:08:45.190 --> 03:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
that is uh completely supported by
 
03:08:47.830 --> 03:08:47.840 align:start position:0%
our secretary of
 
03:08:50.309 --> 03:08:50.319 align:start position:0%
i'm not uh if authorized or qualified to
 
03:08:51.910 --> 03:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
speak for the other members
 
03:08:53.910 --> 03:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
i for one would certainly advocate it
 
03:08:55.269 --> 03:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
it's been the product of work that
 
03:08:57.030 --> 03:08:57.040 align:start position:0%
involved all the interested parties the
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
secretary of state the town of windham
 
03:09:00.790 --> 03:09:00.800 align:start position:0%
the citizen myself
 
03:09:03.269 --> 03:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
and i think that the senate's passage of
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 43 and unanimous vote
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
indicates the desire to move ahead with
 
03:09:08.710 --> 03:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
the process and if we can better shape
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
that process i think that the senate
 
03:09:11.830 --> 03:09:11.840 align:start position:0%
would support this and i would be

community and to the board of selectmen
 
03:10:08.150 --> 03:10:08.160 align:start position:0%

of the entire board with regard to
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
anything that has occurred since
 
03:10:15.590 --> 03:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
wednesday afternoon
 
03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
um i and i have not seen the proposal uh
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
that mr uh iron got uh you know uh
 
03:10:24.790 --> 03:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
discussed in writing
 
03:10:27.510 --> 03:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
um on on wednesday representative uh
 
03:10:30.870 --> 03:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
charlie mcmahon uh mr eyring christy st
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
loren who originally had asked for the
 
03:10:32.399 --> 03:10:33.510 align:start position:0%
loren who originally had asked for the
recount

03:10:33.510 --> 03:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
recount
 
03:10:35.349 --> 03:10:35.359 align:start position:0%
myself and several others were part of a
 
03:10:37.269 --> 03:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting which was a result
 
03:10:39.910 --> 03:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
of a lengthy meeting last monday evening
 
03:10:41.750 --> 03:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
where significant public input from the
 
03:10:44.790 --> 03:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
new hampshire community was heard
 
03:10:46.710 --> 03:10:46.720 align:start position:0%
that committee outputted amendment
 
03:10:46.720 --> 03:10:48.150 align:start position:0%
that committee outputted amendment
language

03:10:48.150 --> 03:10:48.160 align:start position:0%
language
 
03:10:50.550 --> 03:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
which which i believe i think you you
 
03:10:52.150 --> 03:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
may have received last night it
 
03:10:54.550 --> 03:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
contained 11 letter points
 
03:10:56.550 --> 03:10:56.560 align:start position:0%
that was later approved by the board of
 
03:10:59.190 --> 03:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
selectmen on wednesday
 
03:11:01.110 --> 03:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
with the goal being to get a definitive
 
03:11:02.950 --> 03:11:02.960 align:start position:0%
answer as to why the machine count and
 
03:11:05.190 --> 03:11:05.200 align:start position:0%
the recount tallies differ
 
03:11:07.190 --> 03:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
whether the issue be the local windham
 
03:11:09.429 --> 03:11:09.439 align:start position:0%
process something with the windham
 
03:11:09.439 --> 03:11:10.550 align:start position:0%
process something with the windham
machines

03:11:10.550 --> 03:11:10.560 align:start position:0%
machines
 
03:11:13.110 --> 03:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
or the state recount process
 
03:11:15.190 --> 03:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
in other words we cannot focus the audit
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
solely on the machines
 
03:11:19.349 --> 03:11:19.359 align:start position:0%
now i don't want to derail this process
 
03:11:20.950 --> 03:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
to derail any movement towards getting a
 
03:11:22.790 --> 03:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
definitive answer here
 
03:11:25.429 --> 03:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
but what what mr eyring did after five
 
03:11:27.190 --> 03:11:27.200 align:start position:0%
hours of meetings on wednesday with the
 
03:11:28.870 --> 03:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
town was to do an end around on that
 
03:11:31.030 --> 03:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
process to propose something different
 
03:11:33.030 --> 03:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
today than what he had agreed to on
 
03:11:35.110 --> 03:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
wednesday without discussing this with
 
03:11:38.790 --> 03:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
others that were part of that process
 
03:11:40.710 --> 03:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
that being said both the members of that
 
03:11:42.790 --> 03:11:42.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and the windham selectmen
 
03:11:44.870 --> 03:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
knew the language of any amendment
 
03:11:48.790 --> 03:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:50.550 --> 03:11:50.560 align:start position:0%
if the points generally meet or exceed
 
03:11:52.309 --> 03:11:52.319 align:start position:0%
what was proposed by the subcommittee i
 
03:11:53.990 --> 03:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't see any reason why the windham
 
03:11:56.150 --> 03:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen would not fully
 
03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
support such a measure
 
03:12:00.230 --> 03:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
on the surface the new proposal sounds
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
more comprehensive
 
03:12:03.750 --> 03:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
but as i said i have not seen anything
 
03:12:04.950 --> 03:12:04.960 align:start position:0%
in writing
 
03:12:07.110 --> 03:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
one thing i am not completely
 
03:12:08.230 --> 03:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
clear on
 
03:12:10.710 --> 03:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
is the recount measures
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
once again because i don't believe this
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
process should focus solely and only on
 
03:12:17.030 --> 03:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
the machines
 
03:12:19.990 --> 03:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
several counts um did not take place
 
03:12:22.230 --> 03:12:22.240 align:start position:0%
during the the state recount
 
03:12:24.550 --> 03:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
um that may have given us more clarity
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
into what happened including the number
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
of ballots the number of undervotes the
 
03:12:31.590 --> 03:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
number of overvotes and the blanks
 
03:12:34.150 --> 03:12:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's crucial in this new process that if
 
03:12:35.750 --> 03:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
we are to do a recount and we absolutely
 
03:12:38.230 --> 03:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
i think believe we need to do a recount
 
03:12:39.670 --> 03:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
that those
 
03:12:42.070 --> 03:12:42.080 align:start position:0%
additional counts need to occur to give
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
us more clarity in the differences
 
03:12:45.590 --> 03:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
between the output of the machines and
 
03:12:48.150 --> 03:12:48.160 align:start position:0%
what happened at that recount
 
03:12:50.070 --> 03:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
lastly i just want to make sure i'm not
 
03:12:51.590 --> 03:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
sure it was mentioned
 
03:12:53.830 --> 03:12:53.840 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that the the
 
03:12:53.840 --> 03:12:54.790 align:start position:0%
i just want to make sure that the the
someone

03:12:54.790 --> 03:12:54.800 align:start position:0%
someone
 
03:12:56.790 --> 03:12:56.800 align:start position:0%
representatives of the windham board of
 
03:12:59.349 --> 03:12:59.359 align:start position:0%
selectmen are allowed to
 
03:13:01.190 --> 03:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
up close and personal get a look into
 
03:13:02.870 --> 03:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
this audit when it does occur i'm not
 
03:13:04.870 --> 03:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
sure we were listed on the uh original
 
03:13:04.880 --> 03:13:05.670 align:start position:0%
sure we were listed on the uh original
list

03:13:05.670 --> 03:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
list
 
03:13:08.950 --> 03:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's all thank you for your time
 
03:13:10.950 --> 03:13:10.960 align:start position:0%

um
 
03:13:53.429 --> 03:13:53.439 align:start position:0%
hear what they were they were to
 
03:13:59.510 --> 03:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:02.150 --> 03:14:02.160 align:start position:0%
um that the ballots being detained by
 
03:14:04.150 --> 03:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state
 
03:14:06.870 --> 03:14:06.880 align:start position:0%
that the bodies take place in a neutral
 
03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:08.630 align:start position:0%
that the bodies take place in a neutral
location

03:14:08.630 --> 03:14:08.640 align:start position:0%
location
 
03:14:12.150 --> 03:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
other than concord or windham
 
03:14:13.750 --> 03:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
um that
 
03:14:16.630 --> 03:14:16.640 align:start position:0%
overall ballot inventory verification
 
03:14:18.870 --> 03:14:18.880 align:start position:0%
shall be performed
 
03:14:24.950 --> 03:14:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:27.670 --> 03:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
the window board celebrities ask me to
 
03:14:29.750 --> 03:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
retain the ability to perform an
 
03:14:32.309 --> 03:14:32.319 align:start position:0%
independent forensic analysis
 
03:14:35.110 --> 03:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
um and i i will say i'm not sure that
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
that is contained in anything
 
03:14:39.670 --> 03:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
um that they are requesting that the
 
03:14:42.309 --> 03:14:42.319 align:start position:0%
accounts be hand tally if it starts
 
03:14:44.550 --> 03:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
taking several county district seven
 
03:14:47.349 --> 03:14:47.359 align:start position:0%
state representative race um i'm not
 
03:14:50.870 --> 03:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
sure that that is included and mr ellery
 
03:14:52.630 --> 03:14:52.640 align:start position:0%
i understand that the secretary of state
 
03:14:54.790 --> 03:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
are also we said we get into a little
 
03:14:56.469 --> 03:14:56.479 align:start position:0%
bit of the difference between a recount
 
03:14:58.469 --> 03:14:58.479 align:start position:0%
and an audit at that point
 
03:15:01.030 --> 03:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
um 100 of the ballots will be run in
 
03:15:02.790 --> 03:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
their entirety to evolve forward the
 
03:15:02.800 --> 03:15:04.630 align:start position:0%
their entirety to evolve forward the
machines

03:15:04.630 --> 03:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
machines
 
03:15:06.870 --> 03:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
i believe that is part of it
 
03:15:09.110 --> 03:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
um the audit will be live streamed and
 
03:15:09.120 --> 03:15:10.870 align:start position:0%
um the audit will be live streamed and
recorded

03:15:10.870 --> 03:15:10.880 align:start position:0%
recorded
 
03:15:12.950 --> 03:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then they have some things that they
 
03:15:14.870 --> 03:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
would like in regards to

monitoring program a 21-year resident of

gilmanton have been working very closely
 
03:17:58.710 --> 03:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
with both senator guida and ken eyring
 
03:18:00.790 --> 03:18:00.800 align:start position:0%
on this very important matter
 
03:18:02.710 --> 03:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'm encouraged to hear the plan outlined
 
03:18:04.950 --> 03:18:04.960 align:start position:0%
by mr eyring jointly agreed to by
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
secretary of state gardner
 
03:18:09.510 --> 03:18:09.520 align:start position:0%
i firmly believe it is imperative that
 
03:18:11.670 --> 03:18:11.680 align:start position:0%
we investigate this what secretary of
 
03:18:13.990 --> 03:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
state gardner told me on december 10th
 
03:18:15.990 --> 03:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
was the largest discrepancy between
 
03:18:18.229 --> 03:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
machine and hand counts in the history
 
03:18:19.990 --> 03:18:20.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire elections
 
03:18:22.309 --> 03:18:22.319 align:start position:0%
when most political contests are decided
 
03:18:25.110 --> 03:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
by six percent or less we cannot shrug
 
03:18:27.670 --> 03:18:27.680 align:start position:0%
off this anomaly with well it didn't
 
03:18:29.670 --> 03:18:29.680 align:start position:0%
change the outcome of the election
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
we owe it to the citizens of not just
 
03:18:33.990 --> 03:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
wyndham but of all new hampshire to
 
03:18:36.389 --> 03:18:36.399 align:start position:0%
explain this vote count anomaly
 
03:18:38.710 --> 03:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
let us not forget that 85 percent of new
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire towns and cities use this same
 
03:18:43.670 --> 03:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
machine the only one certified for use
 
03:18:45.670 --> 03:18:45.680 align:start position:0%
by the ballot law commission
 
03:18:47.590 --> 03:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
this windham anomaly has shaken the
 
03:18:49.590 --> 03:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
confidence of new hampshire citizens in
 
03:18:51.349 --> 03:18:51.359 align:start position:0%
these voting machines
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
we must be assured that those whom we
 
03:18:55.830 --> 03:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
truly elected are those that now govern
 
03:18:59.269 --> 03:18:59.279 align:start position:0%
us do any of you want your constituents
 
03:19:01.910 --> 03:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
questioning your right to occupy occupy
 
03:19:04.469 --> 03:19:04.479 align:start position:0%
the seat that you are in today
 
03:19:06.150 --> 03:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
there is nothing more sacred in a
 
03:19:09.110 --> 03:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
democracy than the sanctity of the vote
 
03:19:10.950 --> 03:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
if the accuracy of our elections is
 
03:19:12.950 --> 03:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
questioned if we lose faith in their
 
03:19:15.349 --> 03:19:15.359 align:start position:0%
outcomes then it will not be long before
 
03:19:17.750 --> 03:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
our society disintegrates into distrust
 
03:19:19.190 --> 03:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
and chaos
 
03:19:21.990 --> 03:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
it is your undeniable duty to compel an
 
03:19:23.750 --> 03:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
investigation that will explain this
 
03:19:25.830 --> 03:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
vote total discrepancy
 
03:19:27.830 --> 03:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
i strongly urge you to adopt secretary
 
03:19:30.790 --> 03:19:30.800 align:start position:0%

candidate who requested the recount
 
03:22:00.960 --> 03:22:01.750 align:start position:0%
candidate who requested the recount
um

03:22:01.750 --> 03:22:01.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:03.830 --> 03:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
we just heard from mr eyring and
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
apparently he must have misspoken
 
03:22:07.190 --> 03:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
because the
 
03:22:09.429 --> 03:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
um procedure that he put forward
 
03:22:11.910 --> 03:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
actually varies from
 
03:22:15.670 --> 03:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
the um amendment that was generated from
 
03:22:16.950 --> 03:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
the proposed amendment that was
 
03:22:18.950 --> 03:22:18.960 align:start position:0%
generated by the windham election
 
03:22:21.190 --> 03:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
integrity commission committee and
 
03:22:23.349 --> 03:22:23.359 align:start position:0%
approved by the board of selectmen
 
03:22:26.630 --> 03:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
and that biggest discrepancy would be um
 
03:22:29.670 --> 03:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
on line 29 line f
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
uh all of the counts shall be hand
 
03:22:33.110 --> 03:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
tallied pertaining to the rockingham
 
03:22:35.349 --> 03:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
county district 7 state representative
 
03:22:35.359 --> 03:22:36.309 align:start position:0%
county district 7 state representative
race

03:22:36.309 --> 03:22:36.319 align:start position:0%
race
 
03:22:36.319 --> 03:22:38.150 align:start position:0%
race
so

03:22:38.150 --> 03:22:38.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:22:40.710 --> 03:22:40.720 align:start position:0%
recounting hand counting any race other
 
03:22:40.720 --> 03:22:41.830 align:start position:0%
recounting hand counting any race other
than

03:22:41.830 --> 03:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
than
 
03:22:44.150 --> 03:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
the state rep race is not going to give
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
us the answer in terms of whether or not
 
03:22:50.150 --> 03:22:50.160 align:start position:0%
the problem lied with the recount
 
03:22:52.790 --> 03:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
so i strongly object to that and i would
 
03:22:54.630 --> 03:22:54.640 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask for the ballot law
 
03:22:54.640 --> 03:22:55.670 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask for the ballot law
commission

03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:22:55.680 --> 03:22:56.630 align:start position:0%
commission
um

03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:58.870 --> 03:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me the election law committee to
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
take that into consideration
 
03:23:03.990 --> 03:23:04.000 align:start position:0%
um as selectman heath partington had
 
03:23:07.910 --> 03:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
stated the concern of many people is to
 
03:23:10.870 --> 03:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
not point the finger at the machines per
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
se but find out directly where the
 
03:23:16.469 --> 03:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
source of the discrepancy came from and
 
03:23:18.790 --> 03:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
if the source of the discrepancy was
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
from the recount then we need to be able
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
to determine that and the way to do that
 
03:23:25.670 --> 03:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
would be to repeat
 
03:23:28.309 --> 03:23:28.319 align:start position:0%
the accounting of those ballots now i
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
would refer you to the amendment sp 43
 
03:23:34.469 --> 03:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
or excuse me the bill sb 43
 
03:23:38.630 --> 03:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
on line uh line 11 it says the secretary
 
03:23:40.309 --> 03:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
of state and attorney general are
 
03:23:42.950 --> 03:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
authorized to con conduct an audit of
 
03:23:46.150 --> 03:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
the rockingham county district 7 race
 
03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative race
 
03:23:49.830 --> 03:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
so that is what we're supposed to be
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
determining not only is it a problem
 
03:23:54.469 --> 03:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
with the machines
 
03:23:54.479 --> 03:23:55.510 align:start position:0%
with the machines
so

03:23:55.510 --> 03:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:23:58.150 --> 03:23:58.160 align:start position:0%
it's also stipulated in this bill that
 
03:23:59.830 --> 03:23:59.840 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:24:02.389 --> 03:24:02.399 align:start position:0%
that this is not a recount in in terms
 
03:24:05.750 --> 03:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
of establishing who would win a seat
 
03:24:07.030 --> 03:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
even when i
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
appealed to the election law committee
 
03:24:11.349 --> 03:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me the ballot law committee i
 
03:24:14.229 --> 03:24:14.239 align:start position:0%
get you guys names mixed up i i said
 
03:24:16.389 --> 03:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
that you know i am more interested in
 
03:24:17.910 --> 03:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
finding out the cause of this
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
discrepancy versus trying to challenge
 
03:24:22.870 --> 03:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
which four people are going from windham
 
03:24:24.550 --> 03:24:24.560 align:start position:0%
to serve in the house
 
03:24:26.950 --> 03:24:26.960 align:start position:0%
the the ballot law committee commission
 
03:24:29.750 --> 03:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
did say that um representative soti is
 
03:24:31.990 --> 03:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
the fourth place finisher and has been
 
03:24:33.510 --> 03:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
awarded the seat and is already
 
03:24:35.510 --> 03:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
representing the town of windham that's
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
fine with me
 
03:24:39.510 --> 03:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
what i want is to find out the cause of
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
the discrepancy whether it's the town
 
03:24:45.190 --> 03:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's the machines or whether it
 
03:24:47.670 --> 03:24:47.680 align:start position:0%
is the recount process
 
03:24:49.590 --> 03:24:49.600 align:start position:0%
as much as people need to have
 
03:24:52.550 --> 03:24:52.560 align:start position:0%
confidence that their ballots are
 
03:24:54.229 --> 03:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
are counted accurately and we need to
 
03:24:56.229 --> 03:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
have confidence in our elections
 
03:24:59.030 --> 03:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
as candidates and as voter voters we
 
03:25:01.030 --> 03:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
need to have confidence in the recount
 
03:25:03.670 --> 03:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
process that we can appeal to
 
03:25:06.950 --> 03:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
when the elections are very close
 
03:25:08.790 --> 03:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
we have a long history of recounts in
 
03:25:10.870 --> 03:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire i've participated in them
 
03:25:13.750 --> 03:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
before as observers and
 
03:25:15.910 --> 03:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
most typically by and large they go off
 
03:25:18.150 --> 03:25:18.160 align:start position:0%
without a hitch they're they're very
 
03:25:19.590 --> 03:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
very well run
 
03:25:21.510 --> 03:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
but i i think
 
03:25:23.590 --> 03:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
bill gardner secretary of state bill
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
garner mentioned that that he's overseen
 
03:25:28.710 --> 03:25:28.720 align:start position:0%
six 600 of them i mean it it's
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
understandable that there could be
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
mistakes made at once so i think if that
 
03:25:34.309 --> 03:25:34.319 align:start position:0%
is where the fault lies that we need to
 
03:25:36.790 --> 03:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
include that in this comprehensive
 
03:25:39.349 --> 03:25:39.359 align:start position:0%
thorough transparent public audit to
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
find the problem
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
so i i would respectfully appeal to the
 
03:25:47.429 --> 03:25:47.439 align:start position:0%
committee here to keep that in mind um
 
03:25:49.269 --> 03:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
moving forward
 
03:25:49.279 --> 03:25:50.469 align:start position:0%
moving forward
because

03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:25:53.429 --> 03:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
to senator guida's point as much as 85
 
03:25:55.429 --> 03:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
percent of our towns use the accu vote
 
03:25:58.710 --> 03:25:58.720 align:start position:0%
machines 100 of our towns have the
 
03:26:01.269 --> 03:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
recourse of a recount in the event of
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
close elections
 
03:26:05.190 --> 03:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to take any questions
 
03:26:07.349 --> 03:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for joining us this afternoon
 
03:26:09.670 --> 03:26:09.680 align:start position:0%

03:26:11.910 --> 03:26:11.920 align:start position:0%

03:26:18.150 --> 03:26:18.160 align:start position:0%
representative barry mr
 
03:26:20.790 --> 03:26:20.800 align:start position:0%

03:26:22.550 --> 03:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
on your behalf
 
03:26:24.710 --> 03:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
i did yes did you have legal counsel
 
03:26:26.070 --> 03:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
while you were there
 
03:26:29.830 --> 03:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.790 --> 03:26:32.800 align:start position:0%
further questions representative lane
 
03:26:35.349 --> 03:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair um miss say
 
03:26:37.830 --> 03:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
lauren did uh the documents that you
 
03:26:37.840 --> 03:26:39.030 align:start position:0%
lauren did uh the documents that you
mentioned

03:26:39.030 --> 03:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh that you were comparing to are those
 
03:26:43.429 --> 03:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
available have
 
03:26:46.389 --> 03:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
they been sent to us or provided to us
 
03:26:48.229 --> 03:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
you could refer to a committee or a
 
03:26:48.239 --> 03:26:49.429 align:start position:0%
you could refer to a committee or a
commission

03:26:49.429 --> 03:26:49.439 align:start position:0%
commission
 
03:26:50.710 --> 03:26:50.720 align:start position:0%
right now
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
i know and i apologize because i get
 
03:26:55.830 --> 03:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
your committee mixed up with that
 
03:26:58.550 --> 03:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's okay ballot law commission so
 
03:27:01.670 --> 03:27:01.680 align:start position:0%
after the recount because obviously the
 
03:27:04.469 --> 03:27:04.479 align:start position:0%
results were distressing um just in
 
03:27:04.479 --> 03:27:05.590 align:start position:0%
results were distressing um just in
scale

03:27:05.590 --> 03:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
scale
 
03:27:07.750 --> 03:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
my only recourse was to go to the ballot
 
03:27:09.030 --> 03:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
law commission
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
most typically and and i did provide um
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
written testimony that that hopefully
 
03:27:17.110 --> 03:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
you you have um but most commonly what
 
03:27:19.190 --> 03:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
happens with those is
 
03:27:21.349 --> 03:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
if it comes down to a couple of votes
 
03:27:23.429 --> 03:27:23.439 align:start position:0%
and you disagree with how the secretary
 
03:27:25.830 --> 03:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
of state interprets the intent of the
 
03:27:28.309 --> 03:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
voter on a couple of ballots the ballot
 
03:27:30.070 --> 03:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
law commission will examine those in
 
03:27:32.389 --> 03:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
their determination stands that wasn't
 
03:27:35.190 --> 03:27:35.200 align:start position:0%
the case in this situation but it was my
 
03:27:37.429 --> 03:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
only my only recourse
 
03:27:39.750 --> 03:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
so i did appeal to them they did
 
03:27:41.670 --> 03:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
establish that it was representative
 
03:27:43.990 --> 03:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
soti to get the for the fourth seat but
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
they did call for an investigation from
 
03:27:48.950 --> 03:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
 
03:27:48.960 --> 03:27:49.830 align:start position:0%
the attorney general's office
um

03:27:49.830 --> 03:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:27:52.309 --> 03:27:52.319 align:start position:0%
thank you may have a follow-up please
 
03:27:53.750 --> 03:27:53.760 align:start position:0%
another question
 
03:27:56.790 --> 03:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um i guess i maybe i misunderstood
 
03:27:59.510 --> 03:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
you when you were testifying i thought
 
03:28:02.229 --> 03:28:02.239 align:start position:0%
that you said there was a local windham
 
03:28:04.550 --> 03:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
group that had put together
 
03:28:07.750 --> 03:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
something and that it was uh not all
 
03:28:10.870 --> 03:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
those maybe it's 11 points that
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
our chairperson read out i just would
 
03:28:15.110 --> 03:28:15.120 align:start position:0%
like to get a copy of what you were

the committee uh my name is tom murray
 
03:29:46.950 --> 03:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
i'm a resident of windham new hampshire
 
03:29:49.269 --> 03:29:49.279 align:start position:0%
um also a member of the subcommittee
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
that's being referenced
 
03:29:50.880 --> 03:29:51.750 align:start position:0%
that's being referenced
um

03:29:51.750 --> 03:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:29:54.630 --> 03:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
i uh for the most part agree um with
 
03:29:57.349 --> 03:29:57.359 align:start position:0%
both miss saint laurent and mr partation
 
03:29:58.630 --> 03:29:58.640 align:start position:0%
however i do believe this is a
 
03:30:00.710 --> 03:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding i just like to describe
 
03:30:00.720 --> 03:30:02.389 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding i just like to describe
that

03:30:02.389 --> 03:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
we did unanimously take a vote on march
 
03:30:07.349 --> 03:30:07.359 align:start position:0%
3rd just two days ago at that
 
03:30:10.070 --> 03:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
subcommittee maining it was a 4-0 vote
 
03:30:10.080 --> 03:30:10.870 align:start position:0%
subcommittee maining it was a 4-0 vote
the

03:30:10.870 --> 03:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:30:12.550 --> 03:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
11 bullet points that are being
 
03:30:15.030 --> 03:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned are actually
 
03:30:17.590 --> 03:30:17.600 align:start position:0%
incorporated into the amendment
 
03:30:19.830 --> 03:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
i think it's important to note that
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
these were
 
03:30:20.880 --> 03:30:21.750 align:start position:0%
these were
simply

03:30:21.750 --> 03:30:21.760 align:start position:0%
simply
 
03:30:23.510 --> 03:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know more or less a wish list of
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
what we
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
as members of the subcommittee as well
 
03:30:28.710 --> 03:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
as members of public
 
03:30:30.389 --> 03:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
and the board of selectmen
 
03:30:32.710 --> 03:30:32.720 align:start position:0%
were hopeful that the
 
03:30:35.429 --> 03:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
election committee would um
 
03:30:38.550 --> 03:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
take into consideration um however i
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
think there's some misunderstanding
 
03:30:42.070 --> 03:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
that's going on because i believe that
 
03:30:45.510 --> 03:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
um everything that most both mr eyring
 
03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
and uh secretary of state mr gardner
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
have discussed is actually incorporated
 
03:30:52.710 --> 03:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
into that those 11 bullet points i have
 
03:30:54.469 --> 03:30:54.479 align:start position:0%
both of them in front of me i'm very
 
03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
familiar with both of them um i
 
03:30:58.790 --> 03:30:58.800 align:start position:0%
understand the uh
 
03:31:02.229 --> 03:31:02.239 align:start position:0%
the concern that uh saint laurent um
 
03:31:03.990 --> 03:31:04.000 align:start position:0%
brought up and i share that concern and
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
however i also believe that to be
 
03:31:09.349 --> 03:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
um addressed with the forensic audit
 
03:31:11.910 --> 03:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned now that being the uh
 
03:31:13.429 --> 03:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
the hand recount
 
03:31:16.950 --> 03:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
so um my perspective on this is that
 
03:31:19.910 --> 03:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
um according to the uh
 
03:31:21.750 --> 03:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
you know as outlined in the testimony of
 
03:31:24.630 --> 03:31:24.640 align:start position:0%
mr hiring um that that be that that is
 
03:31:27.110 --> 03:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
incorporated into those concerns and
 
03:31:28.950 --> 03:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
with that being said i i would uh
 
03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
support um
 
03:31:30.720 --> 03:31:31.429 align:start position:0%
support um
the

03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%

you know there are shared concerns uh
 
03:32:50.469 --> 03:32:50.479 align:start position:0%
about the count in windham
 
03:32:52.469 --> 03:32:52.479 align:start position:0%
and there is a desire
 
03:32:55.349 --> 03:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
uh to get to the bottom of uh you know
 
03:32:56.790 --> 03:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
what occurred
 
03:32:56.800 --> 03:32:57.750 align:start position:0%
what occurred
um

03:32:57.750 --> 03:32:57.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:58.790 --> 03:32:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know as
 
03:33:01.110 --> 03:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
was proposed uh you know with uh you
 
03:33:02.710 --> 03:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
know with an agreement or an
 
03:33:05.269 --> 03:33:05.279 align:start position:0%
understanding um you know the focus is
 
03:33:07.590 --> 03:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
going to be on the machines themselves
 
03:33:10.469 --> 03:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
uh you know with a thorough forensic uh
 
03:33:12.150 --> 03:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
audit of them
 
03:33:14.469 --> 03:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
and then you know a recount of a couple
 
03:33:16.229 --> 03:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
of the other races uh they're on the
 
03:33:18.630 --> 03:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
ballot just to
 
03:33:20.070 --> 03:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
you know confirm that the machines are
 
03:33:22.229 --> 03:33:22.239 align:start position:0%
working properly
 
03:33:24.550 --> 03:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
but i think everybody has to remember as
 
03:33:26.229 --> 03:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner mentioned in his
 
03:33:26.239 --> 03:33:27.349 align:start position:0%
secretary gardner mentioned in his
comments

03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
comments
 
03:33:27.359 --> 03:33:28.309 align:start position:0%
comments
that

03:33:28.309 --> 03:33:28.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:33:30.550 --> 03:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
conducting elections
 
03:33:32.710 --> 03:33:32.720 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
03:33:32.720 --> 03:33:33.429 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
is

03:33:33.429 --> 03:33:33.439 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:33.439 --> 03:33:34.389 align:start position:0%
is
is

03:33:34.389 --> 03:33:34.399 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:33:37.190 --> 03:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
it involves humans and it
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
involves a lot of them
 
03:33:41.030 --> 03:33:41.040 align:start position:0%
and as we all know humans can make
 
03:33:43.269 --> 03:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
mistakes and and that's a regular
 
03:33:45.030 --> 03:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
occurrence in new hampshire elections
 
03:33:48.070 --> 03:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
and as secretary gardner mentioned that
 
03:33:50.550 --> 03:33:50.560 align:start position:0%
is borne out
 
03:33:52.309 --> 03:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
in the recounts that we see that you
 
03:33:53.510 --> 03:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
know there are
 
03:33:53.520 --> 03:33:54.550 align:start position:0%
know there are
some

03:33:54.550 --> 03:33:54.560 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:33:54.560 --> 03:33:55.429 align:start position:0%
some
uh

03:33:55.429 --> 03:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:33:57.349 --> 03:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
differences between the election account
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
and the recount that we can determine
 
03:34:01.110 --> 03:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
were caused by
 
03:34:03.429 --> 03:34:03.439 align:start position:0%
human error and it might be something as
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
simple as
 
03:34:07.030 --> 03:34:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh double double counting uh write-in
 
03:34:09.190 --> 03:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
votes uh ballots with write-in votes on
 
03:34:09.200 --> 03:34:09.910 align:start position:0%
votes uh ballots with write-in votes on
them

03:34:09.910 --> 03:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:34:11.510 --> 03:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know after they go through the
 
03:34:14.469 --> 03:34:14.479 align:start position:0%
machine it's you know um
 
03:34:15.750 --> 03:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
you know we've seen things like that in
 
03:34:18.070 --> 03:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
the past they're addition errors can
 
03:34:20.790 --> 03:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
happen um ballots can be improperly
 
03:34:20.800 --> 03:34:21.830 align:start position:0%
happen um ballots can be improperly
handled

03:34:21.830 --> 03:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
handled
 
03:34:24.309 --> 03:34:24.319 align:start position:0%
and those aren't deliberate or malicious
 
03:34:26.309 --> 03:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh it's just it's a mistake that
 
03:34:28.630 --> 03:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
somebody made
 
03:34:31.269 --> 03:34:31.279 align:start position:0%
when we conduct a recount and if we were
 
03:34:34.630 --> 03:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
to do a full recount again
 
03:34:37.269 --> 03:34:37.279 align:start position:0%
you know it may be more evident where
 
03:34:39.030 --> 03:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
the issue may have occurred
 
03:34:40.630 --> 03:34:40.640 align:start position:0%
but we still may never know what
 
03:34:43.429 --> 03:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
happened and and that's just that's
 
03:34:46.070 --> 03:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
again the human component of it
 
03:34:47.030 --> 03:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:34:49.510 --> 03:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
what we have done here with the
 
03:34:51.750 --> 03:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
conversations between secretary gardner
 
03:34:55.590 --> 03:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
and mr eyring and others is
 
03:34:57.480 --> 03:34:57.490 align:start position:0%
come to those mutual um
 
03:34:57.490 --> 03:35:00.950 align:start position:0%
come to those mutual um
[Music]

03:35:00.950 --> 03:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:02.950 --> 03:35:02.960 align:start position:0%
areas where you know we want to try and
 
03:35:05.030 --> 03:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
get as much information as we can to at
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
least confirm that the machines
 
03:35:09.670 --> 03:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
were working properly and
 
03:35:11.349 --> 03:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
you know and if we can do that you know
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
we may be able to to glean some other
 
03:35:15.830 --> 03:35:15.840 align:start position:0%
information about you know what happened
 
03:35:17.910 --> 03:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the actual physical accounting
 
03:35:18.950 --> 03:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
03:35:21.590 --> 03:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
but again we may never know and
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
um more we understand the better you
 
03:35:25.510 --> 03:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
know we're hearing
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh testimony on other bills related to
 
03:35:30.229 --> 03:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
audits uh moving forward those are
 
03:35:32.150 --> 03:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
certainly appropriate
 
03:35:32.160 --> 03:35:32.950 align:start position:0%
certainly appropriate
um

03:35:32.950 --> 03:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
but let's let's try and work together to
 
03:35:36.479 --> 03:35:37.349 align:start position:0%
but let's let's try and work together to
uh

03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:39.110 --> 03:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
you know come up with a process that
 
03:35:39.120 --> 03:35:39.990 align:start position:0%
you know come up with a process that
will

03:35:39.990 --> 03:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:35:41.670 --> 03:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
address the issues that we all believe
 
03:35:43.750 --> 03:35:43.760 align:start position:0%
are important uh even though in the end
 
03:35:45.750 --> 03:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
we may not get all the answers uh that
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
we're looking for
 
03:35:48.950 --> 03:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
and with that madam chair i'd be happy
 
03:35:51.349 --> 03:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions
 
03:35:57.269 --> 03:35:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:03.990 --> 03:36:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:07.830 --> 03:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
all right i'm not seeing any uh
 
03:36:11.510 --> 03:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
at this point it is 110
 
03:36:13.750 --> 03:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh the committee is going to take a 30
 
03:36:16.550 --> 03:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
minute recess this public hearing will
 
03:36:16.560 --> 03:36:18.070 align:start position:0%
minute recess this public hearing will
reconvene

03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
reconvene
 
03:36:20.389 --> 03:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
in 30 minutes
 
03:36:23.510 --> 03:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
um at that time i will be
 
03:36:26.070 --> 03:36:26.080 align:start position:0%
um asking how many people want to
 
03:36:29.269 --> 03:36:29.279 align:start position:0%
testify in regards to this matter
 
03:36:32.469 --> 03:36:32.479 align:start position:0%
and i will be determining how much time
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
will be allocated to each speaker
 
03:36:38.469 --> 03:36:38.479 align:start position:0%
um he will not be accepting this bill
 
03:36:40.950 --> 03:36:40.960 align:start position:0%
today or building on it
 
03:36:43.670 --> 03:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
i remind everybody that we remain

accessible online for comments
 
03:36:50.630 --> 03:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
and so sb 33 will continue for a certain
 
03:36:52.229 --> 03:36:52.239 align:start position:0%
amount of time at which point this
 
03:36:53.429 --> 03:36:53.439 align:start position:0%
committee will then take up the
 
03:36:55.990 --> 03:36:56.000 align:start position:0%

we got something completely foreign on
 
04:13:56.389 --> 04:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
the screen so we would refund it to

as
 
04:14:23.429 --> 04:14:23.439 align:start position:0%
indicated a number of people signed up
 
04:14:25.830 --> 04:14:25.840 align:start position:0%

correctly if i'm wrong we'll continue
 
04:14:39.030 --> 04:14:39.040 align:start position:0%

bill
 
04:14:49.030 --> 04:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
that does not mean they're all here or
 
04:14:50.710 --> 04:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
that there aren't other people who want
 
04:14:52.469 --> 04:14:52.479 align:start position:0%
to speak so
 
04:14:54.070 --> 04:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
the majority of the people who have
 
04:14:56.229 --> 04:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak have indicated that
 
04:14:59.189 --> 04:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
they need two minutes to speak
 
04:14:59.199 --> 04:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
they need two minutes to speak
so

04:14:59.990 --> 04:15:00.000 align:start position:0%

attention my name is nicole bowtie and
 
04:15:57.910 --> 04:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
i'm the windham town clerk i am speaking
 
04:16:01.189 --> 04:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
in favor of proposed amendment given by
 
04:16:02.630 --> 04:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen for the town of
 
04:16:04.630 --> 04:16:04.640 align:start position:0%
windham i was also one of the
 
04:16:06.149 --> 04:16:06.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee members involved with
 
04:16:08.469 --> 04:16:08.479 align:start position:0%
drafting this amendment proposal
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
since the alleged discrepancy my office
 
04:16:13.349 --> 04:16:13.359 align:start position:0%
has received dozens if not hundreds of
 
04:16:15.830 --> 04:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
emails calls letters and many right to
 
04:16:17.990 --> 04:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
know requests from winterham residents
 
04:16:20.870 --> 04:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
new hampshire residents media etc
 
04:16:23.189 --> 04:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
everyone especially the town officials
 
04:16:25.750 --> 04:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
are deeply concerned and rightfully so
 
04:16:27.910 --> 04:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
there are many theories and speculations
 
04:16:29.750 --> 04:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
as to what could have happened and to
 
04:16:31.590 --> 04:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
put these all pressed and have the
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
warranted closure is paramount
 
04:16:36.309 --> 04:16:36.319 align:start position:0%
this amendment of bullets will include
 
04:16:38.550 --> 04:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
more of a local presence so this audit
 
04:16:40.149 --> 04:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
is accomplished with a collaborative
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
effort across the board most of these
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
bullets are basic including preservation
 
04:16:46.630 --> 04:16:46.640 align:start position:0%
of the ballots and machines in their
 
04:16:48.950 --> 04:16:48.960 align:start position:0%
current state and control along with the
 
04:16:51.590 --> 04:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
overall ballot count verification some
 
04:16:53.429 --> 04:16:53.439 align:start position:0%
of these proposals such as the neutral
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
location for the audit and all three of
 
04:16:57.269 --> 04:16:57.279 align:start position:0%
the parties abstaining from conducting
 
04:16:59.110 --> 04:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
the audit are simply to make sure that
 
04:17:01.910 --> 04:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
all areas are covered with transparency
 
04:17:05.030 --> 04:17:05.040 align:start position:0%
and being as unbiased as possible
 
04:17:07.189 --> 04:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
in order to maintain public trust and
 
04:17:09.110 --> 04:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
continued transparency through this
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
delicate situation
 
04:17:12.469 --> 04:17:12.479 align:start position:0%
i would strongly encourage that this is
 
04:17:15.189 --> 04:17:15.199 align:start position:0%
handled with the utmost sensitivity
 
04:17:17.189 --> 04:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
the more concerns that many people have
 
04:17:19.990 --> 04:17:20.000 align:start position:0%
raised was a response time to this
 
04:17:22.070 --> 04:17:22.080 align:start position:0%
when this all came to light
 
04:17:24.070 --> 04:17:24.080 align:start position:0%
there wasn't much action taken but we
 
04:17:26.389 --> 04:17:26.399 align:start position:0%
all know this wouldn't just go away
 
04:17:28.309 --> 04:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
especially given the political climate
 
04:17:30.070 --> 04:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
that we've all been in
 
04:17:32.149 --> 04:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
we are four months out from the november
 
04:17:33.830 --> 04:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
general and it seems like we haven't
 
04:17:36.149 --> 04:17:36.159 align:start position:0%
progressed much and it's been steadily
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
on the forefront in windham everyone
 
04:17:40.550 --> 04:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
just wants answers and closure
 
04:17:42.149 --> 04:17:42.159 align:start position:0%
especially since we have a local
 
04:17:44.550 --> 04:17:44.560 align:start position:0%
election this coming tuesday
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
the voters are losing trust and it's
 
04:17:49.030 --> 04:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
disheartening to say the least i can
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
speak for one team's local election
 
04:17:53.670 --> 04:17:53.680 align:start position:0%
officials that we put our heart and soul
 
04:17:55.269 --> 04:17:55.279 align:start position:0%
to make sure that each and every
 
04:17:57.110 --> 04:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
election is run to the best of our
 
04:18:00.070 --> 04:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
ability while following all the laws and
 
04:18:03.110 --> 04:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
processes has always and continues to be
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
of the utmost importance this is exactly
 
04:18:08.309 --> 04:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
why we take the oath of office
 
04:18:10.710 --> 04:18:10.720 align:start position:0%

04:18:12.389 --> 04:18:12.399 align:start position:0%

selectmen assembled the other day we
 
04:21:47.269 --> 04:21:47.279 align:start position:0%

04:21:49.269 --> 04:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
crafting a list of
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%

04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
who is my assistant moderator who was in
 
04:22:12.790 --> 04:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
attendance at the uh
 
04:22:14.950 --> 04:22:14.960 align:start position:0%

griffin i will as well with you here um
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
peter and i serve on a board for many
 
04:22:30.309 --> 04:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:32.469 --> 04:22:32.479 align:start position:0%
the real point i've been listening to
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
the testimonials miss john i need you to
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
speak up
 
04:22:38.710 --> 04:22:38.720 align:start position:0%
i've been listening to the testimony of
 
04:22:38.720 --> 04:22:39.750 align:start position:0%
i've been listening to the testimony of
the

04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:22:41.349 --> 04:22:41.359 align:start position:0%
at this hearing
 
04:22:43.990 --> 04:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i think one important point has to
 
04:22:47.510 --> 04:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
come up and that is that at this point
 
04:22:51.030 --> 04:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
we do not know which set of numbers is
 
04:22:51.040 --> 04:22:52.149 align:start position:0%
we do not know which set of numbers is
correct

04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:22:53.750 --> 04:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
were the
 
04:22:56.229 --> 04:22:56.239 align:start position:0%
numbers correct or were the recount
 
04:22:57.910 --> 04:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
numbers correct
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
and if we find out that the windcam
 
04:23:03.670 --> 04:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
numbers were correct
 
04:23:05.590 --> 04:23:05.600 align:start position:0%
um then
 
04:23:05.600 --> 04:23:06.469 align:start position:0%
um then
the

04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:23:09.349 --> 04:23:09.359 align:start position:0%
machine is really pretty moved
 
04:23:11.750 --> 04:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i would like to describe you a
 
04:23:14.469 --> 04:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
little bit about what i observed that's
 
04:23:16.469 --> 04:23:16.479 align:start position:0%
three pounds
 
04:23:19.910 --> 04:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
namely that um
 
04:23:23.189 --> 04:23:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:25.110 --> 04:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
done i'm not trying to cut you off for
 
04:23:28.070 --> 04:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
some reason as compared to mr griffin
 
04:23:30.229 --> 04:23:30.239 align:start position:0%
your testimony is coming from very
 
04:23:30.239 --> 04:23:31.510 align:start position:0%
your testimony is coming from very
uneven

04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
uneven
 
04:23:33.110 --> 04:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at the people who are
 
04:23:35.349 --> 04:23:35.359 align:start position:0%
attending my video are you also having
 
04:23:36.790 --> 04:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
that experience
 
04:23:38.550 --> 04:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
because i know sometimes when you're
 
04:23:40.790 --> 04:23:40.800 align:start position:0%
just all on the video
 
04:23:42.950 --> 04:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
zoom platform you get sound differently
 
04:23:44.550 --> 04:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
than we do in the room but it's coming
 
04:23:46.229 --> 04:23:46.239 align:start position:0%
through very unsteady so if you could
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
find that microphone and stay close that
 
04:23:49.670 --> 04:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
would be great
 
04:24:09.110 --> 04:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.269 --> 04:24:11.279 align:start position:0%
you either okay
 
04:24:11.279 --> 04:24:12.070 align:start position:0%
you either okay
yeah

04:24:12.070 --> 04:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:24:14.149 --> 04:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
let's try this does this work
 
04:24:16.229 --> 04:24:16.239 align:start position:0%
that's much better okay
 
04:24:18.149 --> 04:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
don't hold don't move i don't know where
 
04:24:19.429 --> 04:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
you are don't move
 
04:24:31.030 --> 04:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.360 --> 04:24:42.370 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:42.370 --> 04:24:49.269 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:24:49.269 --> 04:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:51.429 --> 04:24:51.439 align:start position:0%
we really can't hear you and i don't
 
04:24:52.950 --> 04:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
want to have you go through what you
 
04:24:54.790 --> 04:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
want to say and then have me say at the
 
04:24:56.550 --> 04:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
end of it we didn't hear it
 
04:24:56.560 --> 04:24:57.990 align:start position:0%
end of it we didn't hear it
um

04:24:57.990 --> 04:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:24:59.830 --> 04:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
why don't
 
04:24:59.840 --> 04:25:00.790 align:start position:0%
why don't
i

04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
i
 
04:25:03.189 --> 04:25:03.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know what to do
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
04:25:04.640 --> 04:25:14.469 align:start position:0%
um okay
um

04:25:14.469 --> 04:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:16.950 --> 04:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
keep talking
 
04:25:20.469 --> 04:25:20.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:22.710 --> 04:25:22.720 align:start position:0%
all right let's sign it on a different
 
04:25:22.720 --> 04:25:26.630 align:start position:0%
all right let's sign it on a different
environment

04:25:26.630 --> 04:25:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.030 --> 04:25:29.040 align:start position:0%
divide your phone
 
04:25:29.040 --> 04:25:30.309 align:start position:0%
divide your phone
yeah

04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:25:32.830 --> 04:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
there is a notice that if you call in by
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
phone um
 
04:25:37.349 --> 04:25:37.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes that works better i don't know
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
where you're at
 
04:25:40.790 --> 04:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
if you want to try that with the zoom
 
04:25:42.309 --> 04:25:42.319 align:start position:0%
notice there should have been a calling
 
04:25:45.750 --> 04:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
notice and then maybe you can have
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
you can raise your hand and uh
 
04:25:48.880 --> 04:25:52.469 align:start position:0%
you can raise your hand and uh
maybe

04:25:52.469 --> 04:25:52.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.469 --> 04:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
apparently peter can
 
04:25:56.790 --> 04:25:56.800 align:start position:0%
peter griffin can raise his hand but i
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
think i need you to call in or or
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
you know what it's done log off and log
 
04:26:04.149 --> 04:26:04.159 align:start position:0%
try to log back in because sometimes
 
04:26:06.149 --> 04:26:06.159 align:start position:0%

all right representative jay welcome to
 
04:26:54.710 --> 04:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
04:26:57.269 --> 04:26:57.279 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and i
 
04:26:59.030 --> 04:26:59.040 align:start position:0%
i went through a whole day of hearings
 
04:27:00.790 --> 04:27:00.800 align:start position:0%
the other day so i know how
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
important it is to put everything
 
04:27:05.429 --> 04:27:05.439 align:start position:0%
together as quickly as possible i did
 
04:27:05.439 --> 04:27:06.309 align:start position:0%
together as quickly as possible i did
send

04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
send
 
04:27:11.110 --> 04:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
um an email and my concern is that
 
04:27:13.910 --> 04:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
as important and critical as the
 
04:27:16.630 --> 04:27:16.640 align:start position:0%
forensic study of the
 
04:27:18.630 --> 04:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
scanning machines is
 
04:27:21.189 --> 04:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
there is more to the investigation that
 
04:27:22.630 --> 04:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
needs to be done
 
04:27:25.830 --> 04:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
and so a couple of the things um that's
 
04:27:27.510 --> 04:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
why i really
 
04:27:29.670 --> 04:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
without even looking at the list of 11
 
04:27:31.750 --> 04:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
points that the people of wyndham have
 
04:27:34.149 --> 04:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
put out i would really suggest that that
 
04:27:37.429 --> 04:27:37.439 align:start position:0%
be studied and adopted as absolutely as
 
04:27:40.790 --> 04:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
much as possible i think it's number
 
04:27:40.800 --> 04:27:42.389 align:start position:0%
much as possible i think it's number
638

04:27:42.389 --> 04:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
638
 
04:27:42.399 --> 04:27:43.189 align:start position:0%
638
of

04:27:43.189 --> 04:27:43.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
2021 606 38
 
04:27:46.000 --> 04:27:46.870 align:start position:0%
2021 606 38
house

04:27:46.870 --> 04:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
house
 
04:27:49.590 --> 04:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
um i would like to make sure that in the
 
04:27:49.600 --> 04:27:50.630 align:start position:0%
um i would like to make sure that in the
study

04:27:50.630 --> 04:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:27:53.269 --> 04:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
all the paper ballots are counted just
 
04:27:55.670 --> 04:27:55.680 align:start position:0%
the number of ballots and make sure that
 
04:27:58.469 --> 04:27:58.479 align:start position:0%
matches the number of ballots given out
 
04:28:00.469 --> 04:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
which should be on you know that should
 
04:28:02.630 --> 04:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
be on the checklists
 
04:28:06.149 --> 04:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
um i think that the title of this bill
 
04:28:08.389 --> 04:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
is incorrect it
 
04:28:10.349 --> 04:28:10.359 align:start position:0%
specifically talks about the
 
04:28:12.469 --> 04:28:12.479 align:start position:0%
representatives race
 
04:28:15.429 --> 04:28:15.439 align:start position:0%
that is settled we already know who won
 
04:28:17.349 --> 04:28:17.359 align:start position:0%
the important thing about this
 
04:28:19.830 --> 04:28:19.840 align:start position:0%
investigation is not who needs to be
 
04:28:22.630 --> 04:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
representing uh wyndham the important
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
thing affects all of us in the whole
 
04:28:28.229 --> 04:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
state and that is
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
do does the process work
 
04:28:34.229 --> 04:28:34.239 align:start position:0%
all the parts of the process work so let
 
04:28:37.269 --> 04:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
the forensic experts do their thing but
 
04:28:39.429 --> 04:28:39.439 align:start position:0%
don't stop with that
 
04:28:40.950 --> 04:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
look at all the
 
04:28:43.030 --> 04:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
the concerns that the people of windham
 
04:28:45.510 --> 04:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
have and address those too so that means
 
04:28:47.750 --> 04:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
the title shouldn't say it's just
 
04:28:50.950 --> 04:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
investigating representatives uh
 
04:28:50.960 --> 04:28:51.750 align:start position:0%
investigating representatives uh
uh

04:28:51.750 --> 04:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:28:54.389 --> 04:28:54.399 align:start position:0%
what do you call it the races
 
04:28:57.670 --> 04:28:57.680 align:start position:0%
uh i think that all the races in on that
 
04:28:59.910 --> 04:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
were went through these four machines
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
everything on that ballot ought to be
 
04:29:04.550 --> 04:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
run through the machines again
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
and hand counted
 
04:29:09.269 --> 04:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
it's such a huge
 
04:29:09.279 --> 04:29:10.550 align:start position:0%
it's such a huge
game

04:29:10.550 --> 04:29:10.560 align:start position:0%
game
 
04:29:12.070 --> 04:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's the two minutes
 
04:29:14.149 --> 04:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you much
 
04:29:16.710 --> 04:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you that is wrapping up i guess um
 
04:29:20.149 --> 04:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
i think i just saw a screenshot of
 
04:29:20.159 --> 04:29:22.309 align:start position:0%
i think i just saw a screenshot of
nicole

04:29:22.309 --> 04:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
nicole
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
um are you there with miss dunn
 
04:29:26.239 --> 04:29:28.229 align:start position:0%
um are you there with miss dunn
yes

04:29:28.229 --> 04:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:29:30.309 --> 04:29:30.319 align:start position:0%
this is nice
 
04:29:33.590 --> 04:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
yes indeed yeah so okay let's do this
 
04:29:33.600 --> 04:29:34.630 align:start position:0%
yes indeed yeah so okay let's do this
again

04:29:34.630 --> 04:29:34.640 align:start position:0%
again
 
04:29:35.750 --> 04:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:29:35.760 --> 04:29:36.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
so

04:29:36.710 --> 04:29:36.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
i think what the point i want to make is
 
04:29:42.550 --> 04:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
that there are two sets of numbers
 
04:29:42.560 --> 04:29:44.229 align:start position:0%
that there are two sets of numbers
and

04:29:44.229 --> 04:29:44.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:47.030 --> 04:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't know which number
 
04:29:48.870 --> 04:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
04:29:50.870 --> 04:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
there has been all of this talk about
 
04:29:53.189 --> 04:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
the machines may be wrong
 
04:29:56.630 --> 04:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
um and maybe windham made a mistake but
 
04:29:59.110 --> 04:29:59.120 align:start position:0%
really we don't know which number is
 
04:30:02.389 --> 04:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
correct we know that not only the
 
04:30:04.229 --> 04:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
attorney general and the secretary of
 
04:30:06.149 --> 04:30:06.159 align:start position:0%
state have had access to all the
 
04:30:08.630 --> 04:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
documentation that we've provided but
 
04:30:11.110 --> 04:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
that many of the people like mr k eyring
 
04:30:13.030 --> 04:30:13.040 align:start position:0%
and mr murray have
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
and no one
 
04:30:15.279 --> 04:30:16.469 align:start position:0%
and no one
has

04:30:16.469 --> 04:30:16.479 align:start position:0%
has
 
04:30:18.950 --> 04:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh found anything
 
04:30:21.510 --> 04:30:21.520 align:start position:0%
of significance to my knowledge in any
 
04:30:23.990 --> 04:30:24.000 align:start position:0%
of the paperwork hundreds and hundreds
 
04:30:26.870 --> 04:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
of pages that we sent up including how
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
many ballots we received how many went
 
04:30:30.790 --> 04:30:30.800 align:start position:0%
through the machine
 
04:30:33.110 --> 04:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
how many were counted how many were
 
04:30:34.870 --> 04:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
given out
 
04:30:37.110 --> 04:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
i mean we can give you answers and
 
04:30:40.149 --> 04:30:40.159 align:start position:0%
answers and answers and on the secretary
 
04:30:43.510 --> 04:30:43.520 align:start position:0%
of state's recount you cannot look at
 
04:30:45.750 --> 04:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
any of the documentation and know how
 
04:30:48.309 --> 04:30:48.319 align:start position:0%
many ballots were counted they did not
 
04:30:51.189 --> 04:30:51.199 align:start position:0%
count how many ballots they received
 
04:30:53.269 --> 04:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
they did not count how many ballots they
 
04:30:54.790 --> 04:30:54.800 align:start position:0%
were counting
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
there were stacks of ballots that were
 
04:31:00.389 --> 04:31:00.399 align:start position:0%
sorted in the beginning and one of those
 
04:31:02.710 --> 04:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
stacks was of
 
04:31:05.349 --> 04:31:05.359 align:start position:0%
blank ballots in this
 
04:31:05.359 --> 04:31:06.309 align:start position:0%
blank ballots in this
race

04:31:06.309 --> 04:31:06.319 align:start position:0%
race
 
04:31:08.469 --> 04:31:08.479 align:start position:0%
in other words no one voted for state
 
04:31:08.479 --> 04:31:09.510 align:start position:0%
in other words no one voted for state
rep

04:31:09.510 --> 04:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
rep
 
04:31:11.990 --> 04:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
those were screened we knew they were
 
04:31:15.189 --> 04:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
all blank but those ballots were put
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
into the box
 
04:31:19.269 --> 04:31:19.279 align:start position:0%
un put back sealed up
 
04:31:21.590 --> 04:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
without being counted
 
04:31:24.870 --> 04:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
for the ballots that had um
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
one or two or three votes or votes from
 
04:31:29.199 --> 04:31:29.990 align:start position:0%
one or two or three votes or votes from
e

04:31:29.990 --> 04:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
e
 
04:31:32.870 --> 04:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
from both republican and
 
04:31:36.070 --> 04:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
democrat candidates those were
 
04:31:38.870 --> 04:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
tallied but those ballots were not
 
04:31:41.349 --> 04:31:41.359 align:start position:0%
counted they were sealed up into the
 
04:31:42.710 --> 04:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
into the
 
04:31:42.720 --> 04:31:43.990 align:start position:0%
into the
boxes

04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
boxes
 
04:31:47.269 --> 04:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
so you have no idea how many ballots
 
04:31:50.790 --> 04:31:50.800 align:start position:0%
were counted during the state recount
 
04:31:52.630 --> 04:31:52.640 align:start position:0%
and i and
 
04:31:53.830 --> 04:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
so when i
 
04:31:56.389 --> 04:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
hear people saying that
 
04:31:58.229 --> 04:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
we must be looking at the machines and
 
04:32:00.229 --> 04:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
the machines must be the cause of the
 
04:32:00.239 --> 04:32:01.910 align:start position:0%
the machines must be the cause of the
discrepancy

04:32:01.910 --> 04:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
discrepancy
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
i don't understand when you cannot
 
04:32:08.710 --> 04:32:08.720 align:start position:0%
do a cross-check on any of those numbers
 
04:32:11.110 --> 04:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
and you can do a cross-check in many
 
04:32:14.790 --> 04:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
different ways on the town's
 
04:32:14.800 --> 04:32:15.830 align:start position:0%
different ways on the town's
count

04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
count
 
04:32:19.510 --> 04:32:19.520 align:start position:0%
why is all the emphasis on the machines
 
04:32:19.520 --> 04:32:20.950 align:start position:0%
why is all the emphasis on the machines
um

04:32:20.950 --> 04:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:32:22.950 --> 04:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
wrap up and of course as i've said we
 
04:32:26.070 --> 04:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
will take a written testimony
 
04:32:26.080 --> 04:32:26.950 align:start position:0%
will take a written testimony
okay

04:32:26.950 --> 04:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:32:29.110 --> 04:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer questions
 
04:32:30.710 --> 04:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you does anybody
 
04:32:31.830 --> 04:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
here in the committee room have
 
04:32:36.389 --> 04:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:38.550 --> 04:32:38.560 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question thank you for
 
04:32:41.030 --> 04:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
joining us ms dunn were you at the
 
04:32:41.040 --> 04:32:42.309 align:start position:0%
joining us ms dunn were you at the
recount

04:32:42.309 --> 04:32:42.319 align:start position:0%
recount
 
04:32:45.590 --> 04:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
and yes notice anything
 
04:32:45.600 --> 04:32:46.870 align:start position:0%
and yes notice anything
interesting

04:32:46.870 --> 04:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
04:32:49.269 --> 04:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
significant anything that you considered
 
04:32:52.630 --> 04:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
maybe possibly a miss
 
04:32:54.870 --> 04:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
i did not see and at first i want to
 
04:32:57.349 --> 04:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
state absolutely that i do not think
 
04:32:59.349 --> 04:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
there was anything malevolent that went
 
04:33:00.550 --> 04:33:00.560 align:start position:0%
on i
 
04:33:03.670 --> 04:33:03.680 align:start position:0%
and no i did not see anything
 
04:33:03.680 --> 04:33:04.789 align:start position:0%
and no i did not see anything
that

04:33:04.789 --> 04:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:33:09.670 --> 04:33:09.680 align:start position:0%
i thought was a mistake i was distressed
 
04:33:11.349 --> 04:33:11.359 align:start position:0%
immediately when i found out that they
 
04:33:13.029 --> 04:33:13.039 align:start position:0%
were not counting
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
all of the ballots and that even at the
 
04:33:16.789 --> 04:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
end once they found there was a
 
04:33:18.551 --> 04:33:18.561 align:start position:0%
discrepancy they didn't
 
04:33:20.949 --> 04:33:20.959 align:start position:0%
at that point count all the ballots that
 
04:33:22.470 --> 04:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
were available
 
04:33:24.230 --> 04:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
04:33:26.470 --> 04:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
during this process i'm not going to go
 
04:33:29.429 --> 04:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
into detail about how it happened but
 
04:33:31.830 --> 04:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
during the process there were many many
 
04:33:34.230 --> 04:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
different stacks of
 
04:33:37.189 --> 04:33:37.199 align:start position:0%
ballots on each of the four tables that
 
04:33:39.189 --> 04:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
where the recount was occurring
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
and at one point for example on my table
 
04:33:44.551 --> 04:33:44.561 align:start position:0%
i became so concerned that there were so
 
04:33:46.949 --> 04:33:46.959 align:start position:0%
many stacks of ballots that i stood up
 
04:33:49.029 --> 04:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
and asked them to stop
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
and to
 
04:33:54.150 --> 04:33:54.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that we were aware of which
 
04:33:56.070 --> 04:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
piles were which
 
04:33:56.080 --> 04:33:57.029 align:start position:0%
piles were which
and

04:33:57.029 --> 04:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:00.150 --> 04:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
to consolidate some of the piles so that
 
04:34:02.709 --> 04:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't and couldn't be an error
 
04:34:05.189 --> 04:34:05.199 align:start position:0%
now i did not see a specific error but i
 
04:34:07.349 --> 04:34:07.359 align:start position:0%
think that there's significant
 
04:34:07.359 --> 04:34:08.629 align:start position:0%
think that there's significant
um

04:34:08.629 --> 04:34:08.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:11.990 --> 04:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
risk of error in that process when there
 
04:34:13.590 --> 04:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
were just these stacks of ballots
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
without any labels on them
 
04:34:18.629 --> 04:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
thank you miss dunn representative pair
 
04:34:20.470 --> 04:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
very sorry
 
04:34:21.830 --> 04:34:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes um
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
how many people would you say were at
 
04:34:24.719 --> 04:34:28.150 align:start position:0%
how many people would you say were at
the

04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
did you hear the question it was how
 
04:34:31.109 --> 04:34:31.119 align:start position:0%
many people do you think were there at
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
the marine corps
 
04:34:32.959 --> 04:34:33.830 align:start position:0%
the marine corps
um

04:34:33.830 --> 04:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:37.109 --> 04:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
rough guess i'd say 50.
 
04:34:37.119 --> 04:34:37.990 align:start position:0%
rough guess i'd say 50.
and

04:34:37.990 --> 04:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:48.789 --> 04:34:48.799 align:start position:0%
at the original counting of the ballots
 
04:34:51.109 --> 04:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
are the only counting to be fair yeah
 
04:34:51.119 --> 04:34:51.910 align:start position:0%
are the only counting to be fair yeah
yeah

04:34:51.910 --> 04:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:34:51.920 --> 04:34:53.109 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

04:34:53.109 --> 04:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:53.119 --> 04:34:54.470 align:start position:0%
um
well

04:34:54.470 --> 04:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
we have four machines and we took and
 
04:34:59.590 --> 04:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
the the tapes
 
04:35:02.470 --> 04:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
came out of the four machines
 
04:35:02.480 --> 04:35:03.429 align:start position:0%
came out of the four machines
and

04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
there was also a hand count of eight
 
04:35:09.109 --> 04:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
about 80 ballots
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
there were 10 06
 
04:35:16.150 --> 04:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
i'm hearing
 
04:35:19.830 --> 04:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
not hearing you still i'm not quite sure
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:38.869 --> 04:35:38.879 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry ms dunn we can hear you so
 
04:35:38.879 --> 04:35:39.830 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry ms dunn we can hear you so
okay

04:35:39.830 --> 04:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:35:43.429 --> 04:35:43.439 align:start position:0%
so so the four um tapes that come out of
 
04:35:47.349 --> 04:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
the machines were brought over to two
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
uh people who have done it for years for
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
us set up a spreadsheet
 
04:35:54.150 --> 04:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
the information from the tapes was put
 
04:35:56.070 --> 04:35:56.080 align:start position:0%
into that spreadsheet
 
04:35:56.080 --> 04:35:56.789 align:start position:0%
into that spreadsheet
and

04:35:56.789 --> 04:35:56.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
i think the question was about how many
 
04:35:59.990 --> 04:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
people were there at the end of the
 
04:36:01.910 --> 04:36:01.920 align:start position:0%
night when the tapes and the ballots
 
04:36:05.990 --> 04:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
dozens 40
 
04:36:07.760 --> 04:36:09.029 align:start position:0%
dozens 40
50.

04:36:09.029 --> 04:36:09.039 align:start position:0%
50.
 
04:36:11.590 --> 04:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
there were observers there from both
 
04:36:13.590 --> 04:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
parties um
 
04:36:16.230 --> 04:36:16.240 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of dozen election
 
04:36:18.629 --> 04:36:18.639 align:start position:0%
officials there were there were people
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
who were doing the hand counts
 
04:36:22.310 --> 04:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
many people
 
04:36:24.629 --> 04:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative rowan
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and uh thank you
 
04:36:29.029 --> 04:36:29.039 align:start position:0%
miss done for taking my question
 
04:36:29.039 --> 04:36:30.830 align:start position:0%
miss done for taking my question
uh

04:36:30.830 --> 04:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:36:33.109 --> 04:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
the proposal that we heard at the
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
beginning of this hearing uh
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
for a forensic audit
 
04:36:40.949 --> 04:36:40.959 align:start position:0%
using doing using all four machines with
 
04:36:44.310 --> 04:36:44.320 align:start position:0%
uh with some experts monitoring that
 
04:36:47.510 --> 04:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
and then part of that process was
 
04:36:48.709 --> 04:36:48.719 align:start position:0%
using a
 
04:36:51.910 --> 04:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
another independent machine
 
04:36:54.709 --> 04:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
to count all the ballots
 
04:36:57.590 --> 04:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
independently of of your machines which
 
04:36:59.269 --> 04:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
would then give a
 
04:37:01.429 --> 04:37:01.439 align:start position:0%
an independent count
 
04:37:03.990 --> 04:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the total number of ballots and the
 
04:37:07.029 --> 04:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
results from those ballots
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that that's independent from
 
04:37:10.789 --> 04:37:10.799 align:start position:0%
the machines that we currently have
 
04:37:12.830 --> 04:37:12.840 align:start position:0%
would that satisfy
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
your uh
 
04:37:18.470 --> 04:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
need for for a full recount
 
04:37:21.189 --> 04:37:21.199 align:start position:0%
um sir that
 
04:37:23.109 --> 04:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
i'm not clear
 
04:37:24.869 --> 04:37:24.879 align:start position:0%
on what came out of the committee the
 
04:37:26.150 --> 04:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
other day
 
04:37:27.910 --> 04:37:27.920 align:start position:0%
that you've heard with the 11 points i
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
was not
 
04:37:30.949 --> 04:37:30.959 align:start position:0%
part of that committee
 
04:37:30.959 --> 04:37:31.750 align:start position:0%
part of that committee
but

04:37:31.750 --> 04:37:31.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:37:35.109 --> 04:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
um my personal opinion is i think that
 
04:37:36.310 --> 04:37:36.320 align:start position:0%
if you did an
 
04:37:37.990 --> 04:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
and a
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
a hand audit and i won't call it a
 
04:37:42.230 --> 04:37:42.240 align:start position:0%
recount because it's not going to change
 
04:37:45.109 --> 04:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
the outcome but if you did a hand audit
 
04:37:47.269 --> 04:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
and it matched
 
04:37:49.510 --> 04:37:49.520 align:start position:0%
what came out of windham on election
 
04:37:49.520 --> 04:37:50.470 align:start position:0%
what came out of windham on election
night

04:37:50.470 --> 04:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
night
 
04:37:52.150 --> 04:37:52.160 align:start position:0%
then we would know the machines were
 
04:37:52.160 --> 04:37:53.189 align:start position:0%
then we would know the machines were
fine

04:37:53.189 --> 04:37:53.199 align:start position:0%
fine
 
04:37:53.199 --> 04:37:54.150 align:start position:0%
fine
and

04:37:54.150 --> 04:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:57.029 --> 04:37:57.039 align:start position:0%
then all of the theories about somebody
 
04:37:58.869 --> 04:37:58.879 align:start position:0%
messing with the machines would be taken
 
04:38:01.109 --> 04:38:01.119 align:start position:0%
care of thank you any further questions
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
from is done
 
04:38:03.750 --> 04:38:03.760 align:start position:0%
committee members in the room are
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
committed members attending online
 
04:38:09.670 --> 04:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
representative living
 
04:38:13.750 --> 04:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
thank you um uh miss sun
 
04:38:15.990 --> 04:38:16.000 align:start position:0%
in the bill and you've referred a couple
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
times to four
 
04:38:19.269 --> 04:38:19.279 align:start position:0%
sets of ballots is that because there
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
were four machines and they tried to
 
04:38:23.510 --> 04:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
keep each machine's
 
04:38:25.189 --> 04:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
ballot separately i'm just trying to
 
04:38:27.189 --> 04:38:27.199 align:start position:0%
figure out why everybody's referring to
 
04:38:27.199 --> 04:38:28.869 align:start position:0%
figure out why everybody's referring to
four

04:38:28.869 --> 04:38:28.879 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
there were four machines however
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
i have wondered why that is is continued
 
04:38:38.629 --> 04:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
because when the machines are emptied
 
04:38:38.639 --> 04:38:39.990 align:start position:0%
because when the machines are emptied
out

04:38:39.990 --> 04:38:40.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:38:43.910 --> 04:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
the ballots were stored away
 
04:38:47.189 --> 04:38:47.199 align:start position:0%
not in four separate boxes one for each
 
04:38:49.269 --> 04:38:49.279 align:start position:0%
machine that has never been a
 
04:38:52.230 --> 04:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
requirement or a suggestion and that was
 
04:38:53.990 --> 04:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
not done
 
04:38:56.551 --> 04:38:56.561 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you question thank you
 
04:39:01.670 --> 04:39:01.680 align:start position:0%

04:41:03.510 --> 04:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
just a minute and
 
04:41:09.910 --> 04:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:12.390 --> 04:41:12.400 align:start position:0%

04:41:17.190 --> 04:41:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i was hoping i raised my hand to ask
 
04:41:19.430 --> 04:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
mr steve scanlan a question and i was
 
04:41:21.510 --> 04:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
hoping this wouldn't go into my one
 
04:41:24.310 --> 04:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
minute time frame is that okay
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
what did you want we don't have
 
04:41:29.510 --> 04:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
we just sort of so you know
 
04:41:31.110 --> 04:41:31.120 align:start position:0%
and you know there are people who
 
04:41:33.030 --> 04:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
certainly have more experience than i do
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
but if you have a question um as a
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
participant if you let us know what it
 
04:41:40.550 --> 04:41:40.560 align:start position:0%
is we'll do our best to try and get it
 
04:41:41.830 --> 04:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
answered while you're here online i
 
04:41:43.350 --> 04:41:43.360 align:start position:0%
don't even know who's online at this
 
04:41:45.430 --> 04:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
point okay i'll just try to get it all
 
04:41:49.030 --> 04:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
done in two minutes because i have it um
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
first one okay so i raised my hand to mr
 
04:41:53.990 --> 04:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
scalin's question and was looked over so
 
04:41:55.190 --> 04:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping
 
04:41:55.200 --> 04:41:55.990 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping
um

04:41:55.990 --> 04:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
this is not going to my content we
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
already talked about that sorry it's
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
insane to me anyone who logically can
 
04:42:02.470 --> 04:42:02.480 align:start position:0%
look at the fact that each republican
 
04:42:04.628 --> 04:42:04.638 align:start position:0%
gained 300 votes and state this anomaly
 
04:42:06.310 --> 04:42:06.320 align:start position:0%
can be due to the hand count makes me
 
04:42:08.948 --> 04:42:08.958 align:start position:0%
seriously question the agenda mr scalin
 
04:42:10.708 --> 04:42:10.718 align:start position:0%
statistically speaking hand counts are
 
04:42:13.510 --> 04:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
more accurate it worries me to hear
 
04:42:15.270 --> 04:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
you state that we may never know what
 
04:42:18.070 --> 04:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
happened in four months this is the only
 
04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
time we've heard from the secretary of
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
state's office publicly anyways when i
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
started this journey i called the
 
04:42:24.550 --> 04:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's office and was
 
04:42:26.628 --> 04:42:26.638 align:start position:0%
assured that the machines are 25 years
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
old and what and also well assured that
 
04:42:30.948 --> 04:42:30.958 align:start position:0%
they have no software during the same
 
04:42:32.708 --> 04:42:32.718 align:start position:0%
conversation a few minutes later she
 
04:42:34.550 --> 04:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
stated the machines were updated in
 
04:42:37.430 --> 04:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
2010. i asked how how can you update
 
04:42:39.430 --> 04:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
something that had has no software the
 
04:42:40.868 --> 04:42:40.878 align:start position:0%
lady who i was speaking with put me on
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
hold and transferred me to bud fitch who
 
04:42:45.270 --> 04:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
then stated it was actually firmware i
 
04:42:46.708 --> 04:42:46.718 align:start position:0%
asked the secretary of state's office
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
multiple times
 
04:42:50.070 --> 04:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
why they have not been more involved and
 
04:42:52.708 --> 04:42:52.718 align:start position:0%
cannot answer the answer as to why as an
 
04:42:54.628 --> 04:42:54.638 align:start position:0%
auditor who specializes in recreating
 
04:42:56.470 --> 04:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
million dollar businesses transactions
 
04:42:58.628 --> 04:42:58.638 align:start position:0%
using forensic accounting i do not feel
 
04:43:01.350 --> 04:43:01.360 align:start position:0%
confident in the integrity or i am or
 
04:43:02.628 --> 04:43:02.638 align:start position:0%
confident with the new hampshire
 
04:43:04.310 --> 04:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
secretary of state or attorney general's
 
04:43:06.230 --> 04:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
office i am a nashua and windham
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
resident in support of sb 43 and all the
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
amendments outlines with all due respect
 
04:43:12.628 --> 04:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
if you don't support this bill i i fear
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
that new hampshire residents will fur
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
question further your dedication as
 
04:43:18.390 --> 04:43:18.400 align:start position:0%
elected officials to the great news
 
04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
people of new hampshire leading us to
 
04:43:22.070 --> 04:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
cause a further divide between civilians
 
04:43:23.830 --> 04:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
and our government it is time to unite
 
04:43:25.430 --> 04:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
it is time for us to feel like you work
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
for we the people if this bill becomes
 
04:43:30.150 --> 04:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
labeled tabled or rejected you give us
 
04:43:32.150 --> 04:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
no choice but to question the future and
 
04:43:33.990 --> 04:43:34.000 align:start position:0%
the freedom of our children i am asking
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
you to to not put us in this position we
 
04:43:37.990 --> 04:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to question our
 
04:43:39.990 --> 04:43:40.000 align:start position:0%
children's future of freedom in america
 
04:43:41.670 --> 04:43:41.680 align:start position:0%
by our reps not protecting our election
 
04:43:44.230 --> 04:43:44.240 align:start position:0%
integrity i will assume many people have
 
04:43:45.750 --> 04:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
here have children why would you not
 
04:43:47.430 --> 04:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
want to ensure their freedom in the only
 
04:43:48.868 --> 04:43:48.878 align:start position:0%
country if rand
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
if we're incorrectly by trusted
 
04:43:52.390 --> 04:43:52.400 align:start position:0%
government would ensure exactly that
 
04:43:54.150 --> 04:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
this is why election integrity matters
 
04:43:55.830 --> 04:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
since when does the constitution protect
 
04:43:57.830 --> 04:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
our government over we the people it's
 
04:44:00.230 --> 04:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
like pulling teeth to rescan 10k votes
 
04:44:01.590 --> 04:44:01.600 align:start position:0%
through a machine that produced the
 
04:44:03.110 --> 04:44:03.120 align:start position:0%
largest voting discrepancy in new
 
04:44:05.110 --> 04:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire history with all due respect
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
in my opinion this should this bill
 
04:44:08.470 --> 04:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
should have been sent straight to the
 
04:44:10.230 --> 04:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
house especially with the unanimous vote
 
04:44:12.230 --> 04:44:12.240 align:start position:0%
in the senate as an auditor i can't help
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
but feel as though this is just another
 
04:44:15.590 --> 04:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
process to delay us from getting the
 
04:44:17.910 --> 04:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
truth this response this nonsense has to
 
04:44:20.150 --> 04:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
stop finishing up
 
04:44:21.670 --> 04:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
people will get the truth regarding the
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
gateway to our freedom with or without
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
the ridiculous processes we have to go
 
04:44:27.510 --> 04:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
through our state's constitution gives
 
04:44:29.750 --> 04:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
us this authority i don't think many
 
04:44:32.230 --> 04:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
people understand the fact that if if
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
there is an issue within these machines
 
04:44:35.990 --> 04:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
it literally means we are indeed not
 
04:44:38.390 --> 04:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
free and i have no idea why more people
 
04:44:40.550 --> 04:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
are not taking this more seriously we
 
04:44:42.708 --> 04:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
need answers and we need them if you
 
04:44:46.550 --> 04:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:49.190 --> 04:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
did i get it all out
 
04:44:50.948 --> 04:44:50.958 align:start position:0%
are you reading something this time
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%

us online here
 
04:45:07.990 --> 04:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
and i understand you have some questions
 
04:45:10.150 --> 04:45:10.160 align:start position:0%
and quite often at the end of hearings i
 
04:45:12.230 --> 04:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
might recognize him to see if he has
 
04:45:14.150 --> 04:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
anything he wants to address to clarify
 
04:45:15.430 --> 04:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so i expect to be doing that so

satisfy the needs of affirming the
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
accuracy and public trust in the
 
04:46:19.510 --> 04:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
accuvope machines
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
but we do need to
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
need an audit of the recount process to
 
04:46:26.788 --> 04:46:26.798 align:start position:0%
be able to understand the approximately
 
04:46:29.190 --> 04:46:29.200 align:start position:0%
300 vote discrepancy on the state rep
 
04:46:29.200 --> 04:46:30.470 align:start position:0%
300 vote discrepancy on the state rep
race

04:48:52.830 --> 04:48:52.840 align:start position:0%
change it so
 
04:48:55.030 --> 04:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
um i've lived in new hampshire all my
 
04:48:57.750 --> 04:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
life except for like four years and
 
04:48:59.350 --> 04:48:59.360 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of us that have known that
 
04:49:01.190 --> 04:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
there's been some problems going on for
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
a long time in new hampshire but
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to windham specifically
 
04:49:08.390 --> 04:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
i just don't understand we are it's
 
04:49:09.590 --> 04:49:09.600 align:start position:0%
march 5th
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
this all started november 16th
 
04:49:14.150 --> 04:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
i just can't even imagine
 
04:49:15.990 --> 04:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
why we are continuing to go through this
 
04:49:18.708 --> 04:49:18.718 align:start position:0%
process it is so easy it's really easy
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
one person
 
04:49:22.150 --> 04:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
there was a person that talked earlier
 
04:49:24.390 --> 04:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
who can do forensic accounting could get
 
04:49:26.788 --> 04:49:26.798 align:start position:0%
this done in one day run all the ballots
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
through each one of the four machines
 
04:49:31.830 --> 04:49:31.840 align:start position:0%
literally do an audit of the ballots
 
04:49:33.350 --> 04:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
count them all down
 
04:49:34.868 --> 04:49:34.878 align:start position:0%
you can have a whole team there'll be
 
04:49:36.070 --> 04:49:36.080 align:start position:0%
thousands of people that would be
 
04:49:37.910 --> 04:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
volunteered to do this
 
04:49:37.920 --> 04:49:38.868 align:start position:0%
volunteered to do this
so

04:49:38.868 --> 04:49:38.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:38.878 --> 04:49:39.750 align:start position:0%
so
what

04:49:39.750 --> 04:49:39.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:49:41.910 --> 04:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
mr scanlon said earlier is just so
 
04:49:44.310 --> 04:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
concerning i mean it
 
04:49:46.230 --> 04:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
some of the stuff does doesn't even make
 
04:49:48.390 --> 04:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
any sense he says we might never know
 
04:49:49.670 --> 04:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
what happened
 
04:49:51.990 --> 04:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
i mean are you kidding me follow the 11
 
04:49:54.150 --> 04:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
points in the amendment
 
04:49:57.750 --> 04:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
pass through sb 43 follow the amendments
 
04:49:59.430 --> 04:49:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's really no room for error in
 
04:50:02.310 --> 04:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
there this really isn't rocket science
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
i i mean i just it's it's
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
bizarre that we are still in this place
 
04:50:06.958 --> 04:50:07.990 align:start position:0%
bizarre that we are still in this place
um

04:50:07.990 --> 04:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
i hope you realize we're all watching
 
04:50:12.550 --> 04:50:12.560 align:start position:0%
this very closely this is this is so
 
04:50:15.910 --> 04:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
beyond what's going on i mean we are
 
04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
part of a group a lot of us
 
04:50:22.070 --> 04:50:22.080 align:start position:0%
you got three petitions um sent to you
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%

04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
combined over 1500 signatures of people
 
04:50:33.910 --> 04:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
that have been working on this for a
 
04:50:36.628 --> 04:50:36.638 align:start position:0%
long time we have
 
04:50:39.030 --> 04:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
we have served the ag we have done
 
04:50:41.750 --> 04:50:41.760 align:start position:0%

state we have been ignored
 
04:50:52.070 --> 04:50:52.080 align:start position:0%
and now only until we've got heroes like
 
04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
ken and badaida and all these folks that
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
are that finally
 
04:50:58.868 --> 04:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
you know we've got senate bill passes
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
24-0 and now it has to go to committee
 
04:51:03.910 --> 04:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then it has to go to the house
 
04:51:05.190 --> 04:51:05.200 align:start position:0%
what is this going to be by the time
 
04:51:08.470 --> 04:51:08.480 align:start position:0%

which is derry and i rise in support of
 
04:53:38.230 --> 04:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
senate bill 43 and the amendment that
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
leaves no stone unturned in search for
 
04:53:42.628 --> 04:53:42.638 align:start position:0%
the truth in the in the windham election
 
04:53:44.788 --> 04:53:44.798 align:start position:0%
i believe it would be a travesty to look
 
04:53:46.788 --> 04:53:46.798 align:start position:0%
at just the state rep race as it would
 
04:53:48.708 --> 04:53:48.718 align:start position:0%
do nothing to to instill public
 
04:53:50.550 --> 04:53:50.560 align:start position:0%
confidence in our elections
 
04:53:53.030 --> 04:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
i uh i did attend that uh that meeting
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%

04:53:57.830 --> 04:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
select board meeting and i received a
 
04:53:59.510 --> 04:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
copy of the uh the accu vote machine
 
04:54:01.670 --> 04:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
tapes and the discrepancies at the top
 
04:54:03.350 --> 04:54:03.360 align:start position:0%
of the ballot were disturbing to say the
 
04:54:03.360 --> 04:54:04.708 align:start position:0%
of the ballot were disturbing to say the
least

04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
least
 
04:54:07.030 --> 04:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
begin to begin with uh
 
04:54:07.990 --> 04:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:54:09.990 --> 04:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
it was close to a third of the ballots
 
04:54:12.150 --> 04:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
will run through machine number two
 
04:54:14.708 --> 04:54:14.718 align:start position:0%

you know election integrity is is
 
04:55:23.510 --> 04:55:23.520 align:start position:0%
is at the very root of the tree of
 
04:55:25.350 --> 04:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
liberty we need to restore public
 
04:55:26.948 --> 04:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
confidence and you've heard a lot a lot
 
04:55:29.190 --> 04:55:29.200 align:start position:0%
of no confidence votes in our elections
 
04:55:31.510 --> 04:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
process today uh we need to prove
 
04:55:33.510 --> 04:55:33.520 align:start position:0%
without any doubt just what happened who
 
04:55:35.030 --> 04:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
was responsible and if there was a crime
 
04:55:37.350 --> 04:55:37.360 align:start position:0%
committed the people and people a person
 
04:55:38.550 --> 04:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
04:55:39.670 --> 04:55:39.680 align:start position:0%
the person people are personally
 
04:55:41.830 --> 04:55:41.840 align:start position:0%
responsible needs to be prosecuted and
 
04:55:43.030 --> 04:55:43.040 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
04:55:44.470 --> 04:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
there was a vote counting machine in
 
04:55:46.310 --> 04:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
derry that was very very different from

had asked this question before but um
 
04:57:04.788 --> 04:57:04.798 align:start position:0%
with the proposal that um
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state said he supports uh
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
to have uh
 
04:57:09.440 --> 04:57:10.230 align:start position:0%
to have uh
the

04:57:10.230 --> 04:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:57:11.910 --> 04:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
ballots run through the four machines
 
04:57:13.990 --> 04:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
and then have a separate
 
04:57:16.070 --> 04:57:16.080 align:start position:0%
independent machine
 
04:57:17.830 --> 04:57:17.840 align:start position:0%
not related to our machines count the
 
04:57:20.708 --> 04:57:20.718 align:start position:0%
ballots completely again would that
 
04:57:22.708 --> 04:57:22.718 align:start position:0%
satisfy your
 
04:57:22.718 --> 04:57:24.070 align:start position:0%
satisfy your
concern

04:57:24.070 --> 04:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
concern
 
04:57:27.750 --> 04:57:27.760 align:start position:0%
for comparison with the machines
 
04:57:30.310 --> 04:57:30.320 align:start position:0%
mildly oh thanks for the question uh
 
04:57:32.628 --> 04:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
it'd mildly satisfy mike's concerns i
 
04:57:34.708 --> 04:57:34.718 align:start position:0%
think the whole ballot needs to be taken
 
04:57:36.948 --> 04:57:36.958 align:start position:0%
taking a look at i mean if if say for
 
04:57:39.110 --> 04:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
instance uh there was a crime committed
 
04:57:41.430 --> 04:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
and these uh they do have uh memory
 
04:57:43.350 --> 04:57:43.360 align:start position:0%
boards and stuff and if they run through
 
04:57:44.948 --> 04:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
that memory board
 
04:57:47.430 --> 04:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
um if they were programmed to uh to to
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
take uh you know to if that number two
 
04:57:52.788 --> 04:57:52.798 align:start position:0%
machine was programmed to uh to hurt
 
04:57:55.670 --> 04:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
republicans uh it very well could be uh
 
04:57:57.030 --> 04:57:57.040 align:start position:0%
we need we need to look at every
 
04:57:57.040 --> 04:57:58.708 align:start position:0%
we need we need to look at every
possibility

04:57:58.708 --> 04:57:58.718 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
04:58:00.470 --> 04:58:00.480 align:start position:0%

04:59:30.788 --> 04:59:30.798 align:start position:0%
election committee for hearing my
 
04:59:32.948 --> 04:59:32.958 align:start position:0%
testimony my name is lisa mazur i live
 
04:59:35.110 --> 04:59:35.120 align:start position:0%
in goffstown new hampshire i have lived
 
04:59:37.830 --> 04:59:37.840 align:start position:0%
in the u.s for 26 years here on a green
 
04:59:40.470 --> 04:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
card from canada and just became a us
 
04:59:42.708 --> 04:59:42.718 align:start position:0%
citizen this past january
 
04:59:44.628 --> 04:59:44.638 align:start position:0%
the reason i became a citizen after all
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
these years is because i love america
 
04:59:48.708 --> 04:59:48.718 align:start position:0%
with all my heart and i'm ready to start
 
04:59:51.350 --> 04:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
using my voice with my vote i believe in
 
04:59:53.110 --> 04:59:53.120 align:start position:0%
our country and our constitution but i'm
 
04:59:55.990 --> 04:59:56.000 align:start position:0%
not gonna lie at this moment my faith
 
04:59:57.830 --> 04:59:57.840 align:start position:0%
and belief in both of those things are
 
04:59:59.350 --> 04:59:59.360 align:start position:0%
very shaken after what i've seen
 
05:00:01.830 --> 05:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
happening in our country since november
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
it hit close to home when the
 
05:00:05.030 --> 05:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancy was unveiled right here in
 
05:00:07.270 --> 05:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire this was the largest
 
05:00:09.030 --> 05:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between machine and hand
 
05:00:10.628 --> 05:00:10.638 align:start position:0%
count totals in the history of new
 
05:00:12.150 --> 05:00:12.160 align:start position:0%
hampshire elections
 
05:00:14.390 --> 05:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
because of this a forensic analysis of
 
05:00:16.470 --> 05:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
the machines including cards and ballots
 
05:00:18.708 --> 05:00:18.718 align:start position:0%
needs to be conducted the machines and
 
05:00:20.868 --> 05:00:20.878 align:start position:0%
ballots are town property so the town of
 
05:00:20.878 --> 05:00:21.990 align:start position:0%
ballots are town property so the town of
windham

05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
windham
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
via its board of selectmen should
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
determine which firms does this forensic
 
05:00:26.080 --> 05:00:27.190 align:start position:0%
determine which firms does this forensic
analysis

05:00:27.190 --> 05:00:27.200 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
05:00:29.590 --> 05:00:29.600 align:start position:0%
i have never voted in my life and i'm
 
05:00:33.110 --> 05:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
now terrified that my first vote in 2022
 
05:00:35.510 --> 05:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
might be taken from me my confidence is
 
05:00:37.510 --> 05:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
shaken in our voting system
 
05:00:39.830 --> 05:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
rep representative scanlon you said that
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
we may never know what happened but we
 
05:00:44.070 --> 05:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
sure as heck should
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
the accubo machines are owned by
 
05:00:47.910 --> 05:00:47.920 align:start position:0%
dominion and dominion is a canadian
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
company these machines are banned from
 
05:00:52.868 --> 05:00:52.878 align:start position:0%
being used in canada so maybe we should
 
05:00:54.470 --> 05:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
take a cue from them
 
05:00:56.470 --> 05:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
we have to get this right i don't
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
understand why you wouldn't want to get
 
05:01:00.150 --> 05:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
this right as well it's been too long
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
since november
 
05:01:03.750 --> 05:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
wmur and the union leader call this all
 
05:01:05.830 --> 05:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
a conspiracy theory but for me it's a
 
05:01:08.150 --> 05:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
search for truth regardless of party
 
05:01:08.160 --> 05:01:09.110 align:start position:0%
search for truth regardless of party
lines

05:01:09.110 --> 05:01:09.120 align:start position:0%
lines
 
05:01:11.190 --> 05:01:11.200 align:start position:0%
you have to do the right thing this new
 
05:01:11.200 --> 05:01:12.230 align:start position:0%
you have to do the right thing this new

needs to know that my voice is being
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
heard and that my first ever vote in my
 
05:01:23.830 --> 05:01:23.840 align:start position:0%

uh vlad glad to have you here um my
 
05:01:54.070 --> 05:01:54.080 align:start position:0%
question is about your faith in our
 
05:01:56.230 --> 05:01:56.240 align:start position:0%
elections would you say that things like
 
05:01:58.948 --> 05:01:58.958 align:start position:0%
this where election abnormalities occur
 
05:02:00.708 --> 05:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
cause you lose faith in the elections
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
and thus less likely to vote a hundred
 
05:02:05.110 --> 05:02:05.120 align:start position:0%
percent i actually don't want to vote in
 
05:02:05.120 --> 05:02:06.708 align:start position:0%
percent i actually don't want to vote in
2022.

05:02:06.708 --> 05:02:06.718 align:start position:0%
2022.
 
05:02:10.230 --> 05:02:10.240 align:start position:0%
i'm so disgusted with what i'm seeing i
 
05:02:12.628 --> 05:02:12.638 align:start position:0%
i can't even believe what i'm seeing
 
05:02:14.470 --> 05:02:14.480 align:start position:0%
happening in this country i didn't sign
 
05:02:16.470 --> 05:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
up for this when i signed up to be a
 
05:02:19.030 --> 05:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
citizen i was so excited and now i feel
 
05:02:22.230 --> 05:02:22.240 align:start position:0%
like it's all being taken away from me
 
05:02:28.310 --> 05:02:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:34.070 --> 05:02:34.080 align:start position:0%

um i am
 
05:03:17.670 --> 05:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
not a new citizen by any means i've
 
05:03:19.750 --> 05:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
always been a citizen here i'm 66 years
 
05:03:22.230 --> 05:03:22.240 align:start position:0%
old i live in amherst new hampshire and
 
05:03:23.830 --> 05:03:23.840 align:start position:0%
i'm very concerned
 
05:03:26.150 --> 05:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
that we are losing our ability to
 
05:03:29.110 --> 05:03:29.120 align:start position:0%
actually elect free representatives
 
05:03:30.390 --> 05:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
freely elect
 
05:03:33.030 --> 05:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
our representatives for a representative
 
05:03:33.040 --> 05:03:34.550 align:start position:0%
our representatives for a representative
government

05:03:34.550 --> 05:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
government
 
05:03:37.670 --> 05:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
i so much appreciate everyone there and
 
05:03:39.590 --> 05:03:39.600 align:start position:0%
all of the work that all of you are
 
05:03:43.830 --> 05:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
doing uh including mrs dunn um i i i
 
05:03:46.310 --> 05:03:46.320 align:start position:0%
can't imagine the amount of work that's
 
05:03:48.868 --> 05:03:48.878 align:start position:0%
that's necessary to put on an election
 
05:03:51.350 --> 05:03:51.360 align:start position:0%
um but i think it's time for us all to
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
to stop necessarily patting each other
 
05:03:54.868 --> 05:03:54.878 align:start position:0%
on the back and say there's still more
 
05:03:57.590 --> 05:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
work to be done here there's some hard
 
05:03:59.030 --> 05:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
work to be done
 
05:04:02.230 --> 05:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
to restore confidence in our voting
 
05:04:02.240 --> 05:04:03.990 align:start position:0%
to restore confidence in our voting
system

05:04:03.990 --> 05:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
system
 
05:04:05.830 --> 05:04:05.840 align:start position:0%
i would simply like to say that that the
 
05:04:08.310 --> 05:04:08.320 align:start position:0%
proposal that was made at the beginning
 
05:04:11.190 --> 05:04:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh of this hearing uh with senator uh
 
05:04:13.110 --> 05:04:13.120 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
05:04:16.390 --> 05:04:16.400 align:start position:0%
mr garner and uh and ken eyring um i am
 
05:04:19.190 --> 05:04:19.200 align:start position:0%
in fullest full support of um i think
 
05:04:21.590 --> 05:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
everything needs to be completely
 
05:04:24.150 --> 05:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
transparent and completely open
 
05:04:27.270 --> 05:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i certainly would like to see all of
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
the ballots um
 
05:04:31.910 --> 05:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
looked at and i do think that people
 
05:04:33.910 --> 05:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
need to to remember that if there's a
 
05:04:36.390 --> 05:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
forensic audit that will look at the
 
05:04:39.270 --> 05:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
machines and the ballots
 
05:04:41.750 --> 05:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
so um i think we might have both bases
 
05:04:43.590 --> 05:04:43.600 align:start position:0%
covered there but that's all i'd like to
 
05:04:44.868 --> 05:04:44.878 align:start position:0%
say please
 
05:04:48.150 --> 05:04:48.160 align:start position:0%

05:04:51.190 --> 05:04:51.200 align:start position:0%

05:05:50.788 --> 05:05:50.798 align:start position:0%
many phone calls questioning the
 
05:05:52.550 --> 05:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
integrity of the vote
 
05:05:56.230 --> 05:05:56.240 align:start position:0%

deputy um
 
05:06:02.948 --> 05:06:02.958 align:start position:0%
scanlan i was at the wyndham count i got
 
05:06:04.948 --> 05:06:04.958 align:start position:0%
there about halfway through
 
05:06:07.670 --> 05:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
um all 50 people were not just there for
 
05:06:08.788 --> 05:06:08.798 align:start position:0%
the um
 
05:06:10.628 --> 05:06:10.638 align:start position:0%
the windham vote because there was two
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
or three different uh counts going on in
 
05:06:15.190 --> 05:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
different rooms so there was people in
 
05:06:18.150 --> 05:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
and out of there um as far as uh the
 
05:06:20.310 --> 05:06:20.320 align:start position:0%
amendments that are going forward
 
05:06:23.110 --> 05:06:23.120 align:start position:0%
i would support whatever ever we need to
 
05:06:25.430 --> 05:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
do to correct this problem because
 
05:06:27.750 --> 05:06:27.760 align:start position:0%
there's an integrity problem right now
 
05:06:29.510 --> 05:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
with many people that are constantly
 
05:06:32.230 --> 05:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
calling us on the uh wyndham not just
 
05:06:34.150 --> 05:06:34.160 align:start position:0%
windham now i didn't even know about
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
derry's votes on the over our votes and
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
i know the londonderry machine broke one
 
05:06:41.510 --> 05:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
of our machines broke at night the same
 
05:06:43.990 --> 05:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
thing happened in nashua a machine broke
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
i don't know how many other cities or
 
05:06:48.470 --> 05:06:48.480 align:start position:0%
towns that they had a problem
 
05:06:50.150 --> 05:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
with a machine breaking because
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
londonderry didn't get their vote count
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
in until
 
05:06:56.230 --> 05:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
405 or 4 10 in the morning
 
05:06:58.070 --> 05:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
this is very important
 
05:06:59.670 --> 05:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
for us to do
 
05:07:01.510 --> 05:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
most people don't know we're finally
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
hopefully going to give the secretary of
 
05:07:05.830 --> 05:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
state the authority to audit i don't
 
05:07:07.990 --> 05:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
know why they never had it it should
 
05:07:10.390 --> 05:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
have been done a long time ago but we're
 
05:07:12.230 --> 05:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
not going to go behind whatever happened
 
05:07:13.990 --> 05:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
in the past we're going to hopefully
 
05:07:16.150 --> 05:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
move forward and correct this so i thank
 
05:07:17.190 --> 05:07:17.200 align:start position:0%
you all
 
05:07:19.110 --> 05:07:19.120 align:start position:0%
and hopefully we pass this and move it
 
05:07:21.270 --> 05:07:21.280 align:start position:0%
forward so we can vote it in our next
 
05:07:21.280 --> 05:07:22.788 align:start position:0%
forward so we can vote it in our next

madam chair and members of the committee
 
05:08:03.830 --> 05:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
my name is michael o'brien i
 
05:08:07.110 --> 05:08:07.120 align:start position:0%
am here with operating strategies um and
 
05:08:08.948 --> 05:08:08.958 align:start position:0%
uh justifying half of my client america
 
05:08:11.430 --> 05:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
votes um very brief because it has been
 
05:08:13.830 --> 05:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
a long day we do support um
 
05:08:16.070 --> 05:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
this we feel it's very important to make
 
05:08:19.030 --> 05:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we have answers um we also do
 
05:08:20.628 --> 05:08:20.638 align:start position:0%
very much firmly agree with previous
 
05:08:22.628 --> 05:08:22.638 align:start position:0%
speakers who said we should look into
 
05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
the recount itself we don't know where
 
05:08:26.948 --> 05:08:26.958 align:start position:0%
the error had occurred i also think it's
 
05:08:28.310 --> 05:08:28.320 align:start position:0%
very important for committee members and
 
05:08:29.830 --> 05:08:29.840 align:start position:0%
everyone listening
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
that there were lots of recounts done
 
05:08:35.110 --> 05:08:35.120 align:start position:0%
and races that were large and small
 
05:08:36.868 --> 05:08:36.878 align:start position:0%
and none of them produced issues like we
 
05:08:38.230 --> 05:08:38.240 align:start position:0%
saw in windham so we should treat this
 
05:08:40.788 --> 05:08:40.798 align:start position:0%
as an abnormality because it is
 
05:08:42.070 --> 05:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
and we
 
05:08:43.350 --> 05:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
need to find the answers but i don't
 
05:08:44.948 --> 05:08:44.958 align:start position:0%
think it helps to start thinking this is
 
05:08:46.948 --> 05:08:46.958 align:start position:0%
a larger problem when it seems pretty
 
05:08:49.670 --> 05:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
confined that's all i really have to say
 
05:08:52.708 --> 05:08:52.718 align:start position:0%
questions if anybody has any
 
05:08:54.390 --> 05:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr o'brien any
 
05:08:56.708 --> 05:08:56.718 align:start position:0%
questions for mr o'brien from
 
05:08:58.628 --> 05:08:58.638 align:start position:0%
committee members or
 
05:08:58.638 --> 05:08:59.910 align:start position:0%

which would be committee members
 
05:09:03.990 --> 05:09:04.000 align:start position:0%

05:09:24.070 --> 05:09:24.080 align:start position:0%

thank you very much welcome
 
05:09:32.070 --> 05:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for having me madam chair uh
 
05:09:33.830 --> 05:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and your committee for the
 
05:09:36.310 --> 05:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
patience the professionalism
 
05:09:37.990 --> 05:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
and the
 
05:09:39.590 --> 05:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
deliberate approach you've taken to this
 
05:09:41.030 --> 05:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
problem it really speaks well for the
 
05:09:43.910 --> 05:09:43.920 align:start position:0%
people we have elected on all parties
 
05:09:45.590 --> 05:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
you've done very well
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
now that said i have uh submitted
 
05:09:49.910 --> 05:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
written documents to you before
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
most important amongst those are reports
 
05:09:54.310 --> 05:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
that indicate the number of problems
 
05:09:56.390 --> 05:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
these machines have had not because they
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
weren't good machines in their day
 
05:10:00.868 --> 05:10:00.878 align:start position:0%
but like the studebaker i had in college
 
05:10:02.948 --> 05:10:02.958 align:start position:0%
they have seen their day and they have
 
05:10:05.990 --> 05:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
as many problems as my studebaker did
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
that said
 
05:10:09.750 --> 05:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
there is no bill that you can pass that
 
05:10:11.430 --> 05:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
will fix the problem
 
05:10:13.510 --> 05:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
that is not your jurisdiction you can
 
05:10:13.520 --> 05:10:14.550 align:start position:0%
that is not your jurisdiction you can
however

05:10:14.550 --> 05:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
however
 
05:10:16.470 --> 05:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
follow up on the senate's
 
05:10:19.030 --> 05:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh good work and define the process by
 
05:10:21.590 --> 05:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
which this process can be fixed
 
05:10:24.470 --> 05:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
the proposal that mr ewing had
 
05:10:27.350 --> 05:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
made with mr gardner is right on point
 
05:10:29.670 --> 05:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
the forensic analysis of the machines
 
05:10:31.990 --> 05:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
will answer a lot of questions not only
 
05:10:34.390 --> 05:10:34.400 align:start position:0%
about the windham machines but also the
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
current state of our inventory so you
 
05:10:40.150 --> 05:10:40.160 align:start position:0%
will have be able to solve the windham
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
problem or at least get answers to the
 
05:10:44.788 --> 05:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
windham problem and give you an insight
 
05:10:46.628 --> 05:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
into the machines and other problems
 
05:10:48.830 --> 05:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
that may happen over the next couple of
 
05:10:52.390 --> 05:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
years all that process
 
05:10:54.628 --> 05:10:54.638 align:start position:0%
you will do and you will go a long way
 
05:10:57.190 --> 05:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
to restoring the integrity or the belief
 
05:10:59.590 --> 05:10:59.600 align:start position:0%
in the integrity of our voting process
 
05:11:01.430 --> 05:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
here in new hampshire so i would
 
05:11:03.830 --> 05:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
respectfully request that you pass the
 
05:11:06.470 --> 05:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill with the amendments that mr erring
 
05:11:09.750 --> 05:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
and mr cartner have offered thank you
 
05:11:11.430 --> 05:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
05:11:13.190 --> 05:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
this afternoon and speaking with us
 
05:11:14.230 --> 05:11:14.240 align:start position:0%
another one
 
05:11:15.750 --> 05:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
 
05:11:15.760 --> 05:11:29.990 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
representatives

05:11:29.990 --> 05:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
that comes with fruition that will
 
05:11:34.550 --> 05:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
satisfy your uh
 
05:11:36.230 --> 05:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
your need that we've
 
05:11:38.310 --> 05:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
done what we can do to get to the bottom
 
05:11:40.788 --> 05:11:40.798 align:start position:0%
of this well most definitely when they
 
05:11:43.190 --> 05:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
do the forensic analysis of the machines
 
05:11:45.030 --> 05:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to tell you
 
05:11:47.110 --> 05:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
whether the machines are accurate or not
 
05:11:49.590 --> 05:11:49.600 align:start position:0%
accurate uh and if there's a problem
 
05:11:51.190 --> 05:11:51.200 align:start position:0%
they'll identify it if there's not a
 
05:11:51.200 --> 05:11:52.390 align:start position:0%
they'll identify it if there's not a
problem

05:11:52.390 --> 05:11:52.400 align:start position:0%
problem
 
05:11:54.390 --> 05:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
then they'll give you the direction to
 
05:11:57.030 --> 05:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
go was it a problem made at windham was
 
05:11:58.708 --> 05:11:58.718 align:start position:0%
it a problem at the secretary of state's
 
05:12:00.948 --> 05:12:00.958 align:start position:0%
office a human problem but it will
 
05:12:02.628 --> 05:12:02.638 align:start position:0%
definitely eliminate the question as to
 
05:12:03.910 --> 05:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
whether or not it's a machine or a
 
05:12:06.070 --> 05:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
programming issue and they will be able
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
to prove it by
 
05:12:10.070 --> 05:12:10.080 align:start position:0%
running the ballots through a second
 
05:12:11.750 --> 05:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
unrelated machine
 
05:12:14.390 --> 05:12:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's pretty simple it's pretty basic
 
05:12:16.390 --> 05:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
 
05:12:16.400 --> 05:12:21.910 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any further
questions

05:12:21.920 --> 05:12:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
correctly

05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%

if you can unmute yourself you will be
 
05:13:34.628 --> 05:13:34.638 align:start position:0%

we can welcome oh my goodness sorry
 
05:13:40.708 --> 05:13:40.718 align:start position:0%
about that
 
05:13:43.670 --> 05:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
all right um so i'm joan darjee the town
 
05:13:46.150 --> 05:13:46.160 align:start position:0%
clerk in milford and i'm also um on the
 
05:13:48.070 --> 05:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
executive board of the new hampshire
 
05:13:51.350 --> 05:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
city and town clerks association and i'm
 
05:13:53.430 --> 05:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
the co-chair of the legislative
 
05:13:55.910 --> 05:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee along with dan healy and i'll
 
05:13:57.750 --> 05:13:57.760 align:start position:0%
be really quick um
 
05:14:00.550 --> 05:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
we are basically in support of this bill
 
05:14:03.110 --> 05:14:03.120 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things that came up i
 
05:14:05.830 --> 05:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
just want to address one concern
 
05:14:09.830 --> 05:14:09.840 align:start position:0%
i agree with the forensic experts
 
05:14:11.830 --> 05:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
looking at this but i do have to say
 
05:14:14.230 --> 05:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
that i've just done a brief google
 
05:14:15.270 --> 05:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
search on
 
05:14:16.708 --> 05:14:16.718 align:start position:0%
some of these people that are being
 
05:14:19.110 --> 05:14:19.120 align:start position:0%
called forensic experts and i don't
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
think that radio show hosts are should
 
05:14:24.628 --> 05:14:24.638 align:start position:0%
be considered forensic experts nor
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh just retired army kernels um
 
05:14:30.470 --> 05:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
i don't see anything in their bios that
 
05:14:32.550 --> 05:14:32.560 align:start position:0%
that make them forensic experts harry
 
05:14:34.550 --> 05:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
hursty happens to be
 
05:14:37.190 --> 05:14:37.200 align:start position:0%
um he's probably got more of their i'm
 
05:14:39.430 --> 05:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
familiar with him he's been in milford
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
he looked at our e-poll books um
 
05:14:44.550 --> 05:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
but so i just want to caution
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
that we don't just use those names that
 
05:14:48.470 --> 05:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
were handed out we actually find some
 
05:14:50.628 --> 05:14:50.638 align:start position:0%
real forensic experts if you choose to
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
go that route um secondly i want to
 
05:14:56.948 --> 05:14:56.958 align:start position:0%
agree with betty dunn on everything um
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
05:14:59.590 --> 05:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
you know what you know we're getting all
 
05:15:03.030 --> 05:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
kinds of calls as town clerks and um
 
05:15:03.040 --> 05:15:04.550 align:start position:0%
kinds of calls as town clerks and um
the

05:15:04.550 --> 05:15:04.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:15:09.750 --> 05:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh without doing a hand re count audit
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
of the recount that was done i don't see
 
05:15:14.390 --> 05:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
how going through the machines if the
 
05:15:16.628 --> 05:15:16.638 align:start position:0%
machines come up with the same results
 
05:15:18.788 --> 05:15:18.798 align:start position:0%
and again that doesn't match that hand
 
05:15:18.798 --> 05:15:19.670 align:start position:0%
and again that doesn't match that hand
count

05:15:19.670 --> 05:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
count
 
05:15:21.670 --> 05:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
how is that going to tell us
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:28.310 --> 05:15:28.320 align:start position:0%
most likely it's going to be found that
 
05:15:30.628 --> 05:15:30.638 align:start position:0%
it is an error in the recount that
 
05:15:32.708 --> 05:15:32.718 align:start position:0%
somebody just double counted stacks of
 
05:15:35.110 --> 05:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
um 100 ballots because it's an odd
 
05:15:37.750 --> 05:15:37.760 align:start position:0%
number it's 300 i mean it's not an i
 
05:15:40.070 --> 05:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's usually you'd expect to be off by
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of an uneven number not a
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:49.270 --> 05:15:49.280 align:start position:0%
the one thing i just want in in regards
 
05:15:51.030 --> 05:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
to representative love i will tell you
 
05:15:53.430 --> 05:15:53.440 align:start position:0%
that if he looked at milford's tapes we
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
had the exact same results absentee
 
05:15:58.390 --> 05:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
ballots tended to be cast by democrats
 
05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
and independents
 
05:16:01.350 --> 05:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:16:03.590 --> 05:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
that we had to put our absentees through
 
05:16:05.670 --> 05:16:05.680 align:start position:0%
one machine because they were all folded
 
05:16:07.270 --> 05:16:07.280 align:start position:0%
and you didn't want to mess up the other
 
05:16:10.390 --> 05:16:10.400 align:start position:0%
machines you didn't want to create lines
 
05:16:12.708 --> 05:16:12.718 align:start position:0%
because of social distancing so we
 
05:16:14.788 --> 05:16:14.798 align:start position:0%
processed all our absentees through one
 
05:16:17.190 --> 05:16:17.200 align:start position:0%
machine and our tapes that look exactly
 
05:16:19.590 --> 05:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
like when windhams does obviously with
 
05:16:22.150 --> 05:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:23.830 --> 05:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's all i have to say
 
05:16:25.670 --> 05:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for letting me letting me
 
05:16:27.830 --> 05:16:27.840 align:start position:0%
speak all right great well thank you and
 
05:16:29.990 --> 05:16:30.000 align:start position:0%

bill is our own committee member
 
05:17:57.430 --> 05:17:57.440 align:start position:0%
paul bergeron
 
05:17:59.110 --> 05:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
there you go mr
 
05:18:01.750 --> 05:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
05:18:04.310 --> 05:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and i very much
 
05:18:06.310 --> 05:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
appreciate you calling me at this point
 
05:18:07.830 --> 05:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
because the testimony has been
 
05:18:09.990 --> 05:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
fascinating um
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
i'll be very brief
 
05:18:14.550 --> 05:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
you know my my main point is there's a
 
05:18:16.070 --> 05:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
lot of reasons why election results
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
could be turned over during a recount
 
05:18:19.910 --> 05:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
and many of those are due to human error
 
05:18:21.190 --> 05:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
and that's already been addressed i
 
05:18:23.190 --> 05:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
think both deputy scanlan and secretary
 
05:18:25.270 --> 05:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
of state gardner said that there can be
 
05:18:27.350 --> 05:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
a human error involved
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
in a memo that
 
05:18:30.788 --> 05:18:30.798 align:start position:0%
the deputy sent out back on february
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
23rd he said he warned that jumping to
 
05:18:35.270 --> 05:18:35.280 align:start position:0%
conclusions of what caused the disparity
 
05:18:37.510 --> 05:18:37.520 align:start position:0%
at this point is mere speculation it
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
conject and conjecture
 
05:18:42.470 --> 05:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
so my concern is is twofold first i want
 
05:18:44.550 --> 05:18:44.560 align:start position:0%
to make sure that any kind of audit
 
05:18:46.948 --> 05:18:46.958 align:start position:0%
that's conducted does more than look at
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
just the machines needs to also look at
 
05:18:51.750 --> 05:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
all the paperwork the memory card
 
05:18:55.270 --> 05:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
devices uh and the processes as well to
 
05:18:57.110 --> 05:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that we can find out what
 
05:18:58.948 --> 05:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
actually did happen and then give the
 
05:19:00.628 --> 05:19:00.638 align:start position:0%
secretary of state an opportunity to
 
05:19:02.788 --> 05:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
create the guidance that our moderators
 
05:19:04.788 --> 05:19:04.798 align:start position:0%
and clerks and other communities need to
 
05:19:07.430 --> 05:19:07.440 align:start position:0%
avoid similar situations from occurring
 
05:19:10.948 --> 05:19:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh and one final uh very short story i
 
05:19:13.670 --> 05:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to mention is several years ago
 
05:19:15.270 --> 05:19:15.280 align:start position:0%
there was a state representative race in
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
hudson there were six open seats and the
 
05:19:19.910 --> 05:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
election night returns showed two
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
democratic candidates tied for seventh
 
05:19:21.840 --> 05:19:22.788 align:start position:0%
democratic candidates tied for seventh
place

05:19:22.788 --> 05:19:22.798 align:start position:0%
place
 
05:19:25.910 --> 05:19:25.920 align:start position:0%
losing by 37 votes a recount changed the
 
05:19:25.920 --> 05:19:27.110 align:start position:0%
losing by 37 votes a recount changed the
finish

05:19:27.110 --> 05:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
finish
 
05:19:29.350 --> 05:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
and the recount showed that all six
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
republicans lost votes as a result of
 
05:19:33.990 --> 05:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
the recount and five of the six
 
05:19:36.550 --> 05:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
democratic candidates gained votes
 
05:19:39.510 --> 05:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
that recount happened in 1972
 
05:19:41.510 --> 05:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
it was a while ago i was the person that
 
05:19:43.190 --> 05:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
ended up winning the six seat by four
 
05:19:45.190 --> 05:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
votes in the recount
 
05:19:47.350 --> 05:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
and i would just add that the
 
05:19:49.270 --> 05:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
mistakes occurred because of human error
 
05:19:51.750 --> 05:19:51.760 align:start position:0%
there were no ballot counting devices in
 
05:19:54.150 --> 05:19:54.160 align:start position:0%
service in 1972
 
05:19:56.150 --> 05:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
so i would like to urge the committee to
 
05:19:58.230 --> 05:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
keep in mind that any kind of audit
 
05:20:01.750 --> 05:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
needs to include all other aspects of uh
 
05:20:04.708 --> 05:20:04.718 align:start position:0%
election returns and counting and and so
 
05:20:06.150 --> 05:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
on not just the
 
05:20:08.628 --> 05:20:08.638 align:start position:0%
ballot counting devices themselves
 
05:20:11.430 --> 05:20:11.440 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank you representative
 
05:20:13.670 --> 05:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
bergeron i i apologize i thought that
 
05:20:15.590 --> 05:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
maybe you were speaking to
 
05:20:17.830 --> 05:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
um something else because at some point
 
05:20:19.270 --> 05:20:19.280 align:start position:0%
the committee is obviously going to need
 
05:20:21.590 --> 05:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
to have an executive session on this and
 
05:20:24.470 --> 05:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
talk about everything so um i hope
 
05:20:25.750 --> 05:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee members don't feel that they
 
05:20:27.830 --> 05:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
have to sign up for me to recognize them
 
05:20:29.590 --> 05:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
and i didn't know if you wanted to talk
 
05:20:30.868 --> 05:20:30.878 align:start position:0%
about something specific in your
 
05:20:32.070 --> 05:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
amendment so
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
thank you that's fine i'm sure and i
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
my understanding is if we're sitting on
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
the committee we're asking questions and
 
05:20:39.990 --> 05:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
that's why i signed up to provide
 
05:20:40.000 --> 05:20:41.190 align:start position:0%
that's why i signed up to provide
testimony

05:20:41.190 --> 05:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:20:41.200 --> 05:20:42.310 align:start position:0%
testimony
okay

05:20:42.310 --> 05:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:20:44.230 --> 05:20:44.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:20:44.240 --> 05:20:45.030 align:start position:0%
thank you
i

05:20:45.030 --> 05:20:45.040 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
to be honest representative bergeron i
 
05:20:48.948 --> 05:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
don't know if i want to give the idea to
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
the other 18 members that are sitting on
 
05:20:52.948 --> 05:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
the other side of this room and screen
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
for that but we'll see what the sign-ups
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
look like for next week and we'll see
 
05:20:59.670 --> 05:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:59.680 --> 05:21:01.270 align:start position:0%

bill i would like to point out that we
 
05:21:48.150 --> 05:21:48.160 align:start position:0%
the people have already been waiting
 
05:21:50.310 --> 05:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
four months for redress i encourage this
 
05:21:52.150 --> 05:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
committee to establish a timeline before
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
leaving today and establish a date for
 
05:21:57.910 --> 05:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
the amended sb 43 bill to be signed
 
05:21:59.350 --> 05:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
i would like to continue by saying that
 
05:22:02.150 --> 05:22:02.160 align:start position:0%
i am a united states navy veteran i say
 
05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
i say this of course with pride but not
 
05:22:05.910 --> 05:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
as a means to grandstand
 
05:22:07.670 --> 05:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
however i will not digress from sharing
 
05:22:09.190 --> 05:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
with you some of the conversations that
 
05:22:10.628 --> 05:22:10.638 align:start position:0%
i've had with my fellow brothers and
 
05:22:10.638 --> 05:22:12.150 align:start position:0%
i've had with my fellow brothers and
sisters

05:22:12.150 --> 05:22:12.160 align:start position:0%
sisters
 
05:22:13.670 --> 05:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
some of us feel as though we have
 
05:22:16.150 --> 05:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
sacrificed our time our liberties our
 
05:22:16.160 --> 05:22:17.110 align:start position:0%
sacrificed our time our liberties our
freedoms

05:22:17.110 --> 05:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
freedoms
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
our brothers and sisters to support and
 
05:22:21.590 --> 05:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
defend the freedoms of politicians and
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
not the freedoms of our citizens
 
05:22:25.350 --> 05:22:25.360 align:start position:0%
this is a major perversion of our
 
05:22:27.030 --> 05:22:27.040 align:start position:0%
service to not only our great state
 
05:22:29.110 --> 05:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
constitution but also our federal
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
constitution and we petition our state
 
05:22:33.030 --> 05:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
government to correct this injustice
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
against us all
 
05:22:37.030 --> 05:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
while we still have a chance i will end
 
05:22:38.948 --> 05:22:38.958 align:start position:0%
this with a simple but powerful quote by
 
05:22:41.110 --> 05:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
john adams and an explanation of my
 
05:22:44.628 --> 05:22:44.638 align:start position:0%
choosing of this quote
 
05:22:46.628 --> 05:22:46.638 align:start position:0%
you will never know how much it costs
 
05:22:48.390 --> 05:22:48.400 align:start position:0%
the present generation to preserve your
 
05:22:48.400 --> 05:22:49.270 align:start position:0%
the present generation to preserve your
freedom

05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
freedom
 
05:22:51.590 --> 05:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
i hope you will make a good use of it if
 
05:22:53.990 --> 05:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
you do not i shall repent in heaven that
 
05:22:56.868 --> 05:22:56.878 align:start position:0%
i ever took half the pains to reserve it
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
i mentioned the honorable john adams
 
05:23:00.310 --> 05:23:00.320 align:start position:0%
quote because there was questions about
 
05:23:01.990 --> 05:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
the president that this passing of this
 
05:23:03.430 --> 05:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
bill may set
 
05:23:05.270 --> 05:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
in my opinion the president
 
05:23:07.590 --> 05:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
the president that this would set is the
 
05:23:09.830 --> 05:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
president of our government uniting with
 
05:23:12.390 --> 05:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
the citizens to honor to honor
 
05:23:14.390 --> 05:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
the sacrifices our founding fathers made
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
for all of us by honoring the vote which
 
05:23:18.708 --> 05:23:18.718 align:start position:0%
is at the heart and soul of both our
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
federal and state constitutions which
 
05:23:23.030 --> 05:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
founded our great republican
 
05:23:25.110 --> 05:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
thank you and god bless our great state
 
05:23:26.788 --> 05:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
and our country
 
05:23:28.628 --> 05:23:28.638 align:start position:0%
thank you mr todd for your testimony
 
05:23:31.110 --> 05:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions for mr
 
05:23:33.270 --> 05:23:33.280 align:start position:0%
toss representative homer brian thank
 
05:23:35.030 --> 05:23:35.040 align:start position:0%

05:23:37.270 --> 05:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr todd for coming here and
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
sharing your thoughts and your opinions
 
05:23:41.990 --> 05:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
and your experiences and uh your service
 
05:23:44.070 --> 05:23:44.080 align:start position:0%
to our country
 
05:23:46.868 --> 05:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
are you a windham voter or a national
 
05:23:46.878 --> 05:23:50.070 align:start position:0%
are you a windham voter or a national
voter

05:23:50.070 --> 05:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.230 --> 05:23:52.240 align:start position:0%
uh i would just bought property in
 
05:23:55.350 --> 05:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
windham in 2020 and we're building we're
 
05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
building in windham
 
05:23:59.350 --> 05:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully so currently i'm a nationalist
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
naturally you just said that you were a
 
05:24:03.030 --> 05:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
resident of nashua
 
05:24:05.030 --> 05:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
so it just did create a little question
 
05:24:07.190 --> 05:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
i i didn't know that it needed to be
 
05:24:08.628 --> 05:24:08.638 align:start position:0%
followed up but thank you for
 
05:24:10.550 --> 05:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
distinguishing that you're sort of in

you for a few minutes welcome back
hi

05:24:43.270 --> 05:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
hi
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh daniel hilly derry town clerk i'm
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire city and
 
05:24:50.230 --> 05:24:50.240 align:start position:0%
town clerks association uh we are in
 
05:24:52.868 --> 05:24:52.878 align:start position:0%
support of this bill as joan mentioned
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh with the wyndham amendments that
 
05:24:58.310 --> 05:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
their committee discussed i am a little
 
05:25:00.948 --> 05:25:00.958 align:start position:0%
concerned with representative love's
 
05:25:02.628 --> 05:25:02.638 align:start position:0%
statement earlier
 
05:25:05.350 --> 05:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
that the absentee ballots were spread
 
05:25:07.110 --> 05:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
out through the machines that question
 
05:25:09.910 --> 05:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
was asked at the the windham meeting on
 
05:25:11.110 --> 05:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
monday night
 
05:25:13.430 --> 05:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the selectmen that answered it stated
 
05:25:16.230 --> 05:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
that the the absentee ballots primarily
 
05:25:19.590 --> 05:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
went through machine one um gene mr
 
05:25:21.110 --> 05:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
healey you're fading in and out that's
 
05:25:23.510 --> 05:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
why i'm sort of leaning closer
 
05:25:23.520 --> 05:25:24.390 align:start position:0%
why i'm sort of leaning closer
okay

05:25:24.390 --> 05:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:25:26.550 --> 05:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
yeah representative love mentioned
 
05:25:29.910 --> 05:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
earlier that the absentee ballots
 
05:25:31.430 --> 05:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
were spread out through the machines
 
05:25:34.150 --> 05:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
that question was posed to
 
05:25:37.030 --> 05:25:37.040 align:start position:0%
the selectmen um at the wyndham meeting
 
05:25:38.948 --> 05:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
on monday night and they did state that
 
05:25:41.590 --> 05:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
the primarily the ballots the absentee
 
05:25:44.310 --> 05:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
ballots went through machine one
 
05:25:46.390 --> 05:25:46.400 align:start position:0%
the committee that that meeting is
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
available online the committee can watch
 
05:25:50.070 --> 05:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
it back it was near the very end of the
 
05:25:50.080 --> 05:25:51.670 align:start position:0%
it back it was near the very end of the
meeting

05:25:51.670 --> 05:25:51.680 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:25:54.470 --> 05:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
we do have a similar machine tape
 
05:25:55.670 --> 05:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
in derry
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
uh our machine tape
 
05:26:01.110 --> 05:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
machine tape one in derry we have about
 
05:26:03.510 --> 05:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
a thousand more democratic voters if you
 
05:26:05.430 --> 05:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
look at the president race and it's
 
05:26:09.110 --> 05:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
because that machine we used primarily
 
05:26:11.350 --> 05:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
for absentee ballots i think if you look
 
05:26:12.868 --> 05:26:12.878 align:start position:0%
throughout the state that would be a
 
05:26:15.350 --> 05:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
trend uh putting all the ballots through
 
05:26:16.948 --> 05:26:16.958 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots through the one
 
05:26:16.958 --> 05:26:18.470 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots through the one
machine

05:26:18.470 --> 05:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
machine
 
05:26:20.230 --> 05:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
so i don't really believe that is an
 
05:26:22.470 --> 05:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
issue that was strictly an absentee
 
05:26:22.480 --> 05:26:24.470 align:start position:0%
issue that was strictly an absentee
ballot

05:26:24.470 --> 05:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
05:26:26.230 --> 05:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
machine and that's why the numbers
 
05:26:26.240 --> 05:26:27.430 align:start position:0%
machine and that's why the numbers
differ

05:26:27.430 --> 05:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
differ
 
05:26:29.270 --> 05:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
and that was explained to representative
 
05:26:30.788 --> 05:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
love already
 
05:26:33.750 --> 05:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
um and that is it for my testimony uh
 
05:26:36.230 --> 05:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
open to any questions thank you mr daley
 
05:26:37.590 --> 05:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
any questions for mr haley
 
05:26:39.430 --> 05:26:39.440 align:start position:0%
representative tarosian
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%
thank you mr haley for taking the
 
05:26:42.550 --> 05:26:42.560 align:start position:0%
question you may have said it when you
 
05:26:44.788 --> 05:26:44.798 align:start position:0%
fade it out but uh you said it did come
 
05:26:47.910 --> 05:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
up in the window meeting um
 
05:26:49.030 --> 05:26:49.040 align:start position:0%
it came up
 
05:26:51.590 --> 05:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
all of the most developed has developed
 
05:26:52.948 --> 05:26:52.958 align:start position:0%
through machine tools they were spread
 
05:26:52.958 --> 05:26:53.590 align:start position:0%
through machine tools they were spread
out

05:26:53.590 --> 05:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:26:56.470 --> 05:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
here you faded out uh they did state
 
05:26:58.230 --> 05:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
that the majority of their ballots were
 
05:27:00.390 --> 05:27:00.400 align:start position:0%
through the machine that had the i guess
 
05:27:02.948 --> 05:27:02.958 align:start position:0%
the discrepancy that he referenced uh if
 
05:27:04.550 --> 05:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
you watched the meeting it was near the
 
05:27:06.150 --> 05:27:06.160 align:start position:0%
very end of the meeting it was one of
 
05:27:07.910 --> 05:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
the last questions
 
05:27:09.910 --> 05:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
but they did answer that they did say
 
05:27:11.830 --> 05:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
that their absentee ballots primarily
 
05:27:13.990 --> 05:27:14.000 align:start position:0%
went through that machine that was a
 
05:27:15.990 --> 05:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
little different than the rest and that
 
05:27:18.150 --> 05:27:18.160 align:start position:0%
is a common trend as the milford town
 
05:27:20.948 --> 05:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
clerk stated and i do have that same
 
05:27:23.350 --> 05:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
trend in my town and i'd be willing to
 
05:27:26.150 --> 05:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
provide that that those those tapes to
 
05:27:28.708 --> 05:27:28.718 align:start position:0%
you to show that um it was primarily
 
05:27:30.788 --> 05:27:30.798 align:start position:0%
because of the absentee ballots
 
05:27:32.708 --> 05:27:32.718 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr e lee any other
 
05:27:36.310 --> 05:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:40.310 --> 05:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you ma'am
 
05:27:40.320 --> 05:27:41.190 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien thank you ma'am
so

05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:27:44.390 --> 05:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
in derry all of the uh absentees went
 
05:27:47.270 --> 05:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
through primarily one machine
 
05:27:47.280 --> 05:27:48.070 align:start position:0%
through primarily one machine
and

05:27:48.070 --> 05:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:27:49.830 --> 05:27:49.840 align:start position:0%
possible that other communities choose
 
05:27:51.590 --> 05:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
to spread out
 
05:27:53.510 --> 05:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
that could happen not any specific but
 
05:27:55.590 --> 05:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's what some communities do is that
 
05:27:56.628 --> 05:27:56.638 align:start position:0%
what happens
 
05:27:57.910 --> 05:27:57.920 align:start position:0%
that is correct
 
05:27:59.990 --> 05:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that states all absentee
 
05:28:01.670 --> 05:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
ballots have to go through one machine
 
05:28:01.680 --> 05:28:02.708 align:start position:0%
ballots have to go through one machine
or

05:28:02.708 --> 05:28:02.718 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:28:04.310 --> 05:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
if they're spread out so it's whatever
 
05:28:07.990 --> 05:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
the community chooses i know most um if
 
05:28:10.310 --> 05:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
they have multiple machines
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
instead of spreading them out they'll
 
05:28:14.310 --> 05:28:14.320 align:start position:0%
pull one machine kind of to the side to
 
05:28:16.548 --> 05:28:16.558 align:start position:0%
put all the absentee ballots through in
 
05:28:19.430 --> 05:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
case they do jam or there's an issue
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
because absentee ballots are folded so
 
05:28:23.190 --> 05:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's there's some issues
 
05:28:25.190 --> 05:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
putting them through the machine
 
05:28:26.628 --> 05:28:26.638 align:start position:0%
so they don't like to tie up all the
 
05:28:28.868 --> 05:28:28.878 align:start position:0%
machines so they pick one
 
05:28:31.270 --> 05:28:31.280 align:start position:0%
so you would see a trend
 
05:28:32.470 --> 05:28:32.480 align:start position:0%
like that
 
05:28:34.788 --> 05:28:34.798 align:start position:0%
we had way more voters that were
 
05:28:37.350 --> 05:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
democrat choosing to vote by absentee i
 
05:28:39.110 --> 05:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
just ran a report and it was almost a
 
05:28:41.670 --> 05:28:41.680 align:start position:0%
thousand more than republican voters
 
05:28:43.670 --> 05:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for mr
 
05:28:43.680 --> 05:28:47.990 align:start position:0%
thank you any further questions for mr
healey

05:28:47.990 --> 05:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:49.430 --> 05:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you representative blanco with
 
05:28:50.948 --> 05:28:50.958 align:start position:0%
that i'm sorry
 
05:28:53.830 --> 05:28:53.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair um mr healy you
 
05:28:55.990 --> 05:28:56.000 align:start position:0%
said something about there was uh
 
05:28:57.910 --> 05:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
availability of something online to
 
05:29:00.070 --> 05:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
watch was that would that be on the
 
05:29:03.750 --> 05:29:03.760 align:start position:0%
town's website it is um available i
 
05:29:06.548 --> 05:29:06.558 align:start position:0%
think it's windham tv uh they do
 
05:29:08.230 --> 05:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
they do post their meetings so it should
 
05:29:10.868 --> 05:29:10.878 align:start position:0%
be posted um it was about a three hour
 
05:29:10.878 --> 05:29:11.910 align:start position:0%
be posted um it was about a three hour
meeting

05:29:11.910 --> 05:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
05:29:13.910 --> 05:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh so it'd be near the end i
 
05:29:15.590 --> 05:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
believe is that when that question came
 
05:29:15.600 --> 05:29:16.628 align:start position:0%
believe is that when that question came
up

05:29:16.628 --> 05:29:16.638 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not entirely familiar with
 
05:29:21.030 --> 05:29:21.040 align:start position:0%
with their video system
 
05:29:23.190 --> 05:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
i did check the meeting prior to that
 
05:29:25.030 --> 05:29:25.040 align:start position:0%
was posted online so i'm assuming this
 
05:29:27.430 --> 05:29:27.440 align:start position:0%
one will be if it's not already
 
05:29:28.830 --> 05:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
okay thank
 
05:29:34.230 --> 05:29:34.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:36.230 --> 05:29:36.240 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you very much
 
05:29:38.628 --> 05:29:38.638 align:start position:0%

05:30:02.628 --> 05:30:02.638 align:start position:0%
can you hear me we can welcome great uh
 
05:30:05.430 --> 05:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
thank you so much um madam chairwoman
 
05:30:07.510 --> 05:30:07.520 align:start position:0%
and um committee
 
05:30:10.628 --> 05:30:10.638 align:start position:0%
um since derry was mentioned quite a bit
 
05:30:10.638 --> 05:30:11.590 align:start position:0%
um since derry was mentioned quite a bit
um

05:30:11.590 --> 05:30:11.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:13.430 --> 05:30:13.440 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to speak to a couple of
 
05:30:14.788 --> 05:30:14.798 align:start position:0%
different issues
 
05:30:18.070 --> 05:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
we did run 4 500 of our
 
05:30:20.230 --> 05:30:20.240 align:start position:0%
6 500 absentee ballots through one
 
05:30:20.240 --> 05:30:21.670 align:start position:0%
6 500 absentee ballots through one
machine

05:30:21.670 --> 05:30:21.680 align:start position:0%
machine
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
it is pretty much a very common practice
 
05:30:27.430 --> 05:30:27.440 align:start position:0%
because you just tie up one machine
 
05:30:29.990 --> 05:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
especially with
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
all the various social distancing and
 
05:30:36.230 --> 05:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
trying to keep lines to a minimum
 
05:30:37.990 --> 05:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day this
 
05:30:41.910 --> 05:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
this is all about math um in the wyndham
 
05:30:46.390 --> 05:30:46.400 align:start position:0%
race um voters were voting for four
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
they had approximately ten thousand
 
05:30:48.320 --> 05:30:49.910 align:start position:0%
they had approximately ten thousand
ballots

05:30:49.910 --> 05:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
05:30:51.670 --> 05:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
so there needed to be forty thousand
 
05:30:51.680 --> 05:30:54.708 align:start position:0%
so there needed to be forty thousand
votes

05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:54.718 --> 05:30:56.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:30:56.390 --> 05:30:56.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:58.390 --> 05:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of them
 
05:31:01.190 --> 05:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
may have been over voted um overvotes
 
05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
are common especially in absentee
 
05:31:05.590 --> 05:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
ballots where voters just put an x
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
through something
 
05:31:07.200 --> 05:31:09.270 align:start position:0%
through something
um

05:31:09.270 --> 05:31:09.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:11.910 --> 05:31:11.920 align:start position:0%
machines put that into overvote which is
 
05:31:14.070 --> 05:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
like a blank
 
05:31:15.990 --> 05:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
basically they make a candidate called
 
05:31:16.000 --> 05:31:18.150 align:start position:0%
basically they make a candidate called
blank

05:31:18.150 --> 05:31:18.160 align:start position:0%
blank
 
05:31:21.350 --> 05:31:21.360 align:start position:0%
if the voter leaves a race blank or if
 
05:31:23.590 --> 05:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
they only vote for three or four people
 
05:31:25.670 --> 05:31:25.680 align:start position:0%
they attribute three votes to those
 
05:31:25.680 --> 05:31:26.628 align:start position:0%
they attribute three votes to those
people

05:31:26.628 --> 05:31:26.638 align:start position:0%
people
 
05:31:28.470 --> 05:31:28.480 align:start position:0%
one to a blank
 
05:31:28.480 --> 05:31:29.590 align:start position:0%
one to a blank
um

05:31:29.590 --> 05:31:29.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:31.350 --> 05:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day it all has to
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
equal the correct number of votes when
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
you count them all um
 
05:31:39.670 --> 05:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
and when the secretary of state does
 
05:31:41.750 --> 05:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
their recounts they just count the valid
 
05:31:41.760 --> 05:31:43.030 align:start position:0%
their recounts they just count the valid
votes

05:31:43.030 --> 05:31:43.040 align:start position:0%
votes
 
05:31:43.040 --> 05:31:44.230 align:start position:0%
votes
um

05:31:44.230 --> 05:31:44.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:31:46.310 --> 05:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
to you know get to
 
05:31:48.150 --> 05:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
you know what the totals are but when
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
you have an issue like this um
 
05:31:52.150 --> 05:31:52.160 align:start position:0%
did they maybe
 
05:31:55.510 --> 05:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
recount piles um of a hundred to get to
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
300 it's a possibility it could be human
 
05:32:00.628 --> 05:32:00.638 align:start position:0%
error um
 
05:32:02.470 --> 05:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
if you're going to audit this you have
 
05:32:02.480 --> 05:32:03.110 align:start position:0%
if you're going to audit this you have
to

05:32:03.110 --> 05:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:32:06.390 --> 05:32:06.400 align:start position:0%
audit it from start to finish
 
05:32:08.548 --> 05:32:08.558 align:start position:0%
audit the machines
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
audit the hand count
 
05:32:14.470 --> 05:32:14.480 align:start position:0%
run them through an independent machine
 
05:32:17.030 --> 05:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
and and literally just look at it all
 
05:32:20.548 --> 05:32:20.558 align:start position:0%
from start to finish and any other thing
 
05:32:23.430 --> 05:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
is not going to answer voter concerns
 
05:32:28.070 --> 05:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
my phone and my email has been exploding
 
05:32:30.390 --> 05:32:30.400 align:start position:0%
with residents in derry
 
05:32:33.190 --> 05:32:33.200 align:start position:0%
asking what are you going to do to make
 
05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
sure the windham incident doesn't happen
 
05:32:37.430 --> 05:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
in derry
 
05:32:39.110 --> 05:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
considering we still don't know exactly
 
05:32:41.990 --> 05:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
what happened in wyndham um it's really
 
05:32:44.070 --> 05:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
hard to answer that question
 
05:32:47.430 --> 05:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
um and i i just want to count voters
 
05:32:50.230 --> 05:32:50.240 align:start position:0%
vote count the eligible voters count the
 
05:32:52.230 --> 05:32:52.240 align:start position:0%
eligible votes
 
05:32:54.948 --> 05:32:54.958 align:start position:0%
um be it with a machine or a hand count
 
05:32:57.350 --> 05:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is
 
05:32:59.750 --> 05:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh but you we do need to get these
 
05:33:03.110 --> 05:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:05.030 --> 05:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:33:06.310 --> 05:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for being with us this
 
05:33:08.310 --> 05:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
afternoon during your testimony does
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
anybody have any questions for miss
 
05:33:18.548 --> 05:33:18.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:20.390 --> 05:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any thank you for coming
 
05:33:22.310 --> 05:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
and thank you for also talking about the
 
05:33:25.110 --> 05:33:25.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots i know in boston the
 
05:33:27.030 --> 05:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
clerk did a very similar thing they had
 
05:33:28.628 --> 05:33:28.638 align:start position:0%
one machine for the absentee ballots
 
05:33:29.910 --> 05:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
because of all the issues we've heard
 
05:33:32.548 --> 05:33:32.558 align:start position:0%
about and the results were
 
05:33:35.030 --> 05:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
different from a comparative standpoint
 
05:33:37.590 --> 05:33:37.600 align:start position:0%
than the other machines yeah it's it's a
 
05:33:40.788 --> 05:33:40.798 align:start position:0%
standard thing that moderators do simply
 
05:33:43.190 --> 05:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
because you have to keep opening that
 
05:33:46.708 --> 05:33:46.718 align:start position:0%
one ballot box take the ballots out
 
05:33:49.110 --> 05:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
tamp them down because they're folded
 
05:33:51.350 --> 05:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know someday maybe the legislature
 
05:33:53.430 --> 05:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
will spring for telling us that we have
 
05:33:55.350 --> 05:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
to use flat envelopes and then we won't
 
05:33:57.430 --> 05:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
have that problem but that's a different
 
05:33:57.440 --> 05:33:58.788 align:start position:0%
have that problem but that's a different
conversation

05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
05:34:01.510 --> 05:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
last summer you had one less fold this
 
05:34:04.310 --> 05:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
way there you go if you got your back
 
05:34:06.548 --> 05:34:06.558 align:start position:0%
all right is there anybody else
 
05:34:08.788 --> 05:34:08.798 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions
 
05:34:10.708 --> 05:34:10.718 align:start position:0%
i'm not seeing any so thank you is there
 
05:34:12.548 --> 05:34:12.558 align:start position:0%
anybody else in attendance who wants to
 
05:34:14.548 --> 05:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
speak who has not
 
05:34:18.070 --> 05:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
already spoken on this matter
 
05:34:19.670 --> 05:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
representative gay i can't remember
 
05:34:21.590 --> 05:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
whether you've spoken on this or not so
 
05:34:21.600 --> 05:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
whether you've spoken on this or not so
much

05:34:24.070 --> 05:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:34:27.270 --> 05:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
be very quick i can be very quick uh one
 
05:34:28.150 --> 05:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:34:30.390 --> 05:34:30.400 align:start position:0%
is that okay you're very quick or not
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
all right let's go
 
05:34:34.390 --> 05:34:34.400 align:start position:0%
okay one of the uh things that needs to
 
05:34:36.948 --> 05:34:36.958 align:start position:0%
be uh examined which in the forensic
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
they should is the question of why would
 
05:34:41.750 --> 05:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
one one of the four
 
05:34:44.948 --> 05:34:44.958 align:start position:0%
uh ballot boxes read so differently and
 
05:34:46.868 --> 05:34:46.878 align:start position:0%
i'm just learning about some of in the
 
05:34:48.310 --> 05:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
other states some of the things that
 
05:34:51.590 --> 05:34:51.600 align:start position:0%
they found out in such suspect elections
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
was that there was a program in there
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
that actually put a percentage on
 
05:34:58.788 --> 05:34:58.798 align:start position:0%
certain ballots so they boosted some
 
05:35:02.390 --> 05:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
counts like 120
 
05:35:05.190 --> 05:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
and then the opponent they set it to
 
05:35:08.470 --> 05:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
read eighty percent so that
 
05:35:10.788 --> 05:35:10.798 align:start position:0%
that's just one more possibility to
 
05:35:13.670 --> 05:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
explain why one box would be so
 
05:35:15.910 --> 05:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
another audit results because we can
 
05:35:17.590 --> 05:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
start talking about the fact that some
 
05:35:19.750 --> 05:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
states don't even have a procedure for
 
05:35:21.910 --> 05:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
recounts and if you want to recount you
 
05:35:23.670 --> 05:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
gotta go to court so
 
05:35:26.788 --> 05:35:26.798 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your comments on on the
 
05:35:26.798 --> 05:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your comments on on the
bill

05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:35:27.840 --> 05:35:28.948 align:start position:0%
bill
um

05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:30.788 --> 05:35:30.798 align:start position:0%
did you have anything else you wanted to
 
05:35:33.750 --> 05:35:33.760 align:start position:0%
add before we move on to dr strang
 
05:35:35.830 --> 05:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
no i'm just very grateful that we have a
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
very safe recount method and i really
 
05:35:41.830 --> 05:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
strongly doubt that we would ever have
 
05:35:45.590 --> 05:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
mistakes like this on four or five races
 
05:35:45.600 --> 05:35:46.708 align:start position:0%
mistakes like this on four or five races
uh

05:35:46.708 --> 05:35:46.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:35:48.548 --> 05:35:48.558 align:start position:0%
with the supervision that goes there so
 
05:35:50.868 --> 05:35:50.878 align:start position:0%
i have a lot of confidence in in that
 
05:35:52.948 --> 05:35:52.958 align:start position:0%
even though i'd like to see it redone in
 
05:35:56.548 --> 05:35:56.558 align:start position:0%
this in this now in this surrey
 
05:35:58.788 --> 05:35:58.798 align:start position:0%
investigation thank you
 
05:36:01.510 --> 05:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative gay um dr
 
05:36:03.190 --> 05:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
strange we heard from you this morning
 
05:36:05.030 --> 05:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for sticking with us for this
 
05:36:05.040 --> 05:36:06.230 align:start position:0%
thank you for sticking with us for this
afternoon

05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
05:36:07.590 --> 05:36:07.600 align:start position:0%
um did you have something that you
 
05:36:09.350 --> 05:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to add this afternoon to what the
 
05:36:14.070 --> 05:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:15.590 --> 05:36:15.600 align:start position:0%
yes madam sherman thank you i just
 
05:36:19.670 --> 05:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:22.390 --> 05:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
regarding the absentee ballots um mr
 
05:36:24.310 --> 05:36:24.320 align:start position:0%
healey testified that
 
05:36:26.470 --> 05:36:26.480 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballots were fed primarily
 
05:36:29.110 --> 05:36:29.120 align:start position:0%
through machine one that is incorrect
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
windham had 3029 absentee ballots cast
 
05:36:36.788 --> 05:36:36.798 align:start position:0%
but only 1 373 ballots were inserted
 
05:36:39.030 --> 05:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
into machine 1 so it is statistically
 
05:36:39.040 --> 05:36:40.230 align:start position:0%
into machine 1 so it is statistically
impossible

05:36:40.230 --> 05:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
impossible
 
05:36:42.390 --> 05:36:42.400 align:start position:0%
for them to have put into machine 1.
 
05:36:44.628 --> 05:36:44.638 align:start position:0%
they went into machine 2 primarily
 
05:36:47.910 --> 05:36:47.920 align:start position:0%
because machine 2 had 3276
 
05:36:51.350 --> 05:36:51.360 align:start position:0%
ballots the most of any machine and
 
05:36:53.350 --> 05:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
was stated at monday's meeting was that
 
05:36:56.390 --> 05:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots were spread out amongst
 
05:36:58.788 --> 05:36:58.798 align:start position:0%
all of the machines but primarily went
 
05:37:00.628 --> 05:37:00.638 align:start position:0%
into machine two
 
05:37:02.390 --> 05:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's the machine where they where the
 
05:37:04.948 --> 05:37:04.958 align:start position:0%
percentage for the presidential race and
 
05:37:07.190 --> 05:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
the senatorial race were at great
 
05:37:10.070 --> 05:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
variance to machines one three and four
 
05:37:12.548 --> 05:37:12.558 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that clarification and
 
05:37:14.310 --> 05:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
as we're finding out that variance was
 
05:37:16.070 --> 05:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
consistent throughout the state with
 
05:37:18.628 --> 05:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
machine counting ballots that had one
 
05:37:20.948 --> 05:37:20.958 align:start position:0%
devoted to absentee ballots so thank you
 
05:37:23.110 --> 05:37:23.120 align:start position:0%
for helping to clarify that
 
05:37:25.030 --> 05:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
05:37:26.390 --> 05:37:26.400 align:start position:0%
um is there
 
05:37:28.310 --> 05:37:28.320 align:start position:0%
i don't see anybody else in attendance
 
05:37:30.948 --> 05:37:30.958 align:start position:0%
with their hand up um i believe that
 
05:37:33.270 --> 05:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
deputy scanlan is still with us there
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
were a couple of things said in regards
 
05:37:37.110 --> 05:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
to your office and some questions that i
 
05:37:39.350 --> 05:37:39.360 align:start position:0%
wanted to know whether you wanted to
 
05:37:41.510 --> 05:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
we usually give the secretary of state's
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
office an opportunity to respond before
 
05:37:45.430 --> 05:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
we close the public hearing deputy
 
05:37:47.670 --> 05:37:47.680 align:start position:0%
stanley did you want to say anything in
 
05:37:49.830 --> 05:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
closing here to the public hearing
 
05:37:49.840 --> 05:37:51.990 align:start position:0%
closing here to the public hearing
section

05:37:51.990 --> 05:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
section
 
05:37:52.000 --> 05:37:53.030 align:start position:0%
section
yes

05:37:53.030 --> 05:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
05:37:55.350 --> 05:37:55.360 align:start position:0%
briefly thank you madam chair um
 
05:37:57.510 --> 05:37:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know i understand that there are
 
05:38:00.230 --> 05:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
strong emotions on this issue and those
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
emotions are justified
 
05:38:02.320 --> 05:38:03.110 align:start position:0%
emotions are justified
and

05:38:03.110 --> 05:38:03.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:38:06.788 --> 05:38:06.798 align:start position:0%
and you know we are very interested in
 
05:38:08.548 --> 05:38:08.558 align:start position:0%
finding out what happened
 
05:38:12.708 --> 05:38:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:14.868 --> 05:38:14.878 align:start position:0%
there are laws that we have to follow in
 
05:38:16.390 --> 05:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
this process
 
05:38:18.150 --> 05:38:18.160 align:start position:0%
even though i know people believe that
 
05:38:20.548 --> 05:38:20.558 align:start position:0%
this process is moving slowly
 
05:38:23.350 --> 05:38:23.360 align:start position:0%
there are things that are being done and
 
05:38:23.360 --> 05:38:24.310 align:start position:0%
there are things that are being done and
uh

05:38:24.310 --> 05:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
but we only have so much authority and
 
05:38:29.430 --> 05:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
if we were able to do things on our own
 
05:38:31.030 --> 05:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh we wouldn't be here in this hearing
 
05:38:33.190 --> 05:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
right now discussing uh this particular
 
05:38:33.200 --> 05:38:34.070 align:start position:0%
right now discussing uh this particular
issue

05:38:34.070 --> 05:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
issue
 
05:38:37.430 --> 05:38:37.440 align:start position:0%
so that's number one um number two you
 
05:38:39.110 --> 05:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
know i made a comment
 
05:38:39.120 --> 05:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
know i made a comment
um

05:38:40.070 --> 05:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:38:42.390 --> 05:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
about we may never know what happened
 
05:38:45.190 --> 05:38:45.200 align:start position:0%
and i made that comment uh
 
05:38:47.270 --> 05:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
in the context of
 
05:38:48.390 --> 05:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
the human
 
05:38:51.110 --> 05:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh a portion of this
 
05:38:53.350 --> 05:38:53.360 align:start position:0%
you know the the machines are programmed
 
05:38:55.110 --> 05:38:55.120 align:start position:0%
and i think that a forensic audit is
 
05:38:56.310 --> 05:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
going to be able to go through those
 
05:38:56.320 --> 05:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
going to be able to go through those
machines

05:38:57.430 --> 05:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
machines
 
05:38:58.868 --> 05:38:58.878 align:start position:0%
and they're going to be able to to
 
05:39:01.510 --> 05:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
determine with
 
05:39:03.430 --> 05:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
some exactness whether they're operating
 
05:39:05.350 --> 05:39:05.360 align:start position:0%
properly or not there's no question
 
05:39:07.750 --> 05:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
about that what i was referring to is if
 
05:39:09.670 --> 05:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
it turns out that it is not the machine
 
05:39:11.190 --> 05:39:11.200 align:start position:0%
that was a problem
 
05:39:13.910 --> 05:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
and it was either at the recount where
 
05:39:16.230 --> 05:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
there was an issue or whether it was at
 
05:39:18.230 --> 05:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
in the town of wyndham where there was
 
05:39:19.350 --> 05:39:19.360 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
05:39:22.708 --> 05:39:22.718 align:start position:0%
if there is a human component in that we
 
05:39:25.670 --> 05:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
may never know exactly what transpired
 
05:39:27.990 --> 05:39:28.000 align:start position:0%
if if a stack of ballots got double
 
05:39:29.830 --> 05:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
counted by somebody
 
05:39:29.840 --> 05:39:31.270 align:start position:0%
counted by somebody
um

05:39:31.270 --> 05:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:34.310 --> 05:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
yeah we we we're not going to know um
 
05:39:36.948 --> 05:39:36.958 align:start position:0%
you know how that happened um
 
05:39:39.350 --> 05:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh but you know i i i mean maybe there's
 
05:39:41.510 --> 05:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
a possibility but but those are those
 
05:39:43.910 --> 05:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
are uh situations where
 
05:39:46.150 --> 05:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
you know we can locate where the issue
 
05:39:47.990 --> 05:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
may have been but we may not know
 
05:39:49.670 --> 05:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
exactly why
 
05:39:49.680 --> 05:39:50.708 align:start position:0%
exactly why
um

05:39:50.708 --> 05:39:50.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:39:52.788 --> 05:39:52.798 align:start position:0%
you know listening to uh representative
 
05:39:55.350 --> 05:39:55.360 align:start position:0%
baldazzaro and some others you know i i
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a there's a low likelihood
 
05:39:59.350 --> 05:39:59.360 align:start position:0%
that um
 
05:40:01.430 --> 05:40:01.440 align:start position:0%
you know there might be some malicious
 
05:40:03.670 --> 05:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
activity here you know if that is
 
05:40:06.150 --> 05:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
determined then that will be prosecuted
 
05:40:08.788 --> 05:40:08.798 align:start position:0%
to the fullest extent of the law um
 
05:40:10.708 --> 05:40:10.718 align:start position:0%
but we have to go through this process
 
05:40:12.390 --> 05:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
um you know i think we all share the
 
05:40:14.788 --> 05:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
same goal uh we all want to make sure
 
05:40:16.788 --> 05:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
that there's confidence and integrity in
 
05:40:18.470 --> 05:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
our election process
 
05:40:18.480 --> 05:40:19.750 align:start position:0%
our election process
um

05:40:19.750 --> 05:40:19.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:21.270 --> 05:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
it's really important i mean if we don't
 
05:40:22.788 --> 05:40:22.798 align:start position:0%
have that then
 
05:40:25.190 --> 05:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
um we're gonna we we will diminish as a
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
nation and that's in nobody's interest
 
05:40:27.520 --> 05:40:28.390 align:start position:0%
nation and that's in nobody's interest
so

05:40:28.390 --> 05:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:40:30.470 --> 05:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
um you know we're all on the same team
 
05:40:32.708 --> 05:40:32.718 align:start position:0%
and uh we all might have different ideas
 
05:40:32.718 --> 05:40:34.230 align:start position:0%
and uh we all might have different ideas
about

05:40:34.230 --> 05:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
about
 
05:40:35.750 --> 05:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
the best way to go about this i think
 
05:40:38.070 --> 05:40:38.080 align:start position:0%
the proposal that is on the table that
 
05:40:40.150 --> 05:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
was mentioned you know at the very
 
05:40:44.628 --> 05:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
beginning of this hearing uh between
 
05:40:47.430 --> 05:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
mr eyring and and secretary gardner is
 
05:40:49.350 --> 05:40:49.360 align:start position:0%
is really a great place to start because
 
05:40:49.360 --> 05:40:50.390 align:start position:0%
is really a great place to start because
there's

05:40:50.390 --> 05:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:40:52.070 --> 05:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know there is uh some coming
 
05:40:54.628 --> 05:40:54.638 align:start position:0%
together on this thing and and that's
 
05:40:56.548 --> 05:40:56.558 align:start position:0%
important um
 
05:40:56.558 --> 05:40:57.590 align:start position:0%
important um
uh

05:40:57.590 --> 05:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:40:59.350 --> 05:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
so madam chair that's all i have to say
 
05:41:00.628 --> 05:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
i mean if there are any additional
 
05:41:02.150 --> 05:41:02.160 align:start position:0%
questions i would be happy to try and
 
05:41:03.270 --> 05:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
answer them
 
05:41:05.590 --> 05:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative cody thank you madam
 
05:41:07.510 --> 05:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
chair um
 
05:41:09.990 --> 05:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary it is true that we have
 
05:41:12.230 --> 05:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
an obligation to try to find out whether
 
05:41:14.150 --> 05:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
it's a machine problem or a human
 
05:41:15.990 --> 05:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
problem isn't that correct
 
05:41:19.430 --> 05:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely correct thank you
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions for
 
05:41:33.680 --> 05:41:33.690 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:33.690 --> 05:41:37.110 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

05:41:37.110 --> 05:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:41.190 --> 05:41:41.200 align:start position:0%
i'm you're breaking up pretty badly so
 
05:41:42.548 --> 05:41:42.558 align:start position:0%
can you hear me better
 
05:41:45.430 --> 05:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes okay so assuming we passed this and
 
05:41:47.990 --> 05:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
it becomes law from the from the date
 
05:41:49.910 --> 05:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
that you know you have the authority if
 
05:41:52.548 --> 05:41:52.558 align:start position:0%
you will to uh to go through this
 
05:41:54.070 --> 05:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
potential agreement what would you
 
05:41:55.910 --> 05:41:55.920 align:start position:0%
anticipate your expectation would be
 
05:41:57.830 --> 05:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
that how long it would take to
 
05:41:59.030 --> 05:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
come to a
 
05:42:01.990 --> 05:42:02.000 align:start position:0%
final conclusion one way or the other
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
once uh once this bill were to be signed
 
05:42:07.510 --> 05:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
into law we would act uh very quickly
 
05:42:09.350 --> 05:42:09.360 align:start position:0%
and i would think that
 
05:42:11.750 --> 05:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
within a matter of a couple weeks
 
05:42:13.030 --> 05:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
you know we would make every effort to
 
05:42:15.190 --> 05:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
have everything up and running
 
05:42:16.868 --> 05:42:16.878 align:start position:0%
obviously um
 
05:42:18.628 --> 05:42:18.638 align:start position:0%
you know part of the proposal is getting
 
05:42:18.638 --> 05:42:19.750 align:start position:0%
you know part of the proposal is getting
some

05:42:19.750 --> 05:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
some
 
05:42:23.350 --> 05:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
some forest forensic experts in to
 
05:42:25.030 --> 05:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
look at those devices you know we have
 
05:42:27.590 --> 05:42:27.600 align:start position:0%
to contact them and and accommodate
 
05:42:29.190 --> 05:42:29.200 align:start position:0%
their schedules but
 
05:42:31.750 --> 05:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
the plan would be to to move along as
 
05:42:34.470 --> 05:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
expeditiously as possible
 
05:42:34.480 --> 05:42:37.110 align:start position:0%

05:49:13.680 --> 05:49:33.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:49:33.750 --> 05:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:33.760 --> 05:50:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:50:15.830 --> 05:50:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:15.840 --> 05:50:43.750 align:start position:0%
 
you

uh

05:51:10.948 --> 05:51:10.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:10.958 --> 05:52:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:52:18.070 --> 05:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:18.080 --> 05:52:34.470 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:52:34.470 --> 05:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:48.788 --> 05:52:48.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:51.670 --> 05:52:51.680 align:start position:0%
all right um we are scheduled as a
 
05:52:53.590 --> 05:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
committee to take up
 
05:52:53.600 --> 05:52:54.390 align:start position:0%
committee to take up
um

05:52:54.390 --> 05:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:53:06.470 --> 05:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
excuse me 87 97 98 151 370 428 470 555
 
05:53:10.708 --> 05:53:10.718 align:start position:0%
482 523 551 and 570
 
05:53:12.628 --> 05:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
i will note that there is also another
 
05:53:14.150 --> 05:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
committee still meeting here at the
 
05:53:16.948 --> 05:53:16.958 align:start position:0%
state house so i think we can
 
05:53:18.948 --> 05:53:18.958 align:start position:0%
get this done i do want to take this
 
05:53:20.708 --> 05:53:20.718 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go through the schedule
 
05:53:22.548 --> 05:53:22.558 align:start position:0%
for next week i know that we still have
 
05:53:24.390 --> 05:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
people on the line who i suspect are
 
05:53:24.400 --> 05:53:25.510 align:start position:0%
people on the line who i suspect are
interested

05:53:25.510 --> 05:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
interested
 
05:53:27.910 --> 05:53:27.920 align:start position:0%
in sb 43
 
05:53:31.750 --> 05:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
um at a public hearing on sb 43 has
 
05:53:31.760 --> 05:53:33.110 align:start position:0%
um at a public hearing on sb 43 has
closed

05:53:33.110 --> 05:53:33.120 align:start position:0%
closed
 
05:53:33.120 --> 05:53:33.990 align:start position:0%
closed
um

05:53:33.990 --> 05:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:36.628 --> 05:53:36.638 align:start position:0%
we have scheduled next week on monday
 
05:53:38.948 --> 05:53:38.958 align:start position:0%
public hearing on bills
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
and we have executive sessions scheduled
 
05:53:43.510 --> 05:53:43.520 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon
 
05:53:45.350 --> 05:53:45.360 align:start position:0%
um they have been
 
05:53:48.150 --> 05:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
the remaining bills to be voted have
 
05:53:50.310 --> 05:53:50.320 align:start position:0%
also been scheduled
 
05:53:50.320 --> 05:53:51.830 align:start position:0%
also been scheduled
um

05:53:51.830 --> 05:53:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:53:55.510 --> 05:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
throughout on monday and on
 
05:53:59.750 --> 05:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have wednesday available also
 
05:54:02.708 --> 05:54:02.718 align:start position:0%
i am not sure given the current status
 
05:54:05.350 --> 05:54:05.360 align:start position:0%
that it would be possible to accept
 
05:54:07.510 --> 05:54:07.520 align:start position:0%
everything on monday
 
05:54:10.948 --> 05:54:10.958 align:start position:0%
um so my suspicion is at this point we
 
05:54:14.548 --> 05:54:14.558 align:start position:0%
will be using the time on wednesday that
 
05:54:16.628 --> 05:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
we have allocated for us and i believe
 
05:54:19.190 --> 05:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
the start time for wednesday is 10
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock that's my recollection i have
 
05:54:21.440 --> 05:54:22.230 align:start position:0%
o'clock that's my recollection i have
not

05:54:22.230 --> 05:54:22.240 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:54:23.910 --> 05:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
looked at the
 
05:54:27.350 --> 05:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
notices that came out as to the 10th
 
05:54:27.360 --> 05:54:29.350 align:start position:0%
notices that came out as to the 10th
um

05:54:29.350 --> 05:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:54:32.230 --> 05:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
sb 43 we've heard about the underlying
 
05:54:34.310 --> 05:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
bill and i just realized i never got
 
05:54:37.030 --> 05:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
back to senator break was the original
 
05:54:38.628 --> 05:54:38.638 align:start position:0%
producer of the bill
 
05:54:42.070 --> 05:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
so my apologies into video space to
 
05:54:44.230 --> 05:54:44.240 align:start position:0%
senator gray who i said i would go back
 
05:54:45.990 --> 05:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
to at the end of the hearing
 
05:54:47.910 --> 05:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
um do you have an amendment that's been
 
05:54:51.190 --> 05:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
received in regards to
 
05:54:54.628 --> 05:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
what i guess is the windham points that
 
05:54:56.788 --> 05:54:56.798 align:start position:0%
the windham representatives
 
05:54:56.798 --> 05:54:57.670 align:start position:0%
the windham representatives
have

05:54:57.670 --> 05:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
have
 
05:55:00.070 --> 05:55:00.080 align:start position:0%
um submitted but i would
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
suggest that we're probably not going to
 
05:55:04.070 --> 05:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
get to any executive session and i guess
 
05:55:06.548 --> 05:55:06.558 align:start position:0%
i'll say it right now until wednesday on
 
05:55:07.830 --> 05:55:07.840 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:55:07.840 --> 05:55:09.190 align:start position:0%
this bill
so

05:55:09.190 --> 05:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:55:12.390 --> 05:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
we can have you know members
 
05:55:14.070 --> 05:55:14.080 align:start position:0%
based on the testimony what we've got
 
05:55:16.948 --> 05:55:16.958 align:start position:0%
from windows some consideration
 
05:55:16.958 --> 05:55:17.910 align:start position:0%
from windows some consideration
and

05:55:17.910 --> 05:55:17.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:55:21.590 --> 05:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
we have asked as my recollection is for
 
05:55:25.430 --> 05:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
the secretary and mr ellery to
 
05:55:28.230 --> 05:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
actually provide a written summary of
 
05:55:31.910 --> 05:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
what the points were that were indicated
 
05:55:33.990 --> 05:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
that god had been proceeding
 
05:55:35.590 --> 05:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
so hopefully
 
05:55:37.430 --> 05:55:37.440 align:start position:0%
we will be getting that
 
05:55:39.830 --> 05:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
and as a committee we will be able to
 
05:55:42.150 --> 05:55:42.160 align:start position:0%
work together on an amendment
 
05:55:44.310 --> 05:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
to and i think would probably just need
 
05:55:46.948 --> 05:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
an amendment to
 
05:55:51.830 --> 05:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
sb 43 but maybe we'll decide we don't
 
05:55:54.548 --> 05:55:54.558 align:start position:0%
get to a solution that may come to that
 
05:55:56.070 --> 05:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
we might be able to bring as the
 
05:55:57.830 --> 05:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
committee to the house
 
05:55:59.430 --> 05:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
for consideration
 
05:56:01.350 --> 05:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
and for those people listening as to the
 
05:56:01.360 --> 05:56:03.750 align:start position:0%
and for those people listening as to the
process

05:56:03.750 --> 05:56:03.760 align:start position:0%
process
 
05:56:06.230 --> 05:56:06.240 align:start position:0%
whatever we do here in committee we'll
 
05:56:10.548 --> 05:56:10.558 align:start position:0%
have to go to the full house for a vote
 
05:56:13.430 --> 05:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
if we change the bill in any manner from
 
05:56:15.510 --> 05:56:15.520 align:start position:0%
the senate bill that we have in front of
 
05:56:17.830 --> 05:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
us as suggested for example by windham
 
05:56:20.230 --> 05:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
with its amendment it will have to go
 
05:56:22.948 --> 05:56:22.958 align:start position:0%
back to the senate
 
05:56:26.948 --> 05:56:26.958 align:start position:0%
the process after that if the bill is
 
05:56:29.990 --> 05:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
signed off and agreed by both houses it
 
05:56:31.830 --> 05:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
needs to be enrolled
 
05:56:34.788 --> 05:56:34.798 align:start position:0%
will go to the leaders of the chambers
 
05:56:36.868 --> 05:56:36.878 align:start position:0%
or sign off and then it will go to the
 
05:56:39.030 --> 05:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
governor for signature
 
05:56:41.430 --> 05:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
and so i know people are concerned about
 
05:56:43.590 --> 05:56:43.600 align:start position:0%
the length of the process
 
05:56:45.110 --> 05:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
but that is
 
05:56:47.430 --> 05:56:47.440 align:start position:0%
the process that we are in right now
 
05:56:49.750 --> 05:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
legislatively in the meantime i hope you
 
05:56:51.590 --> 05:56:51.600 align:start position:0%
heard and understood
 
05:56:53.830 --> 05:56:53.840 align:start position:0%
that the ballots have been secured and
 
05:56:55.590 --> 05:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
have been retained and the ballot
 
05:56:58.150 --> 05:56:58.160 align:start position:0%
counting devices and all of their
 
05:57:01.190 --> 05:57:01.200 align:start position:0%
hardware and firmware has been secured
 
05:57:03.030 --> 05:57:03.040 align:start position:0%
and none of that will be changed or
 
05:57:04.628 --> 05:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
affected by the elections that are
 
05:57:04.638 --> 05:57:06.548 align:start position:0%

occurring
 
05:57:06.558 --> 05:57:07.430 align:start position:0%
occurring
so

05:57:07.430 --> 05:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:57:09.110 --> 05:57:09.120 align:start position:0%
do any committee members have any
 
05:57:09.120 --> 05:57:13.750 align:start position:0%
do any committee members have any
questions

05:57:13.750 --> 05:57:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:18.390 --> 05:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:23.590 --> 05:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:29.030 --> 05:57:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:32.628 --> 05:57:32.638 align:start position:0%
you didn't have your headset on either
 
05:57:34.390 --> 05:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry it's these headphones i
 
05:57:35.990 --> 05:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
thought i turned them off but i guess i
 
05:57:38.310 --> 05:57:38.320 align:start position:0%
didn't um
 
05:57:40.708 --> 05:57:40.718 align:start position:0%
if am i understanding that we're going
 
05:57:42.390 --> 05:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
to try and exec this
 
05:57:44.868 --> 05:57:44.878 align:start position:0%
on monday but
 
05:57:47.430 --> 05:57:47.440 align:start position:0%
but probably on wednesday i just given
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
how much testimony and how much
 
05:57:53.590 --> 05:57:53.600 align:start position:0%
ambiguity on the amendments we have i i
 
05:57:55.990 --> 05:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
guess i'm just trying to figure out i
 
05:57:57.670 --> 05:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know when the calendar
 
05:58:00.310 --> 05:58:00.320 align:start position:0%
was set which had to be before this
 
05:58:00.320 --> 05:58:02.230 align:start position:0%
was set which had to be before this
hearing

05:58:02.230 --> 05:58:02.240 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
05:58:04.868 --> 05:58:04.878 align:start position:0%
i had optimistically hoped that we would
 
05:58:07.190 --> 05:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
get through all bills on monday
 
05:58:09.910 --> 05:58:09.920 align:start position:0%
but i have reserved wednesday the 10th
 
05:58:12.548 --> 05:58:12.558 align:start position:0%
just in case i think it's much more
 
05:58:14.868 --> 05:58:14.878 align:start position:0%
realistic given like
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
the hearing we had today
 
05:58:19.350 --> 05:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
that we will be exacting bills to
 
05:58:22.868 --> 05:58:22.878 align:start position:0%
include sb 43 on wednesday
 
05:58:24.230 --> 05:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:58:27.350 --> 05:58:27.360 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry for it it's i was being over
 
05:58:29.430 --> 05:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
optimistic when i initially set the
 
05:58:30.868 --> 05:58:30.878 align:start position:0%
founder and
 
05:58:32.868 --> 05:58:32.878 align:start position:0%
i have been brought back to reality
 
05:58:35.110 --> 05:58:35.120 align:start position:0%
today so there you go
 
05:58:37.510 --> 05:58:37.520 align:start position:0%
any other questions and that's for the
 
05:58:39.110 --> 05:58:39.120 align:start position:0%
benefit of people who are signed on who
 
05:58:41.590 --> 05:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
might be interested in that bill i
 
05:58:43.270 --> 05:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
i just don't
 
05:58:44.868 --> 05:58:44.878 align:start position:0%
let's just have an agreement right now
 
05:58:48.310 --> 05:58:48.320 align:start position:0%
it's not coming back to wednesday and
 
05:58:49.670 --> 05:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with what other films the
 
05:58:51.910 --> 05:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
committee can't afford
 
05:58:55.830 --> 05:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:57.270 --> 05:58:57.280 align:start position:0%

appropriate ones so i believe this bill
 
06:01:22.150 --> 06:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be looked at much more closely
 
06:01:24.310 --> 06:01:24.320 align:start position:0%

um
 
06:04:42.788 --> 06:04:42.798 align:start position:0%
as mentioned there were a number of
 
06:04:44.150 --> 06:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
bills that came before the committee
 
06:04:46.548 --> 06:04:46.558 align:start position:0%
dealing with moving the primary date
 
06:04:48.868 --> 06:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
i asked the nashua city clerk to
 
06:04:50.868 --> 06:04:50.878 align:start position:0%
pass some of those proposals by the
 
06:04:52.948 --> 06:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
administrators in the school district
 
06:04:54.470 --> 06:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
and frankly i was surprised that they
 
06:04:56.310 --> 06:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
liked the august date because they felt
 
06:04:58.708 --> 06:04:58.718 align:start position:0%
an early date in september interferes
 
06:05:00.628 --> 06:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
with all the opening school year
 
06:05:03.110 --> 06:05:03.120 align:start position:0%
activities like parent nights and open
 
06:05:05.590 --> 06:05:05.600 align:start position:0%
houses and so on and similarly they were
 
06:05:07.190 --> 06:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
concerned about the june date because
 
06:05:08.708 --> 06:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
that's a period of time where you have a
 
06:05:11.110 --> 06:05:11.120 align:start position:0%
lot of exam activities end of school
 
06:05:13.670 --> 06:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
activities senior awards events field
 
06:05:15.910 --> 06:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
days and of course exams
 
06:05:19.510 --> 06:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
so um you know i i like the idea of uh
 
06:05:21.750 --> 06:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
keeping house bill 97 alive and i will
 
06:05:27.190 --> 06:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:29.030 --> 06:05:29.040 align:start position:0%

while well intended does not really
 
06:12:50.798 --> 06:12:51.590 align:start position:0%
while well intended does not really
meet

06:12:51.590 --> 06:12:51.600 align:start position:0%

all right
 
06:12:59.120 --> 06:12:59.910 align:start position:0%
all right
so

06:12:59.910 --> 06:12:59.920 align:start position:0%

06:13:02.548 --> 06:13:02.558 align:start position:0%

so
 
06:13:23.590 --> 06:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
well i'm sure this bill was intentional
 
06:13:25.990 --> 06:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
i believe that um
 
06:13:28.788 --> 06:13:28.798 align:start position:0%
ultimately the voter's responsibility
 
06:13:30.868 --> 06:13:30.878 align:start position:0%
and he should retain that responsibility
 
06:13:32.230 --> 06:13:32.240 align:start position:0%
to change
 
06:13:33.110 --> 06:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
the act
 
06:13:36.548 --> 06:13:36.558 align:start position:0%
if he or she decides to go from
 
06:13:37.910 --> 06:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
undeclared to
 
06:13:40.390 --> 06:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
a democrat party in a primary to vote or
 
06:13:40.400 --> 06:13:41.430 align:start position:0%
a democrat party in a primary to vote or
undeclared

06:13:41.430 --> 06:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
undeclared
 
06:13:43.350 --> 06:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
republican party
 
06:13:44.868 --> 06:13:44.878 align:start position:0%
they make that decision to do that they
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:48.480 --> 06:13:49.190 align:start position:0%
 
to

06:13:49.190 --> 06:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:13:51.110 --> 06:13:51.120 align:start position:0%
switch back i don't think
 
06:13:52.788 --> 06:13:52.798 align:start position:0%
we should put that
 
06:13:54.948 --> 06:13:54.958 align:start position:0%
bonus on the back of
 
06:13:56.708 --> 06:13:56.718 align:start position:0%
tom clark's be responsible i think
 
06:14:00.390 --> 06:14:00.400 align:start position:0%
that's an individual responsibility
 
06:14:02.628 --> 06:14:02.638 align:start position:0%
and if you're not sure
 
06:14:04.310 --> 06:14:04.320 align:start position:0%
you're some testimony that some people
 
06:14:05.350 --> 06:14:05.360 align:start position:0%
weren't sure
 
06:14:05.360 --> 06:14:06.230 align:start position:0%
weren't sure
whether

06:14:06.230 --> 06:14:06.240 align:start position:0%
whether
 
06:14:08.230 --> 06:14:08.240 align:start position:0%
whether they were registered undeclared
 
06:14:10.390 --> 06:14:10.400 align:start position:0%
or a particular party you can always
 
06:14:12.470 --> 06:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
contact your county clerk and find that
 
06:14:12.480 --> 06:14:13.510 align:start position:0%
contact your county clerk and find that
out

06:14:13.510 --> 06:14:13.520 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:14:16.788 --> 06:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
right away so i don't believe this
 
06:14:18.708 --> 06:14:18.718 align:start position:0%
legislation is necessary and that's the
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
reason for the ideal motion
 
06:14:23.030 --> 06:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else want to
 
06:14:23.040 --> 06:14:24.230 align:start position:0%
thank you does anybody else want to
speak

06:14:24.230 --> 06:14:24.240 align:start position:0%

06:14:25.990 --> 06:14:26.000 align:start position:0%

would you like to speak to your motion
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:44.320 --> 06:20:46.390 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:20:46.390 --> 06:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:20:48.070 --> 06:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
fortunately was a bill relative of the
 
06:20:49.990 --> 06:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
procedures for a fortune electoral
 
06:20:53.830 --> 06:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
districts and what it did is it required
 
06:20:56.230 --> 06:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
the signal to since its information it
 
06:20:56.240 --> 06:20:57.190 align:start position:0%
the signal to since its information it
also

06:20:57.190 --> 06:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
also
 
06:21:01.030 --> 06:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:03.510 --> 06:21:03.520 align:start position:0%
committees to set up a website
 
06:21:05.350 --> 06:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
and for committees to have meetings in
 
06:21:06.548 --> 06:21:06.558 align:start position:0%
every county
 
06:21:09.030 --> 06:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
this would
 
06:21:11.110 --> 06:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
prepare a certain cost for the state to
 
06:21:11.120 --> 06:21:12.310 align:start position:0%
prepare a certain cost for the state to
do

06:21:12.310 --> 06:21:12.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
06:21:14.070 --> 06:21:14.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's necessary
 
06:21:15.670 --> 06:21:15.680 align:start position:0%
we're currently doing a lot of things
 
06:21:16.868 --> 06:21:16.878 align:start position:0%
with zoom
 
06:21:16.878 --> 06:21:17.750 align:start position:0%
with zoom
so

06:21:17.750 --> 06:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:20.628 --> 06:21:20.638 align:start position:0%
that was problematic for me
 
06:21:21.750 --> 06:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing is there's some
 
06:21:25.830 --> 06:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:21:28.628 --> 06:21:28.638 align:start position:0%
during redistricting
 
06:21:30.830 --> 06:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
one party
 
06:21:32.150 --> 06:21:32.160 align:start position:0%
always uh
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
excuse me one
 
06:21:36.628 --> 06:21:36.638 align:start position:0%
their favor looking at the election
 
06:21:38.470 --> 06:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee
 
06:21:38.480 --> 06:21:39.270 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee
um

06:21:39.270 --> 06:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's pretty close to i mean i
 
06:21:42.548 --> 06:21:42.558 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
06:21:44.628 --> 06:21:44.638 align:start position:0%
it's not completely even but it's eight
 
06:21:47.270 --> 06:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
to seven members on the committee
 
06:21:47.280 --> 06:21:48.230 align:start position:0%
to seven members on the committee
so

06:21:48.230 --> 06:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:21:51.030 --> 06:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that um
 
06:21:52.868 --> 06:21:52.878 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have a problem with that
 
06:21:52.878 --> 06:21:53.990 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have a problem with that
and

06:21:53.990 --> 06:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:21:55.750 --> 06:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
this would simply
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
cost the state money for an unnecessary
 
06:22:00.310 --> 06:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
uh requirement
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%

cody
 
06:22:13.670 --> 06:22:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i will oppose the motion of
 
06:22:16.150 --> 06:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
itl i think there may be some problems
 
06:22:18.310 --> 06:22:18.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill but i think it it got a
 
06:22:20.788 --> 06:22:20.798 align:start position:0%
lot of strong support from several
 
06:22:22.948 --> 06:22:22.958 align:start position:0%
people who communicated with me
 
06:22:22.958 --> 06:22:23.750 align:start position:0%
people who communicated with me
and

06:22:23.750 --> 06:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:22:25.430 --> 06:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
there may be some issues that would
 
06:22:27.910 --> 06:22:27.920 align:start position:0%
prevent and ought to pass but i
 
06:22:29.990 --> 06:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
certainly don't think itl is the
 
06:22:33.750 --> 06:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:35.670 --> 06:22:35.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
06:22:37.830 --> 06:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
i can say that i think he has some good
 
06:22:40.788 --> 06:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
ideas in regards to process
 
06:22:42.470 --> 06:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
and have to go forward
 
06:22:42.480 --> 06:22:44.150 align:start position:0%
and have to go forward
um

06:22:44.150 --> 06:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:22:46.548 --> 06:22:46.558 align:start position:0%
but i don't
 
06:22:48.310 --> 06:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
think it's
 
06:22:50.548 --> 06:22:50.558 align:start position:0%
necessary for it is it
 
06:22:52.628 --> 06:22:52.638 align:start position:0%
this positive of what i suspect people
 
06:22:54.470 --> 06:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
would want
 
06:22:57.910 --> 06:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate representatives position
 
06:22:58.868 --> 06:22:58.878 align:start position:0%
on this and
 
06:23:00.708 --> 06:23:00.718 align:start position:0%

neglected to mention and that is that in
1990

06:23:29.030 --> 06:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
1990
 
06:23:31.350 --> 06:23:31.360 align:start position:0%

committee to meet in every county in the

secretary of state to highlight the
 
06:26:38.310 --> 06:26:38.320 align:start position:0%

representative hayward moves in
 
06:26:58.628 --> 06:26:58.638 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate is there a second
 
06:27:01.150 --> 06:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
has been that it's been seconded by
 
06:27:05.510 --> 06:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative o'brien is there any
 
06:27:06.830 --> 06:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
yes i
 
06:27:13.430 --> 06:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:15.750 --> 06:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
anybody want to explain the itl on this
 
06:27:15.760 --> 06:27:20.628 align:start position:0%
anybody want to explain the itl on this
vote

06:27:20.628 --> 06:27:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:22.230 --> 06:27:22.240 align:start position:0%
this was a bill just for anybody who
 
06:27:23.910 --> 06:27:23.920 align:start position:0%
might be representing who might be
 
06:27:25.910 --> 06:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
listening that required a
 
06:27:28.468 --> 06:27:28.478 align:start position:0%
highlight or a watermark or some sort of
 
06:27:28.478 --> 06:27:30.070 align:start position:0%
highlight or a watermark or some sort of
undefined

06:27:30.070 --> 06:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
undefined
 
06:27:33.150 --> 06:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
uh notation on the ballot to highlight
 
06:27:37.670 --> 06:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
the number of uh votes that should occur
 
06:27:39.270 --> 06:27:39.280 align:start position:0%
and it was pointed out during the public
 
06:27:40.948 --> 06:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
hearing that the ballot itself actually
 
06:27:43.510 --> 06:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
has expressions on it
 
06:27:45.110 --> 06:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
and there was
 
06:27:47.430 --> 06:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
i think all i i was going to be sort of
 
06:28:00.708 --> 06:28:00.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:02.948 --> 06:28:02.958 align:start position:0%
madam chair i can talk to the itl motion
 
06:28:05.430 --> 06:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
as well i'll be voting to itl although i
 
06:28:09.270 --> 06:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
can appreciate the sponsor uh taking a
 
06:28:11.830 --> 06:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
measure to highlight an area that could
 
06:28:14.468 --> 06:28:14.478 align:start position:0%
be perceived as confusing there really
 
06:28:16.628 --> 06:28:16.638 align:start position:0%
didn't seem to be an overwhelming need
 
06:28:18.390 --> 06:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
for that particular change
 
06:28:20.948 --> 06:28:20.958 align:start position:0%
and once we get into ballot design
 
06:28:23.430 --> 06:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
really the options are endless so for
 
06:28:26.548 --> 06:28:26.558 align:start position:0%
that reason i will be voting itl
 
06:28:29.510 --> 06:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else on the itl motion
 
06:28:32.788 --> 06:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:28:35.270 --> 06:28:35.280 align:start position:0%

madam chair could i just say that it's a
 
06:30:29.590 --> 06:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
pleasure after a period of some years to
 
06:30:31.350 --> 06:30:31.360 align:start position:0%
hear representative mooney speak to a
 
06:30:33.350 --> 06:30:33.360 align:start position:0%

06:30:36.230 --> 06:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:40.230 --> 06:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:41.510 --> 06:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
the next
 
06:30:43.350 --> 06:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
bill that we have before us this
 
06:30:43.360 --> 06:30:44.628 align:start position:0%
bill that we have before us this
afternoon

06:30:44.628 --> 06:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
06:30:49.110 --> 06:30:49.120 align:start position:0%
is house bill 555 hb 555 as far as
 
06:30:51.430 --> 06:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
relative to prisoners voting rights
 
06:30:53.350 --> 06:30:53.360 align:start position:0%
this bill would amend the absentee voter
 
06:30:55.350 --> 06:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
application form and absentee voter
 
06:30:57.670 --> 06:30:57.680 align:start position:0%
affidavits to make clear that certain
 
06:31:00.548 --> 06:31:00.558 align:start position:0%
persons confined to penal institutions
 
06:31:02.310 --> 06:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
may vote by the
 
06:31:02.320 --> 06:31:05.510 align:start position:0%
may vote by the
ballot

06:31:05.510 --> 06:31:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:08.230 --> 06:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
this is actually somewhat similar to a
 
06:31:10.548 --> 06:31:10.558 align:start position:0%
bill that i think is the same as a bill
 
06:31:13.270 --> 06:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
that passed last year the public hearing
 
06:31:16.628 --> 06:31:16.638 align:start position:0%
on this was on february 17th
 
06:31:19.430 --> 06:31:19.440 align:start position:0%
is there a motion on this bill
 
06:31:22.708 --> 06:31:22.718 align:start position:0%
yes i'd like i'd like to ride i move out
 
06:31:24.628 --> 06:31:24.638 align:start position:0%
to pass on this bill
 
06:31:26.788 --> 06:31:26.798 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
06:31:26.798 --> 06:31:28.310 align:start position:0%
is there a second
representative

06:31:28.310 --> 06:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:31:30.230 --> 06:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
second state representative
 
06:31:31.830 --> 06:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
06:31:34.548 --> 06:31:34.558 align:start position:0%
yes i would thank you this is an
 
06:31:36.310 --> 06:31:36.320 align:start position:0%
interesting bill because there's
 
06:31:39.110 --> 06:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support
 
06:31:41.990 --> 06:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
and it's uh
 
06:31:44.628 --> 06:31:44.638 align:start position:0%
the same bill that we we had last year
 
06:31:46.390 --> 06:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
that you know fizzled out because of
 
06:31:49.750 --> 06:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
coven and all of that
 
06:31:52.788 --> 06:31:52.798 align:start position:0%
this establishes no new voting rights
 
06:31:55.750 --> 06:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
for people who are in prison
 
06:31:58.708 --> 06:31:58.718 align:start position:0%
what this does is clarify that people
 
06:32:00.948 --> 06:32:00.958 align:start position:0%
who are in jail who have not been
 
06:32:02.468 --> 06:32:02.478 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony people who are
 
06:32:02.478 --> 06:32:03.590 align:start position:0%
convicted of a felony people who are
awaiting

06:32:03.590 --> 06:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
awaiting
 
06:32:06.150 --> 06:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
a conviction or
 
06:32:07.750 --> 06:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
a trial
 
06:32:10.708 --> 06:32:10.718 align:start position:0%
hopefully not a conviction but they
 
06:32:13.270 --> 06:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
they have the right to vote
 
06:32:15.350 --> 06:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
if they're not in their own community
 
06:32:17.750 --> 06:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
and that sometimes happens and right now
 
06:32:19.990 --> 06:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot request form asks
 
06:32:21.110 --> 06:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
them about
 
06:32:22.708 --> 06:32:22.718 align:start position:0%
being in their own community or outside
 
06:32:24.390 --> 06:32:24.400 align:start position:0%
of their own community if they're i'm
 
06:32:26.070 --> 06:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
sorry if they're in their own community
 
06:32:27.750 --> 06:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
they are in their own community but in
 
06:32:27.760 --> 06:32:28.868 align:start position:0%
they are in their own community but in
jail

06:32:28.868 --> 06:32:28.878 align:start position:0%
jail
 
06:32:30.468 --> 06:32:30.478 align:start position:0%
so there was some confusion and this
 
06:32:31.830 --> 06:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
clarifies it
 
06:32:34.230 --> 06:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
and just to reiterate this establishes
 
06:32:36.230 --> 06:32:36.240 align:start position:0%
no new voting rights in the state of new
 
06:32:37.350 --> 06:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
hampshire for
 
06:32:37.360 --> 06:32:38.390 align:start position:0%
hampshire for
uh

06:32:38.390 --> 06:32:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:32:38.400 --> 06:32:39.910 align:start position:0%
uh
criminals

06:32:39.910 --> 06:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
criminals
 
06:32:41.190 --> 06:32:41.200 align:start position:0%
because some of these people have not
 
06:32:42.628 --> 06:32:42.638 align:start position:0%
been convicted yet
 
06:32:44.390 --> 06:32:44.400 align:start position:0%
thank you is there any further
 
06:32:46.468 --> 06:32:46.478 align:start position:0%
discussion on this representative barry
 
06:32:49.670 --> 06:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:51.830 --> 06:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
 
06:32:54.150 --> 06:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
i said
 
06:32:54.160 --> 06:32:55.110 align:start position:0%
i said
um

06:32:55.110 --> 06:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:32:56.628 --> 06:32:56.638 align:start position:0%
this is it i believe this is an
 
06:32:58.628 --> 06:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
important bill um
 
06:32:59.750 --> 06:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
a fellow representative of the
 
06:33:01.910 --> 06:33:01.920 align:start position:0%
manchester broadcast forward and he
 
06:33:04.070 --> 06:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
makes the point valley street is in
 
06:33:05.910 --> 06:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
manchester it's the state's largest city
 
06:33:07.750 --> 06:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
it actually sits just outside of my
 
06:33:10.628 --> 06:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
district and it is possible for someone
 
06:33:12.468 --> 06:33:12.478 align:start position:0%
to be arrested in the city of manchester
 
06:33:14.230 --> 06:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
and held the city of manchester who is
 
06:33:16.310 --> 06:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
has not actually committed a crime that
 
06:33:17.830 --> 06:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
does not happen often but sometimes
 
06:33:20.150 --> 06:33:20.160 align:start position:0%
people are arrested falsely so we need
 
06:33:21.990 --> 06:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
to give them an outlet to exercise their
 
06:33:23.750 --> 06:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
right to vote and this is a common sense
 
06:33:26.070 --> 06:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
bill that doesn't create any new rights
 
06:33:28.230 --> 06:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
but clarifies what could be seen as a
 
06:33:30.150 --> 06:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
loophole that inhibits someone from
 
06:33:33.030 --> 06:33:33.040 align:start position:0%
voting and i think it's common sense
 
06:33:34.948 --> 06:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
thank you representative does anybody
 
06:33:40.070 --> 06:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:41.990 --> 06:33:42.000 align:start position:0%

um this is what's a slight redraft of
 
06:35:23.350 --> 06:35:23.360 align:start position:0%
the build that was trying to make its
 
06:35:28.628 --> 06:35:28.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:35:28.638 --> 06:35:30.708 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:35:30.708 --> 06:35:30.718 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:33.830 --> 06:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
we heard it the public hearing was on
 
06:35:37.830 --> 06:35:37.840 align:start position:0%
february 5th is there a motion on age
 
06:35:37.840 --> 06:35:39.750 align:start position:0%
february 5th is there a motion on age
24.

06:35:39.750 --> 06:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
24.
 
06:35:42.070 --> 06:35:42.080 align:start position:0%
i'm out of chair i ask that we retain
 
06:35:42.080 --> 06:35:42.788 align:start position:0%
i'm out of chair i ask that we retain
this

06:35:42.788 --> 06:35:42.798 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:35:44.548 --> 06:35:44.558 align:start position:0%
representative wells means that we
 
06:35:44.558 --> 06:36:03.430 align:start position:0%
representative wells means that we
retain

06:36:03.430 --> 06:36:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:03.440 --> 06:36:04.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

06:36:04.230 --> 06:36:04.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
06:36:04.240 --> 06:36:05.510 align:start position:0%
so
um

06:36:05.510 --> 06:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:36:07.830 --> 06:36:07.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to retain this bill there is
 
06:36:10.868 --> 06:36:10.878 align:start position:0%
potentially some merit to
 
06:36:12.150 --> 06:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
passing this
 
06:36:13.350 --> 06:36:13.360 align:start position:0%
i think we need to do a little more
 
06:36:16.628 --> 06:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
study on it before we uh
 
06:36:18.548 --> 06:36:18.558 align:start position:0%
it's ready to be
 
06:36:26.150 --> 06:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:28.230 --> 06:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
is there any further discussion on the
 
06:36:30.070 --> 06:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
bill or the motion that's in front of
 
06:36:33.270 --> 06:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
the floor it is to retain this
 
06:36:35.190 --> 06:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
and i will say my recollection is this
 
06:36:37.110 --> 06:36:37.120 align:start position:0%
bill got a fair amount of discussion and
 
06:36:38.548 --> 06:36:38.558 align:start position:0%
prior years
 
06:36:40.948 --> 06:36:40.958 align:start position:0%
the the crime sponsor did do some
 
06:36:43.110 --> 06:36:43.120 align:start position:0%
modification and detailing of it as
 
06:36:44.708 --> 06:36:44.718 align:start position:0%
compared to how
 
06:36:47.830 --> 06:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
um the statute exists currently
 
06:36:50.230 --> 06:36:50.240 align:start position:0%
um and in fairness to the sponsor and
 
06:36:52.310 --> 06:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
the committee the reality is this has
 
06:36:54.150 --> 06:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
been a very different year for public
 
06:36:56.788 --> 06:36:56.798 align:start position:0%
hearings that going forward and
 
06:36:56.798 --> 06:36:58.548 align:start position:0%
hearings that going forward and
um

06:36:58.548 --> 06:36:58.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:37:00.868 --> 06:37:00.878 align:start position:0%
it is
 
06:37:02.468 --> 06:37:02.478 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state's office
 
06:37:05.350 --> 06:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
acknowledges that this is a grey area
 
06:37:07.830 --> 06:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
um and i just think that before we
 
06:37:15.110 --> 06:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:37:17.190 --> 06:37:17.200 align:start position:0%
creating less confusion it's always a
 
06:37:18.708 --> 06:37:18.718 align:start position:0%
good thing so that's why i applied for
 
06:37:21.190 --> 06:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
the supporting motion to retain
 
06:37:24.788 --> 06:37:24.798 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
06:37:28.548 --> 06:37:28.558 align:start position:0%

at length about people's faith in our

06:39:41.590 --> 06:39:41.600 align:start position:0%
elections
 
06:39:43.670 --> 06:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
i've spoken at length about the process
 
06:39:46.070 --> 06:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
in which someone may same day register
 
06:39:47.990 --> 06:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire i want to
 
06:39:49.510 --> 06:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
go over that real briefly because this
 
06:39:51.430 --> 06:39:51.440 align:start position:0%
bill pertains to that in the state of
 
06:39:52.628 --> 06:39:52.638 align:start position:0%
new hampshire you may walk into the
 
06:39:55.510 --> 06:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
ballot box with you may walk into
 
06:39:57.270 --> 06:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
the uh location
 
06:39:59.270 --> 06:39:59.280 align:start position:0%
not being a registered voter walk up to
 
06:40:01.190 --> 06:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
the same day registration booth with no
 
06:40:03.910 --> 06:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
id and no proof of residency and you may
 
06:40:05.670 --> 06:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
register to vote but one of the things
 
06:40:07.350 --> 06:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
that happens when you don't produce a
 
06:40:09.990 --> 06:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
photo id is they ask to have your photo
 
06:40:12.708 --> 06:40:12.718 align:start position:0%
taken it's a measure to try to ensure
 
06:40:15.430 --> 06:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
some valid integrity however you are
 
06:40:18.150 --> 06:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to cite a religious exemption to
 
06:40:21.110 --> 06:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
not have your photo taken
 
06:40:22.868 --> 06:40:22.878 align:start position:0%
you then sign the qualified voter after
 
06:40:24.548 --> 06:40:24.558 align:start position:0%
davis which is another conversation for
 
06:40:26.708 --> 06:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
another day
 
06:40:28.390 --> 06:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
the notion that somebody will be able to
 
06:40:30.390 --> 06:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
go to the polling location
 
06:40:32.788 --> 06:40:32.798 align:start position:0%
and not have their photo taken
 
06:40:35.430 --> 06:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
is really far out there in modern day
 
06:40:37.590 --> 06:40:37.600 align:start position:0%
society it's nearly impossible to go
 
06:40:39.750 --> 06:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
outside without being on camera
 
06:40:41.670 --> 06:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
my car has a backup camera and my camera
 
06:40:43.270 --> 06:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
right now on my laptop my cell phone has
 
06:40:45.990 --> 06:40:46.000 align:start position:0%
a camera it's almost impossible
 
06:40:49.590 --> 06:40:49.600 align:start position:0%
so this exemption is rarely used
 
06:40:52.868 --> 06:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
and because but it does however create a
 
06:40:55.030 --> 06:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
extreme amount of distress in our
 
06:40:57.510 --> 06:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
electoral process and by removing it
 
06:41:00.070 --> 06:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
we won't be inhibiting anyone's genuine
 
06:41:01.910 --> 06:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
access to the ballot box
 
06:41:04.150 --> 06:41:04.160 align:start position:0%
what we will do is in a very small way
 
06:41:06.150 --> 06:41:06.160 align:start position:0%
restore some faith in our election and i
 
06:41:08.468 --> 06:41:08.478 align:start position:0%
would think that after today's testimony
 
06:41:10.868 --> 06:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
where nearly 400 people signed up to
 
06:41:12.230 --> 06:41:12.240 align:start position:0%
express in one way or the other they
 
06:41:13.910 --> 06:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
have distrust our elections that we
 
06:41:16.390 --> 06:41:16.400 align:start position:0%
would take positive momentum towards
 
06:41:16.400 --> 06:41:18.468 align:start position:0%
would take positive momentum towards
that

06:41:18.468 --> 06:41:18.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:41:26.310 --> 06:41:26.320 align:start position:0%
