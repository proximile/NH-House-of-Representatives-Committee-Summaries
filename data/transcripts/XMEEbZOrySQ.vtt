00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 align:start position:0%
it being 10 o'clock we'll start on time
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
this is the organizational meeting of
 
00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 align:start position:0%
the finance committee the house finance
 
00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee New Hampshire Constitution
 
00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
gives us a unique role because we're
 
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 align:start position:0%
closer to the people so all spending
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
bills must originate in the New
 
00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire house and the New Hampshire
 
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
house has designated us
 
00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 align:start position:0%
as the finance committee to do that task
 
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
budget by law can can only contain
 
00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.290 align:start position:0%
budget by law can can only contain
spreadsheets

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets
 
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
and you'll see that in the orientation
 
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
so hb2 is added we call it the the
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
trailer bill it has to describe all the
 
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:44.340 align:start position:0%
changes that enable the legislation such
 
00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:47.759 align:start position:0%
if we put in new legislation or if we
 
00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:48.409 align:start position:0%
if we put in new legislation or if we
um

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 align:start position:0%
changes the law changed the tax all that
 
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 align:start position:0%
has to go in hp2
 
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.170 align:start position:0%
has to go in hp2
so

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 align:start position:0%
when we get that
 
00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.230 align:start position:0%
when we get that
um

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:04:59.570 --> 00:04:59.580 align:start position:0%
the budget's usually about 1500 pages
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
thick and last time the hb2 was over 300
 
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 align:start position:0%
Pages it's the biggest we've seen in my
 
00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:10.259 align:start position:0%
25 years of looking at it usually it's a
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
hundred and some pages but last year
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
three over 300.
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
if this policy changes I send those off
 
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
to a policy committee for for uh
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
comments and then they'd come back to
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
Western we'd act appropriately we have
 
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
about six weeks to accomplish the task
 
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
of completing the budget so it's it's a
 
00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 align:start position:0%
pretty full-time thing we'll be meeting
 
00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
Monday through Friday
 
00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
um because of the room shortage and the
 
00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
spreading out and so on Health and Human
 
00:05:42.529 --> 00:05:42.539 align:start position:0%
Services has been assigned to this room
 
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
they'll be using it mostly Wednesdays
 
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:48.539 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they'll use a full day so
 
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 align:start position:0%
they won't have to go into other days so
 
00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 align:start position:0%
it'll be it'll be hours
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday and of
 
00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 align:start position:0%
course your committee rooms except for
 
00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
division three is is a little different
 
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I gotta pay a fine on that one
 
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.830 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I gotta pay a fine on that one
foreign

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:18.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
so I owe now
 
00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:23.699 align:start position:0%
five dollars for my
 
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
my S uh phone going off while we're
 
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
having a hearing
 
00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:30.539 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
we have a February 15th the governor
 
00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
will deliver to us if he's on time hp1
 
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
he'll come in here and and
 
00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 align:start position:0%
make a Spiel and then leave and leave to
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
his budget expert
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
who's never done this before so I'm
 
00:06:49.309 --> 00:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
pleased to have all the experience we
 
00:06:51.409 --> 00:06:51.419 align:start position:0%
have in this room
 
00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
to work on that budget we'll go up line
 
00:06:56.210 --> 00:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
by line Page by Page we'll compare it
 
00:06:58.490 --> 00:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
with what they spent last year we might
 
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
ask a comment
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
was that successful did it cover
 
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:04.020 align:start position:0%
everything was it more than you needed
 
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 align:start position:0%
they'll never admit it or was it less
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
than you needed and did we do anything
 
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
in the law to make it a bigger project
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
project than it was previously
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
we have the ability to shift funds from
 
00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:18.800 align:start position:0%
one line to another with some exceptions
 
00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
we try to keep Personnel lines separate
 
00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:25.979 align:start position:0%
because that's where they quite often
 
00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
come in and we've done some work thanks
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
to my vice chair and I looking at
 
00:07:33.529 --> 00:07:33.539 align:start position:0%
other ways to count the number of
 
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
employees I asked the treasurer this
 
00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
year for a list of paychecks so don't
 
00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:41.160 align:start position:0%
come in and tell me you have 800
 
00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
employees when only 700 paychecks went
 
00:07:46.129 --> 00:07:46.139 align:start position:0%
out so it's it's another way to
 
00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:48.539 align:start position:0%
cross-check that we're going down the
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
right road because everybody likes to
 
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
put a little
 
00:07:54.529 --> 00:07:54.539 align:start position:0%
extra list of people in there and then
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
come into us later and do a song and
 
00:07:58.129 --> 00:07:58.139 align:start position:0%
dance well you know
 
00:08:00.110 --> 00:08:00.120 align:start position:0%
we'd like to give a few
 
00:08:02.689 --> 00:08:02.699 align:start position:0%
uh pay raises to some people or maybe
 
00:08:04.909 --> 00:08:04.919 align:start position:0%
everybody and we'll say
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
we only have so much money in that line
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
well you know we had a lot of early
 
00:08:10.189 --> 00:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
retirement so there's a little extra
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
money in there well isn't that odd you
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
started with extra people in there that
 
00:08:17.809 --> 00:08:17.819 align:start position:0%
you didn't have so we do our best to
 
00:08:19.309 --> 00:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
find them and take them out because we
 
00:08:20.450 --> 00:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
don't want everybody to have a little
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
slush fund if you need extra money come
 
00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
to us we may find it in another agency
 
00:08:28.249 --> 00:08:28.259 align:start position:0%
but don't expect every agency to have
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
their own slush fund so we have to find
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
that and take it out
 
00:08:33.599 --> 00:08:36.350 align:start position:0%
that and take it out
so

00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
you may have noticed that the house
 
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
appreciates this task that we do for
 
00:08:41.829 --> 00:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
them and that's why we have so much room
 
00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
we have more room than others as I
 
00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:47.160 align:start position:0%
started to say normally we have the two
 
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
division rooms across the hall and
 
00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:52.680 align:start position:0%
division three would use this room and
 
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
they're down to their their usual
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
I think it'd be eight people and uh and
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
they'd have a big room for all the
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
people that come in from HHS because
 
00:09:05.210 --> 00:09:05.220 align:start position:0%
that's the half of the budget they deal
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
with so
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
because the Health and Human Services
 
00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:12.240 align:start position:0%
may be here Wednesdays
 
00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:14.339 align:start position:0%
I've asked to give them the room
 
00:09:16.970 --> 00:09:16.980 align:start position:0%
downstairs 104. so division three may
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
meet in 104 sometime it's also been
 
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
assigned to several of these
 
00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
extra committees that have been created
 
00:09:27.050 --> 00:09:27.060 align:start position:0%
on housing and and so on that may also
 
00:09:29.650 --> 00:09:29.660 align:start position:0%
be meeting there sometimes so
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
so Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday
 
00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:33.769 align:start position:0%
so Monday Tuesday Thursday Friday
division

00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
division
 
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:35.700 align:start position:0%
three may meet here sometimes the other
 
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
times they'll probably be meeting down
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
at 104.
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
depending on how the room what rooms are
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
available but it's nice for them to have
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
a special room like all the other
 
00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.650 align:start position:0%
a special room like all the other
divisions

00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
divisions
 
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:48.050 align:start position:0%
divisions
so

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:48.060 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:52.140 align:start position:0%
we now have about 11 bills that come
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
directly to us
 
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860 align:start position:0%
for the for the first committee some of
 
00:09:58.370 --> 00:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
them invite vacated by other committees
 
00:10:01.009 --> 00:10:01.019 align:start position:0%
for instance the one hb50 relative to
 
00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
payment of the state of a portion of
 
00:10:04.910 --> 00:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
retirement system contributions to
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions was vacated by
 
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
Edna so it's come to us and I think
 
00:10:12.850 --> 00:10:12.860 align:start position:0%
there's another one from
 
00:10:15.889 --> 00:10:15.899 align:start position:0%
education that dealt with the difference
 
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:17.700 align:start position:0%
between five thousand and twenty
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
thousand when they had to have a special
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
meeting so they vacated that that's
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
really a financial decision rather than
 
00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
any policy so we're taking some of those
 
00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
bills up front will probably deal with
 
00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:29.210 align:start position:0%
bills up front will probably deal with
those

00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:31.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully before we start the budget
 
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
work on the 15th so
 
00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:35.630 align:start position:0%
work on the 15th so
um

00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:37.620 align:start position:0%
first meeting for us I'd like to
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
introduce ourselves a little tell a
 
00:10:41.949 --> 00:10:41.959 align:start position:0%
little bit about ourselves I'll start
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
MIT graduate went right in the Air Force
 
00:10:47.329 --> 00:10:47.339 align:start position:0%
to Pilot training
 
00:10:50.269 --> 00:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
um had six years of active duty decided
 
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:52.560 align:start position:0%
I liked uh flying airplanes more than
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
doing chemical engineering although
 
00:10:56.329 --> 00:10:56.339 align:start position:0%
there was some relationship
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
and went on to Airlines as well as the
 
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
Air Force Reserve and spent 38 years in
 
00:11:03.829 --> 00:11:03.839 align:start position:0%
my flying career I've been in the
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislature since 1990 I've been on the
 
00:11:08.949 --> 00:11:08.959 align:start position:0%
finance committee or it's or it's
 
00:11:12.889 --> 00:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
predecessor Appropriations since 94 I
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
think I had one term I was not on this
 
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
committee since that time and uh
 
00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:20.820 align:start position:0%
I've enjoyed the work uh it's a
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
challenge for us to figure out how to
 
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
make everything work and and
 
00:11:27.650 --> 00:11:27.660 align:start position:0%
I quite often rely on alternative
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
sources sometimes the people that come
 
00:11:32.449 --> 00:11:32.459 align:start position:0%
before us tell one story if you happen
 
00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:35.100 align:start position:0%
to know or have a neighbor that works
 
00:11:36.889 --> 00:11:36.899 align:start position:0%
there you might hear a different story
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
or if you run into somebody so sit down
 
00:11:41.449 --> 00:11:41.459 align:start position:0%
and talk with those people and you'll
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
find out lots of things that we may not
 
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:46.860 align:start position:0%
find out in in these rooms so use your
 
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
outside connections to find out
 
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:51.720 align:start position:0%
everything you can and it will come in
 
00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
handy and then another thing that uh
 
00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm proud to have his this group of
 
00:11:59.030 --> 00:11:59.040 align:start position:0%

Michael Kane I I consider him kind of
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
the dean of the college because he
 
00:12:12.410 --> 00:12:12.420 align:start position:0%

00:12:15.889 --> 00:12:15.899 align:start position:0%

00:12:25.310 --> 00:12:25.320 align:start position:0%

from Romania which used to be a

00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
unpleasant sort of election in the

School Board elections in Windham the
 
00:26:00.110 --> 00:26:00.120 align:start position:0%

very favorable District so you're never
 
00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
going to get rid of me uh sorry uh I I I
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
want to point out uh Jerry Stringham uh
 
00:32:33.649 --> 00:32:33.659 align:start position:0%
didn't mention that he's the clerk of
 
00:32:38.510 --> 00:32:38.520 align:start position:0%
division three uh Sharon nordgren is our
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
ranking member of division three Maureen
 
00:32:43.730 --> 00:32:43.740 align:start position:0%
Mooney is our vice chair of division
 
00:32:45.649 --> 00:32:45.659 align:start position:0%
three and and this will be the second
 
00:32:48.470 --> 00:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
term I've at least had an opportunity to
 
00:32:51.409 --> 00:32:51.419 align:start position:0%
start out chairing division three I I uh
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
a fun fact about me I'm the only person
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
in U.S military history as a hospital
 
00:33:02.389 --> 00:33:02.399 align:start position:0%
administrator to have established a
 
00:33:05.389 --> 00:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
combat arms Training Center are in a
 
00:33:09.049 --> 00:33:09.059 align:start position:0%
hostile fire zone so it's all it teaches
 
00:33:12.169 --> 00:33:12.179 align:start position:0%
me and taught me was you know anything
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
that happens in the legislature is
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
relatively easy compared to that uh I I
 
00:33:20.630 --> 00:33:20.640 align:start position:0%
spent my career in healthcare
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
administration I had an opportunity to
 
00:33:25.009 --> 00:33:25.019 align:start position:0%
be on the faculty at Georgetown for a
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
little while
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
I wrote just a textbook chapter on
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
Military telemedicine half my career was
 
00:33:36.529 --> 00:33:36.539 align:start position:0%
in the military half of it was in
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals and medical device
 
00:33:42.649 --> 00:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so so I think I'm in a
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
good spot in terms of my background
 
00:33:48.769 --> 00:33:48.779 align:start position:0%
because it's been combined with being on
 
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight Governor's Commission on
 
00:33:54.649 --> 00:33:54.659 align:start position:0%
alcohol and drug abuse the telemedicine
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
commission and a few other things so so
 
00:33:59.029 --> 00:33:59.039 align:start position:0%
I've been blessed to have kind of a
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
holistic opportunity to to view our
 
00:34:04.430 --> 00:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
State Health Care system so
 
00:34:09.829 --> 00:34:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.290 --> 00:34:12.300 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you Mr chairman I'm

00:34:19.490 --> 00:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
I started out in the military working on
 
00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.290 align:start position:0%
I started out in the military working on

or guys like our chairman
 
00:34:27.770 --> 00:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
and uh you know I didn't like that well
 
00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
I spent probably
 
00:34:32.810 --> 00:34:32.820 align:start position:0%
oh I don't know 10 years or so doing
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
that and I also worked I cross-trained
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
in a crypto which is electronics and
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
that was that was fun
 
00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:41.389 align:start position:0%
that was that was fun
uh

00:34:41.389 --> 00:34:41.399 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:44.930 --> 00:34:44.940 align:start position:0%

00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
business for myself in construction and
 
00:34:52.010 --> 00:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
uh that worked out I'm very active in my
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
town government I've I live on the same
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
property that I grew up on which uh that
 
00:35:00.170 --> 00:35:00.180 align:start position:0%
was 77 years ago give or take
 
00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:02.940 align:start position:0%
but uh going to the uh again to division
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
two I spent this is my seventh term
 
00:35:08.630 --> 00:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
and I spent many uh
 
00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:11.400 align:start position:0%
great days in education with some of you
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:35:15.950 --> 00:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
two terms in education and then the
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
other five terms here in finance uh
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
division two which is uh it's a great
 
00:35:21.890 --> 00:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
place we got good uh
 
00:35:24.710 --> 00:35:24.720 align:start position:0%
we got good budgets for uh great things
 
00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:26.579 align:start position:0%
and uh you know education is probably
 
00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
one of my passions
 
00:35:31.250 --> 00:35:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh I got uh let me see
 
00:35:34.730 --> 00:35:34.740 align:start position:0%
I got nine grandkids four kids
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
and a great wife 55 years worth
 
00:35:41.329 --> 00:35:41.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
thank you all we're missing two people
 
00:35:48.170 --> 00:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh Joe Sweeney and Bill hatch will see
 
00:35:51.050 --> 00:35:51.060 align:start position:0%
them hopefully soon and we'll ask them
 
00:35:54.410 --> 00:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
to introduce themselves a little bit I
 
00:35:56.329 --> 00:35:56.339 align:start position:0%
appreciate all the good backgrounds and
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
especially all the experience on other
 
00:36:00.410 --> 00:36:00.420 align:start position:0%
committees when we get done with the
 
00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
budget I will talk about having Liaisons
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
to the other committees
 
00:36:07.970 --> 00:36:07.980 align:start position:0%
and using your backgrounds I hope you
 
00:36:10.849 --> 00:36:10.859 align:start position:0%
can volunteer for them and if you some
 
00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480 align:start position:0%
people don't want to do any so if you
 
00:36:13.849 --> 00:36:13.859 align:start position:0%
want to do more than one that's fine
 
00:36:16.609 --> 00:36:16.619 align:start position:0%
basically it is to deliver this message
 
00:36:19.730 --> 00:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
we tend to be the bad guys
 
00:36:22.790 --> 00:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
they work on a bill in in the policy
 
00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
committee they think it's wonderful they
 
00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:27.300 align:start position:0%
send it to us it needs a few million
 
00:36:29.390 --> 00:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
dollars and we say no
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
and the message that I hope we can
 
00:36:33.349 --> 00:36:33.359 align:start position:0%
deliver is
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
you know this agency better than any of
 
00:36:36.359 --> 00:36:37.130 align:start position:0%
you know this agency better than any of
us

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:36:37.140 --> 00:36:38.329 align:start position:0%
us
so

00:36:38.329 --> 00:36:38.339 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
if they want to add two new employees or
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
three new employees for some new thing
 
00:36:46.730 --> 00:36:46.740 align:start position:0%
look at the whole agency is there some
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
area they're not working as much as they
 
00:36:51.050 --> 00:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
used to can they take three employees
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
and change them over to the three
 
00:36:55.730 --> 00:36:55.740 align:start position:0%
employees that they're asking for makes
 
00:36:58.310 --> 00:36:58.320 align:start position:0%
our job easier you get to complete the
 
00:37:00.470 --> 00:37:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill we get to be happy that we didn't
 
00:37:02.810 --> 00:37:02.820 align:start position:0%
have to raise new money we can find it
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
within the agency in most cases so if
 
00:37:07.730 --> 00:37:07.740 align:start position:0%
it's a small amount we don't get really
 
00:37:10.490 --> 00:37:10.500 align:start position:0%
upset but the idea is we don't want to
 
00:37:12.829 --> 00:37:12.839 align:start position:0%
be the bad guys we want you to think
 
00:37:15.770 --> 00:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
about the spending within that agency as
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
well as
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
the the things that go on in that agency
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
so now I get the opportunity to
 
00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
introduce the Geniuses that keep this
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
all going and uh Michael Kane is the
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant has been
 
00:37:32.030 --> 00:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
doing it for many years his abled
 
00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:34.260 align:start position:0%

00:37:35.930 --> 00:37:35.940 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:44.940 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler members of the committee
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
um I'll give a quick introduction of our
 
00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
staff you'll be able to meet them and
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
learn a little bit more about them after
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
lunch when they go into the division for
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
the orientation but uh just quick myself
 
00:37:57.650 --> 00:37:57.660 align:start position:0%
my name's Michael Kane I'm the
 
00:37:59.210 --> 00:37:59.220 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistants I've been
 
00:38:02.390 --> 00:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
working with the office of the LBA for
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
since 1999 so this is my beginning my
 
00:38:09.050 --> 00:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
24th year next to me is Chris Shea he's
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
the deputy LBA he's also been working
 
00:38:13.609 --> 00:38:13.619 align:start position:0%
with the LBA in both performance out of
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
capacity as well as the budget division
 
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:17.089 align:start position:0%
capacity as well as the budget division
for

00:38:17.089 --> 00:38:17.099 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:38:20.089 --> 00:38:20.099 align:start position:0%
close to 27 years Chris is it 27 years
 
00:38:22.730 --> 00:38:22.740 align:start position:0%
that was a great guess on my part and
 
00:38:25.190 --> 00:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
then behind me here I have Mike Hoffman
 
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
the senior budget officer who has been
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%

working with state government over 30
years

00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:38:32.030 --> 00:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
both Mike and I started within two weeks
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
every within a week of each other back
 
00:38:37.069 --> 00:38:37.079 align:start position:0%
in 1999 with the LBA Mike has extensive
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
experience with both the legislative
 
00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:41.460 align:start position:0%
branch and the executive branch next to
 
00:38:44.450 --> 00:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
Mike is a new face for the finance
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
committee but not a new face for the
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
legislature Melissa Rollins used to work
 
00:38:49.550 --> 00:38:49.560 align:start position:0%
with Department of Revenue
 
00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:51.180 align:start position:0%
Administration so the members who have
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
been on Waze means have probably heard
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
presentation Melissa has 19 plus years
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
of experience with dra before we're able
 
00:39:01.370 --> 00:39:01.380 align:start position:0%
to get her to come over here with
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
retirement of Nancy the Venus who some
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
of you may remember we lucked upon
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
Melissa looking for a new opportunity
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
she graciously accepted our offer and
 
00:39:13.130 --> 00:39:13.140 align:start position:0%
we're a pleasure to have her
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
then the back row it's a little
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
different story but it's you know we
 
00:39:19.970 --> 00:39:19.980 align:start position:0%
have Mickey landrigan and Mick landergan
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
who is also a senior budget officer Mick
 
00:39:24.530 --> 00:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
has been with probably about 15 years
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
between audit and budget uh been with
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
our office for coming on eight years I
 
00:39:32.270 --> 00:39:32.280 align:start position:0%
believe and uh Kevin Ripple Mickey
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
actually he'll deal with division two
 
00:39:37.130 --> 00:39:37.140 align:start position:0%
Mike and Melissa with division one Kevin
 
00:39:40.730 --> 00:39:40.740 align:start position:0%
Ripple behind us on same face still
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
Kevin he's going to be working with
 
00:39:44.270 --> 00:39:44.280 align:start position:0%
division three he's been with our office
 
00:39:46.490 --> 00:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
for uh 15 years as well between
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
performance audit and the budget
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
division working with the budget
 
00:39:53.410 --> 00:39:53.420 align:start position:0%
division seven plus years so I'm very
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
grateful I get to work with these people
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
they're my friends and family back over
 
00:40:00.829 --> 00:40:00.839 align:start position:0%
in the office it makes it easy coming
 
00:40:02.170 --> 00:40:02.180 align:start position:0%
into work
 
00:40:04.730 --> 00:40:04.740 align:start position:0%
and also it makes it a lot easier for us
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
to work with you and work with the
 
00:40:07.970 --> 00:40:07.980 align:start position:0%
legislature so
 
00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:10.020 align:start position:0%
um if I could leave it at that I'll go
 
00:40:12.349 --> 00:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
right into the orientation I'm glad that
 
00:40:14.390 --> 00:40:14.400 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a division and the
 
00:40:17.510 --> 00:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
performance audits those products are
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
some of the most worthwhile if you're
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
studying an agency it may have been
 
00:40:23.630 --> 00:40:23.640 align:start position:0%
three four five years ago that they did
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
an audit especially if it were a
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
performance audit so if you want to know
 
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
something about that agency get a hold
 
00:40:32.750 --> 00:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
of an audit and read it and it have some
 
00:40:34.430 --> 00:40:34.440 align:start position:0%
a lot of good information about what's
 
00:40:37.609 --> 00:40:37.619 align:start position:0%
going on in that in that department so I
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
really like the output of the audit
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:45.109 --> 00:40:45.119 align:start position:0%
thank you very much and I'll move into
 
00:40:47.329 --> 00:40:47.339 align:start position:0%
the orientation and quickly mention the
 
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:50.460 align:start position:0%
LBA is a non-partisan office we do have
 
00:40:52.490 --> 00:40:52.500 align:start position:0%
about 30 staff split between our budget
 
00:40:54.050 --> 00:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
division which are the people you see
 
00:40:56.150 --> 00:40:56.160 align:start position:0%
here including Pam Ellis who is
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
basically running the operation back
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
over in the State House releasing fiscal
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
notes fiscal impact statements and
 
00:41:03.710 --> 00:41:03.720 align:start position:0%
everything else we ask of our so it's
 
00:41:06.170 --> 00:41:06.180 align:start position:0%
we're very grateful to have Pam working
 
00:41:08.810 --> 00:41:08.820 align:start position:0%
with us as well our audit division we
 
00:41:10.130 --> 00:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
have both performance audits as
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler had mentioned uh
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
which are do perform on it's based on
 
00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
direction from the legislative
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
performance audit oversight committee
 
00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:19.820 align:start position:0%
and we also do our financial audits
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
split evenly right now between 12 and 12
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
between the two who perform your annual
 
00:41:29.630 --> 00:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
Financial reports including the kafir or
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
the act for the annual comprehensive
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
financial report that was just released
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
at the end of December
 
00:41:38.569 --> 00:41:38.579 align:start position:0%
so before you you have a 104 page
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
document which I am not going to go over
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
line by line or Page by Page more of a
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
reference document we put together if
 
00:41:48.430 --> 00:41:48.440 align:start position:0%
you do have some questions it is online
 
00:41:51.170 --> 00:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
if you do leave here and have some
 
00:41:52.609 --> 00:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
questions on some of the things we go
 
00:41:54.470 --> 00:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
over or maybe some of the rsas that may
 
00:41:56.450 --> 00:41:56.460 align:start position:0%
drive some of the activity uh feel free
 
00:41:59.030 --> 00:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
to use this document as well as the one
 
00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:00.190 align:start position:0%
to use this document as well as the one
online

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:00.200 align:start position:0%
online
 
00:42:02.750 --> 00:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
just quickly on page one of the document
 
00:42:05.270 --> 00:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
is just the staff listing I've
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
introduced you to everyone here today
 
00:42:08.810 --> 00:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
along with the numbers where you can
 
00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
reach them as well as your email
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
addresses and my staff has great at
 
00:42:16.010 --> 00:42:16.020 align:start position:0%
returning both voicemail and email so
 
00:42:17.329 --> 00:42:17.339 align:start position:0%
feel free to get in touch with them at
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.170 --> 00:42:24.180 align:start position:0%
as far as we do have a section on common
 
00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
terms to find what's an appropriation
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
what is a class line we'll get into that
 
00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:30.900 align:start position:0%
a little more once we get the budget
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
from the governor but basically right
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
now we're in the end of the fiscal year
 
00:42:39.710 --> 00:42:39.720 align:start position:0%
22 or sorry the biennial 22 and 23
 
00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:41.329 align:start position:0%
22 or sorry the biennial 22 and 23
budget

00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
um we're in the phase of Governor's
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
phase of developing the 24 fiscal year
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 operating budget so as you
 
00:42:52.849 --> 00:42:52.859 align:start position:0%
know the legislature develops the budget
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
almost 18 months before the fiscal year
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
before the fiscal year ends so there's a
 
00:43:00.770 --> 00:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
lot of estimates there's a lot of
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
um predictions and guesses that may or
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
may not come true it is a biennial
 
00:43:06.589 --> 00:43:06.599 align:start position:0%
budget not all states as you know have
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
biennial budgets a lot of them do this
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
every year
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
um I came from Massachusetts where they
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
did a budget every year and probably
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
never finished on time once so for New
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to develop a budget two years
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
out and not open it up and when I say
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
open it up amend the budget many times
 
00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
is a great um
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
it's a great effort by this Committee in
 
00:43:29.990 --> 00:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate finance committee to put a
 
00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
budget together for the next two years
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:37.370 --> 00:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
we have a couple uh just going over into
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
rsa9 rsa9 or the statute that drives uh
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
the budget and it drives the uh what's
 
00:43:45.890 --> 00:43:45.900 align:start position:0%
included uh as well as timelines
 
00:43:47.510 --> 00:43:47.520 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler had mentioned the
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
governor on February 15th uh
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%
required by Statute under RSA on page
 
00:43:56.870 --> 00:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
four under rsa92 is transmit to the
 
00:43:58.510 --> 00:43:58.520 align:start position:0%
legislature a budget
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
and this budget will be released on
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
February 15th the governor will provide
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
a and
 
00:44:07.010 --> 00:44:07.020 align:start position:0%
give a presentation to the full
 
00:44:09.890 --> 00:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
legislature on that date or right around
 
00:44:13.490 --> 00:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
that date and then submit to him hit
 
00:44:15.349 --> 00:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
what the governor believes the state
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
should do for the next two years that is
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
one person's opinion he does work with
 
00:44:24.050 --> 00:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
the agencies as he develops his budget
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of put forward What policies and
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
what funding levels he would like to see
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
over the next two years
 
00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.849 align:start position:0%
over the next two years
uh

00:44:31.849 --> 00:44:31.859 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:37.670 --> 00:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
page five is was added in 2019 but page
 
00:44:40.849 --> 00:44:40.859 align:start position:0%
five is uh nine or say nine two a
 
00:44:43.250 --> 00:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
transmission to the legislature changes
 
00:44:45.170 --> 00:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
to statutory law and this is a reference
 
00:44:47.569 --> 00:44:47.579 align:start position:0%
to uh what chairman Weiler mentioned the
 
00:44:50.510 --> 00:44:50.520 align:start position:0%
trailer bill so the budget itself is a
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
large document uh
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
probably when the governor's budget
 
00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
comes out it'll be over 1200 pages of
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
information with line items uh the
 
00:45:02.329 --> 00:45:02.339 align:start position:0%
Appropriations by the class the class
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
being the uh what's in personnel and the
 
00:45:06.290 --> 00:45:06.300 align:start position:0%
various other
 
00:45:06.300 --> 00:45:07.270 align:start position:0%
various other
um

00:45:07.270 --> 00:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:11.089 --> 00:45:11.099 align:start position:0%
components of of a budget but really a
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
technical document not very user or
 
00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
reader friendly
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
what the legislature usually wait for
 
00:45:21.470 --> 00:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
what the public also likes to see uh
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
what is what are the changes to be made
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
in the trailer build a trailer bill is
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
slowly becoming the size of household
 
00:45:31.849 --> 00:45:31.859 align:start position:0%
one because there are many policy
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
changes statutory changes that are put
 
00:45:36.050 --> 00:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
into the trailer Bill the reason for
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
that is because the Constitution does
 
00:45:40.550 --> 00:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
not allow the budget Bill itself to
 
00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
include changes to statutory law it can
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
only deal with the budget the
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
Appropriations themselves you'll see
 
00:45:49.849 --> 00:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
things called footnotes which might
 
00:45:52.190 --> 00:45:52.200 align:start position:0%
provide additional direction to the
 
00:45:54.290 --> 00:45:54.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations contained in the bill but
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
none of them changed statutory law if
 
00:45:58.849 --> 00:45:58.859 align:start position:0%
anything comes overs or is you know even
 
00:46:00.470 --> 00:46:00.480 align:start position:0%
from the governor is introduced or maybe
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
from an agency we make sure that any
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
statutory changes or any legal Law
 
00:46:08.329 --> 00:46:08.339 align:start position:0%
changes are put into the trail will be
 
00:46:11.109 --> 00:46:11.119 align:start position:0%
able to remain in compliance with the
 
00:46:14.210 --> 00:46:14.220 align:start position:0%
Constitutional requirement
 
00:46:16.670 --> 00:46:16.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to skim over a couple of these
 
00:46:19.609 --> 00:46:19.619 align:start position:0%
rsas and really just jump to um
 
00:46:22.990 --> 00:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
a few on page 11.
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
you'll hear the question is there a
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
constitutional requirement to balance
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
the budget for New Hampshire the
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
balanced budget and technically no but
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
there is a statutory requirement under
 
00:46:35.210 --> 00:46:35.220 align:start position:0%
RSA 98b the adoption of the operating
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
budget in summary that the estimated
 
00:46:42.470 --> 00:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
revenues should be sufficient to fund
 
00:46:44.569 --> 00:46:44.579 align:start position:0%
the estimated or the recommended
 
00:46:47.210 --> 00:46:47.220 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for the budget and the
 
00:46:51.530 --> 00:46:51.540 align:start position:0%
last sentence uh in on RSA 98b is one
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
that you'll hear or be discussed
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
throughout the whole process nothing
 
00:46:57.950 --> 00:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
contained here in shall prohibit the use
 
00:46:59.870 --> 00:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
of projected lapses in determining
 
00:47:02.050 --> 00:47:02.060 align:start position:0%
compliance with the section
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
very quickly a lapse is basically an
 
00:47:06.410 --> 00:47:06.420 align:start position:0%
unspent appropriation as I stated
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
previously the budget is developed
 
00:47:10.010 --> 00:47:10.020 align:start position:0%
almost uh
 
00:47:12.670 --> 00:47:12.680 align:start position:0%
two years in advance before the final
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
obviously there's a lot of estimates on
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
Personnel there's a lot of changes in
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
Personnel people come and go retire
 
00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:22.930 align:start position:0%
Personnel people come and go retire
leave

00:47:22.930 --> 00:47:22.940 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
we also have estimates on maybe Medicaid
 
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:27.920 align:start position:0%
case loads or other caseload information
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
that the you know over the next several
 
00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
months will change and as a result that
 
00:47:36.530 --> 00:47:36.540 align:start position:0%
does leave some unspent Appropriations
 
00:47:38.930 --> 00:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
so historically when I'll get to a
 
00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:40.500 align:start position:0%
surplus statement a little later in this
 
00:47:43.069 --> 00:47:43.079 align:start position:0%
document but when the balance budget is
 
00:47:44.990 --> 00:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
proposed by the governor you'll see a
 
00:47:47.089 --> 00:47:47.099 align:start position:0%
line on there which is a lapse what's
 
00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
the lapse amount and basically it will
 
00:47:53.089 --> 00:47:53.099 align:start position:0%
be an amount that the governor assumes
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
based on historic lapse figures or what
 
00:47:59.170 --> 00:47:59.180 align:start position:0%
he knows he's put into the budget
 
00:48:02.089 --> 00:48:02.099 align:start position:0%
what may not be spent by the end of the
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
year and the reason that lapse is there
 
00:48:06.050 --> 00:48:06.060 align:start position:0%
it does give the current sitting
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
legislature and Governor the ability to
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
direct where that lapse goes absent
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
budgeted at a lapse if the lapse wasn't
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
budgeted and just occurred naturally
 
00:48:14.930 --> 00:48:14.940 align:start position:0%
that would be additional funds that
 
00:48:16.609 --> 00:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
would sit up there for the legislature
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
to make a determination at a ladder
 
00:48:20.270 --> 00:48:20.280 align:start position:0%
point to either go into the rainy day
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
fund or to be used for another purpose
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
when you're developing a budget for two
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
years that lapse does give the
 
00:48:27.490 --> 00:48:27.500 align:start position:0%
legislature some flexibility to maybe
 
00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:29.940 align:start position:0%
directing that to where your priorities
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
are when you pass the budget but that
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
will be discussed we'll be interested to
 
00:48:36.770 --> 00:48:36.780 align:start position:0%
see what the governor comes out in the
 
00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
next month what he comes out with the
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
lapse estimates but historically it's
 
00:48:43.069 --> 00:48:43.079 align:start position:0%
been about 60 to 80 million dollars a
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
year of a general fund lapse and we're
 
00:48:48.950 --> 00:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
talking about you know 3.6 3.7 billion
 
00:48:51.290 --> 00:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
dollars in general funds a year so not a
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
large amount it's usually lower than to
 
00:48:55.910 --> 00:48:55.920 align:start position:0%
three percent but it is an amount a
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
chunk of change that the this current
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
sitting legislature can decide what they
 
00:49:01.970 --> 00:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
want to do if it happens
 
00:49:05.450 --> 00:49:05.460 align:start position:0%
and that is a just to kind of further on
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
the laps that's just an estimate it's
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
not a statutory required amount to hit
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
it is uh needed necessary in order to
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
balance the budget and the executive
 
00:49:15.890 --> 00:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
branch takes the full responsibility for
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
ensuring that the state hits that lapse
 
00:49:19.190 --> 00:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
amount to ensure there's a balanced
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
budget as is there um
 
00:49:23.630 --> 00:49:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's basically that's their duty to
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
make sure that it does end in the
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
balanced budget Mr chairman may ask a
 
00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.730 align:start position:0%
balanced budget Mr chairman may ask a
question

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
yes question yes thank you Mr chair
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
um have we ever gone back and looked at
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
the last five budgets or something to
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
see have how close the lapse estimates
 
00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:40.740 align:start position:0%
have been to what the actual lapse was
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
two years later
 
00:49:46.250 --> 00:49:46.260 align:start position:0%
yes and we do have I can put uh share
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
that history with the committee but we
 
00:49:49.069 --> 00:49:49.079 align:start position:0%
do have a history of what the estimates
 
00:49:52.309 --> 00:49:52.319 align:start position:0%
were in the past it was I'd say within
 
00:49:55.430 --> 00:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
the last previous to five years ago we'd
 
00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
usually be pretty close you'd be getting
 
00:49:59.089 --> 00:49:59.099 align:start position:0%
pretty close to that lapse Mountain
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's it beginning in uh fiscal year 19
 
00:50:06.109 --> 00:50:06.119 align:start position:0%
maybe we've been exceeding that lapse by
 
00:50:07.910 --> 00:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes a hundred percent
 
00:50:09.950 --> 00:50:09.960 align:start position:0%
where you'd have a hundred million
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
dollar lapse in one year when you
 
00:50:13.130 --> 00:50:13.140 align:start position:0%
estimated 50 million a lot of that
 
00:50:14.750 --> 00:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
having to do with the vacancies there's
 
00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
a high vacancy rate state employees uh
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
they're slow filling those vacancies as
 
00:50:22.849 --> 00:50:22.859 align:start position:0%
well as other Trends going down
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
um in other areas of the budget uh two
 
00:50:27.349 --> 00:50:27.359 align:start position:0%
years ago we exceeded the lapse by
 
00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
almost 100 million dollars uh this past
 
00:50:31.970 --> 00:50:31.980 align:start position:0%
year we exceeded this past year that
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
just closed fiscal year 22 it was
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
assumed 64 million dollar lapse we came
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
in at 104 million so over 40 million
 
00:50:41.870 --> 00:50:41.880 align:start position:0%
dollars and so yes as the uh house
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
finance committee develops that that is
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
information that we will share
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
information that you will go over and
 
00:50:49.130 --> 00:50:49.140 align:start position:0%
talk with your agencies talk with the
 
00:50:51.290 --> 00:50:51.300 align:start position:0%
governor and as budget director on why
 
00:50:52.730 --> 00:50:52.740 align:start position:0%
they came up with the laps that they
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
came up with when historically we've
 
00:50:56.089 --> 00:50:56.099 align:start position:0%
been hitting these certain amounts so we
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:01.500 --> 00:51:06.109 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.069 --> 00:51:09.079 align:start position:0%
so if I were to go to page 14 is another
 
00:51:12.770 --> 00:51:12.780 align:start position:0%
RSA 913e the revenue stabilization
 
00:51:14.809 --> 00:51:14.819 align:start position:0%
Reserve account otherwise known as the
 
00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:16.559 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund
 
00:51:19.549 --> 00:51:19.559 align:start position:0%
so at the end of each biennium so at the
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
end of each odd number year any surplus
 
00:51:23.569 --> 00:51:23.579 align:start position:0%
remaining in the journal fund is
 
00:51:26.210 --> 00:51:26.220 align:start position:0%
deposited into the rainy day fund unless
 
00:51:27.950 --> 00:51:27.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise directed by the legislature
 
00:51:29.930 --> 00:51:29.940 align:start position:0%
that is something that you're going to
 
00:51:32.030 --> 00:51:32.040 align:start position:0%
discuss uh with the budget that comes
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
out from the governor wouldn't want the
 
00:51:35.990 --> 00:51:36.000 align:start position:0%
House and Senate propose over the next
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
few months by Statute that rainy day
 
00:51:39.119 --> 00:51:40.270 align:start position:0%
few months by Statute that rainy day
fund

00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
cannot exceed two years of general fund
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenues plus any amount
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
that has gone into the rainy day fund
 
00:51:50.569 --> 00:51:50.579 align:start position:0%
from settlements uh from the EG gets
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
settlements the big Exxon Mobil
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
settlement a while ago the Monsanto
 
00:51:57.170 --> 00:51:57.180 align:start position:0%
settlement that came through 10 of those
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
large settlement amounts go into the
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund so it's a 30 plus million
 
00:52:03.290 --> 00:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
dollars in the rainy day fund just from
 
00:52:06.290 --> 00:52:06.300 align:start position:0%
settlements but in total at no point in
 
00:52:09.530 --> 00:52:09.540 align:start position:0%
time can the legislature right now based
 
00:52:10.849 --> 00:52:10.859 align:start position:0%
on the current law that was just past
 
00:52:12.770 --> 00:52:12.780 align:start position:0%
two years ago can exceed two years the
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
general fund under restricted revenues
 
00:52:16.849 --> 00:52:16.859 align:start position:0%
ballpark because we're currently in the
 
00:52:19.309 --> 00:52:19.319 align:start position:0%
last uh year of the biennium of 20 three
 
00:52:22.609 --> 00:52:22.619 align:start position:0%
ballparks about 400 million dollars in
 
00:52:25.069 --> 00:52:25.079 align:start position:0%
which we are not at now and I'll get
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
into where we are right now but the
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
other thing to consider in the rainy day
 
00:52:31.730 --> 00:52:31.740 align:start position:0%
fund is it is a um it's going to be a
 
00:52:33.890 --> 00:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
discussion that the leadership has in
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
both the house and the Senate and the
 
00:52:36.710 --> 00:52:36.720 align:start position:0%
governor have and where they're
 
00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:37.970 align:start position:0%
governor have and where they're
comfortable

00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:37.980 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
00:52:39.530 --> 00:52:39.540 align:start position:0%
um with that rep where they're
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
comfortable with having a rainy day fund
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
balance it's not necessarily what
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
outside organizations may say is a good
 
00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh buffer to have against a downturn
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
um it's what do you what do all of you
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable with because it is a you
 
00:52:56.630 --> 00:52:56.640 align:start position:0%
know close to almost a half a billion
 
00:52:59.030 --> 00:52:59.040 align:start position:0%
dollars if you hit the cap that is
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
either being collected in taxes that
 
00:53:04.010 --> 00:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
aren't being used or it is not being
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
used for other services and based on the
 
00:53:08.210 --> 00:53:08.220 align:start position:0%
emails you're probably receiving already
 
00:53:10.010 --> 00:53:10.020 align:start position:0%
you know there's a lot of requests out
 
00:53:12.049 --> 00:53:12.059 align:start position:0%
there and ideas on on what's a
 
00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:13.800 align:start position:0%
comfortable level so it really is a
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
discussion overall discussion if I were
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
to look back in the last couple years
 
00:53:19.549 --> 00:53:19.559 align:start position:0%
that figure has been about 100 150
 
00:53:21.530 --> 00:53:21.540 align:start position:0%
million dollars is it previous
 
00:53:24.290 --> 00:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
legislatures have been happy so what
 
00:53:25.730 --> 00:53:25.740 align:start position:0%
will happen is when you're developing
 
00:53:28.730 --> 00:53:28.740 align:start position:0%
the budget for 24.25 if the revenues
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
continue to come in how are they're
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
coming in right now which is 200 million
 
00:53:32.339 --> 00:53:33.349 align:start position:0%
coming in right now which is 200 million
dollars

00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:53:36.109 --> 00:53:36.119 align:start position:0%
over the actual Revenue plan
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
um there'll be a discussion in the
 
00:53:39.109 --> 00:53:39.119 align:start position:0%
legislature over the next few months of
 
00:53:41.450 --> 00:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
how much of that you want to go into the
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
rainy day fund and how much you want to
 
00:53:46.370 --> 00:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
use for maybe one time uh areas one-time
 
00:53:50.270 --> 00:53:50.280 align:start position:0%
projects which has happened and I do
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
just want to mention that although there
 
00:53:52.140 --> 00:53:52.990 align:start position:0%
just want to mention that although there
is

00:53:52.990 --> 00:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:53:55.609 --> 00:53:55.619 align:start position:0%
requirements about two-thirds to be used
 
00:53:58.490 --> 00:53:58.500 align:start position:0%
money from the rainy day fund uh there
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
have been since I've been here
 
00:54:03.530 --> 00:54:03.540 align:start position:0%
suspensions of this RSA 913e for the
 
00:54:05.089 --> 00:54:05.099 align:start position:0%
last several
 
00:54:05.099 --> 00:54:06.410 align:start position:0%
last several
um

00:54:06.410 --> 00:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
mostly every budget since I've been here
 
00:54:11.569 --> 00:54:11.579 align:start position:0%
and what that allows is the uh the gov
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the governor to
 
00:54:15.470 --> 00:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
determine how much they should put in
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
there based on what they're hearing uh
 
00:54:18.890 --> 00:54:18.900 align:start position:0%
from everyone that you talk to during
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
the development of the budget
 
00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.650 align:start position:0%
the development of the budget
so

00:54:23.650 --> 00:54:23.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
there are a couple other transfer
 
00:54:27.290 --> 00:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
Provisions that are relative to the
 
00:54:30.130 --> 00:54:30.140 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee as we go through rsa9
 
00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:32.579 align:start position:0%
and then a couple other
 
00:54:32.579 --> 00:54:34.790 align:start position:0%
and then a couple other
um

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.069 --> 00:54:37.079 align:start position:0%
areas that we probably won't you know
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
you as a finance committee won't have to
 
00:54:40.970 --> 00:54:40.980 align:start position:0%
deal with but we did want to put all of
 
00:54:46.370 --> 00:54:46.380 align:start position:0%
our say 9 in there on page 22 is uh
 
00:54:49.430 --> 00:54:49.440 align:start position:0%
these are the deadlines for the 2023
 
00:54:49.440 --> 00:54:50.569 align:start position:0%
these are the deadlines for the 2023
session

00:54:50.569 --> 00:54:50.579 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
um and as representative Wilder
 
00:54:54.410 --> 00:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
mentioned six weeks for the house to
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
develop a budget that's compared to the
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
Senate who has basically the month of
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
April in May to develop their budget
 
00:55:04.010 --> 00:55:04.020 align:start position:0%
um so the house the task of the house
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
finance committee is a large task
 
00:55:09.230 --> 00:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
um a very complicated Cask in a tight
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
time frame six weeks sounds like a long
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
time but considering we're already on
 
00:55:14.990 --> 00:55:15.000 align:start position:0%
January 18th we're waiting for the
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
Governor's budget to be released on
 
00:55:18.950 --> 00:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
February 15th the turnaround is going to
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
be almost about a month as you start to
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
make all your decisions to start
 
00:55:25.670 --> 00:55:25.680 align:start position:0%
drafting your changes to House Bill 2 to
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
start at getting that information back
 
00:55:29.829 --> 00:55:29.839 align:start position:0%
from the agencies to make the decisions
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
you want to make relative to The house's
 
00:55:35.510 --> 00:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
position on the budget so just the two I
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
would highlight is the Thursday March
 
00:55:39.589 --> 00:55:39.599 align:start position:0%
30th being the last day to report all
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
remaining house bills that would include
 
00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.099 align:start position:0%
the budget under these deadlines and
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
what that means is that earlier in that
 
00:55:47.329 --> 00:55:47.339 align:start position:0%
week that's a third Thursday early in
 
00:55:49.069 --> 00:55:49.079 align:start position:0%
that week Monday and Tuesday's divisions
 
00:55:51.410 --> 00:55:51.420 align:start position:0%
will be presenting their recommendations
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
to the full committee so that the full
 
00:55:55.130 --> 00:55:55.140 align:start position:0%
committee can vote on what division one
 
00:55:58.010 --> 00:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
two and three are proposing and if we
 
00:55:59.569 --> 00:55:59.579 align:start position:0%
back up the weekend prior that means
 
00:56:01.849 --> 00:56:01.859 align:start position:0%
division is really will be wrapping up
 
00:56:04.190 --> 00:56:04.200 align:start position:0%
their work right around March 23rd March
 
00:56:07.549 --> 00:56:07.559 align:start position:0%
24th in order to allow time to put the
 
00:56:09.230 --> 00:56:09.240 align:start position:0%
documents together to present to the
 
00:56:10.730 --> 00:56:10.740 align:start position:0%
full finance committee for their final
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
vote obviously deadlines can change but
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
right now these are the deadlines that
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at
 
00:56:20.990 --> 00:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
and if we turn over to page 23
 
00:56:22.910 --> 00:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
um the Senate now the Senate will be
 
00:56:24.410 --> 00:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
watching everything the house is doing
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
so as much as they're not going to
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
receive the document from the house
 
00:56:30.170 --> 00:56:30.180 align:start position:0%
until the beginning of April they
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
usually do participate uh just by
 
00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
watching not asking questions but by
 
00:56:36.230 --> 00:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
watching what the divisions are doing
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
what are the divisions talking about
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
senates also having conversations with
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
the agencies conversations with the
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
governors during that time so by the
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
time they get the budget in
 
00:56:49.790 --> 00:56:49.800 align:start position:0%
um April they have a pretty good idea
 
00:56:52.970 --> 00:56:52.980 align:start position:0%
after the presentations by the finance
 
00:56:55.870 --> 00:56:55.880 align:start position:0%
chairs of what's in the house budget
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
they also the Senate I would point out
 
00:57:01.849 --> 00:57:01.859 align:start position:0%
the Senate has the benefit of
 
00:57:05.210 --> 00:57:05.220 align:start position:0%
two huge Revenue months for the State of
 
00:57:07.549 --> 00:57:07.559 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire March and April a big
 
00:57:09.490 --> 00:57:09.500 align:start position:0%
Revenue collection months
 
00:57:11.809 --> 00:57:11.819 align:start position:0%
what the house Ways and Means Committee
 
00:57:13.490 --> 00:57:13.500 align:start position:0%
Chris works with the house Wheezy means
 
00:57:16.430 --> 00:57:16.440 align:start position:0%
committee so over the next few weeks and
 
00:57:18.049 --> 00:57:18.059 align:start position:0%
I think usually around the beginning of
 
00:57:20.030 --> 00:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
March you'll get some idea of where the
 
00:57:22.790 --> 00:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
house believes revenues will go the
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
difficulty in estimating revenues is
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
that March is such a large month for a
 
00:57:29.450 --> 00:57:29.460 align:start position:0%
revenue collection that weighs and means
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
really has to use uh historical data in
 
00:57:34.670 --> 00:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
individual meetings with agencies to
 
00:57:36.710 --> 00:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
determine where they think revenues will
 
00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:39.420 align:start position:0%
be those revenues will be communicated
 
00:57:41.390 --> 00:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
with the chair of house finance with the
 
00:57:43.609 --> 00:57:43.619 align:start position:0%
division shares with all the members and
 
00:57:45.530 --> 00:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
that will be kind of the target for the
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
house finance committee to use when they
 
00:57:50.690 --> 00:57:50.700 align:start position:0%
develop the budget when the Senate
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
receives the budget they wait they find
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
out what happens at the end of they'll
 
00:57:55.849 --> 00:57:55.859 align:start position:0%
know what happened at the end of March
 
00:57:58.370 --> 00:57:58.380 align:start position:0%
usually by the first week of April but
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
they wait to see how April will end
 
00:58:01.790 --> 00:58:01.800 align:start position:0%
they'll have meetings with the agency
 
00:58:04.010 --> 00:58:04.020 align:start position:0%
he's kind of bring them up to speed on
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
what they asked the governor and didn't
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
receive what they asked the house and
 
00:58:08.930 --> 00:58:08.940 align:start position:0%
didn't receive or vice versa what they
 
00:58:11.930 --> 00:58:11.940 align:start position:0%
did receive and maybe didn't request but
 
00:58:14.270 --> 00:58:14.280 align:start position:0%
they'll use that month of April kind of
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
an information gathering and then once
 
00:58:18.770 --> 00:58:18.780 align:start position:0%
the revenues come in at the end of April
 
00:58:20.569 --> 00:58:20.579 align:start position:0%
on the first week in May they'll have a
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
better idea of where revenues will go
 
00:58:23.690 --> 00:58:23.700 align:start position:0%
and they'll start to make a lot of their
 
00:58:26.150 --> 00:58:26.160 align:start position:0%
large decisions uh in the month of May
 
00:58:29.510 --> 00:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
usually prior to Memorial Day is when
 
00:58:31.250 --> 00:58:31.260 align:start position:0%
the Senate has a good plan or where they
 
00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
want to end up and again Senate very
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
open process as well so the house
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
finance committee members are watching
 
00:58:40.190 --> 00:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
what the Senate is either asking us on
 
00:58:41.809 --> 00:58:41.819 align:start position:0%
what the Senate's doing what the budget
 
00:58:42.890 --> 00:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
and we're just keeping that
 
00:58:45.109 --> 00:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
communication knowing in the end that
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
they'll have to be a resolution of any
 
00:58:49.789 --> 00:58:49.799 align:start position:0%
differences between the house and the
 
00:58:51.470 --> 00:58:51.480 align:start position:0%
Senate budget
 
00:58:54.410 --> 00:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
that's what gets me to page 24 which is
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
a a kind of a chart of the operating
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
budget process and
 
00:59:04.270 --> 00:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the tarp part usually works
 
00:59:06.890 --> 00:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
pretty consistent with what you see here
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
but over the last few budgets I don't
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
think it's been as easy as submission to
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
the governor in passing uh there have
 
00:59:14.569 --> 00:59:14.579 align:start position:0%
been some vetoes couple vetoes in the
 
00:59:16.250 --> 00:59:16.260 align:start position:0%
past there have been instances where the
 
00:59:19.190 --> 00:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
house uh had was unable to pass a budget
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
but then able to adopt a committee a
 
00:59:22.370 --> 00:59:22.380 align:start position:0%
conference budget with continued
 
00:59:24.349 --> 00:59:24.359 align:start position:0%
negotiations with the Senate during the
 
00:59:27.049 --> 00:59:27.059 align:start position:0%
development to theirs but in general the
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
agency phase began almost a year ago the
 
00:59:32.270 --> 00:59:32.280 align:start position:0%
agency phase being agencies start to
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
enter into the budget system the state
 
00:59:37.250 --> 00:59:37.260 align:start position:0%
budget system uh the number of employees
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
where they think the current required
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
programs should be funded in the next
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
two years over the next from March
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
through October they're working to enter
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
that information into the system to
 
00:59:51.470 --> 00:59:51.480 align:start position:0%
adjust based on any statutory change
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
that may be signed by the governor
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
passed by the legislature before that
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
time and then in October and October 1st
 
00:59:59.690 --> 00:59:59.700 align:start position:0%
released the agency budget request which
 
01:00:03.289 --> 01:00:03.299 align:start position:0%
are online uh significant documents we
 
01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:04.920 align:start position:0%
did post them on our website it's easy
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
to find certain things with just a
 
01:00:09.470 --> 01:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
control F on the document as opposed to
 
01:00:12.710 --> 01:00:12.720 align:start position:0%
a box full of paper with those documents
 
01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
which is very hard to find but basically
 
01:00:17.809 --> 01:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
what you'll find in there is your your
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
efficiency budget which is what to
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
continue operations and meet the
 
01:00:23.890 --> 01:00:23.900 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements right now
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
and also your additional prioritized
 
01:00:29.569 --> 01:00:29.579 align:start position:0%
needs which is above and beyond what is
 
01:00:32.510 --> 01:00:32.520 align:start position:0%
required by Statute at this point the
 
01:00:34.789 --> 01:00:34.799 align:start position:0%
governor's phases right now and the
 
01:00:36.829 --> 01:00:36.839 align:start position:0%
governor has until February 15th and
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
we'll use every minute working with the
 
01:00:42.349 --> 01:00:42.359 align:start position:0%
agencies back and forth
 
01:00:44.210 --> 01:00:44.220 align:start position:0%
try different things you know he the
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
governor's working on his estimates
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
right now with the various agencies the
 
01:00:50.030 --> 01:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
area being the largest one and that's
 
01:00:51.710 --> 01:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
also impacting his discussions he's
 
01:00:54.410 --> 01:00:54.420 align:start position:0%
having with HHS that might have half a
 
01:00:56.270 --> 01:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
billion dollars worth of requests for
 
01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:57.540 align:start position:0%
other types of things that have been
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
requested remember they think they
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
should do as long as other agencies
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
um treasury you'll see in the agency
 
01:01:05.390 --> 01:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
budget request almost 100 million
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
dollars roughly between the two years
 
01:01:08.450 --> 01:01:08.460 align:start position:0%
and that really has to do with the
 
01:01:10.130 --> 01:01:10.140 align:start position:0%
revenue sharing that's suspended every
 
01:01:12.410 --> 01:01:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh two years but the governor is going
 
01:01:14.930 --> 01:01:14.940 align:start position:0%
through all that and having discussions
 
01:01:17.270 --> 01:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
with the agency so that on February 15th
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
they can present to you where he thinks
 
01:01:23.150 --> 01:01:23.160 align:start position:0%
uh his recommended budget for the next
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
two years in addition to that typically
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
you receive the document the budget
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
document House Bill one on February 15th
 
01:01:33.890 --> 01:01:33.900 align:start position:0%
OLS legislative services will receive on
 
01:01:36.049 --> 01:01:36.059 align:start position:0%
February 15th the two years ago since it
 
01:01:37.490 --> 01:01:37.500 align:start position:0%
is has only been two years since
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
required they'll receive the draft
 
01:01:42.170 --> 01:01:42.180 align:start position:0%
document for House Bill 2. uh House Bill
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
2 being the trailer Bill and it usually
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
takes OLS about a week week and a half
 
01:01:47.569 --> 01:01:47.579 align:start position:0%
sometimes two weeks depending on how
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
large to put that into Bill format now
 
01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:52.319 align:start position:0%
you'll be meeting with the agencies in
 
01:01:53.990 --> 01:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
the meantime asking them what is
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill to what is proposed by the
 
01:01:57.770 --> 01:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
governor because all of that's going to
 
01:02:00.470 --> 01:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
be kind of show its um
 
01:02:02.390 --> 01:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
but basically introduce itself on the
 
01:02:04.730 --> 01:02:04.740 align:start position:0%
governor's Surplus statement uh as well
 
01:02:06.589 --> 01:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
as the agency budget so you'll have a
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
sense of what's in-house Bill too you
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
just won't see the actual wording until
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
usually the beginning right before the
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
beginning of March you'll get that
 
01:02:13.799 --> 01:02:15.109 align:start position:0%
beginning of March you'll get that
document

01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:02:16.730 --> 01:02:16.740 align:start position:0%
um and again this is something that
 
01:02:18.650 --> 01:02:18.660 align:start position:0%
started off in one or two sections and
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
it's slowly over time morphed into a
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
larger document 300 plus sections for
 
01:02:27.289 --> 01:02:27.299 align:start position:0%
various reasons one of the main reasons
 
01:02:27.299 --> 01:02:28.450 align:start position:0%
various reasons one of the main reasons
is

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:28.460 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:02:30.890 --> 01:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
yes it does start off pretty big from
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
the governor coming over but there's
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
almost a thousand pieces of legislation
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
that will go through the House and
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
Senate this year and we'll maybe stall
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
at one point it may have a cost in the
 
01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh where you'll have it in finance
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
committee and decide to hold on uh
 
01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:48.960 align:start position:0%
policy committee has recommended the
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
policy but you're going to see if it
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
fits into the budget and so you wait and
 
01:02:55.010 --> 01:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
maybe you decide to put it at the house
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
bill too so that you have the funding
 
01:02:58.549 --> 01:02:58.559 align:start position:0%
necessary to implement that policy
 
01:03:01.250 --> 01:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
change that you want as as well as there
 
01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:02.880 align:start position:0%
may be some bills that the house is
 
01:03:04.910 --> 01:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
prioritized as this is a bit this is
 
01:03:07.250 --> 01:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
priority of the house and if it stalls
 
01:03:08.630 --> 01:03:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the Senate well maybe that's
 
01:03:10.789 --> 01:03:10.799 align:start position:0%
something that the house wants to put
 
01:03:12.650 --> 01:03:12.660 align:start position:0%
into House Bill 2 to keep a position
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
alive during a committee conference and
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
at least have that discussion with the
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
Senate when that comes the Senate does
 
01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:19.440 align:start position:0%
the same thing they're watching their
 
01:03:21.770 --> 01:03:21.780 align:start position:0%
Senate bills after crossover what goes
 
01:03:23.329 --> 01:03:23.339 align:start position:0%
into the house what passes what's
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
amended and then maybe they work their
 
01:03:28.789 --> 01:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
way if it has everything's related to
 
01:03:31.609 --> 01:03:31.619 align:start position:0%
the budget so it can be anything really
 
01:03:31.619 --> 01:03:32.210 align:start position:0%
the budget so it can be anything really
um

01:03:32.210 --> 01:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
but there is usually some Nexus with the
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
next two years and with the budget so
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
you'll see House Bill 2 over the uh
 
01:03:41.510 --> 01:03:41.520 align:start position:0%
growing sometimes the largest parts of
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 over half have to do with
 
01:03:45.950 --> 01:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
either reorganization or combination of
 
01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:48.660 align:start position:0%
statutes not the actual policy changes
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
or the two or three paragraphs but the
 
01:03:52.970 --> 01:03:52.980 align:start position:0%
larger ones so
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
I think representative Edwards question
 
01:04:00.049 --> 01:04:00.059 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I you touched on this
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
a little bit but I've been trying to
 
01:04:03.530 --> 01:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
figure this out
 
01:04:07.250 --> 01:04:07.260 align:start position:0%
um uh lapsing versus non-lapsing if if
 
01:04:09.770 --> 01:04:09.780 align:start position:0%
as we're approaching the end of the
 
01:04:12.170 --> 01:04:12.180 align:start position:0%
two-year budget and there are monies
 
01:04:15.950 --> 01:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
that you're projecting for lapses uh I
 
01:04:18.829 --> 01:04:18.839 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say that those funds
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
could potentially be re-budgeted or
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
reprogrammed and spent in some in some
 
01:04:27.650 --> 01:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
other way that I what what I've been
 
01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
trying to recall is is the vehicle for
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
doing that because OLS is closed to us
 
01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:36.530 align:start position:0%
so how do we deep into
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:37.730 align:start position:0%
so how do we deep into
[Music]

01:04:37.730 --> 01:04:37.740 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:41.210 --> 01:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
um our term uh submit any legislation
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
that would authorize spending elsewhere
 
01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:47.339 align:start position:0%
yeah some of that will find its way
 
01:04:51.049 --> 01:04:51.059 align:start position:0%
into house bill 2. so as you go through
 
01:04:53.750 --> 01:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
this current fiscal year
 
01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:54.530 align:start position:0%
this current fiscal year
um

01:04:54.530 --> 01:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:56.150 --> 01:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
you'll have until March at least through
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
the end of March
 
01:04:59.510 --> 01:04:59.520 align:start position:0%
if the agencies are forthcoming which
 
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:01.020 align:start position:0%
what they think will elapse you could
 
01:05:02.750 --> 01:05:02.760 align:start position:0%
put Appropriations from the current
 
01:05:05.270 --> 01:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year into House Bill 2 and that
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
you've seen that in the past a few of
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
the past budgets where you appropriate
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
current year projected surplus funds be
 
01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
it from lapse of revenue for the current
 
01:05:16.329 --> 01:05:16.339 align:start position:0%
year and that's how you address that
 
01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:19.859 align:start position:0%
during a normal so during the 2022
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
session a lot of the there were a lot of
 
01:05:24.890 --> 01:05:24.900 align:start position:0%
legislative specials 300 plus million
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
dollars of legislative specials
 
01:05:30.109 --> 01:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
really based on the revenue Surplus
 
01:05:32.030 --> 01:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
versus the lapse the lapse amount
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
compared to the revenue Surplus we have
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
has been small but it still plays into
 
01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:38.760 align:start position:0%
that pot so either through House Bill 2
 
01:05:40.190 --> 01:05:40.200 align:start position:0%
or a legislative especially in the
 
01:05:42.470 --> 01:05:42.480 align:start position:0%
second year of the session is how any of
 
01:05:43.910 --> 01:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
those additional dollars that haven't
 
01:05:46.010 --> 01:05:46.020 align:start position:0%
already been uh authorized or
 
01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:52.849 --> 01:05:52.859 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
um legislative specials where where does
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
that come from where who gets to craft
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
that bill for a legislative special
 
01:06:05.089 --> 01:06:05.099 align:start position:0%
any legislator
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
um you'll see legislative specials that
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
are introduced into the Senate
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
individually for instance
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
um seven and a half percent uh
 
01:06:16.010 --> 01:06:16.020 align:start position:0%
contribution to Municipal Retirement and
 
01:06:19.030 --> 01:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
22 was a 26 million dollar appropriation
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to keep things going
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to make sure that OLS
 
01:06:27.109 --> 01:06:27.119 align:start position:0%
actually supports those because because
 
01:06:30.049 --> 01:06:30.059 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can be the the roadblock
 
01:06:31.910 --> 01:06:31.920 align:start position:0%
to say no we're not doing any more work
 
01:06:34.430 --> 01:06:34.440 align:start position:0%
for you yes so you might be past your
 
01:06:37.370 --> 01:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
deadline to introduce new legislative uh
 
01:06:40.730 --> 01:06:40.740 align:start position:0%
new legislation but a way not a way
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
around that but of a way in the process
 
01:06:44.450 --> 01:06:44.460 align:start position:0%
is to amend a bill that might be before
 
01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
you where you could put even though you
 
01:06:47.990 --> 01:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
don't have a chance to introduce a new
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
bill you could add an amendment onto
 
01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
another bill so one more follow-up
 
01:06:57.470 --> 01:06:57.480 align:start position:0%
I I anecdotally think I have noticed a
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
trend towards asking that more and more
 
01:07:02.930 --> 01:07:02.940 align:start position:0%
of the budget uh be converted over to
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing versus lapsing have you
 
01:07:07.549 --> 01:07:07.559 align:start position:0%
picked up on a trend is that my
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
imagination or is that real
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
and and if it is real how significant is
 
01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:14.029 align:start position:0%
and and if it is real how significant is
it

01:07:14.029 --> 01:07:14.039 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:07:16.970 --> 01:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
um it is real uh it tends to happen in
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
division three
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
um in Health and Human Services more
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
than any because they do have some
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
caseload uh and eligibility entitlement
 
01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:25.730 align:start position:0%
caseload uh and eligibility entitlement
programs

01:07:25.730 --> 01:07:25.740 align:start position:0%
programs
 
01:07:28.910 --> 01:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
um agencies may ask a lot for
 
01:07:32.510 --> 01:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing but um
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
it's it's uh I would say they would
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
rather make sure they meet their lapse
 
01:07:40.370 --> 01:07:40.380 align:start position:0%
estimate with any available funds as
 
01:07:42.010 --> 01:07:42.020 align:start position:0%
opposed to putting a non-lapsing
 
01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
component in the first year of the
 
01:07:47.029 --> 01:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
budget the reason I say that if you had
 
01:07:48.950 --> 01:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
an agency like administrative Services
 
01:07:51.289 --> 01:07:51.299 align:start position:0%
who the governor said you have the lapse
 
01:07:52.849 --> 01:07:52.859 align:start position:0%
five million dollars by the end of the
 
01:07:55.250 --> 01:07:55.260 align:start position:0%
fiscal year they really bind themselves
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
if they make those funds non-lapsing
 
01:07:58.309 --> 01:07:58.319 align:start position:0%
because they're going to have to look
 
01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:00.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere else instead of using the
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
funds that would otherwise have lapsed
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
you do have HHS has an impact the lapse
 
01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
too much because a majority of your
 
01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:10.260 align:start position:0%
lapse is coming from your vacancies but
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of your non-lapsing funds debt
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
services on you do have some of your
 
01:08:17.090 --> 01:08:17.100 align:start position:0%
Medicaid programs are non-lapsing until
 
01:08:19.030 --> 01:08:19.040 align:start position:0%
the second year of the biennium
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
those are more
 
01:08:21.359 --> 01:08:22.070 align:start position:0%
those are more
um

01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
kind of cushions against unexpected
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
activity or performance or performance
 
01:08:28.849 --> 01:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
against estimates for some of the
 
01:08:31.309 --> 01:08:31.319 align:start position:0%
programs but it doesn't tend it I don't
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
see it as a trend in the larger scale
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
but maybe some of your larger
 
01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
entitlement programs your 200 plus
 
01:08:41.329 --> 01:08:41.339 align:start position:0%
million dollars to have that 10 or 12
 
01:08:44.570 --> 01:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
million into the next year uh sometimes
 
01:08:46.809 --> 01:08:46.819 align:start position:0%
really helpful for those agencies
 
01:08:49.910 --> 01:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for that that was very good uh
 
01:08:51.890 --> 01:08:51.900 align:start position:0%
I'm it's going to take me a couple of
 
01:08:53.809 --> 01:08:53.819 align:start position:0%
walks around that to really understand
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
and I hope Mr Ripple keep training me on
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:00.179 --> 01:09:01.789 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:09:04.189 --> 01:09:04.199 align:start position:0%
so house patch uh Senate and then
 
01:09:06.410 --> 01:09:06.420 align:start position:0%
committee conference uh part of the
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
budget is where house has its position
 
01:09:10.729 --> 01:09:10.739 align:start position:0%
Senate has its position and then you
 
01:09:13.070 --> 01:09:13.080 align:start position:0%
work out the differences within a small
 
01:09:15.349 --> 01:09:15.359 align:start position:0%
crunched time frame of usually under a
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
week and you all come to an agreement
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
and then pass a budget over to the
 
01:09:21.530 --> 01:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
governor who at the same time is still
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
communicating with the House and Senate
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
uh during the entire process on things
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
that maybe he sees that he he agrees
 
01:09:30.050 --> 01:09:30.060 align:start position:0%
with or doesn't agree with but to keep
 
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:31.679 align:start position:0%
that those lines of communications open
 
01:09:34.189 --> 01:09:34.199 align:start position:0%
and then the final the House and Senate
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
both have one final vote uh at least one
 
01:09:39.650 --> 01:09:39.660 align:start position:0%
final vote of adopting that Committee of
 
01:09:41.209 --> 01:09:41.219 align:start position:0%
conference report so it has to be
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
something not that the house finance
 
01:09:44.329 --> 01:09:44.339 align:start position:0%
committees agree on but something that
 
01:09:45.709 --> 01:09:45.719 align:start position:0%
you know you can bring back to your body
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
and have passed a second time
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
what happens if it doesn't pass well two
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
things the budget could be vetoed
 
01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
um which it has been in the past
 
01:09:58.729 --> 01:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
um what happens then is a continuing
 
01:10:00.950 --> 01:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
resolution an option is to keep the
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
funding of the current government
 
01:10:06.590 --> 01:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
um in this is based on a level that is
 
01:10:08.630 --> 01:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
agreed to by the house senate and
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
Governor it doesn't have to be the
 
01:10:11.330 --> 01:10:11.340 align:start position:0%
current year level it could be the
 
01:10:13.010 --> 01:10:13.020 align:start position:0%
current year level plus the current year
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
level minus it's happened back in 2003
 
01:10:17.750 --> 01:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
was the budget has passed by the
 
01:10:19.790 --> 01:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislature there's a very short veto
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
period but that and what happens there
 
01:10:25.330 --> 01:10:25.340 align:start position:0%
is you'll have like a three-month budget
 
01:10:27.770 --> 01:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
agencies will be given the ability to
 
01:10:31.370 --> 01:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
come into fiscal committee to accept uh
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that amount
 
01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:34.610 align:start position:0%
above and beyond that amount
um

01:10:34.610 --> 01:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:36.950 --> 01:10:36.960 align:start position:0%
so it makes fiscal's job a lot harder
 
01:10:38.450 --> 01:10:38.460 align:start position:0%
during those three because at the same
 
01:10:39.830 --> 01:10:39.840 align:start position:0%
time members of the fiscal committee are
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
also negotiating what the final budget
 
01:10:42.950 --> 01:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:10:44.270 --> 01:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
um but there is a way to get through
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
that apps in a continuing resolution
 
01:10:50.090 --> 01:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
um which hasn't happened knock on wood I
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
like to bring everything up is would
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%
probably be a government shutdown if you
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
would have no agreement on a continuing
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
resolution since I've been here only
 
01:11:00.890 --> 01:11:00.900 align:start position:0%
since 99 that has not occurred usually
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
over the three months of a cool down
 
01:11:04.970 --> 01:11:04.980 align:start position:0%
period or further discussion period
 
01:11:06.830 --> 01:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
between the house senate and legislature
 
01:11:09.470 --> 01:11:09.480 align:start position:0%
summer agreement can come sometimes that
 
01:11:11.570 --> 01:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
agreement has gone right to the end of
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
September sometimes it happens right
 
01:11:17.570 --> 01:11:17.580 align:start position:0%
after Labor Day but never say never
 
01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:18.590 align:start position:0%
after Labor Day but never say never
um

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
so we just kind of keep track of that
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
and you know maybe 3 12 of a budget is
 
01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
not good enough maybe you need another
 
01:11:27.110 --> 01:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
week whatever it can be anything that
 
01:11:29.270 --> 01:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
the governor and legislative leadership
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
want to put forward
 
01:11:31.199 --> 01:11:32.630 align:start position:0%
want to put forward
um

01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
and then we get into house bill one uh
 
01:11:38.510 --> 01:11:38.520 align:start position:0%
on page 25. I didn't include all of
 
01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:40.739 align:start position:0%
house bill one I just included kind of
 
01:11:43.850 --> 01:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
the cover page so you see kind of what
 
01:11:46.310 --> 01:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
that looks like uh the introduction
 
01:11:50.030 --> 01:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page 26.
 
01:11:53.090 --> 01:11:53.100 align:start position:0%
we have so-called we call them footnotes
 
01:11:56.630 --> 01:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
which is on page 27 and 28 and these are
 
01:11:58.430 --> 01:11:58.440 align:start position:0%
not statutory changes but more
 
01:12:01.130 --> 01:12:01.140 align:start position:0%
restrictions put on some of the uh
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
transfer or use of certain
 
01:12:05.630 --> 01:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
Appropriations uh maybe some limits uh
 
01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
back of the budget cut and Personnel
 
01:12:09.530 --> 01:12:09.540 align:start position:0%
would be included in here
 
01:12:11.270 --> 01:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
um you know making sure that over time
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
and maintenance doesn't lapse so these
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
are all changes that are law but they're
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
not changing statutes so they are it is
 
01:12:20.870 --> 01:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have them in hospital one
 
01:12:23.510 --> 01:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
as sections but very small and at the
 
01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
end of that on page 31 and 32 are your
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
base Revenue estimates
 
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
um here based on committee conference
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
but for you what you'll include in your
 
01:12:34.610 --> 01:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
house bill one is your base Revenue
 
01:12:36.229 --> 01:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
estimates from the house Wheezy Means
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
Committee for the general fund education
 
01:12:42.470 --> 01:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
trust fund Highway and fishing game
 
01:12:44.930 --> 01:12:44.940 align:start position:0%
and then just an example of what the
 
01:12:47.709 --> 01:12:47.719 align:start position:0%
budget looks like on page 33
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
not a very reader friendly document not
 
01:12:53.930 --> 01:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
a very easy document to find uh things
 
01:12:56.030 --> 01:12:56.040 align:start position:0%
and it's a very detailed account it's an
 
01:12:58.130 --> 01:12:58.140 align:start position:0%
accounting document that is transferred
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
over uh basically turn a key and the
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
legislature the executive branch starts
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
to spend out of those funds once that
 
01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
budget has passed
 
01:13:08.930 --> 01:13:08.940 align:start position:0%
but on the top I'll just go over kind of
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
quickly just the top
 
01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.450 align:start position:0%
quickly just the top
um

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:14.689 --> 01:13:14.699 align:start position:0%
on the left hand side 0 2 is your
 
01:13:17.090 --> 01:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
category so administrative it's Justice
 
01:13:18.950 --> 01:13:18.960 align:start position:0%
and public protection so you'll have
 
01:13:20.990 --> 01:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
category one through six one being
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
General government two being
 
01:13:24.649 --> 01:13:24.659 align:start position:0%
administration of justice and public
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
protection three resource uh and
 
01:13:30.229 --> 01:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
protection for transportation five
 
01:13:32.209 --> 01:13:32.219 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and six
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
education you don't have to remember
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
that here uh the next two uh rows 20 is
 
01:13:41.090 --> 01:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
an agency code so Justice is from the
 
01:13:42.830 --> 01:13:42.840 align:start position:0%
counting in the accounting system is
 
01:13:44.870 --> 01:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
agency 20. so any activity for the
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice any Appropriations
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
occurs under there and then you have
 
01:13:50.689 --> 01:13:50.699 align:start position:0%
your um
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
this will see your activity
 
01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
your activity is division of legal
 
01:13:59.689 --> 01:13:59.699 align:start position:0%
council so 2010 10 is just another uh
 
01:14:01.370 --> 01:14:01.380 align:start position:0%
just a figure
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
it's a set of numbers to keep track of
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
everything that occurs under that
 
01:14:10.490 --> 01:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
activity being the division of legal
 
01:14:13.490 --> 01:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
council so you might have multiple uh
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
levels but you can always sum up to that
 
01:14:20.530 --> 01:14:20.540 align:start position:0%
Division and then 26 23 is a unique
 
01:14:23.450 --> 01:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
number for transportation under
 
01:14:26.149 --> 01:14:26.159 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice and we use that
 
01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
that's called we call that the
 
01:14:29.450 --> 01:14:29.460 align:start position:0%
accounting unit those all those one two
 
01:14:31.790 --> 01:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
three four five digits your accounting
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
unit and that's how the state budgets
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
and that's how the state keeps track of
 
01:14:38.090 --> 01:14:38.100 align:start position:0%
it after the budget and then down you'll
 
01:14:40.250 --> 01:14:40.260 align:start position:0%
see the classes your zero 10 is your
 
01:14:43.430 --> 01:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
Personnel Services 0-13 uh is your
 
01:14:46.370 --> 01:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
unclassified Personnel Services and then
 
01:14:49.430 --> 01:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
your class 60 060 your benefits there
 
01:14:52.490 --> 01:14:52.500 align:start position:0%
are several classes our analysts as you
 
01:14:53.950 --> 01:14:53.960 align:start position:0%
develop your budget will go over
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
multiple uh with you as you get to each
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
agency because there are some that are
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
unique to certain agencies but a lot
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
most of them majority of them are
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
budgeted under the same your class 10
 
01:15:07.189 --> 01:15:07.199 align:start position:0%
across agencies are
 
01:15:09.110 --> 01:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
permanent classified employees and
 
01:15:10.010 --> 01:15:10.020 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the same for
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice or health and
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
human services and so that way you can
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
summarize how much you're spending on a
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
certain type of service by the class
 
01:15:20.270 --> 01:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
level and then your source of funds down
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
low estimated source of funds this one
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
is a transfer from the Department of
 
01:15:27.110 --> 01:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
Transportation so it's other funds show
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
up as other funds in the budget but
 
01:15:30.530 --> 01:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
there's a sending account under the
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to fund
 
01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
this this arm of the Department of
 
01:15:38.689 --> 01:15:38.699 align:start position:0%
Justice so this is what you'll see this
 
01:15:40.070 --> 01:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
is what you'll use when representative
 
01:15:41.510 --> 01:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
Wilder mentioned you'll go through Page
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
by Page line by line of a budget when
 
01:15:45.950 --> 01:15:45.960 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget comes out you'll
 
01:15:48.290 --> 01:15:48.300 align:start position:0%
have an actual history so you'll have
 
01:15:51.050 --> 01:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
your 22 actual expenditures for every
 
01:15:53.209 --> 01:15:53.219 align:start position:0%
single accounting unit your 22 actual
 
01:15:55.790 --> 01:15:55.800 align:start position:0%
expenditures your 23 adjusted authorized
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
which are your Appropriations plus any
 
01:15:59.990 --> 01:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
other legislative or fiscal or GNC
 
01:16:02.090 --> 01:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
activity that occurred prior to our
 
01:16:06.169 --> 01:16:06.179 align:start position:0%
dates or usually August 15th and then
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
you can look at trends you can ask
 
01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
questions on why do you have equipment
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
why has it gone up why is your personnel
 
01:16:15.290 --> 01:16:15.300 align:start position:0%
increasing if you've only spent you know
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
X on this class line and 22 what has
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
changed over the last year to make your
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
request go up by 20 25 and it varies
 
01:16:27.050 --> 01:16:27.060 align:start position:0%
from each agency so you'll notice those
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
when the um the agencies start coming in
 
01:16:31.310 --> 01:16:31.320 align:start position:0%
presenting the governor's budget you'll
 
01:16:33.410 --> 01:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
notice those big jumps
 
01:16:36.050 --> 01:16:36.060 align:start position:0%
um and you can ask those questions when
 
01:16:37.550 --> 01:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
you get there and feel free to ask our
 
01:16:39.830 --> 01:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
analysts as well if you have any
 
01:16:41.330 --> 01:16:41.340 align:start position:0%
questions ahead of time once you get the
 
01:16:43.610 --> 01:16:43.620 align:start position:0%
governor's budget and we do our best we
 
01:16:45.290 --> 01:16:45.300 align:start position:0%
learn with you when the governor's
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
budget because we really are not
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
involved right now with the governor
 
01:16:51.470 --> 01:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
once it's released on February 15th we
 
01:16:52.970 --> 01:16:52.980 align:start position:0%
do our best with you to kind of come up
 
01:16:54.470 --> 01:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
to speed really quick so that the
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
legislature can start doing that
 
01:16:58.140 --> 01:16:59.750 align:start position:0%
legislature can start doing that
sure

01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.189 align:start position:0%
sure
question

01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
thank you just a very quick question I
 
01:17:05.450 --> 01:17:05.460 align:start position:0%
think I heard you say that those three
 
01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
digit codes object codes or whatever you
 
01:17:09.530 --> 01:17:09.540 align:start position:0%
want to call them are mostly consistent
 
01:17:11.870 --> 01:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
around departments which seems to imply
 
01:17:13.430 --> 01:17:13.440 align:start position:0%
that the same code could have different
 
01:17:15.229 --> 01:17:15.239 align:start position:0%
meanings in different departments could
 
01:17:17.510 --> 01:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
you clarify whether that's the case
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
sure there may be one or two and I say
 
01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:22.440 align:start position:0%
there's um
 
01:17:25.550 --> 01:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
your class tens through 80 are all
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
consistent across departments
 
01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:28.490 align:start position:0%
consistent across departments
um

01:17:28.490 --> 01:17:28.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:30.770 --> 01:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
there used to be now this is probably 10
 
01:17:32.450 --> 01:17:32.460 align:start position:0%
years ago class 90 that could be
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
different across departments it could be
 
01:17:37.010 --> 01:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
fish food versus uh purchase of copying
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
supplies in another over the past
 
01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
several years the Department
 
01:17:43.550 --> 01:17:43.560 align:start position:0%
administrative Services has worked to
 
01:17:46.850 --> 01:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
have unique codes for each agencies
 
01:17:49.370 --> 01:17:49.380 align:start position:0%
um so you're there should only be one or
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
two it's very rare now to have
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
um dueling class codes to have different
 
01:17:57.530 --> 01:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
meetings because they do like develop a
 
01:17:59.810 --> 01:17:59.820 align:start position:0%
specific but I can't tell you a hundred
 
01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:03.239 align:start position:0%
percent that there's not one like 523
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
class that might be used across agencies
 
01:18:08.270 --> 01:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
with a different description but we have
 
01:18:12.830 --> 01:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
came a long way from back in 2003 with a
 
01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
class 90. uh if you got a budget report
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
on class 90 it wouldn't tell you
 
01:18:18.770 --> 01:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
anything because it could include
 
01:18:20.090 --> 01:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
provider payments to Health and Human
 
01:18:22.729 --> 01:18:22.739 align:start position:0%
Services it can include purchase
 
01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:25.260 align:start position:0%
payments to UNH so it's been a lot
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
better since over the last 10 years
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
to maintain that consistency and that
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
accuracy and Reporting so thank you very
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
much and thank you Mr chairman
 
01:18:35.159 --> 01:18:36.590 align:start position:0%
much and thank you Mr chairman
okay

01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
and then on page sorry sorry
 
01:18:40.850 --> 01:18:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
um what are class 40 and 42 these are
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
fairly large items
 
01:18:49.209 --> 01:18:49.219 align:start position:0%
yep so
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
class 40 is your indirect cost so uh any
 
01:18:56.390 --> 01:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
overhead costs to be chargeable back to
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
the treasury
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
um the state sets up this so-called
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
Statewide indirect cost allocation plan
 
01:19:05.330 --> 01:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
known as the sway cap that is approved
 
01:19:06.770 --> 01:19:06.780 align:start position:0%
by the U.S Department of Health and
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
Human Services that provides a rate of
 
01:19:12.350 --> 01:19:12.360 align:start position:0%
what is an overhead cost that other
 
01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:13.990 align:start position:0%
what is an overhead cost that other
agencies

01:19:13.990 --> 01:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
01:19:16.970 --> 01:19:16.980 align:start position:0%
incur on their behalf administrative
 
01:19:19.610 --> 01:19:19.620 align:start position:0%
services for any of the accounting
 
01:19:22.250 --> 01:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
reports treasury for the checks so if
 
01:19:25.430 --> 01:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're in other funded agency there is
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
an indirect cost that you're required to
 
01:19:29.450 --> 01:19:29.460 align:start position:0%
pay now those funds go into the general
 
01:19:31.209 --> 01:19:31.219 align:start position:0%
funders of the revenue
 
01:19:33.649 --> 01:19:33.659 align:start position:0%
I'm blanking on how much that amount is
 
01:19:35.510 --> 01:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
could be 10 to 12 million dollars a year
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
and basically that offsets any general
 
01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
fund cost from those
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
other agencies
 
01:19:44.390 --> 01:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
and then 42-year additional fringe
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:52.189 --> 01:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
or non-journal funded agencies or
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
agencies who don't send administrative
 
01:19:57.649 --> 01:19:57.659 align:start position:0%
Services specific funds retiree health
 
01:19:59.390 --> 01:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
available to eligible employees based on
 
01:20:02.570 --> 01:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
the years of service Department
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
administrative Services has the large
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's Journal funds but it
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
also includes money from a retirement
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
subsidy for limited amount of employees
 
01:20:14.270 --> 01:20:14.280 align:start position:0%
but also sending agencies your fish and
 
01:20:16.130 --> 01:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
game department of
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
transportation and safety send their
 
01:20:22.070 --> 01:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
share of retiree Health based on your
 
01:20:24.470 --> 01:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
current number of employees so it's kind
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
of a it's not a direct charge based on
 
01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
what we're paying on behalf of your
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
employees but it's allocated to various
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
agencies based on the number of
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
employees that you have and the
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
percentage of your budget that is
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
non-general funding it's really to
 
01:20:44.090 --> 01:20:44.100 align:start position:0%
offset that general fund cost for State
 
01:20:46.010 --> 01:20:46.020 align:start position:0%
retiree health insurance
 
01:20:48.050 --> 01:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
thank you it's going to take more than
 
01:20:51.229 --> 01:20:51.239 align:start position:0%
once to sink in it yes it is when you
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
get to that line in in division one we
 
01:20:54.830 --> 01:20:54.840 align:start position:0%
get to that line one of your largest
 
01:20:56.570 --> 01:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
lines for retiree health during the
 
01:20:57.950 --> 01:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
budget you'll start to see that agency
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
income and it'll make a little more
 
01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:00.709 align:start position:0%
income and it'll make a little more
sense

01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:21:05.330 --> 01:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:07.490 --> 01:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
back to
 
01:21:09.649 --> 01:21:09.659 align:start position:0%
um where you did the budget footnotes on
 
01:21:13.550 --> 01:21:13.560 align:start position:0%
page 27. right so the Constitution does
 
01:21:15.490 --> 01:21:15.500 align:start position:0%
not or the Constitution prohibits
 
01:21:17.870 --> 01:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
statutory changes
 
01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:21.260 align:start position:0%
but can you waive a statute
 
01:21:23.450 --> 01:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
right is that what happens in the
 
01:21:24.649 --> 01:21:24.659 align:start position:0%
footnote section because you you
 
01:21:26.450 --> 01:21:26.460 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier right that there's a
 
01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
two-thirds requirement for
 
01:21:31.790 --> 01:21:31.800 align:start position:0%
managing the rainy day fund yet
 
01:21:33.890 --> 01:21:33.900 align:start position:0%
typically is overridden by probably a
 
01:21:35.810 --> 01:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
simple majority is that done in the
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
footnotes so you can't change the
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
statute but you can say ignore the
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
statute is that a good way to think
 
01:21:44.090 --> 01:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
about it yes and that would happen in
 
01:21:46.250 --> 01:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
your house bill too okay
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
um hospital when you see here if there
 
01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:49.980 align:start position:0%
are any references to statute it should
 
01:21:51.890 --> 01:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
be purely reference for the house bill
 
01:21:54.770 --> 01:21:54.780 align:start position:0%
one sections but in House Bill 2 you can
 
01:21:54.780 --> 01:21:55.610 align:start position:0%
one sections but in House Bill 2 you can
um

01:21:55.610 --> 01:21:55.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
either suspend a statute or the word the
 
01:22:01.669 --> 01:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
term used is not withstand so basically
 
01:22:03.709 --> 01:22:03.719 align:start position:0%
ignore as you stated a statute or
 
01:22:06.050 --> 01:22:06.060 align:start position:0%
statute requirements if it is signed
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
into law correct
 
01:22:10.669 --> 01:22:10.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:10.679 --> 01:22:11.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:22:11.930 --> 01:22:11.940 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:22:16.250 --> 01:22:16.260 align:start position:0%
and then on page 34 is a document that
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
you will see usually at the end of your
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
process to and this is a compared
 
01:22:23.630 --> 01:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
document this is something we put online
 
01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
so that state agencies and the public in
 
01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:28.820 align:start position:0%
the legislature can keep track of
 
01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
differences between the in this instance
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
the governor and the house budget so
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
when the house passes a budget where
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
were the changes made this is a document
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
that the Senate will use when they
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
develop their budget to see what changes
 
01:22:42.229 --> 01:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
is made but also the house will refer to
 
01:22:44.149 --> 01:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
we'll have a couple
 
01:22:44.159 --> 01:22:44.810 align:start position:0%
we'll have a couple
um

01:22:44.810 --> 01:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:46.850 --> 01:22:46.860 align:start position:0%
compare documents put up what changes
 
01:22:48.350 --> 01:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
the Senate made to the house or the
 
01:22:50.930 --> 01:22:50.940 align:start position:0%
Senate made to the governor and so we'll
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
keep those documents on our website
 
01:22:54.770 --> 01:22:54.780 align:start position:0%
these are large documents usually 15
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
1600 page documents but they do have
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
great detail on you know a 4 800 change
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh in Hardware software just to kind of
 
01:23:06.350 --> 01:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
keep track of everything that was
 
01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:08.689 align:start position:0%
keep track of everything that was
changed

01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
and quickly on page 35 is the State
 
01:23:16.370 --> 01:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 18a which does
 
01:23:18.830 --> 01:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
specific does state that and I'm going
 
01:23:20.810 --> 01:23:20.820 align:start position:0%
to paraphrase that no section or
 
01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
footnote of any such budget Bill shall
 
01:23:25.010 --> 01:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
contain any provision which establishes
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
amends a repeal statutory law I would we
 
01:23:32.689 --> 01:23:32.699 align:start position:0%
do tend to anything that ignores or not
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
withstands we do like to put in House
 
01:23:37.130 --> 01:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 as well just to keep with them to
 
01:23:38.330 --> 01:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
make sure that everything is in
 
01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
compliance with the Constitution
 
01:23:43.250 --> 01:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
and then House Bill 2 we just we didn't
 
01:23:45.169 --> 01:23:45.179 align:start position:0%
print the entire house bill 2 which was
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
300 plus sections but we did provide you
 
01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:50.100 align:start position:0%
with on page 36
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
um through
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
43 44
 
01:23:57.950 --> 01:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
just uh what is included uh you'll have
 
01:23:59.530 --> 01:23:59.540 align:start position:0%
our judicial branch
 
01:24:02.209 --> 01:24:02.219 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for cost of court security
 
01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
you'll have a consolidate human resource
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
and payroll functions which I think you
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
have seen for every budget for the last
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
10 years
 
01:24:13.189 --> 01:24:13.199 align:start position:0%
um extending appropriation dates making
 
01:24:15.729 --> 01:24:15.739 align:start position:0%
Appropriations to certain
 
01:24:19.370 --> 01:24:19.380 align:start position:0%
funds reducing tax rates for the meals
 
01:24:21.590 --> 01:24:21.600 align:start position:0%
and rooms tax making any changes to tax
 
01:24:23.169 --> 01:24:23.179 align:start position:0%
law that make it into house bill too
 
01:24:25.970 --> 01:24:25.980 align:start position:0%
legislature has a choice you either pass
 
01:24:28.630 --> 01:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
a separate bill with any tax changes
 
01:24:31.370 --> 01:24:31.380 align:start position:0%
usually every appropriation Bill comes
 
01:24:33.169 --> 01:24:33.179 align:start position:0%
to finance but for tax changes you can
 
01:24:35.090 --> 01:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
either let that pass on its own and will
 
01:24:37.070 --> 01:24:37.080 align:start position:0%
account for any impact on our Surplus
 
01:24:38.750 --> 01:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
statement which I'll get to or you can
 
01:24:41.149 --> 01:24:41.159 align:start position:0%
include that in-house Bill too if it's
 
01:24:42.350 --> 01:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
something both the House and Senate
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
degree usually let that bill pass but if
 
01:24:45.770 --> 01:24:45.780 align:start position:0%
it's something you are having to Bates
 
01:24:46.970 --> 01:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
with the housing center on what's
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
appropriate you will have may put that
 
01:24:52.130 --> 01:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
into house bill too just to solidify
 
01:24:56.330 --> 01:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
your position and fund your side
 
01:25:01.669 --> 01:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
and then on page 45 is a small when you
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
receive these during the process
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
um they'll be on legal size they'll this
 
01:25:08.570 --> 01:25:08.580 align:start position:0%
is the Surplus statement so this is a
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
combined General and education trust
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
fund Surplus statement this is a
 
01:25:15.050 --> 01:25:15.060 align:start position:0%
document internal document we use
 
01:25:17.410 --> 01:25:17.420 align:start position:0%
um to make sure that the legislature
 
01:25:20.810 --> 01:25:20.820 align:start position:0%
recommends a balanced budget again this
 
01:25:23.510 --> 01:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
is you know for this one on page 45 and
 
01:25:26.750 --> 01:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
this was developed on June of 21 for the
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
next two years so it's based on your
 
01:25:30.770 --> 01:25:30.780 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates any Revenue
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
adjustments which are any changes to
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
taxes any changes in Appropriations that
 
01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
may impact revenues if you had an agency
 
01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
that is provides its net profit to the
 
01:25:44.930 --> 01:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
general fund and and you increase their
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
funding but it doesn't increase their
 
01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:47.820 align:start position:0%
revenue that could be a negative
 
01:25:52.010 --> 01:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
adjustment the ra sometimes they receive
 
01:25:53.570 --> 01:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
additional positions that could bring in
 
01:25:56.030 --> 01:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
additional Revenue auditor positions so
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
you may have a positive adjustment so
 
01:25:59.870 --> 01:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
that's where we keep track of Revenue
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
adjustments and then we have our budget
 
01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.010 align:start position:0%
adjustments and then we have our budget
Appropriations

01:26:03.010 --> 01:26:03.020 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
which are your hospital one
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
Appropriations just from the total page
 
01:26:09.530 --> 01:26:09.540 align:start position:0%
in the back and then your appropriation
 
01:26:11.930 --> 01:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
adjustments these could be individual
 
01:26:14.930 --> 01:26:14.940 align:start position:0%
Appropriations for certain purposes for
 
01:26:17.149 --> 01:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
one year for two years that are outside
 
01:26:19.669 --> 01:26:19.679 align:start position:0%
the your standard operating budget they
 
01:26:22.550 --> 01:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
could be one-time funding provided in
 
01:26:24.169 --> 01:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
the either current fiscal year or the
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
next two fiscal years or again an impact
 
01:26:29.030 --> 01:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
from legislation that may have passed
 
01:26:30.470 --> 01:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
the legislature that could have an
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
impact on Appropriations going forward
 
01:26:35.209 --> 01:26:35.219 align:start position:0%
education for instance if you had a big
 
01:26:37.490 --> 01:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
policy bill go through education that
 
01:26:40.970 --> 01:26:40.980 align:start position:0%
changed your adequacy formula and it
 
01:26:43.250 --> 01:26:43.260 align:start position:0%
passed the policy committees and went
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate vice versa passed we
 
01:26:47.510 --> 01:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
would make sure that although it didn't
 
01:26:49.129 --> 01:26:49.139 align:start position:0%
come to finance we want to make sure
 
01:26:50.810 --> 01:26:50.820 align:start position:0%
that you account for it on your balance
 
01:26:52.430 --> 01:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
sheet and so this is the best we do up
 
01:26:53.770 --> 01:26:53.780 align:start position:0%
to that point
 
01:26:57.530 --> 01:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
and then you'll see on page 46 six you
 
01:26:59.570 --> 01:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
do the same thing for Highway funds so
 
01:27:01.610 --> 01:27:01.620 align:start position:0%
division two you'll be working with
 
01:27:01.620 --> 01:27:02.709 align:start position:0%
division two you'll be working with
Mickey

01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
Mickey
 
01:27:05.290 --> 01:27:05.300 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund
 
01:27:07.490 --> 01:27:07.500 align:start position:0%
both the revenues that are coming in
 
01:27:09.290 --> 01:27:09.300 align:start position:0%
based on estimates from Ways and Means
 
01:27:10.850 --> 01:27:10.860 align:start position:0%
and then working with those agencies
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
that use Highway funds which are
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation as well as
 
01:27:15.530 --> 01:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and there are a
 
01:27:18.530 --> 01:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
couple smaller hits from other agencies
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
but majority of those two and then on
 
01:27:23.450 --> 01:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
the next page of Fish and Game fund on
 
01:27:25.970 --> 01:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
page 47 based on Revenue estimates from
 
01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means proposed budgets and then
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
any changes made you'll see here on page
 
01:27:35.209 --> 01:27:35.219 align:start position:0%
47 there was a change to Department of
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
Information Technology Appropriations
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
and since doit as it's known uh the
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
division one will talk about they spread
 
01:27:45.709 --> 01:27:45.719 align:start position:0%
some other costs out to all the agencies
 
01:27:47.450 --> 01:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
you will see impact on some of these
 
01:27:48.770 --> 01:27:48.780 align:start position:0%
other balance sheets for your
 
01:27:51.709 --> 01:27:51.719 align:start position:0%
non-journal fund agencies and so you'll
 
01:27:54.050 --> 01:27:54.060 align:start position:0%
see there as well as the cost of a pay
 
01:27:55.729 --> 01:27:55.739 align:start position:0%
raise it was a pay raise that passed in
 
01:27:58.370 --> 01:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
House Bill two two years ago and you'll
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
see that there's a fishing game and a
 
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
highway fund portion of that as well as
 
01:28:06.050 --> 01:28:06.060 align:start position:0%
a education as well as a general fund
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
on page 48 our pie charts representative
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
Weiler these aren't all the pie charts
 
01:28:12.890 --> 01:28:12.900 align:start position:0%
we've done I've just included a couple
 
01:28:16.189 --> 01:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
pie charts just a visualization of uh
 
01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
number one not only the size of the
 
01:28:18.300 --> 01:28:19.330 align:start position:0%
number one not only the size of the
budget

01:28:19.330 --> 01:28:19.340 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:28:22.189 --> 01:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
but this more or less what each category
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
that I briefly mentioned before there's
 
01:28:28.010 --> 01:28:28.020 align:start position:0%
six categories the total budget all
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
funds was about thirteen and a half
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars for the current biennium
 
01:28:37.090 --> 01:28:37.100 align:start position:0%
for 22.23 HHS makes up about
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
43.4 or Category 5 43.4 percent of that
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
pie so you see the largest pie being
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
under category five which is all
 
01:28:47.110 --> 01:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
division three yes question
 
01:28:49.610 --> 01:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
01:28:49.620 --> 01:28:50.629 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
chair

01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:28:55.370 --> 01:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
um does this uh chart correlate neatly
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
to what division one and division two do
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
I I know I can guess which one is
 
01:29:03.649 --> 01:29:03.659 align:start position:0%
division three but are are these other
 
01:29:03.659 --> 01:29:04.750 align:start position:0%
division three but are are these other
five

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:29:07.669 --> 01:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
directly and completely correlated to
 
01:29:08.870 --> 01:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
another division
 
01:29:11.270 --> 01:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
no no
 
01:29:13.610 --> 01:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
um so I can tell you category five is
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely division three division two
 
01:29:17.629 --> 01:29:17.639 align:start position:0%
kind of touches Upon A Little Bit of
 
01:29:21.050 --> 01:29:21.060 align:start position:0%
Everything apps all of category six uh
 
01:29:23.689 --> 01:29:23.699 align:start position:0%
division two takes all of category
 
01:29:26.209 --> 01:29:26.219 align:start position:0%
um so can I restate my question
 
01:29:28.550 --> 01:29:28.560 align:start position:0%
because I'm so concerned about the new
 
01:29:30.890 --> 01:29:30.900 align:start position:0%
members of Finance can we get a listing
 
01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
of which division as what part of the
 
01:29:33.420 --> 01:29:36.189 align:start position:0%
of which division as what part of the
budget

01:29:36.189 --> 01:29:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:38.750 --> 01:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
I'm gonna pretend for now I already know
 
01:29:40.669 --> 01:29:40.679 align:start position:0%
it and I just want everyone else to know
 
01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:43.020 align:start position:0%
it so if we can put it in writing
 
01:29:45.050 --> 01:29:45.060 align:start position:0%
somewhere we can do that in the division
 
01:29:47.330 --> 01:29:47.340 align:start position:0%
briefings yeah I think our some of our
 
01:29:48.830 --> 01:29:48.840 align:start position:0%
analysts will have that handout for you
 
01:29:51.169 --> 01:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
but I cannot what it can also do is do a
 
01:29:52.850 --> 01:29:52.860 align:start position:0%
um a pie chart by division if that's
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
helpful just so you can see I wouldn't
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
ask for that it doesn't take that long
 
01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
thank you very much just quickly to
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
continue on what you were talking about
 
01:30:12.050 --> 01:30:12.060 align:start position:0%
with regards to the division breakdowns
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation with the speaker's
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
office actually about including those on
 
01:30:19.970 --> 01:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
the House website when you click on the
 
01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
Committees uh each committee yes it
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
breaks down into membership but really
 
01:30:26.390 --> 01:30:26.400 align:start position:0%
each committee should break down in a
 
01:30:28.610 --> 01:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
very detailed description and even
 
01:30:31.490 --> 01:30:31.500 align:start position:0%
further down each division should have
 
01:30:33.110 --> 01:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
the categories you're talking about
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
right there on the House website thank
 
01:30:39.110 --> 01:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
you okay sure and we can uh work with uh
 
01:30:41.870 --> 01:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
Journal core technology services to give
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
them that information so that they can
 
01:30:44.930 --> 01:30:44.940 align:start position:0%
put that in the drop down for division
 
01:30:44.940 --> 01:30:46.430 align:start position:0%
put that in the drop down for division
one

01:30:46.430 --> 01:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
um division one basically the high level
 
01:30:49.910 --> 01:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're it's your general government
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
under category one it's uh your category
 
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
two other than the department of safety
 
01:30:55.970 --> 01:30:55.980 align:start position:0%
because they're funded from Highway
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
funds and it's uh your category three
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
except fish and games since they're
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
funded with fish and game uh division
 
01:31:05.149 --> 01:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
two being your category four for
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
transportation your category six for
 
01:31:08.930 --> 01:31:08.940 align:start position:0%
education and then safety and fishing
 
01:31:10.430 --> 01:31:10.440 align:start position:0%
game but we do have a listing of that
 
01:31:15.830 --> 01:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.890 --> 01:31:17.900 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:31:22.870 --> 01:31:22.880 align:start position:0%
49 is just a high level uh bar chart
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the source of funding so yes
 
01:31:29.030 --> 01:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
13 and a half billion dollar budget
 
01:31:30.290 --> 01:31:30.300 align:start position:0%
um but
 
01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know where does that come from
 
01:31:33.530 --> 01:31:33.540 align:start position:0%
well we can see the Top Line federal
 
01:31:36.290 --> 01:31:36.300 align:start position:0%
funds make up a majority uh they make up
 
01:31:38.810 --> 01:31:38.820 align:start position:0%
4.2 million dollars when I say majority
 
01:31:41.050 --> 01:31:41.060 align:start position:0%
they're the highest share uh the largest
 
01:31:44.270 --> 01:31:44.280 align:start position:0%
percentage share uh 4.2 billion dollars
 
01:31:47.510 --> 01:31:47.520 align:start position:0%
general fund coming next at 3.3 other
 
01:31:49.370 --> 01:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
funds are all your different agency
 
01:31:51.229 --> 01:31:51.239 align:start position:0%
income but the largest one there almost
 
01:31:53.030 --> 01:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
two billion dollars of it is your
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is another fund uh
 
01:31:57.709 --> 01:31:57.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not anymore the other fund is
 
01:32:00.890 --> 01:32:00.900 align:start position:0%
your insurance your banking your agency
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
income lines your transfers amongst the
 
01:32:05.330 --> 01:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
various agencies education fund at two
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollars has been broken out in
 
01:32:10.010 --> 01:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
the orange Highway about 490 million
 
01:32:13.729 --> 01:32:13.739 align:start position:0%
Turnpike 336 and then liquor fishing
 
01:32:14.810 --> 01:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
game Etc
 
01:32:14.820 --> 01:32:16.430 align:start position:0%
game Etc
so

01:32:16.430 --> 01:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
uh doit being one of your largest other
 
01:32:21.250 --> 01:32:21.260 align:start position:0%
funded agencies because they do receive
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%
funding from every single agencies that
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
use their services and then on page 50
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh the LBA statute of the fiscal
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
committee statute there's a fiscal
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
committee that is responsible for
 
01:32:35.229 --> 01:32:35.239 align:start position:0%
overseeing the budget when it passes
 
01:32:37.490 --> 01:32:37.500 align:start position:0%
overseeing the additional funds that
 
01:32:39.770 --> 01:32:39.780 align:start position:0%
come through outside of the budget
 
01:32:42.530 --> 01:32:42.540 align:start position:0%
process maybe some one-time funds or
 
01:32:44.270 --> 01:32:44.280 align:start position:0%
funds that aren't guaranteed for the
 
01:32:45.490 --> 01:32:45.500 align:start position:0%
next two years
 
01:32:47.510 --> 01:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee does have that
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
requirement to accept and expend allow
 
01:32:52.729 --> 01:32:52.739 align:start position:0%
accept an expenditure of those funds
 
01:32:55.669 --> 01:32:55.679 align:start position:0%
allow transfer of any budgeted funds you
 
01:32:57.410 --> 01:32:57.420 align:start position:0%
have in certain classes unless there's
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
limitations or restrictions fiscal
 
01:33:01.310 --> 01:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
committee will be the legislative the
 
01:33:02.930 --> 01:33:02.940 align:start position:0%
five members of the Senate five members
 
01:33:05.330 --> 01:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
of the house that will oversee any
 
01:33:06.890 --> 01:33:06.900 align:start position:0%
changes to the budget as well as any
 
01:33:09.649 --> 01:33:09.659 align:start position:0%
funds that come in after they're also
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
responsible for appointing us and then
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
sorry you have a question question
 
01:33:16.090 --> 01:33:16.100 align:start position:0%
representative emmerich
 
01:33:20.270 --> 01:33:20.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh I think it was at
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
this point
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
in this in the briefing in previous
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
times when we talked about double
 
01:33:25.199 --> 01:33:26.330 align:start position:0%
times when we talked about double
accounting

01:33:26.330 --> 01:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
accounting
 
01:33:29.450 --> 01:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
yep and the and I just wanted to ask the
 
01:33:33.169 --> 01:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
question again doit out charges itself
 
01:33:35.450 --> 01:33:35.460 align:start position:0%
to everybody
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
but its budget is also part of this
 
01:33:40.189 --> 01:33:40.199 align:start position:0%
budget yes yes so the Departments are
 
01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
paying for it and doit is paying for it
 
01:33:44.390 --> 01:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
so in essence
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
whatever doit's budget is
 
01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:50.820 align:start position:0%
for them it's also found throughout all
 
01:33:53.689 --> 01:33:53.699 align:start position:0%
the other agencies I just wanted to Sure
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
yes and if we go back to page 49 a
 
01:33:58.610 --> 01:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
majority of your other funds are the
 
01:34:00.770 --> 01:34:00.780 align:start position:0%
so-called um not a majority but a large
 
01:34:02.209 --> 01:34:02.219 align:start position:0%
share of your other funds are so-called
 
01:34:03.590 --> 01:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
double counting and I say double
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
counting because in our how the budget
 
01:34:10.030 --> 01:34:10.040 align:start position:0%
is set up is that an agency may have
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
let's say Department of Transportation
 
01:34:17.090 --> 01:34:17.100 align:start position:0%
for instance has a project that toit is
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
working on for them or just their normal
 
01:34:22.610 --> 01:34:22.620 align:start position:0%
support of um for web development for
 
01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
any other software
 
01:34:28.370 --> 01:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
doit will charge
 
01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.390 align:start position:0%
doit will charge
um

01:34:29.390 --> 01:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation for those
 
01:34:33.729 --> 01:34:33.739 align:start position:0%
costs that are related to them
 
01:34:36.350 --> 01:34:36.360 align:start position:0%
so what happens is you have your
 
01:34:38.709 --> 01:34:38.719 align:start position:0%
spending account so you have your
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation meet the
 
01:34:42.830 --> 01:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
actual expenditure
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
transferring over to doit and then doit
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
showing the expenditure in their budget
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
like is it under their General
 
01:34:53.870 --> 01:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
Administration is under a specific so
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
you have both the receiving agency and
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
the sending agency spending being double
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
counted what is in the budget if we look
 
01:35:04.610 --> 01:35:04.620 align:start position:0%
to an old house bill one if you look on
 
01:35:05.990 --> 01:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
the last under
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
um it's in the totals but it's also
 
01:35:09.770 --> 01:35:09.780 align:start position:0%
under each agency there's been a removal
 
01:35:12.410 --> 01:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
of the double counting at least visually
 
01:35:15.410 --> 01:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
so you can see of every agency how much
 
01:35:17.090 --> 01:35:17.100 align:start position:0%
of that is double count it's usually a
 
01:35:19.250 --> 01:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
couple hundred uh to 300 million dollars
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
each fiscal year and to give a real
 
01:35:23.930 --> 01:35:23.940 align:start position:0%
budget total of what the state is
 
01:35:26.450 --> 01:35:26.460 align:start position:0%
actually appropriating so that you don't
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
um you know you don't say you've
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
appropriated 13
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
0.8 billion when you were only really
 
01:35:34.669 --> 01:35:34.679 align:start position:0%
appropriated 13.5 because the you know
 
01:35:37.010 --> 01:35:37.020 align:start position:0%
300 million is double counting so that
 
01:35:39.770 --> 01:35:39.780 align:start position:0%
is a new development uh or new change in
 
01:35:42.290 --> 01:35:42.300 align:start position:0%
the budget Bill itself that was
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
implemented probably
 
01:35:47.450 --> 01:35:47.460 align:start position:0%
two budgets ago that makes it a little
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
more clear because the double counting
 
01:35:51.649 --> 01:35:51.659 align:start position:0%
is an issue when you start to look at um
 
01:35:54.110 --> 01:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
start to compare budgets
 
01:35:59.229 --> 01:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up so uh thank you the so the
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
13.54 million or billion is net
 
01:36:08.750 --> 01:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
it should be I will I'll verify that it
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
should be negative double counting yep
 
01:36:15.290 --> 01:36:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you sure at least from that
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
side now you'll have Duit show up as
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
other funds but you won't uh the Double
 
01:36:21.530 --> 01:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
counting out of the sending agency won't
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.970 --> 01:36:28.980 align:start position:0%
and then fiscal committee
 
01:36:31.129 --> 01:36:31.139 align:start position:0%
um on page 50 they're also responsible
 
01:36:33.649 --> 01:36:33.659 align:start position:0%
for uh overseeing our office appointing
 
01:36:37.070 --> 01:36:37.080 align:start position:0%
the LBA uh over seeing the work of our
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
staff but also with the various
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
transfers and accepting expenditure of
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
funds and then I'll usually during the
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
budget that's one part of it but fiscal
 
01:36:48.590 --> 01:36:48.600 align:start position:0%
committee historically had approved
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
between two and three hundred million
 
01:36:52.310 --> 01:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
dollars a year of other funds mostly
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
federal funds that come in it might be
 
01:36:58.070 --> 01:36:58.080 align:start position:0%
one-time uh funding that's not an
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
ongoing or maybe the legislature has
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
asked them to come into the fiscal
 
01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
committee to give fiscal committee
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
another chance of the legislature
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
another chance to discuss these various
 
01:37:10.070 --> 01:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
programs but what you'll see on the next
 
01:37:13.850 --> 01:37:13.860 align:start position:0%
several pages is not only what fiscal uh
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
historically approves but
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
the increase of the additional fiscal
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
approvals as a result that resulted from
 
01:37:25.970 --> 01:37:25.980 align:start position:0%
cares and arpa funds so almost 1.6
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
billion dollars in funds coming in
 
01:37:29.930 --> 01:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
through fiscal which is not your
 
01:37:32.930 --> 01:37:32.940 align:start position:0%
standard run-of-the-mill fiscal items
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
rarely it has not been that high it has
 
01:37:37.010 --> 01:37:37.020 align:start position:0%
been two to three hundred million with
 
01:37:39.890 --> 01:37:39.900 align:start position:0%
most of it coming from your HHS or maybe
 
01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
some environmental services State
 
01:37:44.450 --> 01:37:44.460 align:start position:0%
revolving loan funds but with arpa I
 
01:37:46.550 --> 01:37:46.560 align:start position:0%
think you can see I think I highlighted
 
01:37:48.649 --> 01:37:48.659 align:start position:0%
a couple of the totals
 
01:37:48.659 --> 01:37:51.410 align:start position:0%
a couple of the totals
um

01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
on page 65 we know that in 22
 
01:37:55.920 --> 01:37:56.810 align:start position:0%
on page 65 we know that in 22
um

01:37:56.810 --> 01:37:56.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
a total of 1.5 billion dollars of
 
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
federal funds came in through fiscal for
 
01:38:02.940 --> 01:38:04.490 align:start position:0%
federal funds came in through fiscal for
22.

01:38:04.490 --> 01:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
22.
 
01:38:07.370 --> 01:38:07.380 align:start position:0%
um and then in 23 that amount
 
01:38:07.380 --> 01:38:08.689 align:start position:0%
um and then in 23 that amount
um

01:38:08.689 --> 01:38:08.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:10.870 --> 01:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
being already in the
 
01:38:13.510 --> 01:38:13.520 align:start position:0%
651 million dollars
 
01:38:15.770 --> 01:38:15.780 align:start position:0%
of additional federal funds and that's
 
01:38:18.470 --> 01:38:18.480 align:start position:0%
on page 72 so almost 2 billion dollars
 
01:38:20.510 --> 01:38:20.520 align:start position:0%
have come in through fiscal and that is
 
01:38:22.850 --> 01:38:22.860 align:start position:0%
not that is only because of your arpa
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
funds your 1.25 billion in the first uh
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
of our cares funds received and another
 
01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.139 align:start position:0%
billion dollars that was received under
 
01:38:32.750 --> 01:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
that program as well as all the
 
01:38:35.590 --> 01:38:35.600 align:start position:0%
individual Federal Acts that have passed
 
01:38:38.750 --> 01:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
after passage to the budget or
 
01:38:38.760 --> 01:38:39.709 align:start position:0%
after passage to the budget or
um

01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:42.530 --> 01:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
are not going to be ongoing operating
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
budget expenses since they do the
 
01:38:46.250 --> 01:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
authority to use these funds does run
 
01:38:49.010 --> 01:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
out also on that fiscal committee uh
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
reporting uh you will see a column
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
called General funds and so there are
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
instances where the fiscal committee is
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
given specific Authority by the
 
01:38:59.270 --> 01:38:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislature to appropriate General funds
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
not for every agency but for specific
 
01:39:04.610 --> 01:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
agencies judicial Council for Indigent
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
defense department of justice for
 
01:39:09.050 --> 01:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
litigation expenditures those will be
 
01:39:11.149 --> 01:39:11.159 align:start position:0%
two issues that division one will be
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
talking about because historically those
 
01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:16.560 align:start position:0%
are agencies that come back and ask
 
01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal for additional General funds they
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
do have the discussion during the budget
 
01:39:22.070 --> 01:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
process whether or not to budget those
 
01:39:26.209 --> 01:39:26.219 align:start position:0%
funds in the operating budget but
 
01:39:28.610 --> 01:39:28.620 align:start position:0%
historically what the legislature has
 
01:39:30.470 --> 01:39:30.480 align:start position:0%
decided to do is to have them come back
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee if they need it
 
01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:34.189 align:start position:0%
to fiscal committee if they need it
um

01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:35.930 --> 01:39:35.940 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice for instance it
 
01:39:37.570 --> 01:39:37.580 align:start position:0%
gives the fiscal committee
 
01:39:40.729 --> 01:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
a little more oversight into
 
01:39:43.430 --> 01:39:43.440 align:start position:0%
expenditures for outside attorneys or
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
any other litigation expenses as opposed
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
to a block appropriation in the budget
 
01:39:49.010 --> 01:39:49.020 align:start position:0%
but it's really up to the legislature
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
what they're comfortable with and then
 
01:39:52.729 --> 01:39:52.739 align:start position:0%
there are a couple other small instances
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
where agencies can come in and ask for
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
additional General funds in the events
 
01:39:59.090 --> 01:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
or emergencies or shortfalls but not
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
every agency has that opportunity only
 
01:40:01.320 --> 01:40:03.470 align:start position:0%
every agency has that opportunity only
uh

01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:05.629 --> 01:40:05.639 align:start position:0%
only when fiscal is given that exclusive
 
01:40:07.910 --> 01:40:07.920 align:start position:0%
That explicit Authority from the full
 
01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:09.410 align:start position:0%
That explicit Authority from the full
legislature

01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:40:12.530 --> 01:40:12.540 align:start position:0%
just to clear up that um
 
01:40:14.629 --> 01:40:14.639 align:start position:0%
and then if I were to go all the way
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
through the end of that document and to
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
page 87 and I won't take up too much
 
01:40:21.470 --> 01:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
your time but the annual comprehensive
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
financial report will be presented to
 
01:40:24.890 --> 01:40:24.900 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee on their first
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
meeting which is next uh week from this
 
01:40:30.649 --> 01:40:30.659 align:start position:0%
Friday so the 27th
 
01:40:32.689 --> 01:40:32.699 align:start position:0%
annual comprehensive reporters the
 
01:40:35.270 --> 01:40:35.280 align:start position:0%
so-called Aquarius to be referred to as
 
01:40:39.169 --> 01:40:39.179 align:start position:0%
the Capper but in this this is basically
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
six months after the close of the fiscal
 
01:40:41.639 --> 01:40:42.550 align:start position:0%
six months after the close of the fiscal
year

01:40:42.550 --> 01:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:45.050 --> 01:40:45.060 align:start position:0%
the state must have an audited financial
 
01:40:47.330 --> 01:40:47.340 align:start position:0%
report of all their expenditures and
 
01:40:49.669 --> 01:40:49.679 align:start position:0%
revenues and activity for that fiscal
 
01:40:49.679 --> 01:40:50.530 align:start position:0%
revenues and activity for that fiscal
year

01:40:50.530 --> 01:40:50.540 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:40:53.209 --> 01:40:53.219 align:start position:0%
this the cappers this was what actually
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
happened and this is not going to change
 
01:40:58.669 --> 01:40:58.679 align:start position:0%
um I say that because the committee of
 
01:41:00.110 --> 01:41:00.120 align:start position:0%
conference documents and legislative
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
documents on the Surplus statements are
 
01:41:03.709 --> 01:41:03.719 align:start position:0%
purely estimates but the Catherine for
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
any who is audited final and where we
 
01:41:12.010 --> 01:41:12.020 align:start position:0%
ended up so on page 88 for instance
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
this will give you uh it's kind of a
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
summary of a general education trust
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
fund on a surplus statement type
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
presentation but it will show kind of
 
01:41:25.010 --> 01:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
where you were where you ended up in 22
 
01:41:28.090 --> 01:41:28.100 align:start position:0%
um for revenues for instance uh revenues
 
01:41:31.010 --> 01:41:31.020 align:start position:0%
total editions almost 3.2 billion
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
dollars that was almost 400 million
 
01:41:34.669 --> 01:41:34.679 align:start position:0%
dollars over legislative estimates back
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
in 21.
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
um and then you have Appropriations uh
 
01:41:41.090 --> 01:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
will you see a lapse line you can see
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
the 104.8 million dollars under the
 
01:41:47.810 --> 01:41:47.820 align:start position:0%
deductions 104 was actually lapsed when
 
01:41:49.310 --> 01:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
the committee conference had estimated
 
01:41:51.890 --> 01:41:51.900 align:start position:0%
about 64. so about a 40 million dollar
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
difference additional Appropriations or
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
things that pass by when the budget
 
01:41:58.370 --> 01:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
passes in 21 or when it passes in 23
 
01:42:00.410 --> 01:42:00.420 align:start position:0%
there may be uh individual legislation
 
01:42:02.270 --> 01:42:02.280 align:start position:0%
that passes that appropriates money
 
01:42:04.370 --> 01:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
outside of that process so those would
 
01:42:06.890 --> 01:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
be accounted for as well and then any
 
01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
chances to the rainy day fund Highway
 
01:42:11.870 --> 01:42:11.880 align:start position:0%
fund transfers are directed by my house
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
bill 2 that's why there's 50 million
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
dollars that has gone in but the
 
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
undesignated fund balance
 
01:42:20.830 --> 01:42:20.840 align:start position:0%
um was
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
361.3 million dollars
 
01:42:27.290 --> 01:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
now that is the ending balance in 22 22
 
01:42:28.970 --> 01:42:28.980 align:start position:0%
being the first year of a biennium that
 
01:42:30.770 --> 01:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
would automatically carry over no
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
deposit is made into the rainy day fund
 
01:42:34.850 --> 01:42:34.860 align:start position:0%
until the last year the biennium so the
 
01:42:38.229 --> 01:42:38.239 align:start position:0%
odd numbered year so that 361
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
and that compares to during the
 
01:42:46.570 --> 01:42:46.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:49.729 --> 01:42:49.739 align:start position:0%
from not mistaken
 
01:42:49.739 --> 01:42:51.790 align:start position:0%
from not mistaken
um

01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.530 --> 01:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
67.4 was where we thought 22 would end
 
01:42:56.030 --> 01:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
based on the revenues and appropriation
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's almost a 300 million dollar swing
 
01:43:00.770 --> 01:43:00.780 align:start position:0%
majority of that with Revenue
 
01:43:03.950 --> 01:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
um so it's it's you're gonna see
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
um when the governor releases his budget
 
01:43:08.270 --> 01:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
for 23 the fiscal year we're currently
 
01:43:10.310 --> 01:43:10.320 align:start position:0%
in that's going to vary from what the
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
committee conference uh assumed back in
 
01:43:15.830 --> 01:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
21 uh large largely because through
 
01:43:17.930 --> 01:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
December 200 the state is 200 million
 
01:43:19.910 --> 01:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
dollars up in Revenue now again March
 
01:43:22.129 --> 01:43:22.139 align:start position:0%
and April could change that but
 
01:43:23.750 --> 01:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
um we're in a positive variance we
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
started with a much larger balance board
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
as a result based on the economic
 
01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
briefing which I think is online that I
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
had given a quick snapshot of where we
 
01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
are beginning 23 which I'll present
 
01:43:37.250 --> 01:43:37.260 align:start position:0%
again to house finance once the
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
governor's budget is released but there
 
01:43:42.729 --> 01:43:42.739 align:start position:0%
was almost a you know a surplus of
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
183 million in the general fund right
 
01:43:47.450 --> 01:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
now just based on where our revenues are
 
01:43:48.950 --> 01:43:48.960 align:start position:0%
to date obviously that can change
 
01:43:50.510 --> 01:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
there'll be items that come to fiscal
 
01:43:51.770 --> 01:43:51.780 align:start position:0%
Community to spend additional General
 
01:43:53.570 --> 01:43:53.580 align:start position:0%
funds there'll be additional Revenue
 
01:43:56.390 --> 01:43:56.400 align:start position:0%
changes that occur but the legislature
 
01:43:58.970 --> 01:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
knowing that Revenue in 22 did decide to
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate almost 300 million of uh
 
01:44:04.250 --> 01:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
one-time funding for various various
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
projects so
 
01:44:08.649 --> 01:44:08.659 align:start position:0%
they can't figure in a good position
 
01:44:11.290 --> 01:44:11.300 align:start position:0%
159.9 million dollar in that rainy day
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh fund
 
01:44:15.590 --> 01:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
um and that doesn't include 100 million
 
01:44:17.390 --> 01:44:17.400 align:start position:0%
dollars that was set aside for the uh
 
01:44:20.090 --> 01:44:20.100 align:start position:0%
the YDC settlement so the sununu center
 
01:44:22.250 --> 01:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
a hundred million dollar the legislature
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
722 to move that out of the rainy day
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
fund and set it aside for the YDC
 
01:44:28.609 --> 01:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
settlement so still shows on our books
 
01:44:30.890 --> 01:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
but it's dedicated for that purpose so
 
01:44:32.570 --> 01:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
the state is in a great financial
 
01:44:36.109 --> 01:44:36.119 align:start position:0%
position as we sit here today but as
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
with any budget any estimates we have no
 
01:44:40.310 --> 01:44:40.320 align:start position:0%
idea what's going to happen over the
 
01:44:42.229 --> 01:44:42.239 align:start position:0%
next two or three years so but right now
 
01:44:44.990 --> 01:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
you're in a great position and as far as
 
01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.430 align:start position:0%
you're in a great position and as far as
history

01:44:46.430 --> 01:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
history
 
01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:47.030 align:start position:0%
history
um

01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:49.250 --> 01:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
Pages 18 I'm sorry did representative
 
01:44:51.129 --> 01:44:51.139 align:start position:0%
Edwards have a question sure question
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
so so just to help us Define a great
 
01:44:58.010 --> 01:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
financial position
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
um we have external Bond agencies that
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
have rated the state I understand we're
 
01:45:07.729 --> 01:45:07.739 align:start position:0%
a b-plus state or are we something else
 
01:45:10.010 --> 01:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
uh higher I thought we were double a uh
 
01:45:12.950 --> 01:45:12.960 align:start position:0%
depending on the rating agency yeah okay
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
so we're we're in a double a status now
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
in general yeah we're not the top but
 
01:45:20.030 --> 01:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
we're not uh we are we have a very good
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
Bond rating which is not at the top it
 
01:45:24.830 --> 01:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
just feels like it's gotten higher since
 
01:45:28.729 --> 01:45:28.739 align:start position:0%
I was on Ways and Means and and so uh
 
01:45:31.790 --> 01:45:31.800 align:start position:0%
yep okay yeah I can look it is great I
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
just wanted to know what great Matt okay
 
01:45:35.390 --> 01:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
oh so great I guess it's all relative
 
01:45:37.310 --> 01:45:37.320 align:start position:0%
right so at General and education Trust
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
on your grade if people start
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
questioning you on your retirement
 
01:45:43.010 --> 01:45:43.020 align:start position:0%
system liability or uh yeah they might
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
not say so great but as far as your
 
01:45:47.450 --> 01:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
current cash balance for Budget purposes
 
01:45:50.810 --> 01:45:50.820 align:start position:0%
and journal you're in a great shape so
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
and then as far as uh history
 
01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:54.770 align:start position:0%
and then as far as uh history
um

01:45:54.770 --> 01:45:54.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:57.709 --> 01:45:57.719 align:start position:0%
just kind of the Capper has a great
 
01:46:00.410 --> 01:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
tables this is uh it's on page 148 the
 
01:46:02.390 --> 01:46:02.400 align:start position:0%
cat for 89 of the handout we put in a
 
01:46:04.250 --> 01:46:04.260 align:start position:0%
few of these historic your schedule of
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
unrestricted Revenue uh for the general
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
fund for the last 10 years so you can
 
01:46:12.830 --> 01:46:12.840 align:start position:0%
see uh significant pretty good growth in
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
general fund revenue is a 1.4 million
 
01:46:18.290 --> 01:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
dollar billion dollars in 2013 up to 1.9
 
01:46:20.810 --> 01:46:20.820 align:start position:0%
and that is after any tax changes that
 
01:46:22.430 --> 01:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
were made so the almost two billion
 
01:46:24.530 --> 01:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in taxes
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh page 90 being your education trust
 
01:46:30.169 --> 01:46:30.179 align:start position:0%
fund you can see 10-year history back in
 
01:46:33.950 --> 01:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
2013 through 2017 the education trust
 
01:46:36.169 --> 01:46:36.179 align:start position:0%
fund was in a um the education trust
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
fund is a fund and Mickey will go over
 
01:46:39.470 --> 01:46:39.480 align:start position:0%
it at some point in division two but
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
it's basically uh it's a non-lapsing
 
01:46:45.169 --> 01:46:45.179 align:start position:0%
fund and if in the event that there are
 
01:46:46.790 --> 01:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
not sufficient funds the education trust
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
fund the general fund has to kick in
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
you'll see 2013 through 2017 based on
 
01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
the revenues and the expenditures coming
 
01:46:55.129 --> 01:46:55.139 align:start position:0%
out of the education trust so the
 
01:46:56.629 --> 01:46:56.639 align:start position:0%
general fund had to contribute and that
 
01:46:57.770 --> 01:46:57.780 align:start position:0%
was like that if you look at the
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
previous five years same way but over
 
01:47:01.850 --> 01:47:01.860 align:start position:0%
the last several years you'll see that
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
there's no transfers were required from
 
01:47:08.870 --> 01:47:08.880 align:start position:0%
2019 through 2022 into the education
 
01:47:10.550 --> 01:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
trust fund because the revenue going
 
01:47:12.890 --> 01:47:12.900 align:start position:0%
into that fund uh largest being
 
01:47:14.629 --> 01:47:14.639 align:start position:0%
Statewide education property tax and
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
business taxes were sufficient to fund
 
01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:19.139 align:start position:0%
adequate education or your education
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
Freedom accounts and anything else
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
that's a charge against that fund and
 
01:47:24.290 --> 01:47:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's something the division two will
 
01:47:26.270 --> 01:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
dive into and ensure that there's a
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
balance or at least see education trust
 
01:47:31.370 --> 01:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
fund is in a good position at the close
 
01:47:34.250 --> 01:47:34.260 align:start position:0%
of the budget Mickey landergan will be
 
01:47:36.950 --> 01:47:36.960 align:start position:0%
the one to basically keep um
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
keep track of that so page 91 is
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
education trust fund specific what I
 
01:47:43.850 --> 01:47:43.860 align:start position:0%
showed you before was the general fund
 
01:47:47.030 --> 01:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
um on page 92 is your Highway fund and
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
I'll usually we'll I'll fly right over
 
01:47:52.310 --> 01:47:52.320 align:start position:0%
the highway fund but you can see in 2013
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
a 46.3 million dollar balance in the
 
01:47:57.470 --> 01:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
highway fund
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
um your additions your Revenue into the
 
01:48:03.010 --> 01:48:03.020 align:start position:0%
highway fund were about 285 million in
 
01:48:07.129 --> 01:48:07.139 align:start position:0%
2013. there are 281 million in 2022 so
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
over 10 years have actually declined but
 
01:48:12.490 --> 01:48:12.500 align:start position:0%
the balance in the highway fund is
 
01:48:15.590 --> 01:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
111.6 million dollars that does include
 
01:48:17.570 --> 01:48:17.580 align:start position:0%
50 million dollars that the general fund
 
01:48:19.310 --> 01:48:19.320 align:start position:0%
had deposited into the highway fund last
 
01:48:21.290 --> 01:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
budget process so absent that you'd be
 
01:48:24.890 --> 01:48:24.900 align:start position:0%
in above the 51 million dollar balance
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
but it does exist and it does currently
 
01:48:31.490 --> 01:48:31.500 align:start position:0%
sit uh fishing game is on page 93 again
 
01:48:34.910 --> 01:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
just a kind of a 10-year history your
 
01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
additions your revenues have increased
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
from 11.5 in 2013 to about 14.9 uh the
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
balance of the fund as low as 1.6
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
million actually dropped down to 401
 
01:48:47.629 --> 01:48:47.639 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in 2015 in the fish and
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
game fund but right now uh because of
 
01:48:51.770 --> 01:48:51.780 align:start position:0%
the increases in revenues as well as
 
01:48:54.410 --> 01:48:54.420 align:start position:0%
additional general fund Support over the
 
01:48:56.390 --> 01:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
last few budgets here at about 9.8
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars in the fish and game
 
01:49:00.770 --> 01:49:00.780 align:start position:0%
fund and you're you're talking about a
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
fund with revenues or expenditures right
 
01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
around the 11 million so 9 million
 
01:49:06.169 --> 01:49:06.179 align:start position:0%
dollars is a pretty healthy balance in
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
that fund
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then page 94 I'll just go through
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
this quickly this is uh your schedule of
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
state employees by function for the last
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
10 fiscal years so this is what the
 
01:49:19.250 --> 01:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
kafir reports so you can see the numbers
 
01:49:21.109 --> 01:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
of state employees these are both your
 
01:49:23.810 --> 01:49:23.820 align:start position:0%
part-time your state full-time employees
 
01:49:25.669 --> 01:49:25.679 align:start position:0%
as well as your part-time and temporary
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
employees and this is something that
 
01:49:29.149 --> 01:49:29.159 align:start position:0%
each division will go through with each
 
01:49:30.890 --> 01:49:30.900 align:start position:0%
agency you're going to look at their
 
01:49:32.270 --> 01:49:32.280 align:start position:0%
Staffing accounts you're going to look
 
01:49:33.530 --> 01:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
at there you're going to talk about
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
their vacancy rates this will be one of
 
01:49:38.030 --> 01:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
the it's usually a large discussion or a
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
big discussion in the house when you
 
01:49:40.609 --> 01:49:40.619 align:start position:0%
develop their budget because you're
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
looking historically over what they've
 
01:49:43.970 --> 01:49:43.980 align:start position:0%
been appropriated what they've been able
 
01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
to fill and Etc so
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
further question
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
okay as you as we came out of uh page 93
 
01:49:56.750 --> 01:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh we we had just uh summarized some of
 
01:49:59.930 --> 01:49:59.940 align:start position:0%
the statutory fund balances and and so
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
now I have a trivia question that you
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
may not know the answer to uh the uh the
 
01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board as
 
01:50:12.109 --> 01:50:12.119 align:start position:0%
uh as it exists in current statute
 
01:50:12.119 --> 01:50:12.850 align:start position:0%
uh as it exists in current statute
um

01:50:12.850 --> 01:50:12.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
it has the ability to set its own fees
 
01:50:19.729 --> 01:50:19.739 align:start position:0%
and I think it's also set up to be
 
01:50:22.010 --> 01:50:22.020 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing and the ability to collect
 
01:50:24.890 --> 01:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
125 percent of their budget and stuff
 
01:50:27.790 --> 01:50:27.800 align:start position:0%
are are they gonna are they going to be
 
01:50:30.649 --> 01:50:30.659 align:start position:0%
do you know now how we're going to
 
01:50:34.070 --> 01:50:34.080 align:start position:0%
review that board are they going to have
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
their own fund balance sheet that we
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
that we look at or or
 
01:50:41.930 --> 01:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
do you want to talk about that offline
 
01:50:44.810 --> 01:50:44.820 align:start position:0%
or I a sure yeah so so high level
 
01:50:47.390 --> 01:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
there'll be a the agency budget request
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
I believe had a budget request for
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
01:50:53.990 --> 01:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the governors going over it now
 
01:50:56.750 --> 01:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
and how he'll present the budget if it's
 
01:50:58.729 --> 01:50:58.739 align:start position:0%
a dedicated fund specifically for that
 
01:51:00.709 --> 01:51:00.719 align:start position:0%
board they will be able to provide you
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
maybe not down to this oh yeah your
 
01:51:04.550 --> 01:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
additions and your subtractions from
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
that fund and give you kind of a status
 
01:51:08.270 --> 01:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
of where they see there now or where
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
they think they'll be based on estimated
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
revenues so you could ask them for that
 
01:51:12.239 --> 01:51:14.030 align:start position:0%
revenues so you could ask them for that
absolutely

01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:51:17.629 --> 01:51:17.639 align:start position:0%
ask them for that or or or the LBA will
 
01:51:20.810 --> 01:51:20.820 align:start position:0%
routinely provide it as in the same
 
01:51:23.209 --> 01:51:23.219 align:start position:0%
format as any other fund balance is it
 
01:51:25.370 --> 01:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
going to be different or the same uh
 
01:51:27.050 --> 01:51:27.060 align:start position:0%
it's such it's a small amount so we
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't do a separate Surplus statement
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
for each dedicated fund so I would ask
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
them specifically uh for that we could
 
01:51:35.870 --> 01:51:35.880 align:start position:0%
prepare it with them for you but there's
 
01:51:37.970 --> 01:51:37.980 align:start position:0%
over 300 you know there's hundreds of
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds so
 
01:51:42.770 --> 01:51:42.780 align:start position:0%
um for this the dedicated funding report
 
01:51:44.570 --> 01:51:44.580 align:start position:0%
would have it after the fact but as you
 
01:51:46.189 --> 01:51:46.199 align:start position:0%
develop the budget it's probably
 
01:51:47.570 --> 01:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
something you want to ask us for and
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
we'll help with that together
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
sure and just a reminder there are
 
01:51:54.410 --> 01:51:54.420 align:start position:0%
several agencies that are somewhat
 
01:52:00.129 --> 01:52:00.139 align:start position:0%
supported by fees Insurance Banking and
 
01:52:02.510 --> 01:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
this one you just referred to with with
 
01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:04.250 align:start position:0%
this one you just referred to with with
medic

01:52:04.250 --> 01:52:04.260 align:start position:0%
medic
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
um prescription drugs so the idea is
 
01:52:10.729 --> 01:52:10.739 align:start position:0%
that it it keeps it even so as as new
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
banks are added a new insurance
 
01:52:14.870 --> 01:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
companies are added they are able to to
 
01:52:18.169 --> 01:52:18.179 align:start position:0%
adjust the fees and that agency is
 
01:52:22.729 --> 01:52:22.739 align:start position:0%
expected to provide 125 percent of their
 
01:52:24.649 --> 01:52:24.659 align:start position:0%
costs because the cost usually only
 
01:52:27.050 --> 01:52:27.060 align:start position:0%
reflect the
 
01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
the salaries and the in the heat and
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
light for the office and so on but
 
01:52:34.250 --> 01:52:34.260 align:start position:0%
there's also kind of an unknown cost
 
01:52:36.770 --> 01:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
which is the retirement system so that's
 
01:52:40.129 --> 01:52:40.139 align:start position:0%
why the extra 25 goes in there to ensure
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
that they don't come to us later and say
 
01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:44.760 align:start position:0%
oh by the way we're short on retirement
 
01:52:47.149 --> 01:52:47.159 align:start position:0%
contributions or fringe benefits or
 
01:52:49.189 --> 01:52:49.199 align:start position:0%
something like that so there's some
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
debate over whether that's the right
 
01:52:52.669 --> 01:52:52.679 align:start position:0%
thing to do some people feel there's too
 
01:52:54.770 --> 01:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
much influence by the bank so by the
 
01:52:56.330 --> 01:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
insurance company there's too much
 
01:52:58.669 --> 01:52:58.679 align:start position:0%
coziness of the people that they're
 
01:53:00.830 --> 01:53:00.840 align:start position:0%
doing business with and being audited by
 
01:53:03.649 --> 01:53:03.659 align:start position:0%
that they are also paying them directly
 
01:53:03.659 --> 01:53:04.729 align:start position:0%
that they are also paying them directly
so

01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:53:06.229 --> 01:53:06.239 align:start position:0%
there's somebody we used to have
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
something similar with labor
 
01:53:10.850 --> 01:53:10.860 align:start position:0%
and we switched it over to General funds
 
01:53:13.729 --> 01:53:13.739 align:start position:0%
well they they were producing enough
 
01:53:17.629 --> 01:53:17.639 align:start position:0%
funds in fines and and fees to cover
 
01:53:19.970 --> 01:53:19.980 align:start position:0%
their expenses it was around a million
 
01:53:22.790 --> 01:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
something on that agency but people said
 
01:53:24.830 --> 01:53:24.840 align:start position:0%
oh no this is too cozy and everything so
 
01:53:27.950 --> 01:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
that there's an example of us switching
 
01:53:29.870 --> 01:53:29.880 align:start position:0%
taking their money that they brought in
 
01:53:32.330 --> 01:53:32.340 align:start position:0%
putting it in the general fund and then
 
01:53:35.870 --> 01:53:35.880 align:start position:0%
paying them out object of the general
 
01:53:37.790 --> 01:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
fund what was needed so
 
01:53:39.470 --> 01:53:39.480 align:start position:0%
those are some things we've done in the
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
past and we could still consider in the
 
01:53:43.790 --> 01:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
future thank you sure representative
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
American looks like he has a question
 
01:53:49.550 --> 01:53:49.560 align:start position:0%
representative memory thank you uh I'm
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the at the growth of these uh
 
01:53:55.850 --> 01:53:55.860 align:start position:0%
restricted fund balances and it looks to
 
01:53:58.609 --> 01:53:58.619 align:start position:0%
me like a lot of these agencies are
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
developing their own rainy day fund
 
01:54:03.770 --> 01:54:03.780 align:start position:0%
uh because that's what it appears
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
because it's like what what happens with
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
this when this sounds like it's cash
 
01:54:11.990 --> 01:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
sitting there uh but kind of how does it
 
01:54:15.290 --> 01:54:15.300 align:start position:0%
get out allocated to be spent
 
01:54:18.530 --> 01:54:18.540 align:start position:0%
a fiscal committee so uh fish and game
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
for instance if if they want to
 
01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:21.770 align:start position:0%
for instance if if they want to
um

01:54:21.770 --> 01:54:21.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:23.209 --> 01:54:23.219 align:start position:0%
it's basically called The Fish game
 
01:54:25.129 --> 01:54:25.139 align:start position:0%
Surplus account so it's basically
 
01:54:26.930 --> 01:54:26.940 align:start position:0%
anything that's not budgeted they can
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
come to fiscal and ask for those funds
 
01:54:31.070 --> 01:54:31.080 align:start position:0%
be it for overtime sometimes for patrols
 
01:54:33.649 --> 01:54:33.659 align:start position:0%
sometimes for equipment Highway fund
 
01:54:36.649 --> 01:54:36.659 align:start position:0%
there's Surplus what fiscal usually see
 
01:54:39.350 --> 01:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
is probably soon probably in your
 
01:54:40.609 --> 01:54:40.619 align:start position:0%
February March they'll come in for
 
01:54:42.890 --> 01:54:42.900 align:start position:0%
winter maintenance depending on they'll
 
01:54:45.410 --> 01:54:45.420 align:start position:0%
use the highway Surplus account but they
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
do need fiscal committee and genes the
 
01:54:49.010 --> 01:54:49.020 align:start position:0%
government Council of approval before
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
spending that so a little more flexible
 
01:54:54.770 --> 01:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
than like a rainy day account since they
 
01:54:56.450 --> 01:54:56.460 align:start position:0%
do just need fiscal committee approval
 
01:54:59.629 --> 01:54:59.639 align:start position:0%
to tap into it but they do also have the
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
oversightful legislature when they come
 
01:55:02.770 --> 01:55:02.780 align:start position:0%
back in to make sure that they're not
 
01:55:05.570 --> 01:55:05.580 align:start position:0%
constantly doing that highway I would
 
01:55:06.950 --> 01:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
say and you'll talk about in division
 
01:55:09.350 --> 01:55:09.360 align:start position:0%
two the unrestricted Revenue in the
 
01:55:11.030 --> 01:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
highway fund as a result of the road to
 
01:55:14.330 --> 01:55:14.340 align:start position:0%
so-called gas tax it's pretty steady you
 
01:55:16.370 --> 01:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
know as cars become more efficient and
 
01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:17.629 align:start position:0%
know as cars become more efficient and
so

01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:55:17.639 --> 01:55:18.649 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
you know that's why the general fund had
 
01:55:22.850 --> 01:55:22.860 align:start position:0%
jumped in in the past and uh provided
 
01:55:24.410 --> 01:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
more funding for them but you can see
 
01:55:27.290 --> 01:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
that they're at a very 111 million uh
 
01:55:29.090 --> 01:55:29.100 align:start position:0%
even with the 50 million deposits so
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
they do like to have some type of
 
01:55:32.450 --> 01:55:32.460 align:start position:0%
cushion I don't want to speak for them
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
now but typically even the legislature
 
01:55:36.410 --> 01:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
wants to see the highway in the fish and
 
01:55:38.330 --> 01:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
game fund with some cushion but what
 
01:55:40.729 --> 01:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
level you're comfortable with is
 
01:55:42.470 --> 01:55:42.480 align:start position:0%
definitely up to you
 
01:55:44.450 --> 01:55:44.460 align:start position:0%
we may get something passed in this
 
01:55:44.460 --> 01:55:45.350 align:start position:0%
we may get something passed in this
session

01:55:45.350 --> 01:55:45.360 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
for all the vehicles that don't pay much
 
01:55:49.910 --> 01:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund because they're
 
01:55:49.920 --> 01:55:50.870 align:start position:0%
into the highway fund because they're
Electric

01:55:50.870 --> 01:55:50.880 align:start position:0%
Electric
 
01:55:53.570 --> 01:55:53.580 align:start position:0%
more their margin they're you know
 
01:55:56.629 --> 01:55:56.639 align:start position:0%
hybrid fuels or something so the the
 
01:55:58.189 --> 01:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
biggest thing that goes into the highway
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
fund is the gas tax
 
01:56:04.310 --> 01:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
which is called the toll and it's uh
 
01:56:06.649 --> 01:56:06.659 align:start position:0%
that's why we've had to put more money
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
into them in the last several years
 
01:56:11.030 --> 01:56:11.040 align:start position:0%
because the gas tax wasn't bringing in
 
01:56:12.410 --> 01:56:12.420 align:start position:0%
enough everybody was getting better
 
01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:13.790 align:start position:0%
enough everybody was getting better
mileage

01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
mileage
 
01:56:15.109 --> 01:56:15.119 align:start position:0%
and now we're going to these electric
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
cars and they're going down the road
 
01:56:19.250 --> 01:56:19.260 align:start position:0%
with a thousand pounds
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
of battery versus 80 pounds of gasoline
 
01:56:25.070 --> 01:56:25.080 align:start position:0%
it's a lot more wear and tear on the
 
01:56:27.290 --> 01:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
roads and they're not paying anything so
 
01:56:29.090 --> 01:56:29.100 align:start position:0%
we've argued about that but we've got to
 
01:56:31.490 --> 01:56:31.500 align:start position:0%
try to find some Solution on that this
 
01:56:33.790 --> 01:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
next term hopefully Transportation
 
01:56:36.470 --> 01:56:36.480 align:start position:0%
committee will find something and
 
01:56:40.250 --> 01:56:40.260 align:start position:0%
we'll be involved thank you sure
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
um and then just the next few pages if I
 
01:56:46.070 --> 01:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
take you to page 95 this is really just
 
01:56:48.050 --> 01:56:48.060 align:start position:0%
a summary of your agency budget request
 
01:56:50.330 --> 01:56:50.340 align:start position:0%
uh the first few pages are all funds
 
01:56:51.890 --> 01:56:51.900 align:start position:0%
that's total funds and then you have
 
01:56:55.010 --> 01:56:55.020 align:start position:0%
your general funds uh just based on time
 
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:57.060 align:start position:0%
it basically have your actual and your
 
01:56:58.370 --> 01:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorized for the current
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
biennium your efficiency budget which is
 
01:57:02.930 --> 01:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
set out in statute which should be
 
01:57:04.669 --> 01:57:04.679 align:start position:0%
included or not your additional
 
01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:07.080 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs which is the lack of a
 
01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
better term your wish list or your
 
01:57:12.229 --> 01:57:12.239 align:start position:0%
suspension's statute that require
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
um you know changes so you can see and
 
01:57:17.470 --> 01:57:17.480 align:start position:0%
then your total agency request
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
these numbers will change dramatically
 
01:57:23.390 --> 01:57:23.400 align:start position:0%
your 20 uh 425 when the governor's
 
01:57:25.490 --> 01:57:25.500 align:start position:0%
budget comes out by agency because right
 
01:57:28.189 --> 01:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
now he is going detail uh to the level
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
of the house usually to come up with
 
01:57:32.750 --> 01:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
what he believes should be provided so
 
01:57:36.410 --> 01:57:36.420 align:start position:0%
what is the source of these the agency
 
01:57:39.470 --> 01:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
request in November yes yes the ANC
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
budget request correct this is uh the
 
01:57:43.370 --> 01:57:43.380 align:start position:0%
source of this document the agency
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
better request that released uh that the
 
01:57:47.149 --> 01:57:47.159 align:start position:0%
governor had budget hearings back in
 
01:57:49.370 --> 01:57:49.380 align:start position:0%
November on those
 
01:57:52.010 --> 01:57:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and then just the last few pages 100
 
01:57:54.050 --> 01:57:54.060 align:start position:0%
to 104s
 
01:57:56.810 --> 01:57:56.820 align:start position:0%
and your analysts will uh we'll talk
 
01:57:58.729 --> 01:57:58.739 align:start position:0%
about it with your divisions just on
 
01:58:00.649 --> 01:58:00.659 align:start position:0%
kind of how we can help you through this
 
01:58:02.450 --> 01:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
process there's a lot of numbers there's
 
01:58:05.149 --> 01:58:05.159 align:start position:0%
a lot of documents really our job is to
 
01:58:07.129 --> 01:58:07.139 align:start position:0%
assist you
 
01:58:09.950 --> 01:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
um in getting a document out getting a
 
01:58:12.229 --> 01:58:12.239 align:start position:0%
budget out in the past from your
 
01:58:14.209 --> 01:58:14.219 align:start position:0%
committee so you can see we like to keep
 
01:58:17.209 --> 01:58:17.219 align:start position:0%
you organized on page 100 we like to put
 
01:58:21.169 --> 01:58:21.179 align:start position:0%
together indexes of any amendments that
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
are provided so when the divisions
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
present to the full committee on here's
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
what we believe this portion of the
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
budget should be that everyone can
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
follow along will provide you with um
 
01:58:32.629 --> 01:58:32.639 align:start position:0%
you know the section whether or not
 
01:58:34.189 --> 01:58:34.199 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment if there was an
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
amendment uh and the recommendation will
 
01:58:38.570 --> 01:58:38.580 align:start position:0%
include that and you can see on page 102
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
just kind of examples of what those
 
01:58:43.250 --> 01:58:43.260 align:start position:0%
amendments look like we'll work with the
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
legislative services to develop those
 
01:58:46.790 --> 01:58:46.800 align:start position:0%
amendments based on the discussions and
 
01:58:49.910 --> 01:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
decisions you have in your Division and
 
01:58:53.030 --> 01:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
then on page 104 it's very small I
 
01:58:55.010 --> 01:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
apologize I kind of shrunk it down for
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
this presentation but this is our detail
 
01:58:58.910 --> 01:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
chain sheet this is a document we'll
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
start the minute the house approves a
 
01:59:05.570 --> 01:59:05.580 align:start position:0%
change to a one of the lines we'll make
 
01:59:07.250 --> 01:59:07.260 align:start position:0%
sure that we keep track of this this is
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
something our analysts keep track of
 
01:59:11.689 --> 01:59:11.699 align:start position:0%
internally as the house finance budgets
 
01:59:13.669 --> 01:59:13.679 align:start position:0%
developed as well as the Senate and
 
01:59:16.129 --> 01:59:16.139 align:start position:0%
Community Conference to ensure we're
 
01:59:18.589 --> 01:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
tracking everything also to put some
 
01:59:23.290 --> 01:59:23.300 align:start position:0%
comments in there of yes there's a um
 
01:59:27.470 --> 01:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
175 and 225 000 Edition over the benium
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
but what is it for so we like to put you
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
know if you look on the budget document
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
the compare report doesn't really tell
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
you much the detail changes to really
 
01:59:37.609 --> 01:59:37.619 align:start position:0%
provide a very high level but a little
 
01:59:39.770 --> 01:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
more detail on like adding funding for
 
01:59:41.209 --> 01:59:41.219 align:start position:0%
the Small Business Development Center
 
01:59:43.729 --> 01:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
making a change because of a change to
 
01:59:46.850 --> 01:59:46.860 align:start position:0%
maybe some employees but these changes
 
01:59:49.609 --> 01:59:49.619 align:start position:0%
will add in foot to uh the compare
 
01:59:51.229 --> 01:59:51.239 align:start position:0%
report which is a larger document
 
01:59:53.410 --> 01:59:53.420 align:start position:0%
comparing so we think this is a very
 
01:59:56.149 --> 01:59:56.159 align:start position:0%
helpful document for our office to keep
 
01:59:57.890 --> 01:59:57.900 align:start position:0%
track of everything that the legislature
 
02:00:00.649 --> 02:00:00.659 align:start position:0%
does but also for the legislature and
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
the public to keep it track could keep
 
02:00:06.050 --> 02:00:06.060 align:start position:0%
track of what's been changing and that
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
is all I have for now
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
left a couple minutes excellent timing
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I rushed through a couple so for the
 
02:00:16.669 --> 02:00:16.679 align:start position:0%
committee this reminds me of an old
 
02:00:20.149 --> 02:00:20.159 align:start position:0%
military expression drinking from a fire
 
02:00:22.609 --> 02:00:22.619 align:start position:0%
hose you're not getting much and a lot
 
02:00:25.430 --> 02:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
of it's splashing around your ears but
 
02:00:25.440 --> 02:00:26.510 align:start position:0%
of it's splashing around your ears but
um

02:00:26.510 --> 02:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:28.189 --> 02:00:28.199 align:start position:0%
these are these are handy things to hang
 
02:00:30.229 --> 02:00:30.239 align:start position:0%
on to and if you want to refer back to
 
02:00:32.089 --> 02:00:32.099 align:start position:0%
them and and of course you'll have your
 
02:00:34.430 --> 02:00:34.440 align:start position:0%
your Genius experts in within each
 
02:00:37.010 --> 02:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
division a little give you more details
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
as you need it but
 
02:00:39.000 --> 02:00:39.589 align:start position:0%
as you need it but
um

02:00:39.589 --> 02:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:42.290 --> 02:00:42.300 align:start position:0%
I am so happy to be working with the LBA
 
02:00:44.209 --> 02:00:44.219 align:start position:0%
all these years these these people do a
 
02:00:48.410 --> 02:00:48.420 align:start position:0%
great job uh make us produce a great
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
product we couldn't do it without them
 
02:00:52.729 --> 02:00:52.739 align:start position:0%
so I'm delighted to have all your people
 
02:00:55.129 --> 02:00:55.139 align:start position:0%
here thank you
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
further questions about the material
 
02:01:01.609 --> 02:01:01.619 align:start position:0%
too many to uh answer Jr go ahead thank
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman uh page 94 so you're
 
02:01:06.890 --> 02:01:06.900 align:start position:0%
giving us a 10-year look back right
 
02:01:10.070 --> 02:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
regarding some level of funds right in
 
02:01:12.770 --> 02:01:12.780 align:start position:0%
this case right this was the employees
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
yes how
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
at what level do you have that by
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
Department So within division three for
 
02:01:21.350 --> 02:01:21.360 align:start position:0%
instance would you have that for DHHS as
 
02:01:22.910 --> 02:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
a whole would you have that for within
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
divisions as a right how far down could
 
02:01:28.729 --> 02:01:28.739 align:start position:0%
you do a statement like that
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
so that would require Health and Human
 
02:01:30.960 --> 02:01:32.510 align:start position:0%
so that would require Health and Human
Services

02:01:32.510 --> 02:01:32.520 align:start position:0%
Services
 
02:01:35.149 --> 02:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
um my guess is they should and have been
 
02:01:36.950 --> 02:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
asked in the past to provide a history
 
02:01:40.970 --> 02:01:40.980 align:start position:0%
by division uh by accounting unit of um
 
02:01:42.830 --> 02:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
when I say accounting unit one function
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
of the number of employees so
 
02:01:47.450 --> 02:01:47.460 align:start position:0%
they should be able to provide that to
 
02:01:48.709 --> 02:01:48.719 align:start position:0%
you and historically have been able to
 
02:01:51.229 --> 02:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
provide that thank you okay uh second
 
02:01:51.239 --> 02:01:52.089 align:start position:0%
provide that thank you okay uh second
question

02:01:52.089 --> 02:01:52.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:01:55.250 --> 02:01:55.260 align:start position:0%
if if I could just add to that
 
02:01:58.010 --> 02:01:58.020 align:start position:0%
um the the second strategic topic that
 
02:01:59.510 --> 02:01:59.520 align:start position:0%
we're going to review in division three
 
02:02:02.209 --> 02:02:02.219 align:start position:0%
is is Manpower where they're going to
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
break it down into that level and if
 
02:02:06.169 --> 02:02:06.179 align:start position:0%
you're not satisfied with the breakdown
 
02:02:08.750 --> 02:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
that they they come ready to give us we
 
02:02:10.609 --> 02:02:10.619 align:start position:0%
we can ask them questions and we still
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
have a few weeks to get them to respond
 
02:02:12.599 --> 02:02:13.850 align:start position:0%
have a few weeks to get them to respond
so

02:02:13.850 --> 02:02:13.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:15.290 --> 02:02:15.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:15.950 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:18.709 --> 02:02:18.719 align:start position:0%
second question page nine something here
 
02:02:20.870 --> 02:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
to add I believe the budget actually has
 
02:02:22.189 --> 02:02:22.199 align:start position:0%
the counts for every one of the
 
02:02:26.030 --> 02:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:29.629 --> 02:02:29.639 align:start position:0%
on page 96 if I'm reading this correctly
 
02:02:31.810 --> 02:02:31.820 align:start position:0%
um the Departments have requested almost
 
02:02:37.010 --> 02:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
16.3 billion dollars over the 24.25 is
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
that that is correct and that's jumping
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
from roughly 13 and a half in this
 
02:02:50.089 --> 02:02:50.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:54.050 --> 02:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
now representative memrick yes what
 
02:02:56.330 --> 02:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
I still call it the kafir when are we
 
02:02:58.729 --> 02:02:58.739 align:start position:0%
going to get the the printed so we have
 
02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:01.020 align:start position:0%
hard copies ready to we'll bring them
 
02:03:01.020 --> 02:03:02.089 align:start position:0%
hard copies ready to we'll bring them
over

02:03:02.089 --> 02:03:02.099 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:03:02.099 --> 02:03:02.930 align:start position:0%
over
um
