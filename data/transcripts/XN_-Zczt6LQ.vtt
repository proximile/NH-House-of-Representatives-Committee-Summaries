00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
rise States America to the rep which
 
00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
stand One Nation God indivisible with
 
00:08:34.589 --> 00:08:34.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:37.630 --> 00:08:37.640 align:start position:0%
you and we will call the prime sponsor
 
00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:50.230 align:start position:0%
you and we will call the prime sponsor
representative

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
Aly I uh want to present the HB
 
00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:02.720 align:start position:0%
383 it's about uh Condominiums and since
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
the housing committee I don't think has
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
anybody on it that has been having to
 
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:10.760 align:start position:0%
deal with this over and over marel were
 
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:12.040 align:start position:0%
you on
 
00:09:15.470 --> 00:09:15.480 align:start position:0%
Commerce um I was on commer yest had
 
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:18.550 align:start position:0%
Commerce um I was on commer yest had
you're

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
right yes they're coming here which was
 
00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.389 align:start position:0%
right yes they're coming here which was
a

00:09:23.389 --> 00:09:23.399 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
surprise a pleasant surprise in some
 
00:09:25.880 --> 00:09:27.509 align:start position:0%
surprise a pleasant surprise in some
ways

00:09:27.509 --> 00:09:27.519 align:start position:0%
ways
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
since Commerce passes is about half of
 
00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
our stuff but
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
on so I have two things here one of them
 
00:09:38.829 --> 00:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
is a presentation to the housing
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee it's about uh condominiums in
 
00:09:46.350 --> 00:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
our state and the wide variations in
 
00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:50.880 align:start position:0%
them and the difficulty of uh
 
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
on providing law
 
00:09:59.470 --> 00:09:59.480 align:start position:0%
for for groups that go from
 
00:10:04.389 --> 00:10:04.399 align:start position:0%
over a thousand people in one seasonal
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
Campground I think it's about if I
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
remember correctly
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
4,000 uh to
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
duplexes and quad
 
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.710 align:start position:0%
duplexes and quad
plexes

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
plexes
 
00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:19.069 align:start position:0%
plexes
where

00:10:19.069 --> 00:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
uh we in I was uh I created the
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
condominium committee study committee in
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
200 and
 
00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
10 uh and we had two Democrats and two
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
Republicans and we worked together and
 
00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
we figured out everything we thought we
 
00:10:42.629 --> 00:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
wanted to do and then the next term was
 
00:10:46.829 --> 00:10:46.839 align:start position:0%
the O'Brien years so um the committee
 
00:10:46.839 --> 00:10:48.550 align:start position:0%
the O'Brien years so um the committee
went

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
went
 
00:10:50.949 --> 00:10:50.959 align:start position:0%
uh went
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
on in a very different
 
00:10:57.829 --> 00:10:57.839 align:start position:0%
direction and the term after that two of
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
the people from that and two new people
 
00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
got together and uh have we'd been
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
working for quite a long time trying to
 
00:11:13.069 --> 00:11:13.079 align:start position:0%
figure out how to provide
 
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
law uh for about governance that would
 
00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:18.750 align:start position:0%
law uh for about governance that would
help

00:11:18.750 --> 00:11:18.760 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:11:24.030 --> 00:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
Condominiums uh to to uh govern
 
00:11:27.310 --> 00:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
themselves there were that was my
 
00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:32.200 align:start position:0%
original intent I run a uh 22 unit
 
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
Homeowner Association which I was put in
 
00:11:37.509 --> 00:11:37.519 align:start position:0%
charge of 6 months after I arrived 30
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
years ago uh and got out of for five
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
years and got brought back because no
 
00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:51.399 align:start position:0%
one else wanted to do it um but
 
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:56.160 align:start position:0%
um I realized that Condominiums and
 
00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:58.519 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations which is what I
 
00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:00.680 align:start position:0%
am is
 
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:04.040 align:start position:0%
are on
 
00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.990 align:start position:0%
are on
a

00:12:05.990 --> 00:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:12:10.790 --> 00:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
a sorry I've been in CTS for three weeks
 
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.160 align:start position:0%
uh it are small
 
00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:17.800 align:start position:0%
governments some of them aren't so small
 
00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
like Freedom New Hampshire which is uh
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
has this uh 4,000 something I think it
 
00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:30.320 align:start position:0%
is uh unit summer well not just summer
 
00:12:37.269 --> 00:12:37.279 align:start position:0%
but not not winter uh on essentially
 
00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
Campground uh and it is a condominium
 
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
and it has it all of its documents in in
 
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:48.800 align:start position:0%
the uh Register of Deeds there but it is
 
00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
a very different animal from four people
 
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
in one uh quadplex trying to work with
 
00:13:01.189 --> 00:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
each other when one of them hates the
 
00:13:05.470 --> 00:13:05.480 align:start position:0%
others or is hated by the others um or
 
00:13:07.870 --> 00:13:07.880 align:start position:0%
they're fighting about whether they're
 
00:13:12.509 --> 00:13:12.519 align:start position:0%
going to paint and and who gets to make
 
00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:13.710 align:start position:0%
going to paint and and who gets to make
the

00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
rules and uh there is everything in
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
between there are Luxury Condominiums
 
00:13:22.110 --> 00:13:22.120 align:start position:0%
there are lowincome
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
Condominiums and
 
00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
um the statute before we got together
 
00:13:31.470 --> 00:13:31.480 align:start position:0%
and started working on it contained
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
almost nothing about how you
 
00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:36.990 align:start position:0%
almost nothing about how you
vote

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:37.000 align:start position:0%
vote
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
on how you how you make rules
 
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
on what uh
 
00:13:49.949 --> 00:13:49.959 align:start position:0%
acceptable forms of of structure
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
are and
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
on the group that I was usually in um
 
00:13:59.629 --> 00:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
provided this structure
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
over the years but we also realized
 
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
eventually because every people didn't
 
00:14:09.509 --> 00:14:09.519 align:start position:0%
really know we existed but every now and
 
00:14:11.509 --> 00:14:11.519 align:start position:0%
then a condominium that was in trouble
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
would find out and people would would
 
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
come to our committee meetings and talk
 
00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:20.720 align:start position:0%
with us about it and um there is
 
00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely no
 
00:14:25.389 --> 00:14:25.399 align:start position:0%
way to
 
00:14:25.399 --> 00:14:27.509 align:start position:0%
way to
uh

00:14:27.509 --> 00:14:27.519 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:14:31.189 --> 00:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
get if if a homeowners association or a
 
00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
Condominium Association is run by a
 
00:14:39.470 --> 00:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
manager who controls the board or is run
 
00:14:42.269 --> 00:14:42.279 align:start position:0%
by a board which consists
 
00:14:48.629 --> 00:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
of four or five people who appoint their
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
successors rather than have real
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
elections about it so that you get a
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%
click that has had uh a one particular
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
idea of where the condominium should be
 
00:15:03.749 --> 00:15:03.759 align:start position:0%
going you've got a lot of people outside
 
00:15:07.949 --> 00:15:07.959 align:start position:0%
of them that uh disagree with this and
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
can't figure out what to do the only
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
thing they can do is at this point still
 
00:15:17.949 --> 00:15:17.959 align:start position:0%
is to go to the uh Superior
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
Court and file a lawsuit that
 
00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399 align:start position:0%
takes at a minimum two years before you
 
00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.110 align:start position:0%
takes at a minimum two years before you
get

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
get
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
heard and it costs about 20 it cost
 
00:15:32.309 --> 00:15:32.319 align:start position:0%
about $220,000 10 years
 
00:15:37.629 --> 00:15:37.639 align:start position:0%
ago uh to to do and during the time that
 
00:15:41.629 --> 00:15:41.639 align:start position:0%
after you filed that lawsuit uh in a lot
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
of cases you're getting uh persecuted by
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
by the board you're getting fined for
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
for things nobody had ever heard of you
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
there was one extreme case of a
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
lowincome condominium that was within a
 
00:16:04.269 --> 00:16:04.279 align:start position:0%
project uh that was going to be
 
00:16:08.749 --> 00:16:08.759 align:start position:0%
developed as non low income and it they
 
00:16:11.749 --> 00:16:11.759 align:start position:0%
started out with a lowincome one and it
 
00:16:15.189 --> 00:16:15.199 align:start position:0%
was bought by a new developer and he
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
decided that he didn't want them there
 
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
and so there was an elevator there was a
 
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:23.240 align:start position:0%
woman who was
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
disabled and had real trouble walking
 
00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:28.720 align:start position:0%
upstairs the elevator broke down all the
 
00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:32.959 align:start position:0%
time time and there was was a person who
 
00:16:37.389 --> 00:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
had red paint thrown at her door uh in
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
other places there would be uh the snow
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
plow would plow straight through your
 
00:16:47.949 --> 00:16:47.959 align:start position:0%
lawn and winter uh and it can be quite
 
00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:49.590 align:start position:0%
lawn and winter uh and it can be quite
unpleasant

00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
unpleasant
 
00:16:53.670 --> 00:16:53.680 align:start position:0%
on and then there are cases where
 
00:16:58.309 --> 00:16:58.319 align:start position:0%
um the after a long time of suffering
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
the people in the
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
condominium uh
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
turned uh decided that they were going
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
to take matters into their own hands
 
00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.750 align:start position:0%
to take matters into their own hands
they

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:17:18.029 --> 00:17:18.039 align:start position:0%
uh did a uh informal vote for for a uh
 
00:17:18.039 --> 00:17:19.069 align:start position:0%
uh did a uh informal vote for for a uh
special

00:17:19.069 --> 00:17:19.079 align:start position:0%
special
 
00:17:23.150 --> 00:17:23.160 align:start position:0%
meeting and then they uh managed to get
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
the local police to stand by while while
 
00:17:29.310 --> 00:17:29.320 align:start position:0%
they met with the board and the manager
 
00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:34.520 align:start position:0%
who was the problem uh and they
 
00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:40.440 align:start position:0%
undid uh they they uh legitimized the
 
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:43.640 align:start position:0%
special meeting and then they voted out
 
00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
the board and the next week they created
 
00:17:49.789 --> 00:17:49.799 align:start position:0%
a new board and they voted out the
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
manager and since then they've been in
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
great shape but it's
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
um it's it's a very complex thing
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the Condominiums have
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
different kinds of requirements for
 
00:18:07.029 --> 00:18:07.039 align:start position:0%
voting and for other things a lot of
 
00:18:10.390 --> 00:18:10.400 align:start position:0%
them make sense what do you do with a
 
00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.990 align:start position:0%
them make sense what do you do with a
4,000

00:18:11.990 --> 00:18:12.000 align:start position:0%
4,000
 
00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:13.789 align:start position:0%
4,000
member

00:18:13.789 --> 00:18:13.799 align:start position:0%
member
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
uh spring fall
 
00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
summer uh group that is really there to
 
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640 align:start position:0%
play in order to get them
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
all or even a majority of them to a
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
meeting and then how do you run that
 
00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:32.360 align:start position:0%
meeting that's totally different from
 
00:18:36.190 --> 00:18:36.200 align:start position:0%
what everybody else faces so um that
 
00:18:37.390 --> 00:18:37.400 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:18:42.549 --> 00:18:42.559 align:start position:0%
all and I apologize for saying it uh
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
apart from this
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
bill uh because um next year we're I'm
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
going to find some other people to help
 
00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
me and we're going to bring in again the
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow a quasi Jud IAL uh
 
00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
solution to this problem that allows
 
00:19:08.830 --> 00:19:08.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility depending on the kinds of of
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
condominium that you've got
 
00:19:15.909 --> 00:19:15.919 align:start position:0%
and this is based on the manufactured
 
00:19:19.590 --> 00:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
housing board that existed until fairly
 
00:19:22.669 --> 00:19:22.679 align:start position:0%
recently but was dormant for about 10
 
00:19:28.270 --> 00:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
years before that uh they they set up uh
 
00:19:31.870 --> 00:19:31.880 align:start position:0%
a was a Judiciary System which was
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
linked to the Judiciary System on and
 
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
they they would uh they had people from
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
all of the relevant uh
 
00:19:49.909 --> 00:19:49.919 align:start position:0%
um parts of the problem on that were on
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
the board and they decided
 
00:19:57.990 --> 00:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
cases on that were brought to them by
 
00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.990 align:start position:0%
cases on that were brought to them by
mostly

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:00.000 align:start position:0%
mostly
 
00:20:02.590 --> 00:20:02.600 align:start position:0%
I think a couple of times by the owners
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
of manufactured housing Parks but uh
 
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
most of the time by members of those
 
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:13.080 align:start position:0%
parks and they they had a lawyer on
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
board with them and they would uh write
 
00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:19.720 align:start position:0%
up the case afterwards legal in legal
 
00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:21.880 align:start position:0%
terms and they would hand it over to the
 
00:20:24.510 --> 00:20:24.520 align:start position:0%
Superior Court the Superior Courts now
 
00:20:28.669 --> 00:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
have a wide range of cases about every
 
00:20:30.310 --> 00:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
everything that could occur in a
 
00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:32.640 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing Park and people
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
just have to go to the website find them
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
find the one that fits their situation
 
00:20:42.029 --> 00:20:42.039 align:start position:0%
and go back to the other side of the
 
00:20:45.789 --> 00:20:45.799 align:start position:0%
complaint and and say
 
00:20:49.669 --> 00:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
see and and they that pretty well solves
 
00:20:52.110 --> 00:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
the problem we really need something
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
like that for Condominiums and homeowner
 
00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:58.600 align:start position:0%
associations the uh Municipal ass
 
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
Association for good reason never never
 
00:21:06.190 --> 00:21:06.200 align:start position:0%
helps these groups but they are small
 
00:21:11.269 --> 00:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
governments so uh that's uh that's
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
enough about that uh
 
00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.710 align:start position:0%
enough about that uh
383

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:17.720 align:start position:0%
383
 
00:21:21.669 --> 00:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.870 --> 00:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
that we've been struggling uh the same
 
00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
idea of flexible law for the
 
00:21:30.190 --> 00:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
for these
 
00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:32.230 align:start position:0%
for these
groups

00:21:32.230 --> 00:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
groups
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh we um
 
00:21:39.269 --> 00:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
the condo com study committee was shut
 
00:21:44.029 --> 00:21:44.039 align:start position:0%
down last year because it had been uh
 
00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
there for over 10 years and we were we
 
00:21:51.430 --> 00:21:51.440 align:start position:0%
were in fact still studying things but
 
00:21:54.390 --> 00:21:54.400 align:start position:0%
they it looked like we were just trying
 
00:21:59.029 --> 00:21:59.039 align:start position:0%
to help uh it on different groups as
 
00:22:00.950 --> 00:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
they came in
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
and the problem was that that's the way
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
we were learning how to deal with them
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
in a way that we could put into law so
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't have to keep
 
00:22:14.630 --> 00:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
coming and
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
um we're going to I'm I'm going to go
 
00:22:25.870 --> 00:22:25.880 align:start position:0%
to uh to with that other Bill about that
 
00:22:33.549 --> 00:22:33.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:35.070 align:start position:0%
 
last

00:22:35.070 --> 00:22:35.080 align:start position:0%
last
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
we HP 383 is an attempt to aform
 
00:22:41.430 --> 00:22:41.440 align:start position:0%
condominium some of whose voting
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
practices are contrary to the existing
 
00:22:45.669 --> 00:22:45.679 align:start position:0%
law on the
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
books uh including the 4,000
 
00:22:54.350 --> 00:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
unit Campground
 
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.149 align:start position:0%
unit Campground
um

00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
and uh last year we passed bill that
 
00:23:01.870 --> 00:23:01.880 align:start position:0%
defined exactly what voting
 
00:23:05.390 --> 00:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
proxies of different legal types are and
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
are not because there we were seeing
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
confusion that some boards were saying
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
okay we we can do we can do it this way
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh because there's nothing in the law
 
00:23:20.430 --> 00:23:20.440 align:start position:0%
about that kind of
 
00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
about that kind of
proxy

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:28.870 --> 00:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
and and we um
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
man defined a bit passed a bill that
 
00:23:35.789 --> 00:23:35.799 align:start position:0%
defined exactly on what different kinds
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
of voting proxies were and what what was
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
not considered to be um legal and
 
00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:52.760 align:start position:0%
uh fair to the
 
00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
community uh this year's Bill tries to
 
00:23:59.549 --> 00:23:59.559 align:start position:0%
define the permanence in ability to
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
alter the original condominium
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
declaration which was made by the
 
00:24:08.070 --> 00:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
developer and which most people think is
 
00:24:08.080 --> 00:24:09.510 align:start position:0%
developer and which most people think is
not

00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
alterable but which in quite a few cases
 
00:24:16.269 --> 00:24:16.279 align:start position:0%
does need some altering because the
 
00:24:17.950 --> 00:24:17.960 align:start position:0%
developer was thinking more about
 
00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
himself and his control than he was
 
00:24:23.549 --> 00:24:23.559 align:start position:0%
about the community that would follow
 
00:24:23.559 --> 00:24:25.909 align:start position:0%
about the community that would follow
him

00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
um and also the byw laws which are made
 
00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
partly by the developer and then added
 
00:24:35.750 --> 00:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
to by successive boards and membership
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
votes and finally the rules which some
 
00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
Condominiums have ex rules as well as
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
bylaws and some don't
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
um my Association doesn't
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
uh the rules are usually made by the
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
boards alone
 
00:25:01.149 --> 00:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
but sometimes become the subject of
 
00:25:01.159 --> 00:25:03.630 align:start position:0%
but sometimes become the subject of
membership

00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
membership
 
00:25:06.430 --> 00:25:06.440 align:start position:0%
rebellions it's required by law to
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
register the Declaration and the
 
00:25:11.389 --> 00:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
accompanying plats with the registers of
 
00:25:14.070 --> 00:25:14.080 align:start position:0%
deeds and usually the bylaws and amended
 
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
bylaws are also so registered a few
 
00:25:20.750 --> 00:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
associations also register the rules
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
some associations have amended the
 
00:25:26.430 --> 00:25:26.440 align:start position:0%
Declaration but their developer provided
 
00:25:29.909 --> 00:25:29.919 align:start position:0%
a oh I talked about that already sorry I
 
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:31.880 align:start position:0%
thought it was time to start
 
00:25:34.430 --> 00:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
standardizing but I now believe it needs
 
00:25:37.149 --> 00:25:37.159 align:start position:0%
a group working on it to make it work
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
for everyone and we're not not there yet
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
uh Mr John Cummings sent you the
 
00:25:45.070 --> 00:25:45.080 align:start position:0%
following suggestions for Amendment
 
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:47.840 align:start position:0%
which I mostly agree with but I had
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
expected I think maybe I've got someone
 
00:25:52.950 --> 00:25:52.960 align:start position:0%
from his for
 
00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh it says 400 it was
 
00:26:00.750 --> 00:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
4,000 unit sees condominium in Freedom
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
to come and speak on the other side that
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
and there may be other associations that
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
have come uh if some of you would like
 
00:26:11.789 --> 00:26:11.799 align:start position:0%
to work on the this issue including the
 
00:26:14.830 --> 00:26:14.840 align:start position:0%
people behind I will work with you after
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
a retain decision otherwise this bill
 
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:21.320 align:start position:0%
dies and we figure out more of how to do
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
it next year and I wanted
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
to to uh add uh I made a mistake on the
 
00:26:33.389 --> 00:26:33.399 align:start position:0%
first paragraph I wrote this last night
 
00:26:36.029 --> 00:26:36.039 align:start position:0%
after doing everything else I had to do
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh and um I was thinking your ranking
 
00:26:42.350 --> 00:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
member is actually on the municipal and
 
00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.549 align:start position:0%
member is actually on the municipal and
County

00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
County
 
00:26:43.559 --> 00:26:45.470 align:start position:0%
County
committee

00:26:45.470 --> 00:26:45.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.360 align:start position:0%

you thank you very much I'm sorry if I
 
00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:53.200 align:start position:0%

tired thank you representative Al me
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
questions for representative alme
 
00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
00:27:06.389 --> 00:27:06.399 align:start position:0%
chair um representative Aly um uh in the
 
00:27:10.430 --> 00:27:10.440 align:start position:0%
bill under um Roman numeral 3 the last
 
00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
sentence there says the bylaws can be
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
changed by a simple majority of those
 
00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:19.520 align:start position:0%
present at a properly noticed meeting um
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
do I understand correctly that you want
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
to see that changed to a majority of
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
unit owners and is that something that
 
00:27:29.990 --> 00:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
would want to do after the bill is
 
00:27:32.549 --> 00:27:32.559 align:start position:0%
retained or are you planning to put in
 
00:27:37.070 --> 00:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
effect sorry I'm not planning to put an
 
00:27:42.909 --> 00:27:42.919 align:start position:0%
amendment to that effect because I think
 
00:27:46.509 --> 00:27:46.519 align:start position:0%
that the bill as it is hasn't had enough
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
people looking at it and what i' really
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
like to see is if there are enough
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
people here that are interested in the
 
00:27:59.549 --> 00:27:59.559 align:start position:0%
condominium problem that uh they'd be
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
willing to work on a study of it during
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
during the fall that is retain it if not
 
00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
then then uh we'll um I think what we're
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
going to be trying most next year is to
 
00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.120 align:start position:0%
get that that
 
00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:21.190 align:start position:0%
get that that
uh

00:28:21.190 --> 00:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.470 --> 00:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
on board on board for condominium
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
condominium work because uh the whole
 
00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
the problem is is too big for our uh law
 
00:28:43.190 --> 00:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
books new law book for all of it go
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:52.269 --> 00:28:52.279 align:start position:0%
youe sorry you do agree that the B law
 
00:28:55.230 --> 00:28:55.240 align:start position:0%
should only be changed by a majority of
 
00:28:59.070 --> 00:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:02.509 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:29:02.509 --> 00:29:02.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:07.640 align:start position:0%
um I am a little conflicted by it I we
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
have Pro a big problem of a lot of
 
00:29:11.990 --> 00:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
Condominiums especially the ones that
 
00:29:16.269 --> 00:29:16.279 align:start position:0%
start to fall apart are that uh most of
 
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
their members live in Massachusetts or
 
00:29:24.110 --> 00:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
Florida or someplace like that uh and
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
they just um they get sent
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
on on proxies sometimes to uh to vote on
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
something and just told check the box
 
00:29:41.549 --> 00:29:41.559 align:start position:0%
that is say you agree with all of it uh
 
00:29:44.389 --> 00:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
by the board sometimes the board is very
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
good sometimes it isn't um
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
and uh there are also on a lot of people
 
00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:55.990 align:start position:0%
and uh there are also on a lot of people
my

00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
Association uh we meet twice a year
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
there are only 22 units but only about
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
half of the units show up uh the others
 
00:30:08.990 --> 00:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
are some of them are very elderly some
 
00:30:11.470 --> 00:30:11.480 align:start position:0%
of them are are
 
00:30:13.870 --> 00:30:13.880 align:start position:0%
working 20h hour
 
00:30:18.669 --> 00:30:18.679 align:start position:0%
days uh and they they can come and
 
00:30:21.029 --> 00:30:21.039 align:start position:0%
complain to any of of us anytime they
 
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
want to uh 22 units isn't too bad for
 
00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
that if you got a 100 like
 
00:30:33.509 --> 00:30:33.519 align:start position:0%
my my colleague down the road from me on
 
00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
that gets
 
00:30:40.190 --> 00:30:40.200 align:start position:0%
trickier and if you are in an you have
 
00:30:43.269 --> 00:30:43.279 align:start position:0%
an apartment building with a th000 units
 
00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:43.990 align:start position:0%
an apartment building with a th000 units
in

00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:30:48.070 --> 00:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
it such as uh one of the Reps a long
 
00:30:53.269 --> 00:30:53.279 align:start position:0%
time ago was in on it can seriously fall
 
00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.080 align:start position:0%
apart uh if if the board isn't being
 
00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
renewed by different
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
people uh if the manager is telling them
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
what he thinks ought to happen uh in
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
that particular group it was uh a
 
00:31:14.190 --> 00:31:14.200 align:start position:0%
problem that the original board which
 
00:31:17.029 --> 00:31:17.039 align:start position:0%
continued to every time one of them had
 
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:19.600 align:start position:0%
to leave the others of them would decide
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
who was coming on next and their
 
00:31:25.950 --> 00:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
objective was first and foremost to save
 
00:31:29.669 --> 00:31:29.679 align:start position:0%
everybody money and they did that by by
 
00:31:32.629 --> 00:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
not doing any maintenance for years and
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
years and
 
00:31:37.509 --> 00:31:37.519 align:start position:0%
years and then people started to walk
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
away who had enough money that they
 
00:31:41.590 --> 00:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
could walk away and the others
 
00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.190 align:start position:0%
could walk away and the others
couldn't

00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
couldn't
 
00:31:47.629 --> 00:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
so other questions representative
 
00:31:51.029 --> 00:31:51.039 align:start position:0%
hegner thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:31:53.629 --> 00:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
representative um so I understand you're
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
talking about these smaller um condo
 
00:31:57.549 --> 00:31:57.559 align:start position:0%
complexes that are run by a board of
 
00:32:00.070 --> 00:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
director s what about the larger ones
 
00:32:01.990 --> 00:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
that hire these management companies
 
00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
Evergreen condo management that come in
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
is Don't They isn't aren't they the ones
 
00:32:09.669 --> 00:32:09.679 align:start position:0%
managing making all the decisions the
 
00:32:10.909 --> 00:32:10.919 align:start position:0%
people that live there really don't have
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
any right to say I mean they hire this
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
company they make the
 
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
decisions um they handle the bylaws
 
00:32:18.990 --> 00:32:19.000 align:start position:0%
getting get registered and all that
 
00:32:20.710 --> 00:32:20.720 align:start position:0%
stuff so just trying to understand I
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
guess the difference between the board
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
of directors and then this management
 
00:32:27.230 --> 00:32:27.240 align:start position:0%
company of the large there is always a
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
board of directors the board of
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
directors is supposed to direct the
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
manager on what you're describing
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
frequently does happen that the manager
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
directs the board and um that's what
 
00:32:45.070 --> 00:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
happened in the first case that led uh
 
00:32:48.509 --> 00:32:48.519 align:start position:0%
chair John Hunt to agree that maybe we
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
do have to do something because the that
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
was the one I described in which
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
everybody got together and forced a new
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
election with a police
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
present uh and then on got rid of the
 
00:33:07.470 --> 00:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
manager and then came to his committee
 
00:33:09.269 --> 00:33:09.279 align:start position:0%
and described what they'd been through
 
00:33:12.789 --> 00:33:12.799 align:start position:0%
for 13 years they gave me a copy of a
 
00:33:15.909 --> 00:33:15.919 align:start position:0%
letter they sent 12 years before to John
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
help and he he was the person in in
 
00:33:25.029 --> 00:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
charge of the management company and not
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
the board of directors oh no John Lynch
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
was was was the governor of the state of
 
00:33:32.110 --> 00:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:33:34.870 --> 00:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay so who wasn't helping them out the
 
00:33:37.110 --> 00:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
board the management association that
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
was in charge of management
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
association was on playing favorites on
 
00:33:46.350 --> 00:33:46.360 align:start position:0%
who would get
 
00:33:50.830 --> 00:33:50.840 align:start position:0%
on get their Road their their section of
 
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
Road plowed and and things like that
 
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:57.320 align:start position:0%
they were on they were telling them that
 
00:33:59.549 --> 00:33:59.559 align:start position:0%
certain things were in the law which
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't true on in the end when they got
 
00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:07.480 align:start position:0%
rid of that manager uh she was a smaller
 
00:34:11.069 --> 00:34:11.079 align:start position:0%
manager she only had two Condominiums
 
00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:14.200 align:start position:0%
but there was a condominium uh halfway
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
across the state from them that heard
 
00:34:21.310 --> 00:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
about it and threw her out two weeks
 
00:34:25.310 --> 00:34:25.320 align:start position:0%
later uh but there are there are good
 
00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
managers and there are managers to are
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
sticklers to everything and which can
 
00:34:35.109 --> 00:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes cause problems too uh but
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
managers are supposed to and I was
 
00:34:41.950 --> 00:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
trained by a manager the manager of e of
 
00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
five eastmen uh
 
00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:47.800 align:start position:0%
Condominiums uh when I first came back
 
00:34:50.790 --> 00:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
home uh they
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
were uh she would hold annual meetings
 
00:34:58.190 --> 00:34:58.200 align:start position:0%
and there would be discussion and
 
00:35:01.829 --> 00:35:01.839 align:start position:0%
everybody would talk about about what
 
00:35:04.310 --> 00:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
they liked and what they didn't like and
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
then they would would go away and the
 
00:35:09.310 --> 00:35:09.320 align:start position:0%
board would act on it
 
00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.870 align:start position:0%
board would act on it
properly

00:35:10.870 --> 00:35:10.880 align:start position:0%
properly
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
uh that on the kind that you're talking
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
about nobody gets to see who's making
 
00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:20.990 align:start position:0%
about nobody gets to see who's making
any

00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:35:23.589 --> 00:35:23.599 align:start position:0%
decisions and those are the ones that we
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
really need and sometimes they're
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
small there was one
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
quadplex in which uh a woman bought
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
in uh she was pretty stubborn and she
 
00:35:41.390 --> 00:35:41.400 align:start position:0%
was an accountant and uh she she bought
 
00:35:46.150 --> 00:35:46.160 align:start position:0%
in there and discovered that the
 
00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:50.200 align:start position:0%
um first developer of the of the
 
00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
property uh lived there and had brought
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
in two friends and the friend and she
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
were paying less dues than the woman
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
recruited she spent 2 years fighting it
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
and then I didn't hear from her again so
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts right other questions
 
00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts right other questions
representative

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
buolo thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative uh Aly um so I'm I'm
 
00:36:26.550 --> 00:36:26.560 align:start position:0%
trying to and thank you for telling us a
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
little bit about you know what's going
 
00:36:30.190 --> 00:36:30.200 align:start position:0%
on with condos uh and condo associations
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire but I'm trying to wrap
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
my head specifically around this bill HB
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
385 and the purpose and effect of this
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
bill so can you um please briefly
 
00:36:43.349 --> 00:36:43.359 align:start position:0%
explain the effect of not recording the
 
00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:45.800 align:start position:0%
rules are bylaws and what problem this
 
00:36:47.550 --> 00:36:47.560 align:start position:0%
is solving
 
00:36:51.750 --> 00:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
specifically yes well rules in general
 
00:36:54.470 --> 00:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
in most places that we've heard of the
 
00:36:58.150 --> 00:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
rules on if they're created or cre at by
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:37:02.990 --> 00:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
itself and people can come and complain
 
00:37:04.750 --> 00:37:04.760 align:start position:0%
about them if they have
 
00:37:08.109 --> 00:37:08.119 align:start position:0%
meanings um but they don't get
 
00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:12.400 align:start position:0%
officially put in the I'm not sure why
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
the uh uh totem pole condominium in
 
00:37:22.750 --> 00:37:22.760 align:start position:0%
Freedom um recorded all their roles as
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
well with the registry of
 
00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
deeds which makes them hard to get rid
 
00:37:34.230 --> 00:37:34.240 align:start position:0%
of again but um the the
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
bylaws sometimes do not end up in there
 
00:37:40.309 --> 00:37:40.319 align:start position:0%
it depends on the condominium what they
 
00:37:43.109 --> 00:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
decide to do what Their manager decides
 
00:37:49.109 --> 00:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
to do um there is a condominium in uh
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
Hanover I live next to Handover uh which
 
00:38:00.390 --> 00:38:00.400 align:start position:0%
uh was set up so that the people who
 
00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
with the smaller units would pay the
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
same amount as the people with the
 
00:38:05.119 --> 00:38:06.309 align:start position:0%
same amount as the people with the
larger

00:38:06.309 --> 00:38:06.319 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:38:08.910 --> 00:38:08.920 align:start position:0%
units and there was a guy who contacted
 
00:38:11.309 --> 00:38:11.319 align:start position:0%
me and said isn't there a law about this
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
and I said
 
00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:18.280 align:start position:0%
no that that was my involvement
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
but so um it
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
does it every everything to do with
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
Condominiums and homeowner syst ations
 
00:38:33.430 --> 00:38:33.440 align:start position:0%
is variable that's that's a difficulty
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
it's a challenge but
 
00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
also um we need to do something about it
 
00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
because there there's fairly decent
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
evidence not enough that there are about
 
00:38:52.390 --> 00:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
a sixth of the housed population in this
 
00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.390 align:start position:0%
a sixth of the housed population in this
state

00:38:54.390 --> 00:38:54.400 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.270 align:start position:0%
state
and

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:56.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
the the the developers are now
 
00:39:02.470 --> 00:39:02.480 align:start position:0%
concentrating on M making uh apartment
 
00:39:05.589 --> 00:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
buildings for rent
 
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
because the the
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
way the cost of building and such has
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
changed has made it more profitable for
 
00:39:17.510 --> 00:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
them to do that and they can do it more
 
00:39:20.430 --> 00:39:20.440 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you representative Aaron
 
00:39:22.990 --> 00:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative uh alme
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just following up
 
00:39:28.710 --> 00:39:28.720 align:start position:0%
on representative B question is there a
 
00:39:31.550 --> 00:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
difference in the way the bylaws are
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
enforced whether they are uh registered
 
00:39:38.630 --> 00:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
with the register of deeds or not the
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
register of deeds does not follow up on
 
00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:45.800 align:start position:0%
this I had one case that I took care of
 
00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
during the summer that was referred to
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
me by by a
 
00:39:55.109 --> 00:39:55.119 align:start position:0%
representative uh in that town and it
 
00:40:00.470 --> 00:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
was a essentially a a ski condominium so
 
00:40:03.470 --> 00:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of the people didn't live in it
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
and it was completely falling apart uh I
 
00:40:10.109 --> 00:40:10.119 align:start position:0%
went to the register of deeds for her
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
and I found out that the the president
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
together with the treasurer with no
 
00:40:19.990 --> 00:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
Knowledge from the group had had
 
00:40:21.790 --> 00:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
00:40:25.230 --> 00:40:25.240 align:start position:0%
mortgaged essentially the
 
00:40:27.829 --> 00:40:27.839 align:start position:0%
condominium to
 
00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079 align:start position:0%
uh to a local
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
bank uh and then two years later without
 
00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
no idea that it been paid back but it
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
must have been paid back on they did the
 
00:40:43.710 --> 00:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
same thing again but only the president
 
00:40:46.470 --> 00:40:46.480 align:start position:0%
signed it because the treasure was now
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
no longer a member and was living in
 
00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.550 align:start position:0%
no longer a member and was living in
South

00:40:51.550 --> 00:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:54.990 --> 00:40:55.000 align:start position:0%
Carolina uh that's that's the kind of
 
00:40:58.309 --> 00:40:58.319 align:start position:0%
messes that things get into
 
00:41:03.150 --> 00:41:03.160 align:start position:0%
but I don't want to take up too much
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
time because there yes I appreciate that
 
00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
there are other people here to testify
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
are there other questions for
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
representative Aly representative Howen
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm just trying to follow up on
 
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron's question so would
 
00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:15.280 align:start position:0%
my recourse be if you violated what you
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
thought were the rules just to go to
 
00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:19.550 align:start position:0%
thought were the rules just to go to
court

00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
um that's the last recourse for all the
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
people that we've talked to because it
 
00:41:28.630 --> 00:41:28.640 align:start position:0%
costs a lot of money
 
00:41:32.430 --> 00:41:32.440 align:start position:0%
and because uh it takes a lot of time
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
and while it's taking that time you
 
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
n all right any other questions seean
 
00:41:44.750 --> 00:41:44.760 align:start position:0%

nature of these types of rules invites
 
00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
frequent change and having the rules run
 
00:46:24.750 --> 00:46:24.760 align:start position:0%
with a land due to the regy of Deeds
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
filing is really not necessary
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
the requirement to keep the rules
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
current at the registry of deeds is an
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary burden placed on the board
 
00:46:38.069 --> 00:46:38.079 align:start position:0%
of directors which frankly today
 
00:46:41.910 --> 00:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
are are overburdened as it is the rules
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
can be written so that the first offense
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
may result in a warning letter
 
00:46:49.109 --> 00:46:49.119 align:start position:0%
subsequent offenses can occur fines
 
00:46:52.349 --> 00:46:52.359 align:start position:0%
until the offense is remedy The Vineyard

HB
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
383 uh I will also say The Vineyards has
 
00:47:03.750 --> 00:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
term limits so we don't have board of
 
00:47:06.630 --> 00:47:06.640 align:start position:0%
directors going on and on forever and
 
00:47:09.829 --> 00:47:09.839 align:start position:0%
ever term limits you can serve two terms
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
and then you have to not serve on the
 
00:47:14.630 --> 00:47:14.640 align:start position:0%
board again thank you very much
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%

Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:47:28.430 --> 00:47:28.440 align:start position:0%
Mr sweat um when you refer ref to a 2/3
 
00:47:30.870 --> 00:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
vote being desirable a desirable
 
00:47:33.390 --> 00:47:33.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for changing the Declaration
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
or the bylaws were you um referring to a
 
00:47:40.589 --> 00:47:40.599 align:start position:0%
2third vote of all the unit owners or a
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
2third vote of owners president at a
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
meeting thank you for that question the
 
00:47:48.829 --> 00:47:48.839 align:start position:0%
answer is when we talk about an
 
00:47:51.069 --> 00:47:51.079 align:start position:0%
amendment two-thirds Amendment for the
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
Declaration it does require a 2/3 vote
 
00:47:57.069 --> 00:47:57.079 align:start position:0%
of the total unit owners when you're
 
00:47:59.829 --> 00:47:59.839 align:start position:0%
talking about a change to the bylaws it
 
00:48:03.549 --> 00:48:03.559 align:start position:0%
requires a two3 a 66 and 23 vote for the
 
00:48:06.150 --> 00:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
units present at the meeting by either
 
00:48:07.790 --> 00:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
proxy or
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
question I really don't know the answer
 
00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:26.440 align:start position:0%
to that but if I had to take a guess
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
that condominium uh declaration is
 
00:48:32.589 --> 00:48:32.599 align:start position:0%
probably of a higher priority than the
 
00:48:38.069 --> 00:48:38.079 align:start position:0%
bylaws because the bylaws can uh be
 
00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:39.760 align:start position:0%
different for each Condominium
 
00:48:42.390 --> 00:48:42.400 align:start position:0%
Association because as I said before the
 
00:48:44.670 --> 00:48:44.680 align:start position:0%
nature in form of Condominiums is not
 
00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:47.240 align:start position:0%
all uniform there are many sizes and
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
shapes and styles of
 
00:48:53.549 --> 00:48:53.559 align:start position:0%
Condominiums represent Aon thank you for
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for coming
 
00:48:59.750 --> 00:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
in to testify if the uh documents are
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
not kept at the register of deeds where
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
is like the master copy of the bylaw is
 
00:49:10.870 --> 00:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
kept and uh how does that work uh who
 
00:49:14.030 --> 00:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
knows who has the latest
 
00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:16.829 align:start position:0%
knows who has the latest
copy

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
copy
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
well the documents the original
 
00:49:23.069 --> 00:49:23.079 align:start position:0%
documents are filed with the in our case
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
the Rockingham registry of deeds now if
 
00:49:28.789 --> 00:49:28.799 align:start position:0%
it's the annual meeting where we decide
 
00:49:30.870 --> 00:49:30.880 align:start position:0%
to amend either declaration or the
 
00:49:32.950 --> 00:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
bylaws it is the
 
00:49:35.990 --> 00:49:36.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of members of the board
 
00:49:38.829 --> 00:49:38.839 align:start position:0%
to file those amendments at with the
 
00:49:41.670 --> 00:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
registry of deeds to make sure that they
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
are a public record now if they if that
 
00:49:46.710 --> 00:49:46.720 align:start position:0%
is not done I mean that would certainly
 
00:49:51.789 --> 00:49:51.799 align:start position:0%
be uh a fault of negligence on whoever
 
00:49:53.589 --> 00:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
is assigned to do that Duty on the board
 
00:49:57.670 --> 00:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr sweat seeing none
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%

that's come up including all the ones
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
that have come up every year
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
um uh some reason the speaker was angry
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
with me last term and decided that I was
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
going to be the chairman of the condo
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
committee so I got to learn even more
 
00:50:36.030 --> 00:50:36.040 align:start position:0%
about some of the things going on and
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
Susan uh representative Alby and I did
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
work very well together get a few pieces
 
00:50:42.470 --> 00:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
of uh legislation passed uh issues that
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
came up in front of our
 
00:50:46.829 --> 00:50:46.839 align:start position:0%
committee you've heard a lot today about
 
00:50:49.069 --> 00:50:49.079 align:start position:0%
uh asso condominium associations and
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on a few things I'd
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
like to refer to uh the bill itself
 
00:50:54.190 --> 00:50:54.200 align:start position:0%
lines nine and
 
00:50:57.109 --> 00:50:57.119 align:start position:0%
10 I guess I really don't care uh this
 
00:51:00.510 --> 00:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
is kind of a uh something where if they
 
00:51:02.069 --> 00:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
want to do it they can do it but as was
 
00:51:05.510 --> 00:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
stated by Mr sweat uh the condominium uh
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
documents and the bylaws are registered
 
00:51:11.710 --> 00:51:11.720 align:start position:0%
bylaws are very specific they deal with
 
00:51:14.349 --> 00:51:14.359 align:start position:0%
um major parts of the association one
 
00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
example of a bylaw change would be a
 
00:51:18.150 --> 00:51:18.160 align:start position:0%
condominium that has basement that were
 
00:51:19.789 --> 00:51:19.799 align:start position:0%
not intended for those basements to be
 
00:51:22.309 --> 00:51:22.319 align:start position:0%
living area people make them living area
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
then there's water leaks and what have
 
00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:25.960 align:start position:0%
you and a lot of insurance claims and
 
00:51:27.230 --> 00:51:27.240 align:start position:0%
someone decides they should not be
 
00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
living area anymore so we're going to
 
00:51:30.910 --> 00:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
change that that's a significant bylaw
 
00:51:33.390 --> 00:51:33.400 align:start position:0%
which you would usually have uh 2/3 or
 
00:51:37.069 --> 00:51:37.079 align:start position:0%
3/4 of the uh members uh having to uh
 
00:51:39.390 --> 00:51:39.400 align:start position:0%
owners have to agree to this whereas
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
rules are simple things you you can't
 
00:51:42.870 --> 00:51:42.880 align:start position:0%
let your dog go to the bathroom over
 
00:51:44.190 --> 00:51:44.200 align:start position:0%
there and you can't do this and you
 
00:51:45.829 --> 00:51:45.839 align:start position:0%
can't have a certain flag on a certain
 
00:51:47.150 --> 00:51:47.160 align:start position:0%
day and all the other things that come
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
up in certain rules those rules are
 
00:51:53.589 --> 00:51:53.599 align:start position:0%
usually made by the condominium board
 
00:51:56.190 --> 00:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
itself or if they're significant enough
 
00:51:59.109 --> 00:51:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh is uh fines maybe for violating these
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
things they would come up in front of
 
00:52:01.470 --> 00:52:01.480 align:start position:0%
the entire
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
board um so I think it would be
 
00:52:06.630 --> 00:52:06.640 align:start position:0%
unnecessary every time there's a rule
 
00:52:08.069 --> 00:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
change because there are rule changes
 
00:52:10.910 --> 00:52:10.920 align:start position:0%
annually depending on what happens you
 
00:52:13.470 --> 00:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
know no one knew anything about I
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
remember four or five years ago was
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
awnings what are we going to do about
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
awnings then it was satellite dishes and
 
00:52:19.870 --> 00:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
all these other things that keep coming
 
00:52:22.270 --> 00:52:22.280 align:start position:0%
up that you don't expect that you have
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
to change and make rules to having to
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
register these uh um makes it very
 
00:52:32.630 --> 00:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
timely cost um you know costly and I'm
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
not sure it really does anything there
 
00:52:35.870 --> 00:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
question was asked well where are these
 
00:52:38.589 --> 00:52:38.599 align:start position:0%
things kept more often than not when you
 
00:52:41.109 --> 00:52:41.119 align:start position:0%
buy a condominium uh the purchaser will
 
00:52:42.950 --> 00:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
get a copy of these things before they
 
00:52:44.349 --> 00:52:44.359 align:start position:0%
want to know the bylaws they want to
 
00:52:46.430 --> 00:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
know the rules before they enter into
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
purchasing an association is common to
 
00:52:50.390 --> 00:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
get these things the board of directors
 
00:52:51.829 --> 00:52:51.839 align:start position:0%
and the management company has to
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
provide them to you so it's not a secret
 
00:52:58.230 --> 00:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
as to what the these things are
 
00:53:01.390 --> 00:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
um so it shouldn't be that that that
 
00:53:03.630 --> 00:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
difficult um for people to find out what
 
00:53:04.990 --> 00:53:05.000 align:start position:0%
these things
 
00:53:07.789 --> 00:53:07.799 align:start position:0%
are my biggest issue is lines 13 through
 
00:53:10.150 --> 00:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
18 where we're basically saying it's
 
00:53:13.789 --> 00:53:13.799 align:start position:0%
whoever lines uh 16 and 18 the bylaws
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
can be changed by a simple majority of
 
00:53:17.710 --> 00:53:17.720 align:start position:0%
those present at a proposed meeting this
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
was an issue was brought up in front of
 
00:53:20.910 --> 00:53:20.920 align:start position:0%
Representative Aly and I last year at
 
00:53:22.870 --> 00:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
this committee there is an association
 
00:53:25.270 --> 00:53:25.280 align:start position:0%
where people just don't show up and they
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
can't get things done and that's that's
 
00:53:29.430 --> 00:53:29.440 align:start position:0%
a problem with associations but that is
 
00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:31.640 align:start position:0%
the nature of the beast when people
 
00:53:34.309 --> 00:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
don't show up the board of directors
 
00:53:36.829 --> 00:53:36.839 align:start position:0%
often time cut doesn't get is not able
 
00:53:39.030 --> 00:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
to get things done and that is
 
00:53:41.470 --> 00:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunate but it seems to work its way
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
out and I want to explain another issue
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
that occurred that came in front of our
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
committee last year a group of very
 
00:53:49.470 --> 00:53:49.480 align:start position:0%
angry individuals in a condominium in
 
00:53:51.589 --> 00:53:51.599 align:start position:0%
marac New Hampshire came in and they
 
00:53:53.190 --> 00:53:53.200 align:start position:0%
were very angry because it looks like
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
the management company was
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
too close to the board and things
 
00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
weren't being done and things weren't
 
00:54:02.069 --> 00:54:02.079 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't when they ask for invoices
 
00:54:04.190 --> 00:54:04.200 align:start position:0%
and things they were always being pushed
 
00:54:06.710 --> 00:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
off um and then lo and behold my
 
00:54:08.190 --> 00:54:08.200 align:start position:0%
daughter comes home one day and says hey
 
00:54:09.990 --> 00:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
Dad my husband and I just bought a
 
00:54:11.829 --> 00:54:11.839 align:start position:0%
condominium in this Association I'm like
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
oh that's just wonderful should don't
 
00:54:17.069 --> 00:54:17.079 align:start position:0%
don't ever ask Dad or anything um well
 
00:54:19.870 --> 00:54:19.880 align:start position:0%
she informed me a couple weeks ago that
 
00:54:21.309 --> 00:54:21.319 align:start position:0%
the board most of the board got kicked
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
out and the management company is going
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
so it does seem to work its way out and
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
yes it is a frustration because do hear
 
00:54:30.430 --> 00:54:30.440 align:start position:0%
things that are not good okay
 
00:54:33.109 --> 00:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
people take that little sense of power
 
00:54:35.109 --> 00:54:35.119 align:start position:0%
and they do some goofy things in these
 
00:54:37.589 --> 00:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
associations U but we cannot make laws
 
00:54:39.990 --> 00:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
for every single situation and this
 
00:54:42.750 --> 00:54:42.760 align:start position:0%
group up in uh up in Freedom whatever
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
where there's so many people they don't
 
00:54:46.789 --> 00:54:46.799 align:start position:0%
show up and it's a problem for them but
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure we can make a law that says
 
00:54:50.990 --> 00:54:51.000 align:start position:0%
only the people that show up you have
 
00:54:52.950 --> 00:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
five people show up in a 100 unit
 
00:54:54.950 --> 00:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
Association and change some of these
 
00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.870 align:start position:0%
Association and change some of these
laws

00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
laws
 
00:54:59.309 --> 00:54:59.319 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure we we need to change the
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
law just for for that one organization
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
and it is it is unfortunate uh one last
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
story I've served on four different
 
00:55:07.789 --> 00:55:07.799 align:start position:0%
condominium boards over the years and we
 
00:55:10.390 --> 00:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
have one Association where Airbnb was
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
becoming a problem our documents clearly
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
State you must rent for one week and
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
this is up in lonia and a lot of people
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
were renting for a bike weekend both
 
00:55:22.990 --> 00:55:23.000 align:start position:0%
bike weekends you know how that could be
 
00:55:26.510 --> 00:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
and um so
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
people would just thumb their nose up at
 
00:55:32.109 --> 00:55:32.119 align:start position:0%
the rule so we wanted to implement a
 
00:55:35.470 --> 00:55:35.480 align:start position:0%
fine a fine equal to like $300 a day
 
00:55:37.750 --> 00:55:37.760 align:start position:0%
which would be kind of equal to the rent
 
00:55:39.390 --> 00:55:39.400 align:start position:0%
to kind of say don't do this the laws
 
00:55:40.990 --> 00:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
bylaws say this the rules say you can't
 
00:55:43.470 --> 00:55:43.480 align:start position:0%
do this please don't do this we could
 
00:55:46.470 --> 00:55:46.480 align:start position:0%
not get a majority of the unit owners to
 
00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:50.680 align:start position:0%
vote for a fine all right that's
 
00:55:52.910 --> 00:55:52.920 align:start position:0%
democracy I was on the board I wanted
 
00:55:55.549 --> 00:55:55.559 align:start position:0%
the fines we didn't get what we want the
 
00:55:57.589 --> 00:55:57.599 align:start position:0%
members said no
 
00:55:58.870 --> 00:55:58.880 align:start position:0%
that's just the way these things work
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's a small little democracy and um we
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
don't always get what we want and and
 
00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:07.079 align:start position:0%
couple years later you know they stopped
 
00:56:08.630 --> 00:56:08.640 align:start position:0%
doing this so much and we didn't have a
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
they it would be nice to be able to
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
solve all these problems here in the
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
legislature but you always you can't
 
00:56:18.510 --> 00:56:18.520 align:start position:0%
always do so I
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
I lines nine and 10 I would not agree to
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
the rules it's just too cumbersome in
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph 13 through 18 with all due
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
respect to my colleague who I got along
 
00:56:32.069 --> 00:56:32.079 align:start position:0%
with very well and enjoyed working with
 
00:56:35.029 --> 00:56:35.039 align:start position:0%
representative Aly I I can't support um
 
00:56:37.230 --> 00:56:37.240 align:start position:0%
13 through lines 13 through 18 just
 
00:56:40.270 --> 00:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
because it would be too detrimental and
 
00:56:41.470 --> 00:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
then You' have a lot of people coming
 
00:56:43.710 --> 00:56:43.720 align:start position:0%
back and say why did you allow if such a
 
00:56:46.190 --> 00:56:46.200 align:start position:0%
small minority of people that showed up
 
00:56:48.630 --> 00:56:48.640 align:start position:0%
to change the rules so respectfully I
 
00:56:50.589 --> 00:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
would request that the bill be an
 
00:56:52.430 --> 00:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
expedience to legislate thank you for
 
00:56:54.190 --> 00:56:54.200 align:start position:0%

00:56:57.990 --> 00:56:58.000 align:start position:0%
much thank you and the last speaker I
 
00:57:06.870 --> 00:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
okak hello
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
everybody Paul okak it's a nice Polish
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
boy from Western Pennsylvania oh that's
 
00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:15.200 align:start position:0%
an N thank you there
 
00:57:19.390 --> 00:57:19.400 align:start position:0%
you well how he won't this friend
 
00:57:23.789 --> 00:57:23.799 align:start position:0%
Mr okay well really he's my cousin okay
 
00:57:26.430 --> 00:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
but um I was from latro Pennsylvania
 
00:57:28.630 --> 00:57:28.640 align:start position:0%
really but uh thank you all for being
 
00:57:31.710 --> 00:57:31.720 align:start position:0%
here the the the issue is is we're
 
00:57:35.109 --> 00:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
starting to swing things for a a vocal
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
minority will start to run the majority
 
00:57:40.789 --> 00:57:40.799 align:start position:0%
and that's the concern
 
00:57:43.270 --> 00:57:43.280 align:start position:0%
and I I don't know how else to put this
 
00:57:45.549 --> 00:57:45.559 align:start position:0%
but I do understand where where boards
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
get entrenched and management companies
 
00:57:48.990 --> 00:57:49.000 align:start position:0%
get entrenched and the landscaper gets
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
entrenched and whatnot but I got to tell
 
00:57:53.990 --> 00:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
you I do this for a living I've done it
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
for 40 years and I'm the vice president
 
00:57:59.430 --> 00:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
of Evergreen management so with that
 
00:58:02.349 --> 00:58:02.359 align:start position:0%
being said we run about 300 associations
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
we have about 30 managers and uh we do a
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
pretty good job it's a profession of
 
00:58:11.190 --> 00:58:11.200 align:start position:0%
perception we don't produce a widget so
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
you could have a room full of folks and
 
00:58:14.470 --> 00:58:14.480 align:start position:0%
you've heard different opinions and
 
00:58:17.109 --> 00:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
perceptions of how this business runs
 
00:58:20.549 --> 00:58:20.559 align:start position:0%
it's never perfect we are run it the
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
flavor or if you would the direction of
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
the board and the board makes the
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
decisions we simp L follow through with
 
00:58:29.870 --> 00:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
those many boards due to some
 
00:58:32.270 --> 00:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
legislation are constantly asking for
 
00:58:34.870 --> 00:58:34.880 align:start position:0%
advice on what to do how to do to
 
00:58:37.589 --> 00:58:37.599 align:start position:0%
protect everybody at large and we try to
 
00:58:40.150 --> 00:58:40.160 align:start position:0%
give that advice if not you've had some
 
00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
condo attorneys speak before you before
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
that they're very entrenched in the
 
00:58:46.109 --> 00:58:46.119 align:start position:0%
business and we we rely on them for the
 
00:58:49.150 --> 00:58:49.160 align:start position:0%
legal legal assistance but I can tell
 
00:58:51.270 --> 00:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
you I've lived in Condos for 40 years
 
00:58:53.829 --> 00:58:53.839 align:start position:0%
I've been on board for four well not
 
00:58:58.630 --> 00:58:58.640 align:start position:0%
about half of that I I say I am on about
 
00:59:01.150 --> 00:59:01.160 align:start position:0%
300 boards because I'm out many many
 
00:59:04.630 --> 00:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
nights at meetings and weekends and it's
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
a wonderful form of democracy the owners
 
00:59:10.430 --> 00:59:10.440 align:start position:0%
elect the boards yes there are some
 
00:59:12.390 --> 00:59:12.400 align:start position:0%
times when boards are empowering yes
 
00:59:14.390 --> 00:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
there's some times when boards are weak
 
00:59:16.589 --> 00:59:16.599 align:start position:0%
and they rely on management to to look
 
00:59:20.309 --> 00:59:20.319 align:start position:0%
at things and help out but overall it's
 
00:59:23.510 --> 00:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
a wonderful wonderful process and you
 
00:59:26.430 --> 00:59:26.440 align:start position:0%
can see that and see how the moment is
 
00:59:28.990 --> 00:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
building because back just about 40
 
00:59:31.230 --> 00:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
years ago there were hardly any condos
 
00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:32.920 align:start position:0%
associations in New Hampshire now
 
00:59:35.910 --> 00:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
they're just going like crazy and people
 
00:59:38.150 --> 00:59:38.160 align:start position:0%
are buying into them and they're not now
 
00:59:40.630 --> 00:59:40.640 align:start position:0%
being segregated 55 and older and things
 
00:59:43.950 --> 00:59:43.960 align:start position:0%
like that of which I qualify now but
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
it's a wonderful process and what's
 
00:59:49.630 --> 00:59:49.640 align:start position:0%
great about the condo developments is
 
00:59:52.950 --> 00:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
they're all different and you choose to
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
move into a community that suits your
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
lifestyle I would not move into an
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
association if it didn't suit my
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
lifestyle and thank goodness for choices
 
01:00:06.190 --> 01:00:06.200 align:start position:0%
because if we didn't have the choice and
 
01:00:08.069 --> 01:00:08.079 align:start position:0%
we do these types of things to make
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
everything Universal there will be no
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
more choices so I just really want you
 
01:00:16.390 --> 01:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
to respect this of the vocal minority is
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
now going to be the majority very
 
01:00:21.430 --> 01:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
dangerous thank you for your testimony
 
01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.630 align:start position:0%
dangerous thank you for your testimony

questions no thank you I will say I do
 
01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:28.520 align:start position:0%

members so the Genesis of the bill
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
before you started with um the special
 
01:09:23.789 --> 01:09:23.799 align:start position:0%
committee on housing last term the first
 
01:09:25.910 --> 01:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
year in which we heard from multiple
 
01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:26.990 align:start position:0%
year in which we heard from multiple
expert

01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
expert
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
organizations um about how we got to our
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
current situation with zoning that we
 
01:09:36.990 --> 01:09:37.000 align:start position:0%
maybe take for granted as just a given
 
01:09:40.630 --> 01:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
and multiple organizations uh both uh
 
01:09:43.870 --> 01:09:43.880 align:start position:0%
State and National organizations who are
 
01:09:46.709 --> 01:09:46.719 align:start position:0%
who have expertise in this issue talked
 
01:09:49.749 --> 01:09:49.759 align:start position:0%
a lot about how zoning came to be what
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
it is today essentially approximately a
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
100 years ago uh there was a Supreme
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
Court case
 
01:09:56.560 --> 01:09:58.709 align:start position:0%
Court case
uh

01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:02.149 --> 01:10:02.159 align:start position:0%
uid that said that zoning was
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
essentially only legitimate in that it
 
01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:06.679 align:start position:0%
was for the health safety and general
 
01:10:09.550 --> 01:10:09.560 align:start position:0%
welfare of the community but not for
 
01:10:11.550 --> 01:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
arbitrary Aesthetics that that would be
 
01:10:14.830 --> 01:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
an illegitimate zoning issue um shortly
 
01:10:17.189 --> 01:10:17.199 align:start position:0%
thereafter New Hampshire had a a Supreme
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
Court case on the same topic that echoed
 
01:10:21.149 --> 01:10:21.159 align:start position:0%
some of the same findings that one was
 
01:10:21.159 --> 01:10:23.310 align:start position:0%
some of the same findings that one was
called

01:10:23.310 --> 01:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
called
 
01:10:27.750 --> 01:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
sundine however around that time things
 
01:10:29.709 --> 01:10:29.719 align:start position:0%
like um
 
01:10:33.510 --> 01:10:33.520 align:start position:0%
redlining started to uh become more
 
01:10:36.830 --> 01:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
popular and it seemed that zoning
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
ordinances followed suit in that they
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
were being geared to keep certain people
 
01:10:44.430 --> 01:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
out of their community and other people
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
in and some of that was being done
 
01:10:50.229 --> 01:10:50.239 align:start position:0%
through Aesthetics or through Aesthetics
 
01:10:53.510 --> 01:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
that then added cost to being in that
 
01:10:53.520 --> 01:10:55.709 align:start position:0%
that then added cost to being in that
community

01:10:55.709 --> 01:10:55.719 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:10:59.070 --> 01:10:59.080 align:start position:0%
so last year last year last term last
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
year I put in a bill that said any
 
01:11:04.149 --> 01:11:04.159 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances as that pertains to
 
01:11:07.990 --> 01:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
residential uh property um needed to be
 
01:11:09.709 --> 01:11:09.719 align:start position:0%
in keeping with those Supreme Court
 
01:11:11.310 --> 01:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
cases the state and the federal Supreme
 
01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:15.000 align:start position:0%
Court cases um and that if that they had
 
01:11:17.750 --> 01:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
to prove that with the best scientific
 
01:11:19.189 --> 01:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
current scientific understanding that
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
they had to prove that uh that that's
 
01:11:25.950 --> 01:11:25.960 align:start position:0%
what those ordinances were based on
 
01:11:28.470 --> 01:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
and then with working in working with
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
the former members of the special
 
01:11:32.510 --> 01:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee on housing um across the aisle
 
01:11:34.830 --> 01:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
as well as some of the other experts we
 
01:11:37.310 --> 01:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
came up with this language which is not
 
01:11:40.510 --> 01:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
where I want it but if you'll permit me
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
so essentially we're creating this
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
concept an extraordinary restriction on
 
01:11:45.239 --> 01:11:46.629 align:start position:0%
concept an extraordinary restriction on
residential

01:11:46.629 --> 01:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
residential
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
property yes towns can do these zoning
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
ordinances and what have you but to the
 
01:11:53.110 --> 01:11:53.120 align:start position:0%
point that they are getting where they
 
01:11:55.229 --> 01:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
are getting to the point that they are
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
preventing people from being able to
 
01:11:59.110 --> 01:11:59.120 align:start position:0%
reasonably live even though they're not
 
01:12:01.070 --> 01:12:01.080 align:start position:0%
hurting other people they're not
 
01:12:02.550 --> 01:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
damaging health and safety of the
 
01:12:04.470 --> 01:12:04.480 align:start position:0%
community that's when it becomes an
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinary restriction and if an
 
01:12:08.790 --> 01:12:08.800 align:start position:0%
ordinance is an extraordinary
 
01:12:11.470 --> 01:12:11.480 align:start position:0%
restriction then they need to prove that
 
01:12:13.550 --> 01:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
is based on the best scientific
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is in the best
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.030 --> 01:12:24.040 align:start position:0%
community the reason this is I think a
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
good approach and something that's very
 
01:12:27.669 --> 01:12:27.679 align:start position:0%
complimentary with some of the other
 
01:12:30.030 --> 01:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
bills that we've heard because it's
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
Broad in that it contains a lot of the
 
01:12:34.510 --> 01:12:34.520 align:start position:0%
same issues manufactured housing lot
 
01:12:38.390 --> 01:12:38.400 align:start position:0%
sizes um residential use and Commercial
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
zones however it's it is a safety net
 
01:12:44.310 --> 01:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
underneath that because while those
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
bills each of those bills that this
 
01:12:47.229 --> 01:12:47.239 align:start position:0%
committee has heard have been outright
 
01:12:49.910 --> 01:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
prohibitions on those ordinances towns
 
01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
cannot do this this is not saying that a
 
01:12:55.149 --> 01:12:55.159 align:start position:0%
town can't do it it's saying that what
 
01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
ever else we pass if we pass that you
 
01:13:00.590 --> 01:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
can't and can and what have you at the
 
01:13:03.189 --> 01:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
very least at a bare minimum if you're
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
passing it you have to show that it's
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
for the health and safety of the
 
01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:09.520 align:start position:0%
community so I'll go through what we
 
01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
came up with again uh Phil Sherman
 
01:13:13.590 --> 01:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
helped with this language The Honorable
 
01:13:16.390 --> 01:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
Josh Oella helped with this language um
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
it's not where I want it to be I would
 
01:13:19.870 --> 01:13:19.880 align:start position:0%
ask hopefully that the committee would
 
01:13:21.990 --> 01:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
support a subcommittee on this so that
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
we can get the language where we want it
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
to be um
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
but deadlines being what they were with
 
01:13:31.270 --> 01:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
OS it is what it is right now so minimum
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
square footage on a house this is
 
01:13:35.189 --> 01:13:35.199 align:start position:0%
something that would provide for tiny
 
01:13:38.430 --> 01:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
homes we have a building code that says
 
01:13:39.790 --> 01:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
that we have you have to have at least
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
200 square feet which is a 20 by1 um
 
01:13:48.390 --> 01:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
dwelling which is a a nice efficiency um
 
01:13:50.870 --> 01:13:50.880 align:start position:0%
but anything uh beyond that it would be
 
01:13:52.830 --> 01:13:52.840 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary they can do it they
 
01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
just have to show that there's a reason
 
01:13:56.430 --> 01:13:56.440 align:start position:0%
the scientific reason for doing it lot
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
size requirements over 5 acres per unit
 
01:14:02.910 --> 01:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
5 acre uh minimum neighborhood is a
 
01:14:05.310 --> 01:14:05.320 align:start position:0%
rural neighborhood it is you can have
 
01:14:09.149 --> 01:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
horses you can have uh hay fields on a 5
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
acre lot residential use on commercially
 
01:14:15.709 --> 01:14:15.719 align:start position:0%
zoned Lots uh in commercially Zone Lots
 
01:14:18.310 --> 01:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
I guess this would just be the use and
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
this is where we need to get to some
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
better language one of the places we
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
need to get to better language because
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit confusing how it's
 
01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.629 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit confusing how it's
worded

01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
worded
 
01:14:28.310 --> 01:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
um in keeping with the other items on
 
01:14:30.950 --> 01:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
the the list inhome business use and
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
residentially Zone Lots this is another
 
01:14:34.669 --> 01:14:34.679 align:start position:0%
one that could use some help because
 
01:14:37.189 --> 01:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
it's meant to specifically be for those
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
types of businesses that wouldn't be uh
 
01:14:42.110 --> 01:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
noxious to anybody else not something
 
01:14:44.390 --> 01:14:44.400 align:start position:0%
that would be noisy or you know burn
 
01:14:47.629 --> 01:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
tires or whatever um but like a little
 
01:14:49.790 --> 01:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
inhome cafe or let's say you're a
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
therapist and you want to have an inhome
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
office and have clients in your inhome
 
01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:56.199 align:start position:0%
office or you're an archit te or Euro
 
01:14:58.590 --> 01:14:58.600 align:start position:0%
whatever allowing for
 
01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:01.480 align:start position:0%
that fees on variance applications or
 
01:15:03.350 --> 01:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
building permits in excess of $100 for
 
01:15:05.030 --> 01:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
owners who own no more than one property
 
01:15:07.030 --> 01:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
and whose previous year household income
 
01:15:09.990 --> 01:15:10.000 align:start position:0%
was less than 150% of the Town median
 
01:15:11.189 --> 01:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
household income this is basically
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
saying if you're low to moderate income
 
01:15:15.390 --> 01:15:15.400 align:start position:0%
and you need to do something you
 
01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be find or feed have to pay an
 
01:15:20.709 --> 01:15:20.719 align:start position:0%
extraordinary fee in order to get that
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:15:24.990 --> 01:15:25.000 align:start position:0%
town restriction on the amount of time a
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
property owner or someone authorized by
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
the owner May camp on a property so this
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
is the idea that you should be able to
 
01:15:32.070 --> 01:15:32.080 align:start position:0%
camp on your own land you own the land
 
01:15:33.270 --> 01:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
you should be able to camp on it you
 
01:15:34.790 --> 01:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
should be able to allow other people to
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
camp on it this is not saying that
 
01:15:38.510 --> 01:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
everyone should be able to camp on any
 
01:15:40.750 --> 01:15:40.760 align:start position:0%
land you have to have legal access to it
 
01:15:43.790 --> 01:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
it also that I don't know why OS uh put
 
01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
it in a different uh paragraph but it's
 
01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
also saying that the number of people
 
01:15:52.990 --> 01:15:53.000 align:start position:0%
um shouldn't be restricted as long as
 
01:15:56.430 --> 01:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
it's not below for per acre so this is
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
getting out of I would I would be open
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
for example to making that so if towns
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
could restrict it for being for like pay
 
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
so like you're allowed to let people
 
01:16:08.350 --> 01:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
camp on your property but maybe not
 
01:16:11.310 --> 01:16:11.320 align:start position:0%
start a camping site as a business
 
01:16:13.510 --> 01:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
without the town's uh
 
01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.390 align:start position:0%
without the town's uh
authorization

01:16:15.390 --> 01:16:15.400 align:start position:0%
authorization
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm also maybe interested in in
 
01:16:20.629 --> 01:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
investigating with some other members of
 
01:16:20.639 --> 01:16:21.510 align:start position:0%
investigating with some other members of
the

01:16:21.510 --> 01:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:16:24.189 --> 01:16:24.199 align:start position:0%
committee where the appeals process
 
01:16:26.669 --> 01:16:26.679 align:start position:0%
after the the the zba so those are some
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
of the ideas that I would like to uh
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
explore in terms of perfecting it but I
 
01:16:32.910 --> 01:16:32.920 align:start position:0%
think that the intent here is really
 
01:16:35.229 --> 01:16:35.239 align:start position:0%
good because it's very broad but it's
 
01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
not a a direct prohibition it's getting
 
01:16:39.910 --> 01:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
us back to that original purpose that
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court set out yes you can
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
have zoning ordinances no it can't be
 
01:16:46.830 --> 01:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
because you just want that community and
 
01:16:48.629 --> 01:16:48.639 align:start position:0%
you want to keep certain types of people
 
01:16:50.590 --> 01:16:50.600 align:start position:0%
or you want to have it look a certain
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
way it has to be for the health and
 
01:16:57.149 --> 01:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
safety of the community um broad but not
 
01:17:01.110 --> 01:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
too burdensome on towns so uh with that
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
01:17:05.590 --> 01:17:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative questions um
 
01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:07.750 align:start position:0%
representative questions um
representative

01:17:07.750 --> 01:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
baxton hi there hi so there's a lot in
 
01:17:17.550 --> 01:17:17.560 align:start position:0%
this bill that I like cool uh and but my
 
01:17:19.629 --> 01:17:19.639 align:start position:0%
I guess let me share with my concern and
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
there's some of it that I kind of like
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
well I don't know how that would work
 
01:17:25.350 --> 01:17:25.360 align:start position:0%
but so my question to you
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
and and and quite honestly it covers a
 
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
lot of things that we see other bills on
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
which you you mentioned and I almost
 
01:17:35.590 --> 01:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
think it would be better to have one
 
01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:38.320 align:start position:0%
comprehensive Bill than a bunch of
 
01:17:40.669 --> 01:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
little bills one thing here one thing
 
01:17:44.790 --> 01:17:44.800 align:start position:0%
there which is what my concern is um in
 
01:17:47.070 --> 01:17:47.080 align:start position:0%
my experience administering these things
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
or or dealing with these things as a as
 
01:17:53.149 --> 01:17:53.159 align:start position:0%
a selectman and as a developer etc
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
etc we many times times find that we
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
have we pass RSA XYZ over here and then
 
01:18:04.870 --> 01:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
we have rxa RSA zyx over here and
 
01:18:07.629 --> 01:18:07.639 align:start position:0%
they're kind of on the same subject and
 
01:18:10.270 --> 01:18:10.280 align:start position:0%
you wind up with a gridlock because
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
they're not worded exactly the same and
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
so instead of achieving the goal that
 
01:18:19.149 --> 01:18:19.159 align:start position:0%
was the intent you actually wind up
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
locking things up so in the process of
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
working on this B I think this is in the
 
01:18:29.310 --> 01:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
category of it certainly is a good
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
idea uh have you have you tried to tie
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
these back into the other rsas so that
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
there's not log Jam here thank you for
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
the question and you I agree with you
 
01:18:44.189 --> 01:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
that I think it's important for us to
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
get to the whole entire point because we
 
01:18:47.870 --> 01:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
have this peace meal we have all these
 
01:18:49.790 --> 01:18:49.800 align:start position:0%
bills what about this what about that
 
01:18:52.510 --> 01:18:52.520 align:start position:0%
when the whole point is the moving of
 
01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
the goalpost way way way beyond what
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court said a 100 years ago
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's the problem health and safety and
 
01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
general welfare as we might be able to
 
01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
Define general welfare specifically in
 
01:19:05.590 --> 01:19:05.600 align:start position:0%
this so getting back to that point with
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
one kind of simple this is the point of
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
zoning and you shouldn't exceed that is
 
01:19:13.149 --> 01:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
really good um the reason I don't think
 
01:19:15.350 --> 01:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
this will create a log Jam is because
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
this is setting a floor so for example
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
if we pass the manufacturing home Bill
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
the lot minimum Bill and uh the
 
01:19:25.510 --> 01:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
commercial the residential use and
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
Commercial Zone Bill all three of those
 
01:19:29.430 --> 01:19:29.440 align:start position:0%
bills the concepts are contained within
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
here but this is setting the floor so
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
while we're saying if you have that
 
01:19:34.910 --> 01:19:34.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance you're going to have to prove
 
01:19:37.590 --> 01:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
health and safety but if we've
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
prohibited that then you can't do you
 
01:19:41.550 --> 01:19:41.560 align:start position:0%
can't even do it at all so but if that
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
would ever be repealed then we would
 
01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
fall back on to well you still have to
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
prove health and safety so we're setting
 
01:19:50.510 --> 01:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
a that is actually the job whenever we
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
have for example federalism with the
 
01:19:53.950 --> 01:19:53.960 align:start position:0%
national government the federal
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
government and state governments the job
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
of the larger governmental entity is to
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
set the floor and then allow the more
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
detailed granular Administration on the
 
01:20:04.990 --> 01:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
smaller level and in this case that's
 
01:20:06.629 --> 01:20:06.639 align:start position:0%
municipality go
 
01:20:10.590 --> 01:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
ahead so that's I I agree with all with
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
theoretical every theoretical thing you
 
01:20:14.390 --> 01:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
said there I completely and totally
 
01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:19.400 align:start position:0%
agree with so now we're in the weeds uh
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
the so we have one bill that says well
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
you can't have a lot size requirement
 
01:20:26.350 --> 01:20:26.360 align:start position:0%
greater than 20 2 2,000 square
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
fet yeah 22 Yeah 22,000 square feet then
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
we have another then in this bill we're
 
01:20:33.229 --> 01:20:33.239 align:start position:0%
talking about well you can't say you
 
01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:34.920 align:start position:0%
can't say you can't require a lot size
 
01:20:37.390 --> 01:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
greater than five acres you can you just
 
01:20:38.990 --> 01:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
have to prove that it you need to do
 
01:20:42.310 --> 01:20:42.320 align:start position:0%
that for health and safety right or
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
whatever uh or you might happen to have
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
one and it doesn't require that you
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
subdivide it either you're talking about
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
subdividing down and so that's fine my
 
01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
question is so as an example as a if I'm
 
01:20:58.030 --> 01:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
considering that we have people on
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
planning boards and Boards of adjustment
 
01:21:02.229 --> 01:21:02.239 align:start position:0%
who are absolutely Volunteers in our
 
01:21:04.790 --> 01:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
small towns and we've spent more time
 
01:21:06.189 --> 01:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
talking about this here this morning
 
01:21:07.350 --> 01:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
than they're going to spend in their
 
01:21:09.390 --> 01:21:09.400 align:start position:0%
entire life but they're going to make a
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
decision on it is it going to be clear
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
to them that they don't have they
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
can't that they can't deny somebody the
 
01:21:22.149 --> 01:21:22.159 align:start position:0%
right to have a five acre or have five
 
01:21:25.229 --> 01:21:25.239 align:start position:0%
acre zoning or that they conver ly that
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
they can't deny the right of a
 
01:21:31.590 --> 01:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
22,000 foot lot because it says
 
01:21:33.390 --> 01:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
someplace else that they can require a
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
five acre I mean this is I'm just I've
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
been in so many of these battles over
 
01:21:41.310 --> 01:21:41.320 align:start position:0%
the last 40 years right and they're not
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
always right but if we craft the bill in
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
such a way that anybody can get it on
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
the first reading that's my concern sure
 
01:21:55.310 --> 01:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate that concern
 
01:21:58.470 --> 01:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of times it requires referencing
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
anything anything we talk about requires
 
01:22:02.629 --> 01:22:02.639 align:start position:0%
referencing multiple places in law
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
unfortunately um so this is meant to be
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
as I said a safety net if we then so
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
basically look it's not prohibiting
 
01:22:14.350 --> 01:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
anything it's just saying you have to
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
prove it if it's this and then if we
 
01:22:17.750 --> 01:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
then go back and say actually you're not
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
even allowed to do that at all that's a
 
01:22:22.270 --> 01:22:22.280 align:start position:0%
really clear RSA in a different location
 
01:22:24.870 --> 01:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
ad midly now if you want to help me with
 
01:22:26.870 --> 01:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
language and somehow get to those other
 
01:22:29.629 --> 01:22:29.639 align:start position:0%
sections of Law and maybe reference back
 
01:22:31.830 --> 01:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
to this in each of those sections if we
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
pass the other bills that are covering
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
the same topic referencing back to this
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
just to make it super clear for anyone
 
01:22:40.750 --> 01:22:40.760 align:start position:0%
who's reading those sections that this
 
01:22:43.669 --> 01:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
this would also apply then that's fine
 
01:22:45.629 --> 01:22:45.639 align:start position:0%
or whatever you might want to come up
 
01:22:47.709 --> 01:22:47.719 align:start position:0%
with I think the point is I think the
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
intent for the majority of the the vast
 
01:22:51.709 --> 01:22:51.719 align:start position:0%
majority of the committee is is the same
 
01:22:53.070 --> 01:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
and I think that there's language here
 
01:22:54.790 --> 01:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
to get to the heart of what's really
 
01:22:56.870 --> 01:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
going on with the problem
 
01:23:01.510 --> 01:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
here go ahead so and I have yeah that's
 
01:23:03.910 --> 01:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
good um the other thing that I have a
 
01:23:06.910 --> 01:23:06.920 align:start position:0%
concern about is that we
 
01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:09.870 align:start position:0%
concern about is that we
have

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:09.880 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:23:13.709 --> 01:23:13.719 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of references to undefined
 
01:23:18.189 --> 01:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
empirical data and so that sort of
 
01:23:23.030 --> 01:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
concerns me uh is empirical data Google
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
is empirical data some statistic the
 
01:23:29.590 --> 01:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
United States Department of Commerce
 
01:23:32.070 --> 01:23:32.080 align:start position:0%
what it I I think that my concern is
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
that that's IL defined and I'm sure we
 
01:23:37.430 --> 01:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
would all agree that we could find a
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
statistic to prove almost
 
01:23:44.350 --> 01:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
anything uh so you know I think that's
 
01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:46.880 align:start position:0%
an open door for confusion or danger or
 
01:23:48.910 --> 01:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
simply not achieving the goals of the
 
01:23:53.110 --> 01:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
bill so have you given any thought to so
 
01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
my first that little loose nut down a
 
01:23:59.149 --> 01:23:59.159 align:start position:0%
little bit sure my first um language
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
last year on this said best current
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
scientific understanding and then I
 
01:24:05.229 --> 01:24:05.239 align:start position:0%
think there was some references to like
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
basically Federal organizations so
 
01:24:10.950 --> 01:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
you're right that I think the point the
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
the minimum the lowest thing I can ask
 
01:24:16.669 --> 01:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
for is for them to be aware them being
 
01:24:18.709 --> 01:24:18.719 align:start position:0%
whoever is you know the towns to be
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
aware that this is you cannot exceed
 
01:24:24.470 --> 01:24:24.480 align:start position:0%
health and safety if they then try to go
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
by disingenuous means to try to say yeah
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
self and safety that's a problem but at
 
01:24:31.070 --> 01:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
least we've said look show your work
 
01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
having said that I'm very happy to
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
strengthen this even further and if it
 
01:24:37.229 --> 01:24:37.239 align:start position:0%
means defining what empirical evidence
 
01:24:40.590 --> 01:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
is um the the process is the same though
 
01:24:42.470 --> 01:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
right so they say here's the empirical
 
01:24:44.750 --> 01:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
evidence and then first that goes to the
 
01:24:47.669 --> 01:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
zba and then after that it may be
 
01:24:49.310 --> 01:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
appealed further that's when I was
 
01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:50.350 align:start position:0%
appealed further that's when I was
talking

01:24:50.350 --> 01:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:24:52.229 --> 01:24:52.239 align:start position:0%
about what's
 
01:24:55.830 --> 01:24:55.840 align:start position:0%
that so I mean the the actual zoning
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
ordinance would be through the planning
 
01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
board but when someone says actually
 
01:25:02.550 --> 01:25:02.560 align:start position:0%
your ordinance is not then you go the
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
zba you go to the planning board
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
planning board would say no this doesn't
 
01:25:08.910 --> 01:25:08.920 align:start position:0%
conform with our rules and then you go
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
over to the
 
01:25:12.990 --> 01:25:13.000 align:start position:0%
zba sorry you'd go to the planning board
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
first even if you think the rule is
 
01:25:17.550 --> 01:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
wrong and say here you're wrong I want
 
01:25:20.790 --> 01:25:20.800 align:start position:0%
this permit based on X Y and Z and then
 
01:25:22.830 --> 01:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
presumably they would turn you down and
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
then you would go to the zba and under
 
01:25:26.990 --> 01:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
current law your next step is to go to
 
01:25:31.550 --> 01:25:31.560 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where something like 92%
 
01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:32.910 align:start position:0%
Superior Court where something like 92%
of

01:25:32.910 --> 01:25:32.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:25:36.310 --> 01:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
zba uh decisions are thrown out when you
 
01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
get there but that's a long and
 
01:25:39.189 --> 01:25:39.199 align:start position:0%
expensive well there's also the housing
 
01:25:41.149 --> 01:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
appeals board and other other areas to
 
01:25:42.310 --> 01:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
do and this is what I was saying is
 
01:25:45.629 --> 01:25:45.639 align:start position:0%
maybe there's room to work on E either a
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
specific appeals process for this or or
 
01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:50.280 align:start position:0%
something else um falling under a
 
01:25:52.229 --> 01:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
different category but my point is is I
 
01:25:53.669 --> 01:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that appeals process
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
is in intact so even if we didn't have
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
we could probably try to Define
 
01:26:00.149 --> 01:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence as strongly as we
 
01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
could try and there may be a town
 
01:26:03.310 --> 01:26:03.320 align:start position:0%
somewhere that would try to
 
01:26:05.870 --> 01:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
disingenuously say haha this is proof
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
right when we all know it's not so
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
that's why the appeals process
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
regardless of how we Define this the
 
01:26:12.390 --> 01:26:12.400 align:start position:0%
appeals process is really
 
01:26:15.270 --> 01:26:15.280 align:start position:0%
important representative Howland yeah I
 
01:26:16.510 --> 01:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
kind of want to follow up on that as
 
01:26:18.990 --> 01:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
well because in order for the ordinance
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
to have passed it's going to have to go
 
01:26:23.310 --> 01:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
through the planning board and then the
 
01:26:25.109 --> 01:26:25.119 align:start position:0%
legislative body is going to have to
 
01:26:27.910 --> 01:26:27.920 align:start position:0%
pass it well you know the legislative
 
01:26:30.590 --> 01:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
body is in most towns if you're sb2
 
01:26:32.390 --> 01:26:32.400 align:start position:0%
that's your whole Community which is
 
01:26:33.669 --> 01:26:33.679 align:start position:0%
going to be the people who were on the
 
01:26:36.229 --> 01:26:36.239 align:start position:0%
planning board and on the zba and you're
 
01:26:39.270 --> 01:26:39.280 align:start position:0%
going to have this IL defined thing of
 
01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.430 align:start position:0%
going to have this IL defined thing of
empirical

01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
empirical
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
evidence I don't I just don't see how
 
01:26:45.149 --> 01:26:45.159 align:start position:0%
that's going to work very well I think
 
01:26:47.109 --> 01:26:47.119 align:start position:0%
that in terms of you're saying the
 
01:26:49.189 --> 01:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
system could be gamed well the people
 
01:26:50.550 --> 01:26:50.560 align:start position:0%
who are passing the ordinance are
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
judging the ordinance so I I I just uh
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
how you're going to appeal it I I think
 
01:26:57.629 --> 01:26:57.639 align:start position:0%
needs to be flushed out more well that's
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
exactly why I mean that wasn't actually
 
01:27:00.830 --> 01:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
a question to me but I'll I'll treat it
 
01:27:03.310 --> 01:27:03.320 align:start position:0%
as a question no no I'll treat it as a
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
question that's exactly why I said we
 
01:27:06.669 --> 01:27:06.679 align:start position:0%
need to I would like to see this
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
Committee in addition to addressing um
 
01:27:10.910 --> 01:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
tweaks in the language and the other
 
01:27:13.669 --> 01:27:13.679 align:start position:0%
points to really hammer out a very solid
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
appeals process that's accessible to
 
01:27:20.030 --> 01:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
people um and open by the way to to
 
01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to say hey you're this
 
01:27:24.510 --> 01:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
town it I may not have a project that's
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
running against it but this town has
 
01:27:30.149 --> 01:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
actually um passed a a um one of these
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
extraordinary restrictions and they
 
01:27:33.070 --> 01:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
didn't provide the evidence or we think
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
the evidence is BS is that allow in
 
01:27:38.830 --> 01:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
testimony um I did want to kind of
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
piggyback on that and and go to another
 
01:27:43.270 --> 01:27:43.280 align:start position:0%
strength of this approach which is we've
 
01:27:45.070 --> 01:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
spent considerable time and I understand
 
01:27:46.870 --> 01:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we probably have amendments for all
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
of the bills on in question um the
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing the the uh lot
 
01:27:54.629 --> 01:27:54.639 align:start position:0%
minimum and the
 
01:27:57.950 --> 01:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
um residential use and Commercial zones
 
01:27:59.470 --> 01:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
where we're really trying to get to
 
01:28:01.030 --> 01:28:01.040 align:start position:0%
these details and we're like oh my gosh
 
01:28:02.550 --> 01:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
these details are very burdens some
 
01:28:04.390 --> 01:28:04.400 align:start position:0%
these details are you know how do we
 
01:28:06.629 --> 01:28:06.639 align:start position:0%
Define like commercial versus industrial
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
and residential use versus res
 
01:28:10.830 --> 01:28:10.840 align:start position:0%
residential building and you know we're
 
01:28:12.390 --> 01:28:12.400 align:start position:0%
trying to really get in the weeds the
 
01:28:16.229 --> 01:28:16.239 align:start position:0%
beauty of this is we are in this format
 
01:28:18.270 --> 01:28:18.280 align:start position:0%
we are doing our correct job by setting
 
01:28:20.109 --> 01:28:20.119 align:start position:0%
a floor and allowing the towns to get
 
01:28:22.109 --> 01:28:22.119 align:start position:0%
into the weeds so all I have to do is
 
01:28:24.270 --> 01:28:24.280 align:start position:0%
say um residential use of of a
 
01:28:26.669 --> 01:28:26.679 align:start position:0%
commercial zone is an extraordinary
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
restriction then they can say okay but
 
01:28:30.830 --> 01:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
this is a fine use of the extraordinary
 
01:28:33.270 --> 01:28:33.280 align:start position:0%
restriction because it's a paint plant
 
01:28:35.070 --> 01:28:35.080 align:start position:0%
and creates noxious fumes or this is a
 
01:28:37.470 --> 01:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
fine uh reason to use the extraordinary
 
01:28:39.109 --> 01:28:39.119 align:start position:0%
restriction they just have to show their
 
01:28:42.030 --> 01:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
work that's literally all we're asking
 
01:28:43.470 --> 01:28:43.480 align:start position:0%
basically that's all this is saying the
 
01:28:45.189 --> 01:28:45.199 align:start position:0%
state is asking the towns look you can
 
01:28:48.149 --> 01:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
do what you want but you have to show
 
01:28:49.590 --> 01:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
that is in keeping with the point of
 
01:28:51.510 --> 01:28:51.520 align:start position:0%
zoning you have to show your work and I
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
don't think that's too much of an ask
 
01:28:57.310 --> 01:28:57.320 align:start position:0%
represent buo thank you Mr chairman and
 
01:28:58.629 --> 01:28:58.639 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Reed um just to
 
01:29:00.750 --> 01:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
Echo some of the comments uh earlier I I
 
01:29:03.510 --> 01:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
think this is a this this bill and this
 
01:29:05.149 --> 01:29:05.159 align:start position:0%
idea has an extraordinary amount of
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
Merit so I really like that this goes to
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
the root and it goes to um you know the
 
01:29:14.629 --> 01:29:14.639 align:start position:0%
original um purpose of zoning ordinances
 
01:29:17.750 --> 01:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I my question is in terms of you know
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
making the legisl local legislative B
 
01:29:22.430 --> 01:29:22.440 align:start position:0%
show the work for the justification of
 
01:29:24.270 --> 01:29:24.280 align:start position:0%
you know whatever the zoning restriction
 
01:29:28.229 --> 01:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
is doesn't this in a way um make the
 
01:29:30.270 --> 01:29:30.280 align:start position:0%
task of the other branches of government
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
easier because it you know really
 
01:29:34.950 --> 01:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
focuses in um you know at the Town level
 
01:29:38.350 --> 01:29:38.360 align:start position:0%
and um the actual zoning ordinances
 
01:29:40.750 --> 01:29:40.760 align:start position:0%
focuses in on showing the work and the
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind but then it also leaves
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
behind a regardless of what the appeals
 
01:29:48.109 --> 01:29:48.119 align:start position:0%
process is it leaves behind a written
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
record and a reasoning for whatever
 
01:29:53.350 --> 01:29:53.360 align:start position:0%
judicial review process to go back and
 
01:29:56.030 --> 01:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
take a look at to see and correct me if
 
01:29:58.189 --> 01:29:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong but see that this is all
 
01:30:01.709 --> 01:30:01.719 align:start position:0%
comporting with what the actual um legal
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
framework is which is health and safety
 
01:30:06.750 --> 01:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
you're absolutely right in fact that's
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
why we have things like minority reports
 
01:30:10.590 --> 01:30:10.600 align:start position:0%
and majority reports in our legislative
 
01:30:12.910 --> 01:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
body in order to leave a record of our
 
01:30:15.750 --> 01:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
legislative intent for future judicial
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
review so this is operating in that same
 
01:30:20.910 --> 01:30:20.920 align:start position:0%
framework and you're also correct as I
 
01:30:24.070 --> 01:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
said when you have the very um
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
intentional design it's it's it's
 
01:30:27.750 --> 01:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
essentially a type of check and balance
 
01:30:29.629 --> 01:30:29.639 align:start position:0%
federalism between the country and the
 
01:30:31.790 --> 01:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
states but also the state versus
 
01:30:34.070 --> 01:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
municipality you have a system where you
 
01:30:35.910 --> 01:30:35.920 align:start position:0%
have two levels of government so that
 
01:30:37.910 --> 01:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
helps to create a check on tyranny on
 
01:30:41.830 --> 01:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
either level we've seen it you may maybe
 
01:30:43.709 --> 01:30:43.719 align:start position:0%
it may be stretching the word but this
 
01:30:45.950 --> 01:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
kind of what we perceive is a type of
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
tyranny on the municipal level and now
 
01:30:49.229 --> 01:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
the state is stepping and say actually
 
01:30:51.750 --> 01:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
you can't go all the way there you can
 
01:30:55.149 --> 01:30:55.159 align:start position:0%
only do health and safety and so by
 
01:30:58.870 --> 01:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
keeping that um balance in place what
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%
we've seen is that when we're trying to
 
01:31:01.950 --> 01:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
do this we're trying to get into the
 
01:31:05.109 --> 01:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
Weeds on manufactured housing and is it
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
like any kind of nonstick built or is it
 
01:31:09.990 --> 01:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
you know 3D printing or what do we we're
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
getting kind of far a field of our job
 
01:31:14.229 --> 01:31:14.239 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be setting that floor
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
the granular details are for the smaller
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh levels of government uh but when
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do these kind of
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed um prohibitions which I'm
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
not against and I've repeated voted for
 
01:31:28.070 --> 01:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
we're we're struggling all of us to find
 
01:31:30.109 --> 01:31:30.119 align:start position:0%
the expertise to go into that granular
 
01:31:32.149 --> 01:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
level on these issues whereas this
 
01:31:34.070 --> 01:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
leaves that open we're just saying look
 
01:31:35.550 --> 01:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
we don't care what you do as long as you
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
don't do this and that is the correct
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
balance between the two levels of
 
01:31:43.709 --> 01:31:43.719 align:start position:0%
government perfect any other questions
 
01:31:45.310 --> 01:31:45.320 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you representative
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:55.149 --> 01:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
Dees well
 
01:32:00.310 --> 01:32:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:02.270 --> 01:32:02.280 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for the record my name
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
is birie Dees I represent the nire
 
01:32:07.109 --> 01:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
municipal assoc Association and we are
 
01:32:10.270 --> 01:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
in opposition to House Bill 410 as it's
 
01:32:13.470 --> 01:32:13.480 align:start position:0%
currently written um first thing I want
 
01:32:15.550 --> 01:32:15.560 align:start position:0%
to state is planning board is not cited
 
01:32:19.149 --> 01:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
once in this bill only legislative body
 
01:32:22.070 --> 01:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative body is the voters so
 
01:32:24.550 --> 01:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
our interpretation of this entire bill
 
01:32:26.350 --> 01:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
is that the legislative body before it
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
adopts any kind of zoning ordinance or
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
amendments to their zoning um at town
 
01:32:33.750 --> 01:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
meeting that someone from the
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
legislative body would have to provide
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
an undefined empirical evidence
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
published by nonpartisan Source there's
 
01:32:42.910 --> 01:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of interesting quote nonpartisan
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
sources out there I bet many of you are
 
01:32:45.910 --> 01:32:45.920 align:start position:0%
aware with them that you agree and
 
01:32:48.830 --> 01:32:48.840 align:start position:0%
disagree with so just throwing that out
 
01:32:51.990 --> 01:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
there um also the term grieved person in
 
01:32:57.229 --> 01:32:57.239 align:start position:0%
the statute cited RSA 76 colon 5 would
 
01:32:59.950 --> 01:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
be first that's not the right statute to
 
01:33:02.189 --> 01:33:02.199 align:start position:0%
site because that specific section of
 
01:33:05.590 --> 01:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
law only defines applicant and a butter
 
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's a separate statute and I can't
 
01:33:09.550 --> 01:33:09.560 align:start position:0%
remember what the number is for the RSA
 
01:33:11.669 --> 01:33:11.679 align:start position:0%
that um that does s site during the
 
01:33:14.270 --> 01:33:14.280 align:start position:0%
appeals process a um an AG grieved
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
person um but
 
01:33:18.470 --> 01:33:18.480 align:start position:0%
essentially our interpretation would be
 
01:33:21.189 --> 01:33:21.199 align:start position:0%
anyone who believes the evidence and the
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
findings by someone who's a member of
 
01:33:24.310 --> 01:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
the legislative body that they don't
 
01:33:26.470 --> 01:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
agree with it could essentially stop
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
that zoning ordinance or Amendment from
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
being adopted um these planning
 
01:33:32.189 --> 01:33:32.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance these planning and zoning
 
01:33:34.149 --> 01:33:34.159 align:start position:0%
ordinances are debated or amended at
 
01:33:36.950 --> 01:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
town meeting or in2 communities so I'm
 
01:33:38.870 --> 01:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
not even sure when the public body would
 
01:33:40.310 --> 01:33:40.320 align:start position:0%
get the opportunity to present to the
 
01:33:41.910 --> 01:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
rest of the public body and the
 
01:33:44.669 --> 01:33:44.679 align:start position:0%
governing bodies um this you know
 
01:33:48.030 --> 01:33:48.040 align:start position:0%
undefined empirical evidence um again
 
01:33:49.590 --> 01:33:49.600 align:start position:0%
legislative body is a term for the
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
voters in a community it's not the term
 
01:33:54.149 --> 01:33:54.159 align:start position:0%
that we usually use in state St statutes
 
01:33:56.629 --> 01:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
in the rsas for planning boards usually
 
01:33:58.430 --> 01:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
you would site either the planning board
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
how it's defined in the rsas or you
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
might use a more open term like a local
 
01:34:06.510 --> 01:34:06.520 align:start position:0%
land use board which is also defined in
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
the rsas um I pointed out that lines 8
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
through 12 anyone could prevent the
 
01:34:14.470 --> 01:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
public body's will to amend the zoning
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
ordinances um appealing to the zoning
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
board a entire zoning ordinance to be
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
adopted is very unreasonable expectation
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
of the zoning board I mean their job job
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
isn't to interpret whether or not the
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
will of the voters is right or wrong
 
01:34:29.470 --> 01:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
their job is to interpret zoning in a
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
community and whether or not to Grant
 
01:34:34.149 --> 01:34:34.159 align:start position:0%
variances um or you know special special
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
use permits or other things of that
 
01:34:38.189 --> 01:34:38.199 align:start position:0%
nature um so that's that would be a huge
 
01:34:41.109 --> 01:34:41.119 align:start position:0%
change in expansion of zba's power um
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
this bill would also it would
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
essentially help municipalities from
 
01:34:45.550 --> 01:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
adopting or amending any zoning
 
01:34:47.189 --> 01:34:47.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance and I'll also mention even
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
those that would greatly incentivize
 
01:34:51.430 --> 01:34:51.440 align:start position:0%
housing if one person decided I'm an AG
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
grieved it's not defined in state law
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
but I don't want any changes ever I'm
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
going to make my zba determine whether
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
or not the public body should be allowed
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
to make these changes um and I also want
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
to go on record and say that that zoning
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
is more than just health and safety
 
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
General Welfare is also a reason for
 
01:35:12.229 --> 01:35:12.239 align:start position:0%
zoning um in the existing statute RSA um
 
01:35:15.510 --> 01:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
674 col 17 that provides all the reasons
 
01:35:18.910 --> 01:35:18.920 align:start position:0%
why municipalities may want to um to do
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
zoning and to have some of these
 
01:35:21.910 --> 01:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable regulations that promote
 
01:35:23.950 --> 01:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
smart and effective development in their
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
communities I also want to point out
 
01:35:28.070 --> 01:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
that some of these um you know what are
 
01:35:29.709 --> 01:35:29.719 align:start position:0%
defined as extraordinary restriction of
 
01:35:32.430 --> 01:35:32.440 align:start position:0%
residential property would restrict uses
 
01:35:34.830 --> 01:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
usages of existing property like for
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
example lot size requirements above 5
 
01:35:38.870 --> 01:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
acres per unit municipalities need to
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
have larger lot sizes for agricultural
 
01:35:43.470 --> 01:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
uses um that's to promote the general
 
01:35:44.870 --> 01:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
welfare and the health and safety of
 
01:35:46.870 --> 01:35:46.880 align:start position:0%
communities and to allow Farms to have
 
01:35:49.510 --> 01:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
the space to farm without you know
 
01:35:51.229 --> 01:35:51.239 align:start position:0%
impacting a Butters and a Butters having
 
01:35:54.470 --> 01:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
to go and um basically you know be upset
 
01:35:57.470 --> 01:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
with any farms in their area
 
01:35:59.870 --> 01:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
um this also kind of establishes a
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
camping by right as long as it's not
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
more than four people municipalities
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
have an interest to kind of prevent
 
01:36:08.109 --> 01:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
camping um on even on private property
 
01:36:10.590 --> 01:36:10.600 align:start position:0%
due to health and safety um and again
 
01:36:11.830 --> 01:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
you know I've mentioned in previous
 
01:36:13.790 --> 01:36:13.800 align:start position:0%
testimony the the issues with
 
01:36:15.550 --> 01:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
residential use and commercially zoned
 
01:36:18.390 --> 01:36:18.400 align:start position:0%
Lots or allowing inhome businesses use
 
01:36:20.430 --> 01:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
in residentially zoned Lots there's
 
01:36:21.910 --> 01:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
several health and safety issues that I
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned on my long testimony
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was House Bill 631 that
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
would have allowed um residential use by
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
right in commercial districts so with
 
01:36:33.350 --> 01:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
all of that um for this bill to even
 
01:36:35.229 --> 01:36:35.239 align:start position:0%
work and be implemented in municipality
 
01:36:39.149 --> 01:36:39.159 align:start position:0%
it needs a major overhaul um and just
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
the premise were also against because
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
you're basically tying the hands of
 
01:36:44.109 --> 01:36:44.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities and their voters from
 
01:36:45.990 --> 01:36:46.000 align:start position:0%
adopting again reasonable ordinances for
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
the health safety and general welfare of
 
01:36:50.109 --> 01:36:50.119 align:start position:0%
their communities to promote smart
 
01:36:52.189 --> 01:36:52.199 align:start position:0%
reasonable development um with that I
 
01:36:54.030 --> 01:36:54.040 align:start position:0%
will take any questions
 
01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:55.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mras can you give me an
 
01:36:58.830 --> 01:36:58.840 align:start position:0%
example of when a non-empirical
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
evidence is unreasonable providing
 
01:37:03.470 --> 01:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
non-empirical evidence is unreasonable
 
01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:04.709 align:start position:0%
non-empirical evidence is unreasonable
for

01:37:04.709 --> 01:37:04.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:07.550 --> 01:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities in regards to adopting a
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance in regards to adopting
 
01:37:11.990 --> 01:37:12.000 align:start position:0%
a zoning ordinance give me if you could
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
give me an example in which providing
 
01:37:18.310 --> 01:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
empiric non-empirical evidence empirical
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:24.550 --> 01:37:24.560 align:start position:0%
thing I think we requiring it is
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
unreasonable I think I think it is
 
01:37:27.870 --> 01:37:27.880 align:start position:0%
because there are times where there are
 
01:37:30.270 --> 01:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
certain aesthetic values that are
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
immeasurable um and there's I mean there
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
could be several other cases where it's
 
01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
like you know five acres how how do you
 
01:37:37.709 --> 01:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
exactly determine the acreage that's
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
good for a farm and preserving the
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
character of an agriculturally zoned
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
area you know there is some there there
 
01:37:46.589 --> 01:37:46.599 align:start position:0%
is some subjective um things that voters
 
01:37:48.189 --> 01:37:48.199 align:start position:0%
determine how they want their
 
01:37:50.070 --> 01:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
communities to look I mean we can't deny
 
01:37:51.510 --> 01:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
that but what we can say is that
 
01:37:52.990 --> 01:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's best for the voters to
 
01:37:54.830 --> 01:37:54.840 align:start position:0%
determine how they want their different
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
zones to be zoned um the kinds of
 
01:37:58.990 --> 01:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
regulations that they have there and
 
01:38:00.189 --> 01:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
usually most of the time they're going
 
01:38:02.470 --> 01:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
to use some kind of evidence in their
 
01:38:03.709 --> 01:38:03.719 align:start position:0%
findings especially if it's like a
 
01:38:05.910 --> 01:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
variance or something the zba has to you
 
01:38:07.229 --> 01:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
know there is that paper trail they say
 
01:38:08.390 --> 01:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
these are our findings for are we're
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to Grant this variance X Y andz or
 
01:38:11.350 --> 01:38:11.360 align:start position:0%
planning board when it adds
 
01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
contingencies for development says you
 
01:38:14.550 --> 01:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
know these are the reasons why we're
 
01:38:16.109 --> 01:38:16.119 align:start position:0%
adding these contingencies and sometimes
 
01:38:17.790 --> 01:38:17.800 align:start position:0%
there aesthetic things where it's like
 
01:38:20.030 --> 01:38:20.040 align:start position:0%
you know this sign based on our sign
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
ordinance it doesn't fit um in our sign
 
01:38:24.430 --> 01:38:24.440 align:start position:0%
ordinance is to preserve the historical
 
01:38:26.510 --> 01:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
character of like a a uh historic
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
village District we had an issue that
 
01:38:29.070 --> 01:38:29.080 align:start position:0%
happened with that in the town of
 
01:38:31.629 --> 01:38:31.639 align:start position:0%
wolfboro with Hunters uh Shop and Save
 
01:38:33.709 --> 01:38:33.719 align:start position:0%
being rebuilt the sign was much
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
different than what had historically
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
been there and would have impact the
 
01:38:38.589 --> 01:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
historical value of the downtown
 
01:38:40.189 --> 01:38:40.199 align:start position:0%
district and people visit wolfboro
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
because it's a beautiful downtown
 
01:38:43.709 --> 01:38:43.719 align:start position:0%
district it helps our property values
 
01:38:45.310 --> 01:38:45.320 align:start position:0%
see that people like to come to wolfboro
 
01:38:47.950 --> 01:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
and want to live in wolfboro so you know
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
that's kind of an immeasurable thing
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
though I can't show you how my property
 
01:38:52.870 --> 01:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
value or how neighboring property values
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
would be directly impacted but I know it
 
01:38:58.109 --> 01:38:58.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:03.229 --> 01:39:03.239 align:start position:0%
so thank you uh Mr chairman um so um you
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
did you did point out in your testimony
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
some of the uh you know languages uh
 
01:39:08.709 --> 01:39:08.719 align:start position:0%
language in the bill that you know I
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
think rightly and other members of the
 
01:39:11.790 --> 01:39:11.800 align:start position:0%
committee pointed out could use some
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
revision or could use some tweaks but
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
let's really go to like the spirit of
 
01:39:18.030 --> 01:39:18.040 align:start position:0%
this legislation which is showing your
 
01:39:20.870 --> 01:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
work I mean you know towns no one this
 
01:39:23.790 --> 01:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
bill is not taking away a Town's ability
 
01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
to you know pass a zoning ordinance it's
 
01:39:27.950 --> 01:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
only requesting that you know if you're
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
going to do that to go ahead and show
 
01:39:31.870 --> 01:39:31.880 align:start position:0%
your work so is the municipal
 
01:39:35.229 --> 01:39:35.239 align:start position:0%
Association is it opposed to the idea of
 
01:39:39.189 --> 01:39:39.199 align:start position:0%
towns having to explain the reasons why
 
01:39:42.510 --> 01:39:42.520 align:start position:0%
they are passing zoning
 
01:39:44.470 --> 01:39:44.480 align:start position:0%
ordinances I think it's extremely
 
01:39:46.510 --> 01:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to expect the legislative
 
01:39:48.350 --> 01:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
body to have to explain itself and
 
01:39:50.510 --> 01:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
especially pinning it onto one or two
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that would actually do the
 
01:39:54.669 --> 01:39:54.679 align:start position:0%
research for that I mean there's a
 
01:39:56.830 --> 01:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
difference between how planning boards
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
and ZB operate whether or not they're
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
going to Grant a variance or how they do
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
you know site plan review and everything
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
and how they approve a development um
 
01:40:06.030 --> 01:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
and how they you know post their F
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
because they do they add their
 
01:40:08.270 --> 01:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
contingencies and their motion and the
 
01:40:09.830 --> 01:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
requirements and they you know there's
 
01:40:11.470 --> 01:40:11.480 align:start position:0%
debate and it's mentioned in the meeting
 
01:40:13.310 --> 01:40:13.320 align:start position:0%
minutes what they discussed and you know
 
01:40:14.550 --> 01:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
the planner keeps it with some of the
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
building documents and the zba has to
 
01:40:18.709 --> 01:40:18.719 align:start position:0%
you know they show their findings as to
 
01:40:21.030 --> 01:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
why they deny or approve a variance um
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
same case in in Wolf bro with Hunter IG
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
they had the grant a variance so then it
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
could have the parking lot in front of
 
01:40:27.709 --> 01:40:27.719 align:start position:0%
the building rather than the building be
 
01:40:30.109 --> 01:40:30.119 align:start position:0%
right up against Main Street and they
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
posted findings about how it would have
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
impacted um not just the ability of the
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
developer to rebuild what's a really
 
01:40:37.470 --> 01:40:37.480 align:start position:0%
important grocery store in our town but
 
01:40:40.470 --> 01:40:40.480 align:start position:0%
also the historic um uh look of our
 
01:40:44.030 --> 01:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
downtown area our our kind of um our our
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
dense downtown area so you know these
 
01:40:48.709 --> 01:40:48.719 align:start position:0%
things are being done but this bill is
 
01:40:50.270 --> 01:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
written is essentially saying that
 
01:40:52.870 --> 01:40:52.880 align:start position:0%
someone from the public body the voters
 
01:40:54.470 --> 01:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
someone like myself you know or
 
01:40:55.790 --> 01:40:55.800 align:start position:0%
yourselves when you go to your town
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
meeting would have to justify why the
 
01:41:01.629 --> 01:41:01.639 align:start position:0%
entire public body is voting to adopt an
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
ordinance even if it's making it so it's
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
easier to develop in a community and
 
01:41:07.669 --> 01:41:07.679 align:start position:0%
then one person who considers themselves
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
AG grieved could basically nullify that
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
and force the zba to determine whether
 
01:41:13.589 --> 01:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
or not that was a legitimate zoning
 
01:41:14.510 --> 01:41:14.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance that should have been
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
considered by the uh the public body
 
01:41:20.629 --> 01:41:20.639 align:start position:0%
so I hope that answers your question I
 
01:41:21.709 --> 01:41:21.719 align:start position:0%
mean we're kind of talking about two
 
01:41:23.310 --> 01:41:23.320 align:start position:0%
different things and this bill is trying
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
to do one thing and using a completely
 
01:41:27.790 --> 01:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
wrong terminology and its attempt to do
 
01:41:29.430 --> 01:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
it which would ultimately undermine
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
local control and the
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
voters U thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
01:41:35.709 --> 01:41:35.719 align:start position:0%
kind of my followup and one of the
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
reasons why I personally really like the
 
01:41:40.589 --> 01:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
idea of the community showing its work
 
01:41:42.510 --> 01:41:42.520 align:start position:0%
as you talked about you know well the
 
01:41:45.070 --> 01:41:45.080 align:start position:0%
community you know deciding how it looks
 
01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:46.639 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that I'm extremely
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
concerned about is a community not
 
01:41:49.589 --> 01:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
deciding so much how the buildings in
 
01:41:51.270 --> 01:41:51.280 align:start position:0%
the community look but deciding what the
 
01:41:53.589 --> 01:41:53.599 align:start position:0%
people in the community look like you
 
01:41:55.990 --> 01:41:56.000 align:start position:0%
know and as someone of French Canadian
 
01:41:57.470 --> 01:41:57.480 align:start position:0%
descent historically in Northern New
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
England people you know who had last
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
name names like mine were excluded from
 
01:42:04.510 --> 01:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
certain places in certain communities so
 
01:42:06.830 --> 01:42:06.840 align:start position:0%
with the legislative body not having to
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
show its work can you suggest something
 
01:42:11.950 --> 01:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
that you know we could you know some
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
kind of tweak or something to make sure
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
that these zoning ordinances are not
 
01:42:17.589 --> 01:42:17.599 align:start position:0%
being passed for reasons which would
 
01:42:19.709 --> 01:42:19.719 align:start position:0%
implicate fair housing violations which
 
01:42:22.109 --> 01:42:22.119 align:start position:0%
would have a disproportionate impact on
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
certain protected classes and categories
 
01:42:24.159 --> 01:42:26.149 align:start position:0%
certain protected classes and categories
of

01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:42:29.109 --> 01:42:29.119 align:start position:0%
people I'm not aware of any uh zoning or
 
01:42:31.189 --> 01:42:31.199 align:start position:0%
planning ordinances that are currently
 
01:42:34.189 --> 01:42:34.199 align:start position:0%
in violation of fair housing um I think
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
the zoning districts and the regulations
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
they have for them are they're the same
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
for everyone who wants to move into that
 
01:42:42.430 --> 01:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
zoning District or wants to develop in
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
that zoning District it's a fair and
 
01:42:46.390 --> 01:42:46.400 align:start position:0%
equal playing field um and ultimately
 
01:42:48.629 --> 01:42:48.639 align:start position:0%
the voters are the ones who determine
 
01:42:51.589 --> 01:42:51.599 align:start position:0%
what the uh what the zoning ordinances
 
01:42:53.629 --> 01:42:53.639 align:start position:0%
will be in a community and how district
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
is to be developed and um that's
 
01:42:57.550 --> 01:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
probably the best place uh for the
 
01:42:59.510 --> 01:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
decision to be made ultimately is with a
 
01:43:01.270 --> 01:43:01.280 align:start position:0%
planning board working with a you know a
 
01:43:04.589 --> 01:43:04.599 align:start position:0%
town planner or circuit Rider to develop
 
01:43:06.310 --> 01:43:06.320 align:start position:0%
um smart reasonable zoning ordinances
 
01:43:07.629 --> 01:43:07.639 align:start position:0%
and to present them to the voters to
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
justify them and to look for the voters
 
01:43:11.950 --> 01:43:11.960 align:start position:0%
approval or at times disapproval well
 
01:43:13.950 --> 01:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
for we had one year where we voted down
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
every single planning and zoning
 
01:43:17.790 --> 01:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
ordinance that's how we felt that year
 
01:43:20.669 --> 01:43:20.679 align:start position:0%
so you know um some years they all pass
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
Pretty you know it's dependent by town
 
01:43:25.310 --> 01:43:25.320 align:start position:0%
too so ultimately um you know and also
 
01:43:26.629 --> 01:43:26.639 align:start position:0%
this assumption that there isn't a paper
 
01:43:28.310 --> 01:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
trail that planning boards and zoning
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
boards um have they do have that and
 
01:43:33.589 --> 01:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
that's to legally protect themselves as
 
01:43:35.790 --> 01:43:35.800 align:start position:0%
they're trying to implement the zoning
 
01:43:37.990 --> 01:43:38.000 align:start position:0%
ordinances and to interpret them based
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
on the will of the voters and um so they
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
do keep that paper trail and as
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
representative Faxton mentioned um it's
 
01:43:44.589 --> 01:43:44.599 align:start position:0%
for when there's appeals right when
 
01:43:46.709 --> 01:43:46.719 align:start position:0%
there's an appeals either to the zba um
 
01:43:48.910 --> 01:43:48.920 align:start position:0%
or appeals to the uh to the um to the
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
superior court or to the housing board
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
um so you know again this is a pretty
 
01:43:55.149 --> 01:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
complicated issue and to try to address
 
01:43:57.669 --> 01:43:57.679 align:start position:0%
it in one bill and make the public body
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
have to justify its votes is very
 
01:44:02.229 --> 01:44:02.239 align:start position:0%
difficult it's very unwieldy I'm not
 
01:44:04.070 --> 01:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
sure how any town could possibly
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
implement this properly without someone
 
01:44:07.950 --> 01:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
basically finding this loophole and
 
01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
using it to stop any zoning ordinances
 
01:44:14.510 --> 01:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
amended representative
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:44:22.270 --> 01:44:22.280 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify this morning um I
 
01:44:24.030 --> 01:44:24.040 align:start position:0%
have two questions
 
01:44:26.790 --> 01:44:26.800 align:start position:0%
um and the first one is that you
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned a concern that the bill refers
 
01:44:31.030 --> 01:44:31.040 align:start position:0%
to the legislative body of the
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
municipality but doesn't mention the
 
01:44:36.430 --> 01:44:36.440 align:start position:0%
planning board in reference to providing
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
um empirical evidence but couldn't the
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
legislative body um have the planning
 
01:44:46.910 --> 01:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
board or someone from the planning board
 
01:44:50.030 --> 01:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
provide the empirical evidence and if
 
01:44:55.470 --> 01:44:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.149 --> 01:44:57.159 align:start position:0%
the planning board is a governing body
 
01:44:59.709 --> 01:44:59.719 align:start position:0%
it's not a legislative body they're two
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
distinctly different things so by having
 
01:45:04.550 --> 01:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
the governing body present the empirical
 
01:45:07.669 --> 01:45:07.679 align:start position:0%
evidence which is undefined um it
 
01:45:09.550 --> 01:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the the it wouldn't be the
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
legislative body now I guess you could
 
01:45:13.149 --> 01:45:13.159 align:start position:0%
say theoretically they could collect all
 
01:45:14.750 --> 01:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
this empirical evidence and then provide
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
it to a someone who's a member of the
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislative body to provide it to
 
01:45:21.629 --> 01:45:21.639 align:start position:0%
everyone else but we're not sure where a
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
form would exist because these planning
 
01:45:25.470 --> 01:45:25.480 align:start position:0%
you know these Planning and Zoning
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%
amendments aren't especially in SP2
 
01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:29.880 align:start position:0%
towns they're not debated at the town
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
meeting so I'm not sure where there
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
would be a a proper venue to to even
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
discuss whether or not these empirical
 
01:45:38.390 --> 01:45:38.400 align:start position:0%
findings are legitimate and you know
 
01:45:40.629 --> 01:45:40.639 align:start position:0%
ultimately then you have this AG grieved
 
01:45:43.229 --> 01:45:43.239 align:start position:0%
party um that isn't mentioned I mean
 
01:45:47.510 --> 01:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
they cite RSA 676 col 5 Roman 1 um but
 
01:45:50.270 --> 01:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
that terminology agree party isn't used
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
anywhere in that statute the entire 676
 
01:45:55.709 --> 01:45:55.719 align:start position:0%
colon 5
 
01:45:58.629 --> 01:45:58.639 align:start position:0%
um it's just I'm I'm not sure how you
 
01:46:00.510 --> 01:46:00.520 align:start position:0%
you could make this bill work as it's
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
currently written it's just it's a very
 
01:46:04.350 --> 01:46:04.360 align:start position:0%
unworkable piece of legislation and we
 
01:46:05.990 --> 01:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
see the intent and we still disagree
 
01:46:07.870 --> 01:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
with the intent but just for the
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
committee to understand I we wouldn't
 
01:46:12.790 --> 01:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
know how to tell a municipality to do
 
01:46:15.589 --> 01:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
this because it's just not possible
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
follow up on the first question yes
 
01:46:20.950 --> 01:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
follow um thank you
 
01:46:23.629 --> 01:46:23.639 align:start position:0%
um you um
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there would be no way to
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
get this information out in sb2 town but
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
couldn't it be mailed out to the
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
voters if I guess theoretically you
 
01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
could create a mailing requirement and
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers could pay for you know why
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
zoning amendments are being adopted to
 
01:46:45.629 --> 01:46:45.639 align:start position:0%
be mailed out but then again the ballot
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
in sb2 towns there's a statutory
 
01:46:49.550 --> 01:46:49.560 align:start position:0%
requirement that they explain what the
 
01:46:51.669 --> 01:46:51.679 align:start position:0%
zoning or the planning amendment is
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
doing right as an explanation and it has
 
01:46:56.550 --> 01:46:56.560 align:start position:0%
to be understood by kind of in layman's
 
01:46:58.709 --> 01:46:58.719 align:start position:0%
terms so that kind of is already done if
 
01:47:00.270 --> 01:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
someone goes and reviews the ballot and
 
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
becomes a knowledgeable voter and
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
understands what exactly the zoning
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
amendments are that are being presented
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
to them that they ultimately will be
 
01:47:09.189 --> 01:47:09.199 align:start position:0%
voting on so couldn't the evidence be
 
01:47:11.430 --> 01:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
part of that explanation on the
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
ballot I know I can speak from personal
 
01:47:16.870 --> 01:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
experience as someone who's a member of
 
01:47:18.629 --> 01:47:18.639 align:start position:0%
the legislative body in wolfboro is that
 
01:47:20.629 --> 01:47:20.639 align:start position:0%
every year our planning board has an
 
01:47:22.669 --> 01:47:22.679 align:start position:0%
information session it's coming up I
 
01:47:24.750 --> 01:47:24.760 align:start position:0%
want to say this Wednesday or Thursday
 
01:47:27.149 --> 01:47:27.159 align:start position:0%
and they explain why they're making each
 
01:47:28.910 --> 01:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
zoning Amendment change they record it
 
01:47:31.669 --> 01:47:31.679 align:start position:0%
and they put it on the town's website um
 
01:47:33.149 --> 01:47:33.159 align:start position:0%
that's something you know different
 
01:47:34.550 --> 01:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
communities have different capacity to
 
01:47:36.430 --> 01:47:36.440 align:start position:0%
do those types of things um but I
 
01:47:37.870 --> 01:47:37.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't recommend putting the
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
explanation of quote undefined empirical
 
01:47:42.109 --> 01:47:42.119 align:start position:0%
evidence or sorry undefined quote
 
01:47:45.070 --> 01:47:45.080 align:start position:0%
empirical evidence um on the ballot the
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
ballots would end up being like you know
 
01:47:48.950 --> 01:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
be hundreds of pages
 
01:47:52.870 --> 01:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
long my second question um is about
 
01:47:57.070 --> 01:47:57.080 align:start position:0%
about the um 5 acre um provision and
 
01:48:01.790 --> 01:48:01.800 align:start position:0%
that is that the bill um would um uh say
 
01:48:04.669 --> 01:48:04.679 align:start position:0%
that that the uh municipality has to
 
01:48:06.990 --> 01:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
provide evidence if it's going to
 
01:48:10.030 --> 01:48:10.040 align:start position:0%
require anything larger than 5 acres and
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that 5 Acres isn't big
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
enough um for a farm but the fact that
 
01:48:19.109 --> 01:48:19.119 align:start position:0%
they can't that the town can't require a
 
01:48:21.870 --> 01:48:21.880 align:start position:0%
lot to be larger than 5 acres does that
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
prevent a farmer from buying a lot or
 
01:48:26.189 --> 01:48:26.199 align:start position:0%
buying several lots and putting them
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:34.669 --> 01:48:34.679 align:start position:0%
Acres that's a good question I'd have to
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
do some more research on that but um I'm
 
01:48:39.430 --> 01:48:39.440 align:start position:0%
not entirely certain there are many
 
01:48:41.750 --> 01:48:41.760 align:start position:0%
people who are trying to buy a bunch of
 
01:48:44.350 --> 01:48:44.360 align:start position:0%
lots in a residential area to create a
 
01:48:47.910 --> 01:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
farming um you know a farming into to
 
01:48:50.109 --> 01:48:50.119 align:start position:0%
start a farm and um I'm not sure what
 
01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
the rules I would probably guess my best
 
01:48:55.310 --> 01:48:55.320 align:start position:0%
assumption that um there's probably
 
01:48:58.070 --> 01:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
rules in local municipalities for how
 
01:49:00.229 --> 01:49:00.239 align:start position:0%
you can combine Lots um and they're
 
01:49:02.030 --> 01:49:02.040 align:start position:0%
probably governed what those rules are
 
01:49:05.030 --> 01:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know some level by state RSA but um
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
I can't speak exactly to that I wasn't
 
01:49:08.350 --> 01:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
anticipating that question this morning
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
AR aren't we talking about rural farming
 
01:49:13.070 --> 01:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
areas and really about one person buying
 
01:49:15.430 --> 01:49:15.440 align:start position:0%
a farm from someone else or a family
 
01:49:19.310 --> 01:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
buying a farm from another family um and
 
01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
that farm could be as big as necessary
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
the fact that the town can't require it
 
01:49:27.430 --> 01:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
to be bigger than 5 Acres how does that
 
01:49:30.470 --> 01:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
prevent the farmer from having a farm
 
01:49:33.830 --> 01:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's bigger than 5 Acres so that would
 
01:49:35.870 --> 01:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
be that wouldn't be a change of use and
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
it would probably be already existing in
 
01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
an agriculturally zoned area where it's
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
permitted if there was already a farm
 
01:49:42.750 --> 01:49:42.760 align:start position:0%
there um the concern would be if someone
 
01:49:46.030 --> 01:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
was in an area that um someone was in an
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
area that permitted farming in the zone
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
and all of a sudden the you know the
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
community um can't require lot sizes
 
01:49:55.030 --> 01:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
larger than 5 Acres but it's
 
01:49:56.950 --> 01:49:56.960 align:start position:0%
advantageous to require 10 acre lot
 
01:49:58.550 --> 01:49:58.560 align:start position:0%
sizes for the farm because based on the
 
01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
farming practices that are done in that
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
Community that's this amount of area
 
01:50:04.750 --> 01:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
necessary to have a farming Enterprise
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
where it doesn't impact the abuts in a
 
01:50:08.149 --> 01:50:08.159 align:start position:0%
negative way where the abuts are making
 
01:50:10.030 --> 01:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
complaints and complaining about you
 
01:50:11.669 --> 01:50:11.679 align:start position:0%
know an example might be in a lot of
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
farms they have a lot of runoff and a
 
01:50:16.189 --> 01:50:16.199 align:start position:0%
lot of that runoff has high amounts of
 
01:50:19.910 --> 01:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
um different um I mean really it can
 
01:50:21.910 --> 01:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
smell and the runoff can pollute
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
neighbors um well water compute you know
 
01:50:26.189 --> 01:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
groundwater on neighboring Lots so
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
having larger lot sizes for farming is
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
important for protecting Community
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
Health and um and the the abutters
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
health and the uh property values of the
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
abutters I mean there's been examples
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
where people have tried to farm on lot
 
01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
sizes that are significantly smaller
 
01:50:42.550 --> 01:50:42.560 align:start position:0%
than what's probably required for the
 
01:50:44.470 --> 01:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
type of farming they're doing and where
 
01:50:46.390 --> 01:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
people go to the town and complain about
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
you know different different health
 
01:50:50.709 --> 01:50:50.719 align:start position:0%
issues and different smells that they're
 
01:50:52.149 --> 01:50:52.159 align:start position:0%
that are coming from the farm that's
 
01:50:54.229 --> 01:50:54.239 align:start position:0%
impacting their lives and their private
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
property thank you thank you um
 
01:50:58.629 --> 01:50:58.639 align:start position:0%
representative Dumont and then
 
01:51:00.669 --> 01:51:00.679 align:start position:0%
Daxton just one quick question to your
 
01:51:01.950 --> 01:51:01.960 align:start position:0%
point can you explain to me why a
 
01:51:03.470 --> 01:51:03.480 align:start position:0%
municipality would need to tell its
 
01:51:04.870 --> 01:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
residents that and why the residents
 
01:51:05.990 --> 01:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to figure that out on
 
01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:08.870 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to figure that out on
their

01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:11.669 --> 01:51:11.679 align:start position:0%
own you you'd be amazed how often people
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
buy buy land or buy um homes sight
 
01:51:17.550 --> 01:51:17.560 align:start position:0%
unseen and haven't actually done their
 
01:51:19.669 --> 01:51:19.679 align:start position:0%
due diligence to see one if the lot can
 
01:51:21.910 --> 01:51:21.920 align:start position:0%
even be developed whether or not it's on
 
01:51:24.109 --> 01:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
a class six Road or a class four or five
 
01:51:26.350 --> 01:51:26.360 align:start position:0%
Road I mean there's several reasons why
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
and why why you know people might not do
 
01:51:30.669 --> 01:51:30.679 align:start position:0%
their due diligence to understand the
 
01:51:32.669 --> 01:51:32.679 align:start position:0%
lot that they're buying and what uses
 
01:51:34.470 --> 01:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
are permitted there and how it's allowed
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
to be developed but um the
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
municipalities their concern is that
 
01:51:39.550 --> 01:51:39.560 align:start position:0%
they're putting regulations in different
 
01:51:41.310 --> 01:51:41.320 align:start position:0%
zones for the communities to protect
 
01:51:43.589 --> 01:51:43.599 align:start position:0%
health safety and the general welfare
 
01:51:46.270 --> 01:51:46.280 align:start position:0%
and to um to basically promote um smart
 
01:51:50.030 --> 01:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
and reasonable development go ahead so
 
01:51:51.430 --> 01:51:51.440 align:start position:0%
followup so what you're saying is that
 
01:51:52.990 --> 01:51:53.000 align:start position:0%
the municipality knows better than the
 
01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:54.109 align:start position:0%
the municipality knows better than the
property

01:51:54.109 --> 01:51:54.119 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:51:56.910 --> 01:51:56.920 align:start position:0%
owner no that's not necessarily what I'm
 
01:51:57.870 --> 01:51:57.880 align:start position:0%
saying what I'm saying is the
 
01:52:00.030 --> 01:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
municipality is trying its best to
 
01:52:02.109 --> 01:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
balance the needs of property owners and
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
the general Community to promote health
 
01:52:05.310 --> 01:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
safety and Welfare and to adopt
 
01:52:07.229 --> 01:52:07.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances so then the development
 
01:52:09.910 --> 01:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't impact other property owners
 
01:52:11.669 --> 01:52:11.679 align:start position:0%
negatively it's trying to balance the
 
01:52:13.470 --> 01:52:13.480 align:start position:0%
rights of property owners that is that
 
01:52:15.149 --> 01:52:15.159 align:start position:0%
is the goal and to promote health and
 
01:52:16.870 --> 01:52:16.880 align:start position:0%
safety and the general welfare of the
 
01:52:19.189 --> 01:52:19.199 align:start position:0%
entire Community um so it isn't one
 
01:52:20.669 --> 01:52:20.679 align:start position:0%
property owner that's doing development
 
01:52:22.189 --> 01:52:22.199 align:start position:0%
at the expense of everyone else
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
especially esecially those who are
 
01:52:24.709 --> 01:52:24.719 align:start position:0%
already existing you know peacefully on
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
their lots that are zoned for the
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
current usage that they're using it
 
01:52:31.870 --> 01:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
for representative
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
taxon so I share as I said earlier I I
 
01:52:38.709 --> 01:52:38.719 align:start position:0%
share your
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
concerns uh I don't hate the bill uh
 
01:52:46.950 --> 01:52:46.960 align:start position:0%
the I think it's a basket full of
 
01:52:48.910 --> 01:52:48.920 align:start position:0%
interesting or good
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
ideas um I disagree with you about the 5
 
01:52:55.149 --> 01:52:55.159 align:start position:0%
Aker aspect I see I go back to what
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs said I don't I
 
01:52:59.790 --> 01:52:59.800 align:start position:0%
don't see how the fact that I require I
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
can't have bigger than a 5 acre doesn't
 
01:53:04.069 --> 01:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
mean I can couldn't have a 50 acre and I
 
01:53:06.870 --> 01:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important for the the commit
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
the the committee to understand one of
 
01:53:11.830 --> 01:53:11.840 align:start position:0%
the things are are are we have
 
01:53:14.910 --> 01:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
176 towns in this state something a
 
01:53:19.669 --> 01:53:19.679 align:start position:0%
whole bunch a whole lot and everybody's
 
01:53:22.030 --> 01:53:22.040 align:start position:0%
got a little bit different zoning and a
 
01:53:24.430 --> 01:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
little bit different take on it so and
 
01:53:26.550 --> 01:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
in my towns the Two Towns I represent we
 
01:53:29.470 --> 01:53:29.480 align:start position:0%
still have traditional town meeting y uh
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
and if this came if there was no fix on
 
01:53:34.030 --> 01:53:34.040 align:start position:0%
this in this past which I think it needs
 
01:53:37.069 --> 01:53:37.079 align:start position:0%
some fixes my your your point is you
 
01:53:39.350 --> 01:53:39.360 align:start position:0%
don't know how the town would pres would
 
01:53:42.790 --> 01:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
handle this well in an SP2 town and in a
 
01:53:45.470 --> 01:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
town meeting format you have a budget a
 
01:53:48.470 --> 01:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
joint budget uh and town warrant hearing
 
01:53:50.830 --> 01:53:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's a town warrant which includes the
 
01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
zoning changes month or so before the
 
01:53:56.629 --> 01:53:56.639 align:start position:0%
town meeting or the vote and you would
 
01:53:58.470 --> 01:53:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's where you would hear as we did in
 
01:54:01.470 --> 01:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
my town last week the zoning the
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
proposed zoning changes if anybody cares
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
which oftentimes they
 
01:54:09.550 --> 01:54:09.560 align:start position:0%
don't so Mike I I think that's a simple
 
01:54:11.109 --> 01:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
thing and maybe it needs to be spelled
 
01:54:14.910 --> 01:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
out more clearly in the bill um but I
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
think it's important to understand that
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
in my town There's No Zone that either
 
01:54:22.990 --> 01:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
explicitly allows farming disallows
 
01:54:25.310 --> 01:54:25.320 align:start position:0%
farming you want to have a farm knock
 
01:54:29.069 --> 01:54:29.079 align:start position:0%
yourself out uh and to the further point
 
01:54:30.350 --> 01:54:30.360 align:start position:0%
just because somehow we got on the
 
01:54:33.030 --> 01:54:33.040 align:start position:0%
subject of farming under the current New
 
01:54:35.270 --> 01:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire law if you own a piece of land
 
01:54:37.830 --> 01:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
that is less than 10 acres but you
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
generate uh the majority of your income
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
from agricultural means you can have a
 
01:54:46.510 --> 01:54:46.520 align:start position:0%
quarter acre lot in uh current use
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
rather than in the typical the rule is
 
01:54:51.870 --> 01:54:51.880 align:start position:0%
normally 10 acres or more so there's a
 
01:54:54.510 --> 01:54:54.520 align:start position:0%
lot of variations that I think we would
 
01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
be need to be conscious of in what we do
 
01:54:59.589 --> 01:54:59.599 align:start position:0%
here because we don't want to we don't
 
01:55:02.109 --> 01:55:02.119 align:start position:0%
want to mess things up I do have
 
01:55:03.709 --> 01:55:03.719 align:start position:0%
concerns as I said earlier I do have
 
01:55:05.589 --> 01:55:05.599 align:start position:0%
concerns about the bill I think some of
 
01:55:07.510 --> 01:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
the ideas are really good I think some
 
01:55:11.069 --> 01:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
of them are less so but and I do your
 
01:55:12.990 --> 01:55:13.000 align:start position:0%
point I think is really the point I was
 
01:55:15.990 --> 01:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
making earlier in terms of the current
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
system of local governments that we have
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which there's about
 
01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
50 you we need need to make sure that we
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
structure this in a way that the
 
01:55:29.790 --> 01:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
implementation doesn't con make it more
 
01:55:32.589 --> 01:55:32.599 align:start position:0%
complicated or confusing and make it
 
01:55:35.510 --> 01:55:35.520 align:start position:0%
clear who's supposed to do what uh the
 
01:55:37.390 --> 01:55:37.400 align:start position:0%
your the point you make of one
 
01:55:39.870 --> 01:55:39.880 align:start position:0%
individual tying up all the zoning in
 
01:55:42.510 --> 01:55:42.520 align:start position:0%
town forever while I would hate to think
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that's true you could at least time
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
up for half a dozen years in court
 
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
proving that that getting proved that
 
01:55:49.709 --> 01:55:49.719 align:start position:0%
you were wrong if you were really
 
01:55:52.830 --> 01:55:52.840 align:start position:0%
motivated so um I was that a question
 
01:55:54.870 --> 01:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
that was a what all right I think we're
 
01:55:57.069 --> 01:55:57.079 align:start position:0%
getting I think we're like this is going
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
on longer than I expected it to um so
 
01:56:02.550 --> 01:56:02.560 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions or can we
 
01:56:05.189 --> 01:56:05.199 align:start position:0%
move on Mr DET thank you very much
 
01:56:11.589 --> 01:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.790 --> 01:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
back just turn the mic on
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
please chair Alexander Vice chair Cole
 
01:56:24.069 --> 01:56:24.079 align:start position:0%
members of the committee it's an honor
 
01:56:26.109 --> 01:56:26.119 align:start position:0%
to be back before you today again my
 
01:56:27.709 --> 01:56:27.719 align:start position:0%
name is Samuel Hooper I'm legislative
 
01:56:29.550 --> 01:56:29.560 align:start position:0%
council with the institute for justice a
 
01:56:32.189 --> 01:56:32.199 align:start position:0%
nonprofit civil liberties law firm uh
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
that works nationally to work on issues
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
of economic Liberty and property rights
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
we have a zoning Justice project
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
specifically that um fights to try and
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
end the kind of exclusionary zoning that
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
we see across the country that can limit
 
01:56:47.149 --> 01:56:47.159 align:start position:0%
property rights and a contribut to the
 
01:56:49.950 --> 01:56:49.960 align:start position:0%
housing crisis um J is supportive of
 
01:56:52.390 --> 01:56:52.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um we think that there's some
 
01:56:54.030 --> 01:56:54.040 align:start position:0%
word smithing to be done potentially but
 
01:56:56.910 --> 01:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
we're very um admiring of the intent
 
01:56:58.629 --> 01:56:58.639 align:start position:0%
behind this bill because it introduces
 
01:57:00.629 --> 01:57:00.639 align:start position:0%
the rigorous standard a more rigorous
 
01:57:03.229 --> 01:57:03.239 align:start position:0%
standard of review for um for zoning
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
ordinances that impose extraordinary
 
01:57:07.430 --> 01:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
restrictions on property rights and by
 
01:57:09.149 --> 01:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
requiring municipalities to actually
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
show their working to justify some of
 
01:57:12.750 --> 01:57:12.760 align:start position:0%
the restrictions that they impose on
 
01:57:15.189 --> 01:57:15.199 align:start position:0%
property rights with empirical evidence
 
01:57:17.310 --> 01:57:17.320 align:start position:0%
um and show a necessity for those
 
01:57:19.470 --> 01:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
regulations based on health and safety
 
01:57:21.629 --> 01:57:21.639 align:start position:0%
this bill kind of mirrors what in the in
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
the Jud process um we we have the
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
concept of strict scrutiny whereby if
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
there is a um um an infringement or a
 
01:57:31.589 --> 01:57:31.599 align:start position:0%
restriction on a fundamental right um
 
01:57:33.149 --> 01:57:33.159 align:start position:0%
the government has to show a compelling
 
01:57:34.589 --> 01:57:34.599 align:start position:0%
government interest in having that
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
restriction in the first place and also
 
01:57:38.270 --> 01:57:38.280 align:start position:0%
show that that restriction is narrowly
 
01:57:40.470 --> 01:57:40.480 align:start position:0%
tailored to the least restrictive means
 
01:57:42.109 --> 01:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
of achieving what the government's goal
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
is um um you know at the moment strict
 
01:57:48.830 --> 01:57:48.840 align:start position:0%
scrutiny tends to be um reserved for um
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
you know core fundamental rights so you
 
01:57:54.589 --> 01:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
look at issues to do with um uh race for
 
01:57:57.189 --> 01:57:57.199 align:start position:0%
example um it currently doesn't extend
 
01:57:59.830 --> 01:57:59.840 align:start position:0%
to property rights and in the world of
 
01:58:01.709 --> 01:58:01.719 align:start position:0%
property right a much more lenient um
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
standard of review exists rational basis
 
01:58:05.470 --> 01:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
review where pretty much anything the
 
01:58:07.589 --> 01:58:07.599 align:start position:0%
government says um the court has to
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
defer to and take face value and we see
 
01:58:11.830 --> 01:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
this just RIT large with the kind of
 
01:58:13.910 --> 01:58:13.920 align:start position:0%
restrictive zoning or ordinances we see
 
01:58:16.189 --> 01:58:16.199 align:start position:0%
around the country um that can be quite
 
01:58:17.990 --> 01:58:18.000 align:start position:0%
Preposterous not at all rooted in health
 
01:58:20.550 --> 01:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
and safety in any way um but just have
 
01:58:22.390 --> 01:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
to be waved through by the court because
 
01:58:24.390 --> 01:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're not allowed to um you know
 
01:58:26.830 --> 01:58:26.840 align:start position:0%
exercise any additional kind of review
 
01:58:28.510 --> 01:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
um we like this bill because it kind of
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
approaches the issue from a high level
 
01:58:32.310 --> 01:58:32.320 align:start position:0%
top- down perspective so we think it's
 
01:58:33.750 --> 01:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
great to have more granular bills
 
01:58:35.629 --> 01:58:35.639 align:start position:0%
looking at minimum lot size looking at
 
01:58:37.390 --> 01:58:37.400 align:start position:0%
manufactured homes residential and
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
Commercial all of that's good but
 
01:58:40.669 --> 01:58:40.679 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's also good to go back to
 
01:58:42.510 --> 01:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
first principes like we're big on that
 
01:58:44.669 --> 01:58:44.679 align:start position:0%
at the institute for justice um we've
 
01:58:46.510 --> 01:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
seen a similar Bill actually um
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
currently um make quite a lot of
 
01:58:50.669 --> 01:58:50.679 align:start position:0%
progress in Montana where they're famous
 
01:58:52.589 --> 01:58:52.599 align:start position:0%
for their Montana housing miror they've
 
01:58:54.589 --> 01:58:54.599 align:start position:0%
done a lot of work um on bills
 
01:58:55.870 --> 01:58:55.880 align:start position:0%
unfortunately this bill I think it was
 
01:58:58.589 --> 01:58:58.599 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 146 um having passed the
 
01:59:00.149 --> 01:59:00.159 align:start position:0%
housing committee it then failed on the
 
01:59:02.589 --> 01:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
senate floor and a very close vote um
 
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
there was quite a lot of coordinated
 
01:59:05.589 --> 01:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
opposition from some of the municipal
 
01:59:07.189 --> 01:59:07.199 align:start position:0%
leagues but it did a similar thing it
 
01:59:08.629 --> 01:59:08.639 align:start position:0%
tried to sck that concept of strict
 
01:59:11.030 --> 01:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
scrutiny and just tell towns and cities
 
01:59:12.790 --> 01:59:12.800 align:start position:0%
look show your work if you want to
 
01:59:14.910 --> 01:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
restrict property rights then just show
 
01:59:16.550 --> 01:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
how this is actually tied to something
 
01:59:19.149 --> 01:59:19.159 align:start position:0%
that's not just um a backhanded way to
 
01:59:20.990 --> 01:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
stop certain people certain types of
 
01:59:23.510 --> 01:59:23.520 align:start position:0%
housing from existing Community um it's
 
01:59:25.629 --> 01:59:25.639 align:start position:0%
not an onerous requirement at all and in
 
01:59:27.270 --> 01:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
fact it could potentially save City's
 
01:59:28.870 --> 01:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
work because by doing this work of
 
01:59:31.149 --> 01:59:31.159 align:start position:0%
justifying the zoning ordinance upfront
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
once um and getting you know um judicial
 
01:59:36.510 --> 01:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
confirmation that that's um a valid
 
01:59:38.310 --> 01:59:38.320 align:start position:0%
ordinance you then save yourself having
 
01:59:40.870 --> 01:59:40.880 align:start position:0%
to fight the same appeal a hundred times
 
01:59:42.550 --> 01:59:42.560 align:start position:0%
when different agreed Property Owners
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
then come up and try to dispute it so we
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
think it's better more efficient use of
 
01:59:47.990 --> 01:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
government resources as well to do that
 
01:59:52.189 --> 01:59:52.199 align:start position:0%
work up front um so again um if um I I
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
commend this bill to the committee I
 
01:59:55.390 --> 01:59:55.400 align:start position:0%
think it could be very good I think um
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
it would be worth more exploration of
 
02:00:00.069 --> 02:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
some of the specific um uh specific
 
02:00:01.430 --> 02:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
Clauses in the bill to make sure that
 
02:00:03.790 --> 02:00:03.800 align:start position:0%
they do achieve their desired effects um
 
02:00:05.310 --> 02:00:05.320 align:start position:0%
but we we very much like how this
 
02:00:07.390 --> 02:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
interacts with the other bills actually
 
02:00:08.990 --> 02:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
um we think that establishing that floor
 
02:00:11.229 --> 02:00:11.239 align:start position:0%
of basic property rights is really good
 
02:00:13.669 --> 02:00:13.679 align:start position:0%
um and then um the more detailed bills
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
to go into minimum lot size and other
 
02:00:17.470 --> 02:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
things can serve as supplementary to
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
that so again thank you very much for my
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm very happy to take any
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
questions the committee May are there
 
02:00:23.990 --> 02:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:00:25.990 --> 02:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
buolo thank you very much uh thank you
 
02:00:28.109 --> 02:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman thank you for your testimony
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
um given Institute for justice um and my
 
02:00:33.189 --> 02:00:33.199 align:start position:0%
familiarity with it in terms of it does
 
02:00:36.750 --> 02:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
um uh quite a bit of uh litigation and
 
02:00:38.510 --> 02:00:38.520 align:start position:0%
things like that regarding like you said
 
02:00:41.030 --> 02:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
economic Liberty and property rights um
 
02:00:42.270 --> 02:00:42.280 align:start position:0%
I would presume that Institute for
 
02:00:43.709 --> 02:00:43.719 align:start position:0%
justice would be quite familiar with
 
02:00:45.589 --> 02:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
different uh appeals processes and
 
02:00:47.830 --> 02:00:47.840 align:start position:0%
things like that would it be possible to
 
02:00:51.189 --> 02:00:51.199 align:start position:0%
maybe submit um you know you mentioned
 
02:00:53.390 --> 02:00:53.400 align:start position:0%
word smithing or tweaking some of the uh
 
02:00:55.069 --> 02:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
things with this bill I think one of the
 
02:00:56.910 --> 02:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
concerns is the appeal process would
 
02:00:58.350 --> 02:00:58.360 align:start position:0%
would Institute for justice be willing
 
02:01:01.310 --> 02:01:01.320 align:start position:0%
to maybe submit any kind of proposed
 
02:01:03.750 --> 02:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
tweaks or ways um that the appeals
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
process for this particular bill could
 
02:01:07.510 --> 02:01:07.520 align:start position:0%
play out absolutely um in the course of
 
02:01:08.790 --> 02:01:08.800 align:start position:0%
our litigation we've had a lot of
 
02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:10.239 align:start position:0%
experience in different states and
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities and they all vary
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
slightly but I would be more than happy
 
02:01:15.589 --> 02:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
to base on our research um to provide
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
some supplementary testimony to the
 
02:01:18.589 --> 02:01:18.599 align:start position:0%
committee to suggest some potential
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
improvements in that area that'd be
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
great thank you other question questions
 
02:01:24.629 --> 02:01:24.639 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you Mr
 
02:01:26.030 --> 02:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
chairman is there anyone else here
 
02:01:28.629 --> 02:01:28.639 align:start position:0%
that's willing that's um planning on
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
testifying on HB 410 seeing none I'm
 
02:01:33.390 --> 02:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
going to close the public hearing at
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
11:58 um so we will be in recess until 1
 
02:01:40.990 --> 02:01:41.000 align:start position:0%
o00 I want to invite my colleagues down

welcome thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
03:04:45.670 --> 03:04:45.680 align:start position:0%

4 and I'm here today to introduce House
 
03:04:48.640 --> 03:04:50.550 align:start position:0%
4 and I'm here today to introduce House
Bill

03:04:50.550 --> 03:04:50.560 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
457 some might call it the Frat House
 
03:04:56.309 --> 03:04:56.319 align:start position:0%
bill before we talk about the bill it's
 
03:04:58.110 --> 03:04:58.120 align:start position:0%
important to know the background behind
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
the bill and why we're here today right
 
03:05:02.910 --> 03:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
now across the state of New Hampshire at
 
03:05:05.550 --> 03:05:05.560 align:start position:0%
least seven municipalities have certain
 
03:05:08.269 --> 03:05:08.279 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that limit the number
 
03:05:11.309 --> 03:05:11.319 align:start position:0%
of unrelated people living together in a
 
03:05:13.870 --> 03:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
single family home college towns like
 
03:05:18.070 --> 03:05:18.080 align:start position:0%
Durham especially Durham have adopted a
 
03:05:20.950 --> 03:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
three unrelated rule meaning no more
 
03:05:23.550 --> 03:05:23.560 align:start position:0%
than three unrelated people may live in
 
03:05:26.030 --> 03:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
the same single family
 
03:05:29.030 --> 03:05:29.040 align:start position:0%
house it doesn't you know you don't have
 
03:05:31.030 --> 03:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
to be a genius to understand that this
 
03:05:34.030 --> 03:05:34.040 align:start position:0%
restricts the supply of housing but also
 
03:05:36.950 --> 03:05:36.960 align:start position:0%
equally important it infringes on the
 
03:05:39.030 --> 03:05:39.040 align:start position:0%
property rights and the economic freedom
 
03:05:41.870 --> 03:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
of an individual right now in Durham it
 
03:05:44.790 --> 03:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
reduces the supply of housing and this
 
03:05:44.800 --> 03:05:45.670 align:start position:0%
reduces the supply of housing and this
is

03:05:45.670 --> 03:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
particularly you know visible as a UNH
 
03:05:51.110 --> 03:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
student myself right now there's a very
 
03:05:53.910 --> 03:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
tight housing market rental rates are on
 
03:05:56.469 --> 03:05:56.479 align:start position:0%
average $33,000 a month if you're
 
03:05:58.349 --> 03:05:58.359 align:start position:0%
looking for an apartment to rent you got
 
03:06:01.269 --> 03:06:01.279 align:start position:0%
to search for at least a year in advance
 
03:06:03.389 --> 03:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
and it's just blatant discrimination by
 
03:06:05.830 --> 03:06:05.840 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham against UNH college
 
03:06:08.550 --> 03:06:08.560 align:start position:0%
kids against young professionals that
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
might not have the budget to live by
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
themselves so they need to pull together
 
03:06:17.190 --> 03:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
and they need to combine efforts into
 
03:06:19.389 --> 03:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
renting maybe a single family house or a
 
03:06:22.229 --> 03:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
duplex whatever it may be but for
 
03:06:24.349 --> 03:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
example in Durham right now if you have
 
03:06:28.269 --> 03:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
a say a five bedroom house the realtor
 
03:06:31.349 --> 03:06:31.359 align:start position:0%
cannot lease that house
 
03:06:34.710 --> 03:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
to five unrelated college students but
 
03:06:37.910 --> 03:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
it can lease that house to say a family
 
03:06:40.590 --> 03:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
of eight I mean it just doesn't make
 
03:06:43.469 --> 03:06:43.479 align:start position:0%
sense from an economic perspective we
 
03:06:44.950 --> 03:06:44.960 align:start position:0%
all know that we're in a housing
 
03:06:48.349 --> 03:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
shortage right now and a IST might call
 
03:06:50.590 --> 03:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
it a market failure meaning that the
 
03:06:53.950 --> 03:06:53.960 align:start position:0%
market does not efficiently allocate the
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
the supply of housing meaning there's a
 
03:06:58.429 --> 03:06:58.439 align:start position:0%
shortage right now and people are
 
03:07:01.190 --> 03:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
demanding more housing than is on the
 
03:07:03.070 --> 03:07:03.080 align:start position:0%
market the
 
03:07:05.030 --> 03:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
solution well sometimes with market
 
03:07:06.910 --> 03:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
failures people seem to think that it's
 
03:07:06.920 --> 03:07:07.910 align:start position:0%
failures people seem to think that it's
government

03:07:07.910 --> 03:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:07:10.229 --> 03:07:10.239 align:start position:0%
regulation but in this case it's
 
03:07:12.910 --> 03:07:12.920 align:start position:0%
actually deregulation because government
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
created this problem in the first place
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
and we see this all across the housing
 
03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
market not just housing for college
 
03:07:20.550 --> 03:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
students government gets involved they
 
03:07:21.790 --> 03:07:21.800 align:start position:0%
set certain
 
03:07:24.309 --> 03:07:24.319 align:start position:0%
regulations and it's harder to build
 
03:07:26.469 --> 03:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
it's harder to lease and it drives up
 
03:07:31.269 --> 03:07:31.279 align:start position:0%
the cost of housing so HP 457 here today
 
03:07:32.950 --> 03:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
has two main
 
03:07:35.750 --> 03:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
Provisions first it prohibits zoning
 
03:07:38.950 --> 03:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances based off a familial
 
03:07:42.750 --> 03:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
status and then secondly it prohibited
 
03:07:45.389 --> 03:07:45.399 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that restrict
 
03:07:48.030 --> 03:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
occupants per bedroom to less Le than
 
03:07:50.469 --> 03:07:50.479 align:start position:0%
two less than two
 
03:07:53.110 --> 03:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
people that's the bill and unfortunately
 
03:07:54.670 --> 03:07:54.680 align:start position:0%
I got to get back to committee so I
 
03:07:56.790 --> 03:07:56.800 align:start position:0%
won't be taking any questions thank you
 
03:07:56.800 --> 03:07:59.630 align:start position:0%
won't be taking any questions thank you
representative

03:07:59.630 --> 03:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
Fairington okay so with that I probably
 
03:08:03.830 --> 03:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
have about 15 pink cards we're going to
 
03:08:05.190 --> 03:08:05.200 align:start position:0%
try to keep it around three minutes if
 
03:08:08.150 --> 03:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
you could um on your testimony but um I
 
03:08:11.070 --> 03:08:11.080 align:start position:0%
will call on next uh representative
 
03:08:22.269 --> 03:08:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:23.870 --> 03:08:23.880 align:start position:0%

Council um I am representing the
 
03:08:42.910 --> 03:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
legislature on the public higher
 
03:08:44.830 --> 03:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
education study
 
03:08:48.030 --> 03:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
committee uh my background I have
 
03:08:50.229 --> 03:08:50.239 align:start position:0%

Vanderbilt and I've been a college
 
03:08:55.469 --> 03:08:55.479 align:start position:0%
President but mostly I'm very proud to
 
03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
be a a Durham resident we believe that
 
03:09:02.910 --> 03:09:02.920 align:start position:0%
when students are sent to us I believe
 
03:09:04.830 --> 03:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
that there's somebody else's kids being
 
03:09:07.830 --> 03:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
sent to our care and it's up to us to
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
keep them safe and have them learn
 
03:09:12.790 --> 03:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
something about being a responsible
 
03:09:14.830 --> 03:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
citizen in our
 
03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
town I I have to mention that uh last
 
03:09:21.309 --> 03:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
night the Durham Town Council after long
 
03:09:24.550 --> 03:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
research changed its zoning so it's no
 
03:09:27.790 --> 03:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
longer less than three and Todd celik
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
who's the Town Administrator in Durham
 
03:09:33.630 --> 03:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh is better in position to talk about
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
that I also want to tell you that dur
 
03:09:38.429 --> 03:09:38.439 align:start position:0%
I've been on the straford regional
 
03:09:41.630 --> 03:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
Planning Commission for 13 years and um
 
03:09:43.790 --> 03:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
and certainly aware of the
 
03:09:47.110 --> 03:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
housing challenge so much so in Durham
 
03:09:49.750 --> 03:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have now passed a Workforce housing
 
03:09:52.190 --> 03:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
overlay district and we have three of
 
03:09:54.030 --> 03:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
them now where our zoning will be
 
03:09:56.349 --> 03:09:56.359 align:start position:0%
suspended one of them is a 100 Acre Farm
 
03:10:00.389 --> 03:10:00.399 align:start position:0%
that I'm personally working on and um
 
03:10:02.830 --> 03:10:02.840 align:start position:0%
and I strongly believe as the others in
 
03:10:07.030 --> 03:10:07.040 align:start position:0%
Durham that having unrestricted zoning
 
03:10:10.429 --> 03:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
is is not unrestricted but zoning that
 
03:10:13.429 --> 03:10:13.439 align:start position:0%
fits our situation is is the best way to
 
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
go um and I I would hope that you listen
 
03:10:21.190 --> 03:10:21.200 align:start position:0%
to the testimony from the town today uh
 
03:10:23.429 --> 03:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
safety is the most important thing for
 
03:10:26.550 --> 03:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
us learning about citizenship is second
 
03:10:28.670 --> 03:10:28.680 align:start position:0%
most uh the student
 
03:10:31.229 --> 03:10:31.239 align:start position:0%
affairs I want to say that the seventh
 
03:10:33.950 --> 03:10:33.960 align:start position:0%
item on our agenda every meeting is a
 
03:10:36.030 --> 03:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
report from the UNH student Senate
 
03:10:38.269 --> 03:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
external Affairs chair or their
 
03:10:40.910 --> 03:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
designate the chair of their designate
 
03:10:43.349 --> 03:10:43.359 align:start position:0%
is a wonderful young woman who who who
 
03:10:45.750 --> 03:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
met it with us last night the student
 
03:10:48.429 --> 03:10:48.439 align:start position:0%
Senate at UNH is not taken a position on
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation the student Senate they
 
03:10:53.750 --> 03:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
are discussing it but they understand
 
03:10:55.590 --> 03:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
because we have a dialogue with them all
 
03:10:59.710 --> 03:10:59.720 align:start position:0%
the time about housing issues in town
 
03:11:01.510 --> 03:11:01.520 align:start position:0%
and I would urge you to listen to the
 
03:11:03.910 --> 03:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
testimony taught is here the fire chief
 
03:11:06.750 --> 03:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
is here and others from Durham on why
 
03:11:09.150 --> 03:11:09.160 align:start position:0%
this is important but I would also what
 
03:11:10.950 --> 03:11:10.960 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'd like to do if it's okay
 
03:11:13.790 --> 03:11:13.800 align:start position:0%

our code officer David Emanuel our fire
 
03:12:14.269 --> 03:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
chief and brandan O salivan our Fire
 
03:12:16.510 --> 03:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
Marshall we're here to testify against
 
03:12:20.070 --> 03:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
HP4 57 as currently presented to answer
 
03:12:22.429 --> 03:12:22.439 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have and to speak
 
03:12:24.670 --> 03:12:24.680 align:start position:0%
in favor of an amendment that rep alen
 
03:12:25.750 --> 03:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
plans to
 
03:12:28.429 --> 03:12:28.439 align:start position:0%
introduce Durham is host to UNH and we
 
03:12:30.349 --> 03:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
have a significant presence of college
 
03:12:32.950 --> 03:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
students who impact the socioeconomic
 
03:12:35.830 --> 03:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
characteristics of our small town the
 
03:12:38.349 --> 03:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
census indicates that Durham has about
 
03:12:41.269 --> 03:12:41.279 align:start position:0%
15,400 residents that figure includes
 
03:12:43.269 --> 03:12:43.279 align:start position:0%
UNH students who live off- campus in
 
03:12:45.830 --> 03:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
Durham and by comparison UNH has an
 
03:12:48.469 --> 03:12:48.479 align:start position:0%
enrollment of around 11,400
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
undergraduates so there's a significant
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
influence and impact managing the
 
03:12:54.990 --> 03:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
commercial use of off-campus student
 
03:12:57.309 --> 03:12:57.319 align:start position:0%
housing is a fundamental and overarching
 
03:12:59.870 --> 03:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
issue in our town as it is in college
 
03:13:02.550 --> 03:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
towns such as Plymouth Kean hover New
 
03:13:04.710 --> 03:13:04.720 align:start position:0%

03:13:14.469 --> 03:13:14.479 align:start position:0%
2011 has created opportunities for
 
03:13:17.269 --> 03:13:17.279 align:start position:0%

student
 
03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
population what's different about
 
03:13:44.229 --> 03:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
Durham's rental housing market which is
 
03:13:46.269 --> 03:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
true of most college towns is local
 
03:13:49.469 --> 03:13:49.479 align:start position:0%
rents are derived on a per bed basis
 
03:13:51.630 --> 03:13:51.640 align:start position:0%
this Market Factor creates an incentive
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
for landlords and Property Owners to
 
03:13:56.229 --> 03:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
rent to college students rather than
 
03:13:58.510 --> 03:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
conventional renters seeking Workforce
 
03:14:00.790 --> 03:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
housing because their gross monthly rent
 
03:14:03.550 --> 03:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
can be twice as high driving up property
 
03:14:05.710 --> 03:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
prices and rents to the point that most
 
03:14:08.110 --> 03:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
conventional renters and families simply
 
03:14:10.269 --> 03:14:10.279 align:start position:0%
cannot compete financially against the
 
03:14:13.030 --> 03:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
student housing rental market and its
 
03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
investors Workforce housing units behave
 
03:14:18.389 --> 03:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
fundamentally different from non-family
 
03:14:20.389 --> 03:14:20.399 align:start position:0%
commercial congregate living catering to
 
03:14:22.229 --> 03:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
undergraduate college students
 
03:14:23.950 --> 03:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
particularly with per bed student
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
rentals with individual leases promoting
 
03:14:29.429 --> 03:14:29.439 align:start position:0%
A Boarding House type of atmosphere over
 
03:14:31.830 --> 03:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
many years Durham has thoughtfully
 
03:14:34.070 --> 03:14:34.080 align:start position:0%
adopted a host of regulations to address
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
the impact of college student housing
 
03:14:38.429 --> 03:14:38.439 align:start position:0%
including our noise ordinance an open
 
03:14:40.670 --> 03:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
container ordinance our trash ordinance
 
03:14:43.030 --> 03:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
our disorderly house ordinance parking
 
03:14:44.950 --> 03:14:44.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances Fire and Life safety
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
regulations and more but Cornerstone of
 
03:14:49.550 --> 03:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
our ability to manage density and use
 
03:14:51.550 --> 03:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
within non-family Commercial College
 
03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
student housing units has been through
 
03:14:53.600 --> 03:14:54.950 align:start position:0%
student housing units has been through
local

03:14:54.950 --> 03:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
local
 
03:14:57.790 --> 03:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
zoning I want to State unequivocally
 
03:15:00.190 --> 03:15:00.200 align:start position:0%
that Durham is doing its part to address
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's housing challenges as
 
03:15:04.429 --> 03:15:04.439 align:start position:0%
ref Burton noted two months ago we
 
03:15:06.269 --> 03:15:06.279 align:start position:0%
adopted what we called an attainable
 
03:15:08.550 --> 03:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
housing ordinance overlay and now look
 
03:15:10.190 --> 03:15:10.200 align:start position:0%
forward to the construction of as many
 
03:15:13.229 --> 03:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
as 200 additional rental beds on a large
 
03:15:16.229 --> 03:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
parcel of land along Route 4 and Durham
 
03:15:17.950 --> 03:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
this would be a appropriately located
 
03:15:19.790 --> 03:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
and managed to attract the much needed
 
03:15:22.110 --> 03:15:22.120 align:start position:0%
local Workforce that we're striving
 
03:15:24.469 --> 03:15:24.479 align:start position:0%
toward last evening after months of
 
03:15:26.870 --> 03:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
review the council as rep and councelor
 
03:15:47.030 --> 03:15:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:49.590 --> 03:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
four specifically identified commercial
 
03:15:51.870 --> 03:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
zoning districts all walkable and
 
03:15:54.429 --> 03:15:54.439 align:start position:0%
proximate to the UNH core campus and all
 
03:15:57.670 --> 03:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
service by Wildcat Transit bus service
 
03:15:59.910 --> 03:15:59.920 align:start position:0%
this local change limits the number of
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
occum in a dwelling unit based upon the
 
03:16:06.070 --> 03:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
state fire code we understand that rep
 
03:16:07.910 --> 03:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
Allen plans to introduce an amendment to
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
the committee that would ensure
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities may not adopt occupancy
 
03:16:13.750 --> 03:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances that are more restrictive
 
03:16:16.389 --> 03:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
than Allowed by the state fire code if
 
03:16:18.349 --> 03:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
as a committ you ultimately believe that
 
03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
A Change Is warranted to RSA 67416 we
 
03:16:25.229 --> 03:16:25.239 align:start position:0%
feel that rep howland's amendment is an
 
03:16:27.750 --> 03:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate solution it would eliminate
 
03:16:30.150 --> 03:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
potential inconsistencies between local
 
03:16:32.670 --> 03:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
zoning and the state fire code and it
 
03:16:35.070 --> 03:16:35.080 align:start position:0%
would make sense thank you thank you for
 
03:16:38.110 --> 03:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
your testimony questions for Mr
 
03:16:42.550 --> 03:16:42.560 align:start position:0%
selig representative miles um I was just
 
03:16:43.950 --> 03:16:43.960 align:start position:0%
wondering why it doesn't include grad
 
03:16:45.910 --> 03:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
students or why does it exclude grad
 
03:16:48.870 --> 03:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:53.790 --> 03:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
um uh we typically graduate students
 
03:16:56.790 --> 03:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
live a very different lifestyle and have
 
03:16:58.830 --> 03:16:58.840 align:start position:0%
substantially different needs than
 
03:17:00.910 --> 03:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
undergraduates they don't tend to live
 
03:17:04.150 --> 03:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
in large uh congregate group settings uh
 
03:17:06.830 --> 03:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
they behave uh fundamentally differently
 
03:17:10.269 --> 03:17:10.279 align:start position:0%
more like uh a family would and so it
 
03:17:12.710 --> 03:17:12.720 align:start position:0%
simply is typically not an issue uh we
 
03:17:14.349 --> 03:17:14.359 align:start position:0%
have a lot of adus that graduate
 
03:17:16.429 --> 03:17:16.439 align:start position:0%
students live in uh there are apartments
 
03:17:18.710 --> 03:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
in town that cater to graduate students
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
but it's a it's a niche market yeah M Mr
 
03:17:24.189 --> 03:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
C could you elaborate on that because I
 
03:17:26.030 --> 03:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering when you say
 
03:17:28.510 --> 03:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
conventional housing what does that mean
 
03:17:30.349 --> 03:17:30.359 align:start position:0%
and why is that different from student
 
03:17:33.550 --> 03:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
housing isn't it just isn't housing just
 
03:17:35.469 --> 03:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
somewhere where somebody lives and I
 
03:17:38.990 --> 03:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
guess to follow up with that why is four
 
03:17:41.750 --> 03:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
students living in it in a unit not a
 
03:17:43.830 --> 03:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
problem but five are like is there a
 
03:17:45.510 --> 03:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
magic number there I guess I'm trying to
 
03:17:47.269 --> 03:17:47.279 align:start position:0%
understand what we've found found over
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
many years is that the more
 
03:17:51.309 --> 03:17:51.319 align:start position:0%
undergraduate college students who live
 
03:17:56.070 --> 03:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
together as a unit that lends itself to
 
03:17:59.229 --> 03:17:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh challenges that don't coincide with a
 
03:18:01.790 --> 03:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
traditional family neighborhood um you
 
03:18:04.469 --> 03:18:04.479 align:start position:0%
end up with lots of cars you end up with
 
03:18:06.990 --> 03:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
trash you end up with parties those are
 
03:18:09.150 --> 03:18:09.160 align:start position:0%
things that we regulate against but you
 
03:18:11.510 --> 03:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
also end up with large groups of young
 
03:18:14.510 --> 03:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
people walking to that house at say 2:
 
03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
in the morning and along the way they're
 
03:18:18.590 --> 03:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
not breaking any laws but along the way
 
03:18:20.870 --> 03:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
they're waking up all the families along
 
03:18:23.229 --> 03:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
the street heading to the event and
 
03:18:25.790 --> 03:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
heading back from the event and so we've
 
03:18:29.950 --> 03:18:29.960 align:start position:0%
just found that limiting the number of
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
um undergraduate students makes good
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
sense and we've tried to uh discern what
 
03:18:40.349 --> 03:18:40.359 align:start position:0%
an appropriate uh break is for a
 
03:18:42.670 --> 03:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
traditional residential use versus a
 
03:18:45.429 --> 03:18:45.439 align:start position:0%
commercial use just as you do with a
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
hotel for example there are specific
 
03:18:50.189 --> 03:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
characteristics of a hotel versus a
 
03:18:52.910 --> 03:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
boarding house versus perhaps duplexes
 
03:18:55.870 --> 03:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
Tri triplexes versus a single family
 
03:18:59.950 --> 03:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
resident or department and there are uh
 
03:19:02.389 --> 03:19:02.399 align:start position:0%
breaks that we create to differentiate
 
03:19:04.790 --> 03:19:04.800 align:start position:0%
which zones in terms of use are
 
03:19:06.990 --> 03:19:07.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate and our determination
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
consistent with a fire code is that five
 
03:19:12.630 --> 03:19:12.640 align:start position:0%
is a good number the what the fire code
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
says as I understand it is uh up to four
 
03:19:18.910 --> 03:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
uh you treat that as a single family
 
03:19:20.990 --> 03:19:21.000 align:start position:0%
type residence when you get to five
 
03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not related to one
 
03:19:27.030 --> 03:19:27.040 align:start position:0%
another in any way that then triggers
 
03:19:29.510 --> 03:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
the uh fire code requirements such as a
 
03:19:31.710 --> 03:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
sprinkler code Etc so you could have for
 
03:19:35.349 --> 03:19:35.359 align:start position:0%
example a family plus that would be
 
03:19:37.990 --> 03:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
considered one and then you could have
 
03:19:40.550 --> 03:19:40.560 align:start position:0%
three more that gets you to four and
 
03:19:42.750 --> 03:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
that would be acceptable in a
 
03:19:44.429 --> 03:19:44.439 align:start position:0%
traditional residential use under our
 
03:19:47.550 --> 03:19:47.560 align:start position:0%
new ordinance but if you had five
 
03:19:50.349 --> 03:19:50.359 align:start position:0%
then you end up with a a specific
 
03:19:52.229 --> 03:19:52.239 align:start position:0%
commercial use that we're calling
 
03:19:54.429 --> 03:19:54.439 align:start position:0%
student rental at this time okay and and
 
03:19:56.150 --> 03:19:56.160 align:start position:0%
just just to ask one more question do
 
03:19:58.150 --> 03:19:58.160 align:start position:0%
you believe that the way your ordinance
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
as adopted would discriminate against
 
03:20:02.349 --> 03:20:02.359 align:start position:0%
five people with a disability that are
 
03:20:03.910 --> 03:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
unrelated and living together do you
 
03:20:05.229 --> 03:20:05.239 align:start position:0%
think that opens up the town of Durham
 
03:20:07.550 --> 03:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
up to potential lawsuits by redefining a
 
03:20:10.150 --> 03:20:10.160 align:start position:0%
certain Zone based on unrelated people
 
03:20:12.389 --> 03:20:12.399 align:start position:0%
we we don't we've uh very carefully
 
03:20:14.469 --> 03:20:14.479 align:start position:0%
identified the zones where we've allowed
 
03:20:17.070 --> 03:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
the five or more and these are zones
 
03:20:21.389 --> 03:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
that are serviced by a network of uh um
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
uh uh sidewalks and uh bus service
 
03:20:26.830 --> 03:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
they're all walkable to the core campus
 
03:20:28.590 --> 03:20:28.600 align:start position:0%
they're walkable to our downtown so they
 
03:20:30.830 --> 03:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
make good sense for this use and it's a
 
03:20:32.790 --> 03:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
use that's consistent with other uses in
 
03:20:36.790 --> 03:20:36.800 align:start position:0%
this Zone uh multifam multi-unit uh uh
 
03:20:38.550 --> 03:20:38.560 align:start position:0%
high-rises that are three or four
 
03:20:40.150 --> 03:20:40.160 align:start position:0%
stories with commercial on the fourth
 
03:20:42.429 --> 03:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
floor housing above we have uh
 
03:20:44.309 --> 03:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
fraternity houses in one of the zone and
 
03:20:47.030 --> 03:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
it would be allowed in that zone uh so
 
03:20:48.710 --> 03:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh the zones are all walkable to the
 
03:20:51.429 --> 03:20:51.439 align:start position:0%
court campus okay thank you represent
 
03:20:54.229 --> 03:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
paig thank you Mr chair I'm just seeking
 
03:20:58.070 --> 03:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
clarification the um the greater than
 
03:21:00.950 --> 03:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
four unrelated people that unrelated
 
03:21:03.110 --> 03:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
language am I correct in understanding
 
03:21:06.189 --> 03:21:06.199 align:start position:0%
that's in the fire code um the fire code
 
03:21:08.790 --> 03:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
defines a it's and again we've got
 
03:21:11.349 --> 03:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
Brendon Orin our fire inspector if you'd

03:21:14.790 --> 03:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
answer would that be

Durham I'm also a part-time unh I've
 
03:21:48.910 --> 03:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
been in the community for over 30 years
 
03:21:51.030 --> 03:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
uh everything that was said I agree with
 
03:21:52.790 --> 03:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
the breakdown of the
 
03:21:55.469 --> 03:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
2021 Life Safety Code which is adopted
 
03:21:59.070 --> 03:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
by law specifies a single family home
 
03:22:01.910 --> 03:22:01.920 align:start position:0%
can have up to three Outsiders if they
 
03:22:04.309 --> 03:22:04.319 align:start position:0%
go to four it becomes a lodging and
 
03:22:06.229 --> 03:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
rooming house it's a completely
 
03:22:08.830 --> 03:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
different type of occupancy and they can
 
03:22:10.269 --> 03:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
go up to
 
03:22:14.269 --> 03:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
16 if they exceed 16 becomes a dormatory
 
03:22:18.269 --> 03:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:20.150 --> 03:22:20.160 align:start position:0%
questions for the fire inspector
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
specifically representative Gibbs thank
 
03:22:25.630 --> 03:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr fire
 
03:22:29.710 --> 03:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
inspector um but isn't the difference
 
03:22:34.229 --> 03:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
between uh a uh house occupied by four
 
03:22:36.189 --> 03:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
unrelated people and five unrelated
 
03:22:38.870 --> 03:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
people is requirement for sprinklers
 
03:22:40.830 --> 03:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
isn't that the main difference and is
 
03:22:43.469 --> 03:22:43.479 align:start position:0%
there any other important
 
03:22:46.469 --> 03:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
difference yes once you have five UNR
 
03:22:48.830 --> 03:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
ated you're lodging and rooming if it's
 
03:22:50.070 --> 03:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
a new lodging and rooming you're
 
03:22:51.910 --> 03:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
required to have a sprinkler system a
 
03:22:53.990 --> 03:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
fire alarm system separation between the
 
03:22:56.110 --> 03:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
first and second floor and each of the
 
03:23:00.990 --> 03:23:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:03.309 --> 03:23:03.319 align:start position:0%
automatically other questions represent
 
03:23:05.710 --> 03:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
howand um this is just clarification of
 
03:23:08.670 --> 03:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
the new ordinance so uh in the new
 
03:23:11.670 --> 03:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance that the town of Durham pass
 
03:23:13.590 --> 03:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
which uh
 
03:23:18.429 --> 03:23:18.439 align:start position:0%
identifies um student rental there as
 
03:23:21.150 --> 03:23:21.160 align:start position:0%
long as they have uh that fire
 
03:23:24.030 --> 03:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
suppression in place they can there's no
 
03:23:26.469 --> 03:23:26.479 align:start position:0%
limitation on the occupancy other than
 
03:23:28.950 --> 03:23:28.960 align:start position:0%
what state fire code says right that is
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
correct and then anywhere else in Durham
 
03:23:35.710 --> 03:23:35.720 align:start position:0%
from what we just passed there is no
 
03:23:38.550 --> 03:23:38.560 align:start position:0%
nothing that uh says you can do greater
 
03:23:40.710 --> 03:23:40.720 align:start position:0%
than what fire code is occupancy is set
 
03:23:43.110 --> 03:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
by fire code right that's also correct
 
03:23:46.110 --> 03:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
yes represent miles thank you Mr
 
03:23:46.120 --> 03:23:47.630 align:start position:0%
yes represent miles thank you Mr
chairman

03:23:47.630 --> 03:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:23:50.510 --> 03:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh another clarifying question so a
 
03:23:52.790 --> 03:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
family of eight could live in one of
 
03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:55.710 align:start position:0%
family of eight could live in one of
these

03:23:55.710 --> 03:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:58.790 --> 03:23:58.800 align:start position:0%
buildings and they could have three
 
03:24:02.110 --> 03:24:02.120 align:start position:0%
Outsiders so 9 10 11 so they could have
 
03:24:04.710 --> 03:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
11 people in
 
03:24:10.469 --> 03:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
one building but if they're just three
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
or four unrelated people they're maxed
 
03:24:17.110 --> 03:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
at four now they could have up to three
 
03:24:19.269 --> 03:24:19.279 align:start position:0%
the family could have up to three if
 
03:24:21.870 --> 03:24:21.880 align:start position:0%
they go to four it's the equivalent of
 
03:24:24.070 --> 03:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
five unrelated the family be in one
 
03:24:26.309 --> 03:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
group and then there's four others that
 
03:24:30.510 --> 03:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
are unrelated follow up following that
 
03:24:34.150 --> 03:24:34.160 align:start position:0%
not really so so in one situation if
 
03:24:36.790 --> 03:24:36.800 align:start position:0%
there's a family and some Outsiders they
 
03:24:39.710 --> 03:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
can be up to 11 11-ish the family can be
 
03:24:42.590 --> 03:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
any size and they can have up to three
 
03:24:45.030 --> 03:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
people in a in a this dwelling correct
 
03:24:49.349 --> 03:24:49.359 align:start position:0%
but if they're for students
 
03:24:51.950 --> 03:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
unrelated that's that plus plus the
 
03:24:53.510 --> 03:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
family it's a lot no forget about a
 
03:24:55.269 --> 03:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
family just separate
 
03:24:57.630 --> 03:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
separating separating the family plus
 
03:24:57.640 --> 03:24:58.710 align:start position:0%
separating separating the family plus
three

03:24:58.710 --> 03:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:25:00.710 --> 03:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
Outsiders separate
 
03:25:04.429 --> 03:25:04.439 align:start position:0%
question students only so it's 11 or 12
 
03:25:07.429 --> 03:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
versus 3 four in the same
 
03:25:09.750 --> 03:25:09.760 align:start position:0%
building individually yes you could have
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
the family plus three Outsiders and you
 
03:25:13.830 --> 03:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
would not be a lodging and rooming you
 
03:25:17.910 --> 03:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
could have four individuals with no uh
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
relation with each other still be a
 
03:25:23.030 --> 03:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
single family home not a lodging rooming
 
03:25:25.510 --> 03:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
if you add one more Outsider to either
 
03:25:28.870 --> 03:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
one of those two categories you now have
 
03:25:31.269 --> 03:25:31.279 align:start position:0%
the five but in one situation you can
 
03:25:33.950 --> 03:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
have up to 11 or 12 but in another
 
03:25:36.710 --> 03:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
situation you can only have four yes in
 
03:25:39.070 --> 03:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
the same size building the same number
 
03:25:41.429 --> 03:25:41.439 align:start position:0%
of bedrooms yes the code the code is
 
03:25:43.309 --> 03:25:43.319 align:start position:0%
specific on including his three
 
03:25:45.590 --> 03:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
Outsiders so Mr inspector if the
 
03:25:47.750 --> 03:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
students got married you could have up
 
03:25:49.150 --> 03:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
to six
 
03:25:51.070 --> 03:25:51.080 align:start position:0%
right if the students if they got
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
married to each other yep no I'm just
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to like understand how
 
03:25:57.070 --> 03:25:57.080 align:start position:0%
ridiculous is it if they if they get
 
03:25:58.990 --> 03:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
married to each other you can have six
 
03:26:01.990 --> 03:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
students living in a place under the
 
03:26:04.830 --> 03:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
fire code yes okay thank you
 
03:26:06.510 --> 03:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs and representative
 
03:26:10.590 --> 03:26:10.600 align:start position:0%
howand thank you um for practical
 
03:26:13.229 --> 03:26:13.239 align:start position:0%
purposes why should the requirements be
 
03:26:16.469 --> 03:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
different for five people who constitute
 
03:26:19.030 --> 03:26:19.040 align:start position:0%
family and five people who are unrelated
 
03:26:21.150 --> 03:26:21.160 align:start position:0%
you have five people regardless why
 
03:26:23.070 --> 03:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
should the requirements be
 
03:26:26.630 --> 03:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
different absolutely the code makes
 
03:26:28.950 --> 03:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
reference that it's their understanding
 
03:26:30.269 --> 03:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
and I say there the committee that
 
03:26:33.229 --> 03:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
established it that there is more of a
 
03:26:35.150 --> 03:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
reason for a family to look out for each
 
03:26:38.309 --> 03:26:38.319 align:start position:0%
other opposed to five separate leases
 
03:26:39.349 --> 03:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
where you don't even know when those
 
03:26:41.590 --> 03:26:41.600 align:start position:0%
people are coming and going but suppose
 
03:26:43.510 --> 03:26:43.520 align:start position:0%
you don't have five separate leases
 
03:26:45.550 --> 03:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
suppose you have five people who get
 
03:26:47.790 --> 03:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
together as friends and I did this when
 
03:26:50.389 --> 03:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
I was in graduate school um who get
 
03:26:52.990 --> 03:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
together as friends and decide to rent a
 
03:26:57.189 --> 03:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
house um with one lease one person signs
 
03:26:58.950 --> 03:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
a lease the others pay the rent to that
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
person so it's a group of people who
 
03:27:03.710 --> 03:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
watch out for each other why should the
 
03:27:05.229 --> 03:27:05.239 align:start position:0%
requirements be different we actually
 
03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
did this with eight people big big house
 
03:27:09.710 --> 03:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
um why should the requirement be
 
03:27:11.630 --> 03:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
different for those eight people than
 
03:27:14.590 --> 03:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
for an eight person
 
03:27:17.189 --> 03:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
family the language the code separates
 
03:27:20.510 --> 03:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
them as related or not related the annex
 
03:27:22.910 --> 03:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
of the code goes into that detail but
 
03:27:24.469 --> 03:27:24.479 align:start position:0%
the annex is not
 
03:27:26.389 --> 03:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
enforceable and that has never been
 
03:27:29.550 --> 03:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
clarified to my knowledge but why I what
 
03:27:32.790 --> 03:27:32.800 align:start position:0%
does the annex say the annex says that
 
03:27:35.910 --> 03:27:35.920 align:start position:0%
the intention of the unrelated is
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
separate leases it does not go into the
 
03:27:41.269 --> 03:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
detail of whether or not there's one one
 
03:27:43.830 --> 03:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
lease which would then make them
 
03:27:45.710 --> 03:27:45.720 align:start position:0%
concerned about each other because
 
03:27:47.229 --> 03:27:47.239 align:start position:0%
there's one person answering for that
 
03:27:48.790 --> 03:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
lease and then the sub leases to the
 
03:27:51.269 --> 03:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
other four and I'd I'd love to get a
 
03:27:54.269 --> 03:27:54.279 align:start position:0%
clarification on that if that passes the
 
03:27:59.309 --> 03:27:59.319 align:start position:0%
definition of having not necessarily
 
03:28:01.750 --> 03:28:01.760 align:start position:0%
relationships but an interest in each
 
03:28:05.150 --> 03:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
other's wellbeing well let me go just
 
03:28:07.110 --> 03:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
aurther can can I go just a little you
 
03:28:10.670 --> 03:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
can have a followup yes one more okay
 
03:28:14.750 --> 03:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
um back in the day when I was doing this
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
um we didn't have per occupant leases
 
03:28:21.110 --> 03:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
you had one lease per house or one lease
 
03:28:23.550 --> 03:28:23.560 align:start position:0%
per apartment usually one person signed
 
03:28:25.590 --> 03:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
it sometimes a group of people would all
 
03:28:28.990 --> 03:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
sign it but in any case it was one lease
 
03:28:30.990 --> 03:28:31.000 align:start position:0%
and a group of people were responsible
 
03:28:34.590 --> 03:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
for it and why should that be a problem
 
03:28:37.229 --> 03:28:37.239 align:start position:0%
that still isn't clear to me I'm not
 
03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
saying that's a problem and I'm not
 
03:28:41.229 --> 03:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
saying that that shouldn't be clarified
 
03:28:42.750 --> 03:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
but it would need to be clarified in
 
03:28:45.389 --> 03:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
order to be selectively enforced that
 
03:28:45.399 --> 03:28:47.309 align:start position:0%
order to be selectively enforced that
way

03:28:47.309 --> 03:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
way
 
03:28:48.990 --> 03:28:49.000 align:start position:0%
okay representative
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
Howland this is just to clarify her
 
03:28:54.429 --> 03:28:54.439 align:start position:0%
question because and I I understand I've
 
03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
worked with uh the Fire Marshall and
 
03:28:58.469 --> 03:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
that on this and it it does confuse
 
03:29:00.590 --> 03:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
people so to her question she was saying
 
03:29:03.030 --> 03:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
like um if you have three unrelated and
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
a family are in there and it becomes
 
03:29:06.830 --> 03:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
identified as a lodging house or
 
03:29:08.790 --> 03:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
actually what was it when we get to five
 
03:29:11.590 --> 03:29:11.600 align:start position:0%
and it qualifies as a lodging house you
 
03:29:13.110 --> 03:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
have to put a sprinkler in but the
 
03:29:16.110 --> 03:29:16.120 align:start position:0%
occupancy is is goes up to the ma
 
03:29:18.189 --> 03:29:18.199 align:start position:0%
maximum that's allowed by the fire code
 
03:29:20.429 --> 03:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
for the a lodging house so it's actually
 
03:29:23.990 --> 03:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
that house regardless of whether you had
 
03:29:27.870 --> 03:29:27.880 align:start position:0%
students or any unrelated is 15 right or
 
03:29:30.990 --> 03:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
16 you go up to 16 16 so you can put 16
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
people in that the question I guess
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
phrasing this the question fire code
 
03:29:38.910 --> 03:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
says that a lodging house as long as you
 
03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
meet the sprinkler and other suppression
 
03:29:45.030 --> 03:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
systems can hold up to 16 people is that
 
03:29:48.550 --> 03:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:50.309 --> 03:29:50.319 align:start position:0%
okay other questions for the fire
 
03:29:52.110 --> 03:29:52.120 align:start position:0%
inspector thank you and if you could I
 
03:29:53.910 --> 03:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
don't know your name so I'll F this out
 
03:29:56.030 --> 03:29:56.040 align:start position:0%
sure thank you thank you um any other
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
questions for Mr selig representative
 
03:30:01.110 --> 03:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
03:30:04.189 --> 03:30:04.199 align:start position:0%
for coming to testify um I want to
 
03:30:06.830 --> 03:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
follow up on um representative
 
03:30:09.710 --> 03:30:09.720 align:start position:0%
Alexander's question about five disabled
 
03:30:13.710 --> 03:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
people um suppose five disabled people
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
um wanted to live together outside of
 
03:30:19.309 --> 03:30:19.319 align:start position:0%
your Zone um uh because they need to
 
03:30:21.429 --> 03:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
support each other and possibly be
 
03:30:25.030 --> 03:30:25.040 align:start position:0%
supported by personal care assistance um
 
03:30:27.790 --> 03:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
would you would you try to prevent
 
03:30:27.800 --> 03:30:29.870 align:start position:0%
would you would you try to prevent
that

03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:35.189 --> 03:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
um within the uh zones where the student
 
03:30:37.150 --> 03:30:37.160 align:start position:0%
rental is
 
03:30:40.750 --> 03:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
allowed if they are enrolled full-time
 
03:30:43.030 --> 03:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
college students the ordinance would
 
03:30:45.550 --> 03:30:45.560 align:start position:0%
apply if they are not enrolled full-time
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
College students the ordinance would not
 
03:30:50.870 --> 03:30:50.880 align:start position:0%
apply so it would depend on a number of
 
03:30:50.880 --> 03:30:52.630 align:start position:0%
apply so it would depend on a number of
different

03:30:52.630 --> 03:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:30:55.150 --> 03:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
circumstances uh followup go
 
03:30:58.990 --> 03:30:59.000 align:start position:0%
ahead why would why would that make a
 
03:31:03.189 --> 03:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
difference um well we've we've just we
 
03:31:06.510 --> 03:31:06.520 align:start position:0%
found and this goes to the issue of
 
03:31:10.750 --> 03:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
family plus three living together if a
 
03:31:13.990 --> 03:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
family is present within the rental that
 
03:31:15.910 --> 03:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
family unit will materially change
 
03:31:18.030 --> 03:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
change the characteristics of that
 
03:31:20.670 --> 03:31:20.680 align:start position:0%
housing upon the neighborhood and the
 
03:31:24.469 --> 03:31:24.479 align:start position:0%
use will behave much as a traditional uh
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
residential use would versus a
 
03:31:29.830 --> 03:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
commercial use that has a very different
 
03:31:32.910 --> 03:31:32.920 align:start position:0%
impact on the surroundings and so we've
 
03:31:35.349 --> 03:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
identified the four zones where we feel
 
03:31:37.830 --> 03:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
the impact would be very appropriate and
 
03:31:39.590 --> 03:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
consistent with the nature of those
 
03:31:43.269 --> 03:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
zones and outside of that you would be
 
03:31:47.269 --> 03:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
allowed to have four so if there are
 
03:31:51.349 --> 03:31:51.359 align:start position:0%
five uh disabled individuals they would
 
03:31:53.870 --> 03:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
and they were full-time college students
 
03:31:56.269 --> 03:31:56.279 align:start position:0%
they could live within the four zones
 
03:32:00.670 --> 03:32:00.680 align:start position:0%
we've identified together if they are uh
 
03:32:02.830 --> 03:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
living outside of that zone there'd be a
 
03:32:05.229 --> 03:32:05.239 align:start position:0%
limitation on the number of people and
 
03:32:07.349 --> 03:32:07.359 align:start position:0%
if they were full-time students there'd
 
03:32:09.630 --> 03:32:09.640 align:start position:0%
be a limitation on the number you'd be
 
03:32:11.910 --> 03:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
allowed four not five and those young
 
03:32:13.870 --> 03:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
people would have to decide which four
 
03:32:16.510 --> 03:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
would sign the leases and the other ele
 
03:32:18.630 --> 03:32:18.640 align:start position:0%
that's changed I think since you may
 
03:32:21.309 --> 03:32:21.319 align:start position:0%
have been in school and we renting with
 
03:32:24.910 --> 03:32:24.920 align:start position:0%
your uh colleagues is that today in
 
03:32:27.070 --> 03:32:27.080 align:start position:0%
college communities the rentals are done
 
03:32:29.750 --> 03:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
on a per bed basis so a landlord is
 
03:32:32.309 --> 03:32:32.319 align:start position:0%
typically not saying here I'm going to
 
03:32:34.229 --> 03:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
rent this single family house to you
 
03:32:36.110 --> 03:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs and you can have as
 
03:32:38.750 --> 03:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
many people live there as as you'd like
 
03:32:41.070 --> 03:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
um instead the landlord is saying I'm
 
03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
going to rent to every specific person
 
03:32:45.870 --> 03:32:45.880 align:start position:0%
who's going in there and the more people
 
03:32:48.110 --> 03:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
I can put in there the more Revenue I'll
 
03:32:51.670 --> 03:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
receive but why followup uh followup
 
03:32:56.550 --> 03:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um but why would you put that
 
03:32:58.990 --> 03:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
against the testimony that I can
 
03:33:02.349 --> 03:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
personally uh give you of eight people
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
living together completely unrelated to
 
03:33:09.070 --> 03:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
each other but as friends um why would
 
03:33:11.189 --> 03:33:11.199 align:start position:0%
you put that
 
03:33:13.510 --> 03:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
against my
 
03:33:15.990 --> 03:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
testimony well we've found those over
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
many years that um if you have eight
 
03:33:22.189 --> 03:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
people living together who are full-time
 
03:33:24.870 --> 03:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
college students living off campus their
 
03:33:28.349 --> 03:33:28.359 align:start position:0%
behavior will by and large not be
 
03:33:30.950 --> 03:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
conducive to the traditional family
 
03:33:33.309 --> 03:33:33.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and in an effort to
 
03:33:35.670 --> 03:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
preserve those neighborhoods and
 
03:33:38.429 --> 03:33:38.439 align:start position:0%
preserve housing stock available in
 
03:33:39.990 --> 03:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
those neighborhoods for the workforce
 
03:33:43.830 --> 03:33:43.840 align:start position:0%
housing we'd like to create um this uh
 
03:33:45.910 --> 03:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
ordinance change made sense to the
 
03:33:48.150 --> 03:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
Durham Community but this would not be
 
03:33:50.389 --> 03:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
true if they weren't
 
03:33:53.590 --> 03:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
students um if they are not students
 
03:33:56.469 --> 03:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
then the characteristic of those
 
03:33:59.269 --> 03:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
individuals the lifestyle is uh
 
03:34:01.550 --> 03:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
profoundly different from if they are
 
03:34:05.110 --> 03:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:05.120 --> 03:34:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
students

03:34:07.309 --> 03:34:07.319 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:34:09.950 --> 03:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
so when you say traditional family I
 
03:34:11.309 --> 03:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
guess I'm wondering like do you mean
 
03:34:13.990 --> 03:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
specifically like a husband and a wife
 
03:34:16.070 --> 03:34:16.080 align:start position:0%
and like two kids is that what dur wants
 
03:34:18.550 --> 03:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
like two kids on single family lots
 
03:34:19.189 --> 03:34:19.199 align:start position:0%
where like they have little
 
03:34:20.550 --> 03:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods stuff like that like I
 
03:34:21.590 --> 03:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
guess like what do you mean by
 
03:34:23.670 --> 03:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
traditional family because there's a lot
 
03:34:24.910 --> 03:34:24.920 align:start position:0%
of different families and they look a
 
03:34:26.750 --> 03:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
lot different and why is Durham trying
 
03:34:28.229 --> 03:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
to zone out certain parts certain
 
03:34:30.910 --> 03:34:30.920 align:start position:0%
families from certain areas of town so
 
03:34:32.910 --> 03:34:32.920 align:start position:0%
in the 1980s when the no more than three
 
03:34:35.790 --> 03:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
unrelated ordinance was put into effect
 
03:34:37.990 --> 03:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
the vision people had of families I
 
03:34:40.309 --> 03:34:40.319 align:start position:0%
think was exactly what you outlined but
 
03:34:42.189 --> 03:34:42.199 align:start position:0%
we recognize as a community over time
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
that has profoundly changed and so when
 
03:34:46.269 --> 03:34:46.279 align:start position:0%
we speak of tradition family
 
03:34:47.870 --> 03:34:47.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods I guess you could strike
 
03:34:50.229 --> 03:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
the word family and say traditional
 
03:34:51.870 --> 03:34:51.880 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing neighborhoods
 
03:34:53.710 --> 03:34:53.720 align:start position:0%
traditional neighborhoods with people
 
03:34:56.309 --> 03:34:56.319 align:start position:0%
who take an interest in one another who
 
03:34:58.070 --> 03:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
care for their property care for their
 
03:35:00.349 --> 03:35:00.359 align:start position:0%
neighbors who know one another who
 
03:35:02.590 --> 03:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
operate on a lifestyle that's fairly
 
03:35:04.389 --> 03:35:04.399 align:start position:0%
consistent you know getting up in the
 
03:35:07.070 --> 03:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
morning to go to work coming back having
 
03:35:08.790 --> 03:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
supper going to bed at a certain hour
 
03:35:10.550 --> 03:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
now sure there may be individuals who
 
03:35:12.510 --> 03:35:12.520 align:start position:0%
are working a third shift who come home
 
03:35:13.670 --> 03:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
in the middle of the night or early in
 
03:35:16.150 --> 03:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
the morning but those folks are going to
 
03:35:18.030 --> 03:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
by and large be very respectful of their
 
03:35:20.070 --> 03:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
neighbors where what we found is that
 
03:35:22.189 --> 03:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
college students live on a very
 
03:35:24.990 --> 03:35:25.000 align:start position:0%
different schedule they are going to bed
 
03:35:27.550 --> 03:35:27.560 align:start position:0%
very late they are sleeping late and
 
03:35:29.630 --> 03:35:29.640 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there's just an inherent
 
03:35:32.229 --> 03:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
conflict in Lifestyles between non-
 
03:35:34.670 --> 03:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
full-time college student undergraduates
 
03:35:37.349 --> 03:35:37.359 align:start position:0%
and everybody you know and the the
 
03:35:39.710 --> 03:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
students and so we're just trying to
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
find a way to preserve our neighborhoods
 
03:35:47.670 --> 03:35:47.680 align:start position:0%
so that they remain enjoyable places to
 
03:35:50.229 --> 03:35:50.239 align:start position:0%
live wherever people are whether they're
 
03:35:52.790 --> 03:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
a single person a married person a
 
03:35:55.990 --> 03:35:56.000 align:start position:0%
traditional 1950s family or a family as
 
03:35:58.110 --> 03:35:58.120 align:start position:0%
we know it today we don't care we
 
03:36:00.990 --> 03:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
welcome everybody but we're trying to
 
03:36:03.790 --> 03:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
very thoughtfully figure out where this
 
03:36:05.950 --> 03:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
student lifestyle fits in and where it
 
03:36:09.630 --> 03:36:09.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't and that's the Nexus of our uh
 
03:36:11.830 --> 03:36:11.840 align:start position:0%
regulation representative
 
03:36:14.870 --> 03:36:14.880 align:start position:0%
Reed thank thank you Mr chair thank you
 
03:36:16.750 --> 03:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
for your testimony and for taking my
 
03:36:19.269 --> 03:36:19.279 align:start position:0%
question and I think I might have a few
 
03:36:22.309 --> 03:36:22.319 align:start position:0%
follow-ups um so I apologize for not
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
hearing the beginning of your testimony
 
03:36:26.309 --> 03:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
I was um testifying on a different Bill
 
03:36:29.150 --> 03:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
across the hall um but when I hear you
 
03:36:31.750 --> 03:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
talk about the lifestyle differences and
 
03:36:33.469 --> 03:36:33.479 align:start position:0%
how these people are different from that
 
03:36:35.309 --> 03:36:35.319 align:start position:0%
people I my concern is that that's
 
03:36:39.110 --> 03:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
really veiled not even very veiled um
 
03:36:40.309 --> 03:36:40.319 align:start position:0%
what I would call discrimination
 
03:36:42.189 --> 03:36:42.199 align:start position:0%
realizing that student is not a legally
 
03:36:44.670 --> 03:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
protected class um but discrimination
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
against students and so my question is
 
03:36:50.550 --> 03:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
and this came up last year what is
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
stopping the town from enforcing
 
03:36:54.469 --> 03:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances regarding noise enforcing
 
03:36:57.469 --> 03:36:57.479 align:start position:0%
ordinances regarding garbage and
 
03:37:00.429 --> 03:37:00.439 align:start position:0%
relatedly are you aware that the data
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
that we heard on the same bill last year
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
um showed that actually most of the
 
03:37:07.550 --> 03:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
noise problems and the domestic violence
 
03:37:09.469 --> 03:37:09.479 align:start position:0%
disputes and all of that happened with
 
03:37:11.950 --> 03:37:11.960 align:start position:0%
families wives and husbands fighting and
 
03:37:14.150 --> 03:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
children being noisy those little
 
03:37:16.189 --> 03:37:16.199 align:start position:0%
nuclear families that you see to want to
 
03:37:19.229 --> 03:37:19.239 align:start position:0%
protect from the students and not as
 
03:37:20.710 --> 03:37:20.720 align:start position:0%
much from the actual students who do
 
03:37:22.110 --> 03:37:22.120 align:start position:0%
have to go to class at 8:00 in the
 
03:37:22.120 --> 03:37:23.229 align:start position:0%
have to go to class at 8:00 in the
morning

03:37:23.229 --> 03:37:23.239 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:37:28.189 --> 03:37:28.199 align:start position:0%
actually so we we have um I I listed it
 
03:37:30.349 --> 03:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
but we have a a noise ordinance a trash
 
03:37:32.189 --> 03:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
ordinance a disorderly house ordinance
 
03:37:34.670 --> 03:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
various Life Safety codes in place and
 
03:37:37.830 --> 03:37:37.840 align:start position:0%
we um consistently enforce those based
 
03:37:39.830 --> 03:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
upon complaints and our
 
03:37:42.189 --> 03:37:42.199 align:start position:0%
observations um and it's important to do
 
03:37:44.870 --> 03:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
that to ensure that everybody can
 
03:37:44.880 --> 03:37:46.229 align:start position:0%
that to ensure that everybody can
coexist

03:37:46.229 --> 03:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
coexist
 
03:37:50.189 --> 03:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
uh in a uh Happy environment that's what
 
03:37:55.189 --> 03:37:55.199 align:start position:0%
we're after um what we observe over time
 
03:37:57.309 --> 03:37:57.319 align:start position:0%
is at least in Durham New Hampshire and
 
03:37:59.750 --> 03:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
probably in Kean and Plymouth as well
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
that the vast majority of noise
 
03:38:04.550 --> 03:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
complaints trash complaints Etc are
 
03:38:07.229 --> 03:38:07.239 align:start position:0%
focused on student rentals because
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
they're very active they're active late
 
03:38:11.590 --> 03:38:11.600 align:start position:0%
at night they host large Gatherings if
 
03:38:14.349 --> 03:38:14.359 align:start position:0%
you have three undergraduates living
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
together it's typically not three it's
 
03:38:18.550 --> 03:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
the three plus there are three uh
 
03:38:20.630 --> 03:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
significant others who are over they do
 
03:38:23.750 --> 03:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
host Gatherings at off hours and it
 
03:38:27.229 --> 03:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
creates a nuisance for non the non-
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
student population and so when you have
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
a community of more or less 6,500
 
03:38:36.830 --> 03:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
full-time residents like you and me who
 
03:38:38.469 --> 03:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
are living there with their families
 
03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
going to work every day and you have a
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
student population including graduate
 
03:38:45.429 --> 03:38:45.439 align:start position:0%
students of around 13,000 14,000 people
 
03:38:48.349 --> 03:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
people there's a profound influence on
 
03:38:50.429 --> 03:38:50.439 align:start position:0%
the neighborhoods and UNH does not have
 
03:38:52.670 --> 03:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
enough oncampus housing to house all
 
03:38:56.269 --> 03:38:56.279 align:start position:0%
their students um there are not enough
 
03:38:59.030 --> 03:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
um professionally managed properties in
 
03:39:01.030 --> 03:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
town to house all the students so
 
03:39:02.990 --> 03:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's a certain number of the student
 
03:39:05.990 --> 03:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
body that moves out into the uh
 
03:39:08.309 --> 03:39:08.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and we welcome them in the
 
03:39:10.309 --> 03:39:10.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods as long as they behave
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
well but we find that the greater the
 
03:39:15.469 --> 03:39:15.479 align:start position:0%
number the more likely it is that they
 
03:39:17.229 --> 03:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
be challenges and that's what was the
 
03:39:20.189 --> 03:39:20.199 align:start position:0%
Nexus behind the 1980s era no more than
 
03:39:24.070 --> 03:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
three unrelated is um we also experience
 
03:39:26.189 --> 03:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
a real challenge where the student
 
03:39:28.349 --> 03:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
rental dollar because it's on a per bed
 
03:39:32.110 --> 03:39:32.120 align:start position:0%
basis is much much stronger than any
 
03:39:36.229 --> 03:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
other classification and so we lose what
 
03:39:37.870 --> 03:39:37.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to create and so
 
03:39:39.750 --> 03:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
desperately want which is Workforce
 
03:39:44.110 --> 03:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
housing to the off-campus undergraduate
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
population so what we've tried to do
 
03:39:48.950 --> 03:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the new ordinance the council
 
03:39:51.630 --> 03:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
approved last night after months of
 
03:39:54.429 --> 03:39:54.439 align:start position:0%
review a lot of discussion was to try to
 
03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
align our ordinance with the fire code
 
03:39:59.150 --> 03:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
so we've moved away from the definition
 
03:40:01.750 --> 03:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
of family and regulating based upon
 
03:40:03.950 --> 03:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
family which by the way Duram went to
 
03:40:06.030 --> 03:40:06.040 align:start position:0%
court on twice and the New Hampshire
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruled twice that it was
 
03:40:10.110 --> 03:40:10.120 align:start position:0%
not discrimination to discriminate
 
03:40:11.630 --> 03:40:11.640 align:start position:0%
around the issue of family that there
 
03:40:15.349 --> 03:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
was in fact a a recognized and bonafide
 
03:40:17.830 --> 03:40:17.840 align:start position:0%
State interest in preserving the welfare
 
03:40:19.469 --> 03:40:19.479 align:start position:0%
of families and you couldn't
 
03:40:22.030 --> 03:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
discriminate against families but
 
03:40:23.790 --> 03:40:23.800 align:start position:0%
students as you correctly point out are
 
03:40:27.750 --> 03:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
not a protected class and uh they are a
 
03:40:30.790 --> 03:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
a a a a profound uh part of our
 
03:40:33.389 --> 03:40:33.399 align:start position:0%
community that we work hard to welcome
 
03:40:36.269 --> 03:40:36.279 align:start position:0%
to integrate in a successful way but
 
03:40:38.269 --> 03:40:38.279 align:start position:0%
large numbers of them in certain
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods just don't mix well with
 
03:40:43.830 --> 03:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
the non-student population it's not that
 
03:40:45.950 --> 03:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
people don't try but I guess what I
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
would say to any of you is come to
 
03:40:49.750 --> 03:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
Durham and I'll set you up for 2 or
 
03:40:51.670 --> 03:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
three years in a house in a traditional
 
03:40:54.070 --> 03:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
neighborhood uh where we have a lot of
 
03:40:56.590 --> 03:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
student rentals and talk with me after
 
03:40:59.269 --> 03:40:59.279 align:start position:0%
that and you'll experience firsthand
 
03:41:00.910 --> 03:41:00.920 align:start position:0%
what it's like and I don't mean to be
 
03:41:03.510 --> 03:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
crude saying that but that's what Durham
 
03:41:05.910 --> 03:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
residents come to their officials the
 
03:41:08.349 --> 03:41:08.359 align:start position:0%
Town Council our code office our fire
 
03:41:10.790 --> 03:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
department to express profound concern
 
03:41:12.910 --> 03:41:12.920 align:start position:0%
over it and so we're we're working
 
03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
really hard to find a way to manage this
 
03:41:17.790 --> 03:41:17.800 align:start position:0%
really difficult
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
situation followup thank you um so just
 
03:41:24.670 --> 03:41:24.680 align:start position:0%
to clarify your last Point um I've lived
 
03:41:25.950 --> 03:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
in the neighboring town of New Market
 
03:41:27.790 --> 03:41:27.800 align:start position:0%
where a lot of students do live for 15
 
03:41:29.630 --> 03:41:29.640 align:start position:0%
years I also got my Master's Degree at
 
03:41:31.870 --> 03:41:31.880 align:start position:0%
UNH where I drove for Wildcat transit
 
03:41:33.590 --> 03:41:33.600 align:start position:0%
for three years and I drove the late
 
03:41:35.110 --> 03:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
shift so I'm very familiar with the
 
03:41:38.630 --> 03:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
partyer students and um happy to visit
 
03:41:40.469 --> 03:41:40.479 align:start position:0%
Durham again for that purpose but I I
 
03:41:41.870 --> 03:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
feel like I do have some direct
 
03:41:44.030 --> 03:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
knowledge I appreciate that Durham has
 
03:41:48.070 --> 03:41:48.080 align:start position:0%
made their or more legal and my pointing
 
03:41:49.950 --> 03:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
out that it was illegally if it had been
 
03:41:51.950 --> 03:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
enforced illegally enforced in the past
 
03:41:53.990 --> 03:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
was not around the idea of a protected
 
03:41:55.830 --> 03:41:55.840 align:start position:0%
class for students or familial status it
 
03:41:58.030 --> 03:41:58.040 align:start position:0%
was around the idea that we have a law
 
03:42:00.910 --> 03:42:00.920 align:start position:0%
saying specifically for adus you cannot
 
03:42:02.950 --> 03:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
make any Distinction on familial status
 
03:42:05.550 --> 03:42:05.560 align:start position:0%
for the adus and if the some of the
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
housing was Adu related then that was
 
03:42:11.510 --> 03:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
not legally enforced um so to my
 
03:42:14.510 --> 03:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
question I keep hearing you say things
 
03:42:18.309 --> 03:42:18.319 align:start position:0%
like they they and they are a nuisance
 
03:42:19.990 --> 03:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
and they are doing this Behavior it's
 
03:42:23.910 --> 03:42:23.920 align:start position:0%
very um cringe inducing they don't mix
 
03:42:25.590 --> 03:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
well they aren't fitting in with the
 
03:42:28.110 --> 03:42:28.120 align:start position:0%
community and I it it kind of sends up
 
03:42:32.590 --> 03:42:32.600 align:start position:0%
some red flags for me so um I my
 
03:42:34.469 --> 03:42:34.479 align:start position:0%
question is because I'm really trying to
 
03:42:36.429 --> 03:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
get it what are you actually trying to
 
03:42:39.990 --> 03:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
divide here if it's not this kind of you
 
03:42:42.910 --> 03:42:42.920 align:start position:0%
know this this stigma around students
 
03:42:46.189 --> 03:42:46.199 align:start position:0%
are you aware that students who have to
 
03:42:47.830 --> 03:42:47.840 align:start position:0%
study and have to go to class in the
 
03:42:50.070 --> 03:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
morning and take tests and do papers
 
03:42:52.630 --> 03:42:52.640 align:start position:0%
also would find loud music and
 
03:42:54.910 --> 03:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
disruptive behavior a nuisance and
 
03:42:57.550 --> 03:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
conversely are you also aware that the
 
03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
nuclear families living in the preferred
 
03:43:03.389 --> 03:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
regions of your town um also stay up
 
03:43:04.830 --> 03:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
late in fact the workforce housing you
 
03:43:06.070 --> 03:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
keep mentioning a lot of those people
 
03:43:08.149 --> 03:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
are hourly workers that work late jobs
 
03:43:11.429 --> 03:43:11.439 align:start position:0%
they are not normal 9to fs and they also
 
03:43:13.149 --> 03:43:13.159 align:start position:0%
might enjoy an adult beverage and they
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
also might enjoy music so are you aware
 
03:43:18.870 --> 03:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
that the these two groups of people are
 
03:43:21.790 --> 03:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
not as distinct and actually share a lot
 
03:43:24.910 --> 03:43:24.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:27.550 --> 03:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
behaviors so
 
03:43:31.469 --> 03:43:31.479 align:start position:0%
um the ordinance that Durham sunsetted
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
last evening was not illegal it was
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
legal and uh sustained that way on
 
03:43:39.429 --> 03:43:39.439 align:start position:0%
multiple occasions by the New Hampshire
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and we believe what we've
 
03:43:44.630 --> 03:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
put into place is also legal and
 
03:43:46.870 --> 03:43:46.880 align:start position:0%
represent present an improvement moving
 
03:43:51.870 --> 03:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
forward um I think that last year you
 
03:43:54.070 --> 03:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
brought up during the proceedings an
 
03:43:56.830 --> 03:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
important point which is the cost of
 
03:43:59.469 --> 03:43:59.479 align:start position:0%
enforcement and you had made a statement
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't be an issue for Durham
 
03:44:04.710 --> 03:44:04.720 align:start position:0%
because UNH has its own police force and
 
03:44:06.790 --> 03:44:06.800 align:start position:0%
they would police off campus and that's
 
03:44:10.309 --> 03:44:10.319 align:start position:0%
not accurate so to the extent that there
 
03:44:14.389 --> 03:44:14.399 align:start position:0%
are Cs and there are caus by the student
 
03:44:15.910 --> 03:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
housing Pres
 
03:44:18.429 --> 03:44:18.439 align:start position:0%
those our increased calls to our Police
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%
Department our code enforcement our fire
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
department to address these issues the
 
03:44:25.510 --> 03:44:25.520 align:start position:0%
reality is that undergraduate student
 
03:44:28.910 --> 03:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
renters are different in that they are
 
03:44:31.510 --> 03:44:31.520 align:start position:0%
young they're energetic they're learning
 
03:44:33.510 --> 03:44:33.520 align:start position:0%
how to live on their own for the first
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
time uh they're exploring boundaries um
 
03:44:40.750 --> 03:44:40.760 align:start position:0%
and they tend to live very different uh
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
lifestyles in terms of the hours that
 
03:44:45.429 --> 03:44:45.439 align:start position:0%
they keep so on a Thursday night a
 
03:44:47.790 --> 03:44:47.800 align:start position:0%
Friday night a Saturday night Durham
 
03:44:50.750 --> 03:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
starts to pick up uh activity around you
 
03:44:53.670 --> 03:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
know 10:00 and it continues until 2 am
 
03:44:56.149 --> 03:44:56.159 align:start position:0%
in some areas and we're just trying to
 
03:44:59.229 --> 03:44:59.239 align:start position:0%
put that activity where it belongs with
 
03:45:01.429 --> 03:45:01.439 align:start position:0%
similar types of activity and we're
 
03:45:03.149 --> 03:45:03.159 align:start position:0%
trying to keep that activity to a
 
03:45:06.469 --> 03:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
minimum in areas where we where
 
03:45:09.590 --> 03:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
typically non students live and that
 
03:45:12.990 --> 03:45:13.000 align:start position:0%
type of activity fundamentally impacts
 
03:45:15.670 --> 03:45:15.680 align:start position:0%
quality of life and so
 
03:45:18.269 --> 03:45:18.279 align:start position:0%
uh again I appreciate you live in New
 
03:45:20.030 --> 03:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
Market I think one of the things you've
 
03:45:22.429 --> 03:45:22.439 align:start position:0%
experienced over the last 10 years is
 
03:45:25.910 --> 03:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
because of the 22400 beds we've created
 
03:45:28.790 --> 03:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
in Durham we've pulled that student uh
 
03:45:31.830 --> 03:45:31.840 align:start position:0%
element that student body group out of
 
03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
New Market largely out of Portsmith out
 
03:45:37.349 --> 03:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
of do how do I know that because in the
 
03:45:40.030 --> 03:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
early 2000s when many of the UN students
 
03:45:41.830 --> 03:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
were living in those communities the
 
03:45:43.630 --> 03:45:43.640 align:start position:0%
city managers in those communities would
 
03:45:46.229 --> 03:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
call me and they would say Todd how do
 
03:45:48.750 --> 03:45:48.760 align:start position:0%
you manage student housing because we're
 
03:45:50.750 --> 03:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
having all sorts of problems and we're
 
03:45:53.349 --> 03:45:53.359 align:start position:0%
not successful in dealing with it and
 
03:45:55.309 --> 03:45:55.319 align:start position:0%
what Durham has done is pulled those
 
03:45:58.110 --> 03:45:58.120 align:start position:0%
young people back into town so that they
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
don't have to have cars uh it's much
 
03:46:02.790 --> 03:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
more efficient they can walk to class
 
03:46:04.670 --> 03:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
and we really pride ourselves in
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
ensuring safe housing as well and that's
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
one of the objectives of our code office
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
and our fire department these are young
 
03:46:14.030 --> 03:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
people who are renting for the first
 
03:46:16.070 --> 03:46:16.080 align:start position:0%
time who are very inexperienced and we
 
03:46:17.469 --> 03:46:17.479 align:start position:0%
want to make sure as well they're not
 
03:46:21.429 --> 03:46:21.439 align:start position:0%
taken advantage of by landlords who are
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes interested in taking advantage
 
03:46:25.309 --> 03:46:25.319 align:start position:0%
of young people so we have an interest
 
03:46:27.149 --> 03:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
there too in terms of the Health and
 
03:46:29.510 --> 03:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
Welfare and safety but again I'm not
 
03:46:31.990 --> 03:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
trying to Sugar cat to step around and
 
03:46:33.550 --> 03:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
I'm trying I'm sorry if I'm raising red
 
03:46:36.229 --> 03:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
flags for you but uh undergraduate
 
03:46:38.910 --> 03:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
college students behave profoundly
 
03:46:40.990 --> 03:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
differently when living off campus in
 
03:46:42.830 --> 03:46:42.840 align:start position:0%
larger numbers and we're simply trying
 
03:46:45.510 --> 03:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
to very thoughtfully manage that and to
 
03:46:47.750 --> 03:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
put the undergraduate students where
 
03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
there are Services where there are
 
03:46:51.790 --> 03:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
similar types of uses and in a manner
 
03:46:54.269 --> 03:46:54.279 align:start position:0%
that doesn't create disruptions with the
 
03:46:56.429 --> 03:46:56.439 align:start position:0%
the majority of the rest of the
 
03:47:00.070 --> 03:47:00.080 align:start position:0%
community go ahead yeah go ahead um
 
03:47:02.630 --> 03:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
thank you and one last question so
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
should this bill pass is there anything
 
03:47:09.229 --> 03:47:09.239 align:start position:0%
in this bill that would somehow run uh
 
03:47:11.510 --> 03:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
against the new version of the ordinance
 
03:47:14.309 --> 03:47:14.319 align:start position:0%
and I do appreciate that uh the Supreme
 
03:47:16.469 --> 03:47:16.479 align:start position:0%
Court found it was legal in regards to
 
03:47:18.750 --> 03:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
familial status or I'm sorry
 
03:47:20.510 --> 03:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
discrimination on students I was being
 
03:47:22.870 --> 03:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
very specific about adus and that
 
03:47:24.830 --> 03:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
literally being against the current Adu
 
03:47:27.710 --> 03:47:27.720 align:start position:0%
law but you have a new ordinance now I
 
03:47:30.910 --> 03:47:30.920 align:start position:0%
like it a lot better it's a lot cleaner
 
03:47:33.429 --> 03:47:33.439 align:start position:0%
um doesn't have as much problem and I'm
 
03:47:34.710 --> 03:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
hard on it we've worked really hard on
 
03:47:37.950 --> 03:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
it no it's I think it's great I'm I I
 
03:47:39.950 --> 03:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
think it's a lot better my question is
 
03:47:43.550 --> 03:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed does that give a
 
03:47:45.429 --> 03:47:45.439 align:start position:0%
problem for your new ordinance
 
03:47:48.750 --> 03:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
it does yes this bill would um strike
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
down uh vast parts of the new ordinance
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
and that would in essence leave durum so
 
03:47:55.229 --> 03:47:55.239 align:start position:0%
that there would be no restriction in
 
03:47:57.269 --> 03:47:57.279 align:start position:0%
terms of where undergraduate students
 
03:47:57.279 --> 03:47:58.229 align:start position:0%
terms of where undergraduate students
could

03:47:58.229 --> 03:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:48:00.670 --> 03:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
live representative
 
03:48:04.510 --> 03:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
Hicks thank you Mr chairman so to seek
 
03:48:07.429 --> 03:48:07.439 align:start position:0%
clarification where I think you are
 
03:48:11.189 --> 03:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
saying my undergraduate student at
 
03:48:14.309 --> 03:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
UNH I somewhat know what she does in the
 
03:48:14.319 --> 03:48:15.830 align:start position:0%
UNH I somewhat know what she does in the
weekends

03:48:15.830 --> 03:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
weekends
 
03:48:18.229 --> 03:48:18.239 align:start position:0%
and I would not permit that at my house
 
03:48:21.830 --> 03:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
where she has grown up because it' be
 
03:48:24.990 --> 03:48:25.000 align:start position:0%
disruptive on weekends and week nights
 
03:48:27.309 --> 03:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
is that what you're saying yes thank you
 
03:48:32.349 --> 03:48:32.359 align:start position:0%
it is and if if there is a non-student
 
03:48:35.269 --> 03:48:35.279 align:start position:0%
adult living in the property going to
 
03:48:37.950 --> 03:48:37.960 align:start position:0%
work living their lives whether they
 
03:48:40.750 --> 03:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
have family or not they take a very
 
03:48:42.910 --> 03:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
different interest in long-term view of
 
03:48:44.910 --> 03:48:44.920 align:start position:0%
that property and quality of life of
 
03:48:46.710 --> 03:48:46.720 align:start position:0%
themselves and their neighbors then do
 
03:48:48.750 --> 03:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
the individuals in a student rental now
 
03:48:50.389 --> 03:48:50.399 align:start position:0%
are there some student rentals that
 
03:48:52.750 --> 03:48:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't cause any issues there are there
 
03:48:54.630 --> 03:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
are many but there are many that do
 
03:48:57.269 --> 03:48:57.279 align:start position:0%
cause profound issues for neighborhoods
 
03:48:57.279 --> 03:48:58.469 align:start position:0%
cause profound issues for neighborhoods
representative

03:48:58.469 --> 03:48:58.479 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um have you
 
03:49:05.950 --> 03:49:05.960 align:start position:0%
ever heard comments and these comments
 
03:49:08.750 --> 03:49:08.760 align:start position:0%
are something that I can testify to both
 
03:49:10.910 --> 03:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
from personal experience and from
 
03:49:13.269 --> 03:49:13.279 align:start position:0%
handling housing cases at the New
 
03:49:15.309 --> 03:49:15.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Human Rights Commission have
 
03:49:17.630 --> 03:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
you ever heard comments that the worst
 
03:49:20.510 --> 03:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
noise problems can be caused not by
 
03:49:23.710 --> 03:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
students or children or teenagers but by
 
03:49:26.389 --> 03:49:26.399 align:start position:0%
unhappy marriages that can result in
 
03:49:28.910 --> 03:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
people screaming at each other at 2 and
 
03:49:31.590 --> 03:49:31.600 align:start position:0%
3:00 in the morning every night and
 
03:49:33.510 --> 03:49:33.520 align:start position:0%
putting their fists through walls on a
 
03:49:36.910 --> 03:49:36.920 align:start position:0%
regular basis have you ever heard that
 
03:49:41.070 --> 03:49:41.080 align:start position:0%
um we uh so yes and we have um
 
03:49:43.389 --> 03:49:43.399 align:start position:0%
individuals unfortunately who are in
 
03:49:45.830 --> 03:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
that situation and the police do respond
 
03:49:48.630 --> 03:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
and they're very difficult police calls
 
03:49:51.189 --> 03:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
but that does not constitute the vast
 
03:49:53.469 --> 03:49:53.479 align:start position:0%
vast overwhelming majority of our police
 
03:49:53.479 --> 03:49:54.870 align:start position:0%
vast overwhelming majority of our police
calls

03:49:54.870 --> 03:49:54.880 align:start position:0%
calls
 
03:49:58.030 --> 03:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
ours uh very largely surround the
 
03:50:00.550 --> 03:50:00.560 align:start position:0%
student undergraduate experience and
 
03:50:02.710 --> 03:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
parties that are taking
 
03:50:06.149 --> 03:50:06.159 align:start position:0%
place so it's very different
 
03:50:08.030 --> 03:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
represent thank you thank you for taking
 
03:50:13.550 --> 03:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
my question um does UNH have enough dorm
 
03:50:17.269 --> 03:50:17.279 align:start position:0%
dorm housing for all the
 
03:50:20.590 --> 03:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
freshmen for freshmen and now UNH also
 
03:50:22.429 --> 03:50:22.439 align:start position:0%
requires all sophomores to live on
 
03:50:24.070 --> 03:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
campus okay that was my followup
 
03:50:26.750 --> 03:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
question which has which um has created
 
03:50:28.469 --> 03:50:28.479 align:start position:0%
a softening in the rental market in
 
03:50:31.870 --> 03:50:31.880 align:start position:0%
Durham so our professional landlords who
 
03:50:35.349 --> 03:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
operate the um off-campus multi-units
 
03:50:37.950 --> 03:50:37.960 align:start position:0%
the high-rise type uh buildings
 
03:50:39.590 --> 03:50:39.600 align:start position:0%
typically they're close to 100%
 
03:50:41.670 --> 03:50:41.680 align:start position:0%
occupancy for the last 2 years they're
 
03:50:44.910 --> 03:50:44.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere between now 80 and 90% they're
 
03:50:48.030 --> 03:50:48.040 align:start position:0%
really feeling a concern um in addition
 
03:50:50.070 --> 03:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
there are fewer students who are
 
03:50:51.750 --> 03:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
enrolled at the University it's down
 
03:50:53.750 --> 03:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
about a thousand from several years ago
 
03:50:55.309 --> 03:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
so they're feeling the pinch there as
 
03:50:58.070 --> 03:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
well so
 
03:51:02.110 --> 03:51:02.120 align:start position:0%
um uh so then would it be a true
 
03:51:05.550 --> 03:51:05.560 align:start position:0%
statement to say that the most
 
03:51:09.630 --> 03:51:09.640 align:start position:0%
inexperienced young person who I think
 
03:51:14.110 --> 03:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
we said new experiences not sure how to
 
03:51:16.229 --> 03:51:16.239 align:start position:0%
I don't know we say live life or be
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
responsible adults so would it be an
 
03:51:22.710 --> 03:51:22.720 align:start position:0%
accurate statement or if you however you
 
03:51:24.870 --> 03:51:24.880 align:start position:0%
want to make this a question but so the
 
03:51:28.030 --> 03:51:28.040 align:start position:0%
most naive people going to UNH as
 
03:51:30.189 --> 03:51:30.199 align:start position:0%
freshmen and sophomores they are
 
03:51:31.790 --> 03:51:31.800 align:start position:0%
contained within the
 
03:51:35.670 --> 03:51:35.680 align:start position:0%
dorm uh housing right they so then the
 
03:51:39.309 --> 03:51:39.319 align:start position:0%
more responsible ones theoretically of
 
03:51:43.030 --> 03:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
course as Juniors and seniors are the
 
03:51:45.469 --> 03:51:45.479 align:start position:0%
ones seeking the house that we're
 
03:51:48.309 --> 03:51:48.319 align:start position:0%
looking at in this Bill yes that is
 
03:51:51.189 --> 03:51:51.199 align:start position:0%
correct although it is the first time
 
03:51:53.750 --> 03:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
they've ever entered into a lease and
 
03:51:56.189 --> 03:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
really lived on their own when they're
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
in a dormatory they're really kind of
 
03:52:00.950 --> 03:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
taken care of thank you representative
 
03:52:04.429 --> 03:52:04.439 align:start position:0%
hick thank you um so zoning often we
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
talk about health and safety as the
 
03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
reason for zoning would you say on
 
03:52:10.550 --> 03:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
average there's a difference um in
 
03:52:14.510 --> 03:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
health and safety between a a family or
 
03:52:16.510 --> 03:52:16.520 align:start position:0%
let's say adults regardless of family
 
03:52:20.590 --> 03:52:20.600 align:start position:0%
status adults living in housing versus
 
03:52:23.950 --> 03:52:23.960 align:start position:0%
um undergraduate students regardless of
 
03:52:26.110 --> 03:52:26.120 align:start position:0%
whether they are legally
 
03:52:30.469 --> 03:52:30.479 align:start position:0%
adults yes in U as Brendan oin our fire
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
Mall noted the fire code recognizes this
 
03:52:36.750 --> 03:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
as well and typically if someone is in a
 
03:52:40.229 --> 03:52:40.239 align:start position:0%
family unit whatever that family unit is
 
03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
comprised of those individuals know each
 
03:52:44.110 --> 03:52:44.120 align:start position:0%
other they care about one another they
 
03:52:47.309 --> 03:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
know another's schedules um and if there
 
03:52:50.030 --> 03:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
was a fire or an issue they have concern
 
03:52:51.189 --> 03:52:51.199 align:start position:0%
and they're going to look out for one
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
another's welfare where if you have
 
03:52:55.389 --> 03:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
individuals who are not connected in
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
that way living together they don't know
 
03:52:58.710 --> 03:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
their comies and goes they don't
 
03:53:00.670 --> 03:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily have any connections if
 
03:53:02.550 --> 03:53:02.560 align:start position:0%
there's an emergency they're off they're
 
03:53:04.349 --> 03:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
on they're leaving they're not concerned
 
03:53:07.950 --> 03:53:07.960 align:start position:0%
about others in the property per
 
03:53:13.389 --> 03:53:13.399 align:start position:0%
se so yes and all right other questions
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
all right you're off the hook
 
03:53:18.309 --> 03:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
for now I'll be right here if you need
 
03:53:20.790 --> 03:53:20.800 align:start position:0%
me thank
 
03:53:28.670 --> 03:53:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:32.189 --> 03:53:32.199 align:start position:0%
Berlin got some things to pass out here
 
03:53:34.189 --> 03:53:34.199 align:start position:0%
so just give me a minute I'll start
 
03:53:52.389 --> 03:53:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:54.229 --> 03:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
help you feed the other side um we'll
 
03:53:55.830 --> 03:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
just go down this way make sure everyone
 
03:54:14.670 --> 03:54:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.680 --> 03:54:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
you

03:54:45.349 --> 03:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:45.359 --> 03:55:19.110 align:start position:0%
 
something

03:55:19.110 --> 03:55:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:12.030 --> 03:56:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:14.910 --> 03:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
okay everybody got that
 
03:56:17.670 --> 03:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
um so my name is Jeff Berlin I uh
 
03:56:20.189 --> 03:56:20.199 align:start position:0%
introduced this bill last year as 1281
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
with uh we had a bipartisan group last
 
03:56:26.229 --> 03:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
year um full of progressive people on
 
03:56:29.469 --> 03:56:29.479 align:start position:0%
the left and Libertarians on the right
 
03:56:33.349 --> 03:56:33.359 align:start position:0%
um and the actions that you've seen uh
 
03:56:35.910 --> 03:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
introduced at the Town level by Al your
 
03:56:38.309 --> 03:56:38.319 align:start position:0%
truly Allen Howland you have that um
 
03:56:39.790 --> 03:56:39.800 align:start position:0%
that they've just just been discussing
 
03:56:40.990 --> 03:56:41.000 align:start position:0%
in front of you right now so you can
 
03:56:44.550 --> 03:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
actually see it um
 
03:56:46.910 --> 03:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
their actions were a direct result of
 
03:56:48.950 --> 03:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
what we introduced last year I take it
 
03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
as sort of capitulation that we had a
 
03:56:52.110 --> 03:56:52.120 align:start position:0%
pretty big issue that we brought in
 
03:56:53.910 --> 03:56:53.920 align:start position:0%
front of the state because at the local
 
03:56:56.309 --> 03:56:56.319 align:start position:0%
level we were not able to make any
 
03:56:58.990 --> 03:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
progress for obvious reasons as you just
 
03:57:01.550 --> 03:57:01.560 align:start position:0%
witnessed I think the best arguments
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
from our side to be honest with you is
 
03:57:05.389 --> 03:57:05.399 align:start position:0%
to just listen to what these people are
 
03:57:08.550 --> 03:57:08.560 align:start position:0%
saying they're basically requesting you
 
03:57:11.070 --> 03:57:11.080 align:start position:0%
to uphold their discrimination in the
 
03:57:13.830 --> 03:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
name of I think Todd just said some kids
 
03:57:16.630 --> 03:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
walk home at night and wake up the whole
 
03:57:18.189 --> 03:57:18.199 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I've never seen that happen
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
but apparently Todd has um I equate it
 
03:57:24.750 --> 03:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
similarly to you know I live in the
 
03:57:28.510 --> 03:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
downtown area and um huge dog lover
 
03:57:29.950 --> 03:57:29.960 align:start position:0%
myself but I have to say we have some
 
03:57:33.189 --> 03:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
neighbors who let their dogs out at 6:00
 
03:57:35.070 --> 03:57:35.080 align:start position:0%
in the morning and they bark non-stop
 
03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
and they literally wake up the whole
 
03:57:39.469 --> 03:57:39.479 align:start position:0%
neighborhood I haven't seen anybody try
 
03:57:42.070 --> 03:57:42.080 align:start position:0%
to introduce local legislation to ban
 
03:57:44.830 --> 03:57:44.840 align:start position:0%
dogs being outside at 7 the morning as
 
03:57:48.950 --> 03:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
this inconvenience and um although if
 
03:57:50.590 --> 03:57:50.600 align:start position:0%
they did at least they wouldn't be
 
03:57:52.750 --> 03:57:52.760 align:start position:0%
manipulating the housing market which is
 
03:57:54.269 --> 03:57:54.279 align:start position:0%
basically what is happening with this
 
03:57:57.149 --> 03:57:57.159 align:start position:0%
local zoning so um I think that's some
 
03:57:59.070 --> 03:57:59.080 align:start position:0%
important notes I'd like to just
 
03:58:01.670 --> 03:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
highlight some things on the map here so
 
03:58:03.990 --> 03:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
if you look at this map this is the
 
03:58:07.950 --> 03:58:07.960 align:start position:0%
downtown Zone in um in
 
03:58:10.750 --> 03:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
Durham and we have two different things
 
03:58:13.510 --> 03:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
here so on this map um the black line
 
03:58:15.790 --> 03:58:15.800 align:start position:0%
that goes straight through is I didn't
 
03:58:17.389 --> 03:58:17.399 align:start position:0%
really introduce myself completely so I
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
am a citizen of Derm and a landlord I'm
 
03:58:23.870 --> 03:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
I manage um private off-campus housing
 
03:58:25.990 --> 03:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
of others I also have a small portfolio
 
03:58:29.070 --> 03:58:29.080 align:start position:0%
of individual um properties most of
 
03:58:30.630 --> 03:58:30.640 align:start position:0%
which are actually grandfathered which
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
is part of the problem um and are
 
03:58:34.710 --> 03:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
scattered throughout Durham that are
 
03:58:37.309 --> 03:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
actually outside of this map so I in
 
03:58:38.790 --> 03:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
certain properties I'm not subject to
 
03:58:41.349 --> 03:58:41.359 align:start position:0%
this unrelated rule for whatever reason
 
03:58:44.110 --> 03:58:44.120 align:start position:0%
from a long time ago so the black line
 
03:58:46.870 --> 03:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
going through this um is on the left
 
03:58:50.269 --> 03:58:50.279 align:start position:0%
side is my opinion and my expertise of
 
03:58:52.550 --> 03:58:52.560 align:start position:0%
where students would prefer to live in
 
03:58:58.110 --> 03:58:58.120 align:start position:0%
town um the circled zones are the ones
 
03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
that Durham just capitulated um to our
 
03:59:04.149 --> 03:59:04.159 align:start position:0%
issue and now they're saying that the
 
03:59:06.030 --> 03:59:06.040 align:start position:0%
commercial use of quote unquote a
 
03:59:08.149 --> 03:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
student rental
 
03:59:10.550 --> 03:59:10.560 align:start position:0%
um they've shown you it's an industrial
 
03:59:13.710 --> 03:59:13.720 align:start position:0%
use so they want the students to live in
 
03:59:17.110 --> 03:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
the industrial zones and the um CU
 
03:59:18.030 --> 03:59:18.040 align:start position:0%
that's what they think of them
 
03:59:19.870 --> 03:59:19.880 align:start position:0%
apparently is that they're industrial
 
03:59:23.910 --> 03:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
use maybe I don't know um the X's that
 
03:59:26.070 --> 03:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
I've put which is sort of the most
 
03:59:27.750 --> 03:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
egregious part right so in the new Z in
 
03:59:30.670 --> 03:59:30.680 align:start position:0%
the new amendment that Al introduced at
 
03:59:32.790 --> 03:59:32.800 align:start position:0%
Durham I think they're leaving out that
 
03:59:35.349 --> 03:59:35.359 align:start position:0%
this student rental is not allowed in
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
one of the closest residential zones to
 
03:59:39.670 --> 03:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
campus and so on the bottom left of this
 
03:59:43.469 --> 03:59:43.479 align:start position:0%
map I have marked on it's Mill Road it's
 
03:59:45.309 --> 03:59:45.319 align:start position:0%
the right side of mil Road and durm so
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
those of you who are familiar would know
 
03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
this these properties literally touch
 
03:59:53.030 --> 03:59:53.040 align:start position:0%
campus and in the ones I've exed out are
 
03:59:56.189 --> 03:59:56.199 align:start position:0%
to my best knowledge houses that if were
 
03:59:57.710 --> 03:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
they were allowed to rent to more than
 
03:59:59.110 --> 03:59:59.120 align:start position:0%
three now four
 
04:00:01.469 --> 04:00:01.479 align:start position:0%
unrelated have bedrooms that are vacant
 
04:00:02.950 --> 04:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
currently and would be added to the
 
04:00:04.710 --> 04:00:04.720 align:start position:0%
market if you accept this
 
04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
bill now if you just start doing that
 
04:00:09.510 --> 04:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
throughout all the yellow zones on this
 
04:00:14.030 --> 04:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
map that is the visual effect of the
 
04:00:17.110 --> 04:00:17.120 align:start position:0%
Supply that was removed via this
 
04:00:19.510 --> 04:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
discriminatory and restrictive
 
04:00:22.269 --> 04:00:22.279 align:start position:0%
zoning if you're serious
 
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
about the fact that you have a housing
 
04:00:28.910 --> 04:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
crisis and that it's exacerbated by
 
04:00:31.070 --> 04:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
restrictive zoning and an under
 
04:00:34.790 --> 04:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
Supply we have a solution for you right
 
04:00:37.750 --> 04:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
here now people get worried that it's
 
04:00:39.590 --> 04:00:39.600 align:start position:0%
going to be a free-for-all around town
 
04:00:40.830 --> 04:00:40.840 align:start position:0%
and you're going to have a frat house in
 
04:00:42.389 --> 04:00:42.399 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood here and a sorority in
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood here
 
04:00:47.149 --> 04:00:47.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately you know and from my
 
04:00:48.309 --> 04:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
perspective we don't have enough
 
04:00:49.910 --> 04:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
students to actually make that happen so
 
04:00:51.950 --> 04:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
if you moved every single student out of
 
04:00:51.960 --> 04:00:53.510 align:start position:0%
if you moved every single student out of
oncampus

04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
oncampus
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
Housing and whether they're
 
04:00:57.950 --> 04:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
undergraduate overgrad duate and just
 
04:00:59.229 --> 04:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
moved them into the
 
04:01:01.309 --> 04:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods there's not enough of them
 
04:01:03.349 --> 04:01:03.359 align:start position:0%
to do what they're asking to do what
 
04:01:04.469 --> 04:01:04.479 align:start position:0%
they're trying to tell you is going to
 
04:01:05.910 --> 04:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
happen and
 
04:01:08.149 --> 04:01:08.159 align:start position:0%
so I would just argue that that is sort
 
04:01:09.469 --> 04:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
of muddying the waters I think the
 
04:01:12.189 --> 04:01:12.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh rep howand is also
 
04:01:14.030 --> 04:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
introducing just like last year I think
 
04:01:15.750 --> 04:01:15.760 align:start position:0%
is designed to confuse people this is
 
04:01:17.990 --> 04:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
not a fire safety bill this is a
 
04:01:20.349 --> 04:01:20.359 align:start position:0%
Equitable housing Bill and so I'd ask
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
you not to confuse those two
 
04:01:24.870 --> 04:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
things Mr burlin we just ask you wrap up
 
04:01:26.550 --> 04:01:26.560 align:start position:0%
if you yeah sure so yep I'll wrap up
 
04:01:28.550 --> 04:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
right now so um if you have any
 
04:01:29.950 --> 04:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
questions I'll answer them but I would
 
04:01:32.189 --> 04:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
say that if you if you let this bill go
 
04:01:33.149 --> 04:01:33.159 align:start position:0%
through what's you're going to see
 
04:01:34.349 --> 04:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
happen is you're going to see students
 
04:01:36.030 --> 04:01:36.040 align:start position:0%
move from the right side of this black
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
line on your map to the left side and
 
04:01:42.510 --> 04:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
for no discussions at the Town level or
 
04:01:44.149 --> 04:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
anything regarding Workforce housing
 
04:01:46.229 --> 04:01:46.239 align:start position:0%
you're going to create the workforce
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
housing because you're going to remove
 
04:01:49.790 --> 04:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
the demand for the grandfathered
 
04:01:51.229 --> 04:01:51.239 align:start position:0%
properties where students current live
 
04:01:53.309 --> 04:01:53.319 align:start position:0%
outside of town as they move forward
 
04:01:54.910 --> 04:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're going to open that up for the
 
04:01:57.389 --> 04:01:57.399 align:start position:0%
workforce thank you and free to answer
 
04:01:58.990 --> 04:01:59.000 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you questions for Mr
 
04:02:01.110 --> 04:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
Berlin representative Howland I just
 
04:02:02.910 --> 04:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
have one because you mentioned that the
 
04:02:05.510 --> 04:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
zones that you'd circled were were zoned
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
industrial and that's where we're having
 
04:02:10.510 --> 04:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
students live that that does not
 
04:02:12.269 --> 04:02:12.279 align:start position:0%
actually appear to be the case actually
 
04:02:14.910 --> 04:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
CB is Central Business business CH is
 
04:02:17.590 --> 04:02:17.600 align:start position:0%
courthouse and C is co those are
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
actually uh the central business
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
district a residential area budding the
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
central district and another residential
 
04:02:26.750 --> 04:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
so they're they're not industrial at all
 
04:02:29.189 --> 04:02:29.199 align:start position:0%
is that is that true
 
04:02:32.070 --> 04:02:32.080 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I see one res I mean
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
professional office and Central Business
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
I think is I've heard described as
 
04:02:39.429 --> 04:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
business and okay so may maybe I haven't
 
04:02:41.710 --> 04:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
04:02:44.269 --> 04:02:44.279 align:start position:0%
um you guys can decide if you think that
 
04:02:45.750 --> 04:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
the segregation of students to the
 
04:02:47.950 --> 04:02:47.960 align:start position:0%
middle of where the businesses are is
 
04:02:50.110 --> 04:02:50.120 align:start position:0%
industrial or commercial in nature or
 
04:02:52.870 --> 04:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:55.830 --> 04:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
mean I just follow up so that white area
 
04:02:58.110 --> 04:02:58.120 align:start position:0%
that's in the middle of your circled
 
04:03:00.870 --> 04:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
areas that's unh's campus right the
 
04:03:02.510 --> 04:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
white area is the central business
 
04:03:05.149 --> 04:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
district the um the legend I think the
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
circle CB is Central District central
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
business district but the white area
 
04:03:11.550 --> 04:03:11.560 align:start position:0%
that AB buts that that that's next to
 
04:03:15.110 --> 04:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
the green area that you have is that un
 
04:03:16.950 --> 04:03:16.960 align:start position:0%
campus I'm not sure what you're talking
 
04:03:20.870 --> 04:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
about the the grided area that's unh's
 
04:03:23.349 --> 04:03:23.359 align:start position:0%
campus that's what I'm say map I'm
 
04:03:25.590 --> 04:03:25.600 align:start position:0%
asking yeah yeah that's what yeah that's
 
04:03:26.590 --> 04:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
what it
 
04:03:29.469 --> 04:03:29.479 align:start position:0%
says and I I went and I went there and
 
04:03:31.990 --> 04:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to like understand like
 
04:03:33.710 --> 04:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
where's Paul College compared to like
 
04:03:35.870 --> 04:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
this map I I'm sorry this this is a
 
04:03:38.550 --> 04:03:38.560 align:start position:0%
zoning map that's the only reason sorry
 
04:03:40.389 --> 04:03:40.399 align:start position:0%
it's like unless you're really familiar
 
04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
with Derm zoning
 
04:03:44.710 --> 04:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh the map is not as
 
04:03:46.870 --> 04:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
helpful um we can always go over it
 
04:03:48.670 --> 04:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
later great yes we can all right other
 
04:03:49.790 --> 04:03:49.800 align:start position:0%
questions from Mr
 
04:03:53.189 --> 04:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
Berlin San thank you very much thank you

04:04:19.910 --> 04:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
on okay great um all right well I
 
04:04:21.229 --> 04:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
appreciate uh the attention of the
 
04:04:23.790 --> 04:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
committee um my name is Stephen Kimble I
 
04:04:25.590 --> 04:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
um my family has owned property in
 
04:04:27.269 --> 04:04:27.279 align:start position:0%
Durham for over 90 years we've lived on
 
04:04:29.950 --> 04:04:29.960 align:start position:0%
that property for four generations and
 
04:04:32.910 --> 04:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
uh I uh am just a private citizen
 
04:04:34.910 --> 04:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
essentially but um when I heard what
 
04:04:38.309 --> 04:04:38.319 align:start position:0%
Durham was doing uh I was so uh
 
04:04:40.469 --> 04:04:40.479 align:start position:0%
concerned with it that I felt I should
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
get involved um fundamentally you know
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
we've heard a lot of smooth talking
 
04:04:49.309 --> 04:04:49.319 align:start position:0%
bureaucrats trying to make this all
 
04:04:52.110 --> 04:04:52.120 align:start position:0%
sound normal but if you boil it down
 
04:04:55.030 --> 04:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
right the 14th Amendment says equal
 
04:04:56.870 --> 04:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
protection under the law and just
 
04:04:58.710 --> 04:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
because there hasn't been a landmark
 
04:05:01.469 --> 04:05:01.479 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court case about discriminating
 
04:05:03.189 --> 04:05:03.199 align:start position:0%
against students doesn't mean they don't
 
04:05:05.670 --> 04:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
deserve equal protection under the law
 
04:05:07.429 --> 04:05:07.439 align:start position:0%
um and but the Supreme Court has made it
 
04:05:09.790 --> 04:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
clear that separate but equal doesn't
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
cut it equal is equal so um I think that
 
04:05:16.030 --> 04:05:16.040 align:start position:0%
any zoning ordinance that's allowed to
 
04:05:18.670 --> 04:05:18.680 align:start position:0%
use the characteristics of the people in
 
04:05:21.030 --> 04:05:21.040 align:start position:0%
the housing as a way to segregate them
 
04:05:23.110 --> 04:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
into different parts of town is just
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
fundamentally wrong and not supported in
 
04:05:28.070 --> 04:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
the law and I think that that you should
 
04:05:30.229 --> 04:05:30.239 align:start position:0%
be very careful if you're going to allow
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
that to continue um the property that we
 
04:05:36.630 --> 04:05:36.640 align:start position:0%
have there uh back in 1935 my
 
04:05:38.990 --> 04:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
grandfather uh he was a university
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
professor and he allowed uh students to
 
04:05:44.590 --> 04:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
to build a cabin in behind his house cuz
 
04:05:45.870 --> 04:05:45.880 align:start position:0%
during the Great Depression there was
 
04:05:48.950 --> 04:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
really no housing for for students and
 
04:05:50.790 --> 04:05:50.800 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's how we came to have two
 
04:05:54.309 --> 04:05:54.319 align:start position:0%
houses on one lot and um we've always
 
04:05:57.349 --> 04:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
done that uh maintain it sometimes it's
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
rented to students sometimes we have
 
04:06:01.110 --> 04:06:01.120 align:start position:0%
families in there um sometimes our
 
04:06:02.910 --> 04:06:02.920 align:start position:0%
family uses one of the houses sometimes
 
04:06:05.110 --> 04:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
we rent it out it's just it's been there
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we've always had the flexibility to
 
04:06:09.469 --> 04:06:09.479 align:start position:0%
do what needed to be done with it uh we
 
04:06:11.630 --> 04:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
were free to choose who our tenants were
 
04:06:13.710 --> 04:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
we were free to manage them in the way
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
we chose to and that uh is the right
 
04:06:19.990 --> 04:06:20.000 align:start position:0%
thing to do um that kind of generosity
 
04:06:22.189 --> 04:06:22.199 align:start position:0%
really could never happen today of of
 
04:06:23.670 --> 04:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
building another building on your
 
04:06:26.269 --> 04:06:26.279 align:start position:0%
property to uh to help house
 
04:06:28.790 --> 04:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
students um one of the things that I
 
04:06:31.070 --> 04:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
really found concerning is is their use
 
04:06:32.910 --> 04:06:32.920 align:start position:0%
of the US Department of Education
 
04:06:35.910 --> 04:06:35.920 align:start position:0%
definition of a student uh to define a
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
class to segregate into a different part
 
04:06:40.590 --> 04:06:40.600 align:start position:0%
of town I mean that definition was
 
04:06:42.830 --> 04:06:42.840 align:start position:0%
created to identify people that that
 
04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
they wanted to support and encourage to
 
04:06:47.429 --> 04:06:47.439 align:start position:0%
pursue higher education to better
 
04:06:49.510 --> 04:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
themselves these are our future leaders
 
04:06:50.990 --> 04:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
these are people that we're looking to
 
04:06:53.309 --> 04:06:53.319 align:start position:0%
support not to segregate off into some
 
04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
commercial Zone because nobody wants to
 
04:06:58.469 --> 04:06:58.479 align:start position:0%
deal with their learning experience or
 
04:06:59.830 --> 04:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
or their
 
04:07:03.870 --> 04:07:03.880 align:start position:0%
education um I would have to say uh if
 
04:07:05.790 --> 04:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
you replace the word student with any
 
04:07:08.670 --> 04:07:08.680 align:start position:0%
other class of people I think you would
 
04:07:10.790 --> 04:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
find it highly offensive I mean if you
 
04:07:13.030 --> 04:07:13.040 align:start position:0%
try this is their de this is their
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
definition with the word student
 
04:07:17.550 --> 04:07:17.560 align:start position:0%
replaced immigrant rental an immigrant
 
04:07:19.349 --> 04:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
rental is a residential dwelling
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
composed of one or more dwelling units
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
on a single parcel that includes five or
 
04:07:24.870 --> 04:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
more immigrants as defined by federal
 
04:07:27.389 --> 04:07:27.399 align:start position:0%
law immigrant rentals are not allowed
 
04:07:30.910 --> 04:07:30.920 align:start position:0%
use in any residential district r r a RB
 
04:07:30.920 --> 04:07:32.229 align:start position:0%
use in any residential district r r a RB
or

04:07:32.229 --> 04:07:32.239 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:07:35.550 --> 04:07:35.560 align:start position:0%
RC they could pass that tomorrow under
 
04:07:37.109 --> 04:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
the zoning ordinance we have does
 
04:07:39.389 --> 04:07:39.399 align:start position:0%
anybody think that we should allow local
 
04:07:41.070 --> 04:07:41.080 align:start position:0%
zoning officials to have the power to
 
04:07:44.229 --> 04:07:44.239 align:start position:0%
regulate in that fashion
 
04:07:46.030 --> 04:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
I'm just ask Mr Kimble if you wrap up
 
04:07:49.189 --> 04:07:49.199 align:start position:0%
that'd be great yep
 
04:07:51.189 --> 04:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
um all right well I don't think it was
 
04:07:52.750 --> 04:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
ever the intention of the state zoning
 
04:07:54.990 --> 04:07:55.000 align:start position:0%
law or or that it's a covered purpose
 
04:07:58.070 --> 04:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
under RSA 67417 to enable local and
 
04:07:59.950 --> 04:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
Municipal zoning officials to delve into
 
04:08:01.710 --> 04:08:01.720 align:start position:0%
the private lives of their residents in
 
04:08:03.349 --> 04:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
order to segregate them into different
 
04:08:04.469 --> 04:08:04.479 align:start position:0%
groups with different rights and
 
04:08:06.590 --> 04:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
privileges with respect to housing
 
04:08:10.189 --> 04:08:10.199 align:start position:0%
options um while uh representative
 
04:08:12.269 --> 04:08:12.279 align:start position:0%
howland's uh attempt at incorporating
 
04:08:14.750 --> 04:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
the state fire code AS a remedy uh is
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
admirable I think it misses the Mark if
 
04:08:18.790 --> 04:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
you read the definition in there
 
04:08:22.030 --> 04:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
carefully uh it says by members of a
 
04:08:23.670 --> 04:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
single family with not more than three
 
04:08:27.149 --> 04:08:27.159 align:start position:0%
Outsiders in rented rooms so I see huge
 
04:08:29.309 --> 04:08:29.319 align:start position:0%
loopholes I see a fraternity brother
 
04:08:31.469 --> 04:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
who's done well for himself buying a
 
04:08:35.510 --> 04:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
house and letting a dozen of his younger
 
04:08:38.349 --> 04:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
fraternity Brothers live there for free
 
04:08:40.429 --> 04:08:40.439 align:start position:0%
and this would simply not apply the fire
 
04:08:42.710 --> 04:08:42.720 align:start position:0%
code wouldn't apply so I don't think
 
04:08:44.550 --> 04:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
it's the remedy everybody's hoping it's
 
04:08:46.389 --> 04:08:46.399 align:start position:0%
going to be I think you should go with
 
04:08:49.149 --> 04:08:49.159 align:start position:0%
the language that is in the bill perhaps
 
04:08:51.149 --> 04:08:51.159 align:start position:0%
augmented with some language to expand
 
04:08:53.429 --> 04:08:53.439 align:start position:0%
it more clearly that they're not to
 
04:08:55.710 --> 04:08:55.720 align:start position:0%
discriminate on educational status or
 
04:08:57.990 --> 04:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
familial status or any other basis
 
04:09:00.429 --> 04:09:00.439 align:start position:0%
People Are People let them live in
 
04:09:02.429 --> 04:09:02.439 align:start position:0%
housing thank you thank you for your
 
04:09:04.229 --> 04:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
testimony questions for Mr
 
04:09:08.710 --> 04:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
Kimble seeing represent Reed thank you
 
04:09:12.349 --> 04:09:12.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair um thank you very much for your
 
04:09:15.510 --> 04:09:15.520 align:start position:0%
poignant testimony I uh wasn't able to
 
04:09:17.269 --> 04:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
ask this question of a previous speaker
 
04:09:21.070 --> 04:09:21.080 align:start position:0%
so I'll ask it of you um do you
 
04:09:23.309 --> 04:09:23.319 align:start position:0%
understand what I heard previously was
 
04:09:26.670 --> 04:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
that they're trying to uh get at certain
 
04:09:29.750 --> 04:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
behaviors that are problematic and I
 
04:09:33.910 --> 04:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
guess my question is um actually Mr
 
04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
chair I just lost my train of thought
 
04:09:38.870 --> 04:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay well if there's if there's no other
 
04:09:41.149 --> 04:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Sor I'll ask you
 
04:09:43.030 --> 04:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
personally thank you there's plenty of
 
04:09:52.870 --> 04:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:54.990 --> 04:09:55.000 align:start position:0%
Dees welcome
 
04:09:58.030 --> 04:09:58.040 align:start position:0%
back thank you now we're talking
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
congregate housing rather than Farms we
 
04:10:01.550 --> 04:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
had a lot of discussion about
 
04:10:03.870 --> 04:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
agricultural use earlier on that other
 
04:10:05.750 --> 04:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
bill um for the record my name is bro
 
04:10:08.149 --> 04:10:08.159 align:start position:0%
Dees I work with the New Hampshire
 
04:10:08.159 --> 04:10:09.189 align:start position:0%
Dees I work with the New Hampshire
Municipal

04:10:09.189 --> 04:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
Municipal
 
04:10:13.349 --> 04:10:13.359 align:start position:0%
Association um and I'm here to an
 
04:10:15.710 --> 04:10:15.720 align:start position:0%
opposition on behalf of nire Municipal
 
04:10:18.469 --> 04:10:18.479 align:start position:0%
Association for House Bill uh
 
04:10:21.109 --> 04:10:21.119 align:start position:0%
457 so one thing I do want to flag is
 
04:10:22.590 --> 04:10:22.600 align:start position:0%
that the municipal and County government
 
04:10:24.309 --> 04:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
committee is currently has a work
 
04:10:26.990 --> 04:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
session scheduled for tomorrow um to do
 
04:10:30.550 --> 04:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
with recovery homes House Bill uh 432
 
04:10:33.349 --> 04:10:33.359 align:start position:0%
which would be another um zoning mandate
 
04:10:35.229 --> 04:10:35.239 align:start position:0%
similar to this one that would impact
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
congregate living and how congregate
 
04:10:39.109 --> 04:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
living is regulated in municipalities
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
under their zoning um ordinances
 
04:10:43.670 --> 04:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
specifically um when you have that
 
04:10:47.309 --> 04:10:47.319 align:start position:0%
occupancy threshold per per room or just
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
per dwelling that um that's met and then
 
04:10:52.349 --> 04:10:52.359 align:start position:0%
there's a change of use for the
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
structure for the uh dwelling unit so
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
it's important to really delineate the
 
04:10:57.790 --> 04:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
difference between congregate versus
 
04:10:59.349 --> 04:10:59.359 align:start position:0%
regular dwelling units so regular
 
04:11:01.229 --> 04:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit has everything that you
 
04:11:03.309 --> 04:11:03.319 align:start position:0%
need in a dwelling unit like a kitchen
 
04:11:06.590 --> 04:11:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know proper waste disposal um you
 
04:11:09.469 --> 04:11:09.479 align:start position:0%
know running water you know bedrooms
 
04:11:11.990 --> 04:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
living space Etc congregate living is
 
04:11:13.990 --> 04:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
different in the nature of that you have
 
04:11:15.670 --> 04:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
separate bedrooms that are throughout
 
04:11:17.389 --> 04:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
the dwelling um but there's shared
 
04:11:19.309 --> 04:11:19.319 align:start position:0%
living space there's shared facilities
 
04:11:20.990 --> 04:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
for bathrooms there might be shared
 
04:11:23.309 --> 04:11:23.319 align:start position:0%
kitchens um in municipalities they have
 
04:11:25.269 --> 04:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
an interest for the safety health and
 
04:11:27.149 --> 04:11:27.159 align:start position:0%
the general welfare of their communities
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
to regulate where congregate living is
 
04:11:32.510 --> 04:11:32.520 align:start position:0%
in different zoning districts um the
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
reason for this is because different
 
04:11:35.550 --> 04:11:35.560 align:start position:0%
zoning districts have been developed
 
04:11:38.790 --> 04:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
over a 50 60 70 year period um to have
 
04:11:41.269 --> 04:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
specific amount of infrastructure impact
 
04:11:43.349 --> 04:11:43.359 align:start position:0%
um to have enough space and land for
 
04:11:45.510 --> 04:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
Waste Disposal like a septic system has
 
04:11:47.109 --> 04:11:47.119 align:start position:0%
sewer systems and water systems that are
 
04:11:49.790 --> 04:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
built to only meet a certain capacity um
 
04:11:51.189 --> 04:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
there's parking requirements to make
 
04:11:52.469 --> 04:11:52.479 align:start position:0%
sure that there's enough parking
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
depending on the dwelling unit how many
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
people or how many units are in it um
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
traffic is a huge concern that happens
 
04:11:59.510 --> 04:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
in many of these municipalities and
 
04:12:01.349 --> 04:12:01.359 align:start position:0%
again waste disposal more than just you
 
04:12:03.510 --> 04:12:03.520 align:start position:0%
know sewage waste and Water waste you
 
04:12:06.030 --> 04:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
know there's also trash disposal you
 
04:12:09.149 --> 04:12:09.159 align:start position:0%
know so um and other types of uh garbage
 
04:12:10.750 --> 04:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
that people might need to have be picked
 
04:12:12.189 --> 04:12:12.199 align:start position:0%
up by whether it's a municipal service
 
04:12:14.349 --> 04:12:14.359 align:start position:0%
or private service
 
04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
um taking a normal not a normal that's a
 
04:12:22.389 --> 04:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
bad term um taking a regular dwelling
 
04:12:26.990 --> 04:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
unit and changing it to congregate
 
04:12:29.510 --> 04:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
housing is a change of use it would
 
04:12:31.429 --> 04:12:31.439 align:start position:0%
require variance in the few
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities that actually do regulate
 
04:12:35.990 --> 04:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
congregant living it tends to be college
 
04:12:37.830 --> 04:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
towns because they have an invested
 
04:12:39.229 --> 04:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
interest of making sure that you don't
 
04:12:41.469 --> 04:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
have you know an inordinate amount of
 
04:12:43.389 --> 04:12:43.399 align:start position:0%
people that are all unrelated trying to
 
04:12:45.109 --> 04:12:45.119 align:start position:0%
live in the same space that's part of
 
04:12:46.950 --> 04:12:46.960 align:start position:0%
the reason why zoning exists because we
 
04:12:49.510 --> 04:12:49.520 align:start position:0%
had issues where um you know housing was
 
04:12:51.349 --> 04:12:51.359 align:start position:0%
too full to capacity and it was creating
 
04:12:53.469 --> 04:12:53.479 align:start position:0%
safety issues and health issues in the
 
04:12:54.830 --> 04:12:54.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities and not just for those
 
04:12:56.590 --> 04:12:56.600 align:start position:0%
who are residing in those units I know
 
04:12:59.070 --> 04:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
you're going to tell me it's almost time
 
04:13:02.149 --> 04:13:02.159 align:start position:0%
um it had an interest to further the uh
 
04:13:05.510 --> 04:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
General Welfare um there is also Merit
 
04:13:06.990 --> 04:13:07.000 align:start position:0%
to what was described earlier about
 
04:13:09.070 --> 04:13:09.080 align:start position:0%
unrelated people behaving differently
 
04:13:11.389 --> 04:13:11.399 align:start position:0%
especially if they have um separate
 
04:13:13.349 --> 04:13:13.359 align:start position:0%
leases um and especially if the releases
 
04:13:15.630 --> 04:13:15.640 align:start position:0%
are done by bed um you know an example
 
04:13:17.710 --> 04:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
would be a a two-person family with two
 
04:13:19.349 --> 04:13:19.359 align:start position:0%
kids they're not going to need as many
 
04:13:20.870 --> 04:13:20.880 align:start position:0%
cars right they're not going to need a
 
04:13:22.590 --> 04:13:22.600 align:start position:0%
car for every individual but for college
 
04:13:24.269 --> 04:13:24.279 align:start position:0%
students they might work and they might
 
04:13:25.870 --> 04:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
need to travel to school to their
 
04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
classes so they're going to need a car
 
04:13:28.389 --> 04:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
so you need to you know when they go
 
04:13:29.389 --> 04:13:29.399 align:start position:0%
through the process of getting a
 
04:13:30.950 --> 04:13:30.960 align:start position:0%
variance you might want to make a
 
04:13:32.349 --> 04:13:32.359 align:start position:0%
requirement or a contingency that they
 
04:13:34.389 --> 04:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
create more parking or if you all of a
 
04:13:36.429 --> 04:13:36.439 align:start position:0%
sudden have like six people living in
 
04:13:38.469 --> 04:13:38.479 align:start position:0%
the congrate living space you might need
 
04:13:41.229 --> 04:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
to increase the septic um capacity so
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
then it's not um polluting the
 
04:13:44.750 --> 04:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
groundwater or so it's not polluting or
 
04:13:45.910 --> 04:13:45.920 align:start position:0%
the septic system doesn't fail and
 
04:13:47.389 --> 04:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
pollute other people's
 
04:13:49.389 --> 04:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
properties dises if you could wrap up
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
that'd be great my last yeah my last
 
04:13:53.349 --> 04:13:53.359 align:start position:0%
comment um zoning and occupancy
 
04:13:55.870 --> 04:13:55.880 align:start position:0%
ordinances help also limit the potential
 
04:13:59.189 --> 04:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
of violations to noise uh noise nuisance
 
04:14:01.830 --> 04:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
trash waste disposal Etc SE several
 
04:14:04.070 --> 04:14:04.080 align:start position:0%
other ordinances the goal is for smart
 
04:14:05.830 --> 04:14:05.840 align:start position:0%
development and reasonable development
 
04:14:07.830 --> 04:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
to try to limit conflict between
 
04:14:09.790 --> 04:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
Property Owners too and respect every
 
04:14:12.149 --> 04:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
property owner's rights um to be able to
 
04:14:14.670 --> 04:14:14.680 align:start position:0%
live peacefully in their community and
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any
 
04:14:18.710 --> 04:14:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
04:14:21.309 --> 04:14:21.319 align:start position:0%
representative miles thank Mr chair
 
04:14:22.990 --> 04:14:23.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:14:25.429 --> 04:14:25.439 align:start position:0%
question um
 
04:14:30.349 --> 04:14:30.359 align:start position:0%
so would you say that regardless of
 
04:14:32.149 --> 04:14:32.159 align:start position:0%
familial status
 
04:14:33.990 --> 04:14:34.000 align:start position:0%
relationships would you think it's
 
04:14:38.710 --> 04:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
reasonable that the the law might be two
 
04:14:41.830 --> 04:14:41.840 align:start position:0%
people per bedroom just no matter what
 
04:14:45.269 --> 04:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
the relationships are are would that be
 
04:14:48.670 --> 04:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
reasonable well so municipalities you'd
 
04:14:50.309 --> 04:14:50.319 align:start position:0%
run into major constitutional issues if
 
04:14:51.590 --> 04:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
you were trying to regulate the number
 
04:14:55.269 --> 04:14:55.279 align:start position:0%
of people in a dwelling You know despite
 
04:14:56.830 --> 04:14:56.840 align:start position:0%
family so if they're all related you
 
04:14:59.510 --> 04:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
know it can be kind of difficult to you
 
04:15:02.790 --> 04:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
know to try to disentangle um trying to
 
04:15:04.830 --> 04:15:04.840 align:start position:0%
regulate you know families versus
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
unrelated people um we think for
 
04:15:10.389 --> 04:15:10.399 align:start position:0%
unrelated people I guess I should so we
 
04:15:13.229 --> 04:15:13.239 align:start position:0%
think for unrelated people um the
 
04:15:14.870 --> 04:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities and what we've seen and
 
04:15:16.030 --> 04:15:16.040 align:start position:0%
at least what I've seen in most of the
 
04:15:17.670 --> 04:15:17.680 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances is the trigger doesn't
 
04:15:20.309 --> 04:15:20.319 align:start position:0%
happen until um until you get to that
 
04:15:22.229 --> 04:15:22.239 align:start position:0%
four per four different parties
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
unrelated or four different groups
 
04:15:25.149 --> 04:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
unrelated when the fire code comes into
 
04:15:28.550 --> 04:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
place um and so part of the reason is
 
04:15:31.030 --> 04:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
because congregate living in a single
 
04:15:33.429 --> 04:15:33.439 align:start position:0%
family residential zone is much
 
04:15:34.870 --> 04:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
different it's much different and it's
 
04:15:36.309 --> 04:15:36.319 align:start position:0%
higher density than what the Zone was
 
04:15:38.269 --> 04:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
originally designed for or even like a
 
04:15:41.229 --> 04:15:41.239 align:start position:0%
two family so um I guess I'm kind of
 
04:15:43.429 --> 04:15:43.439 align:start position:0%
confused by your question if you couldif
 
04:15:45.630 --> 04:15:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh I'll put it more simply is it
 
04:15:49.590 --> 04:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to have a minimum uh or is
 
04:15:52.109 --> 04:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
it unreasonable in any circumstance to
 
04:15:53.830 --> 04:15:53.840 align:start position:0%
have two people no matter what their
 
04:15:58.149 --> 04:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
relationship is per bedroom in a house
 
04:16:00.510 --> 04:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
three three bedrooms two people per
 
04:16:03.229 --> 04:16:03.239 align:start position:0%
bedroom is that
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to have an to come up to a
 
04:16:08.429 --> 04:16:08.439 align:start position:0%
total of six people per that particular
 
04:16:10.710 --> 04:16:10.720 align:start position:0%
house if there's three bedrooms six
 
04:16:13.389 --> 04:16:13.399 align:start position:0%
unrelated people like why is that a
 
04:16:15.349 --> 04:16:15.359 align:start position:0%
problem it would it would depend on the
 
04:16:17.309 --> 04:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
specific zoning district and the
 
04:16:18.910 --> 04:16:18.920 align:start position:0%
specific municipality whether or not
 
04:16:20.229 --> 04:16:20.239 align:start position:0%
that's an issue and that's why it's best
 
04:16:24.030 --> 04:16:24.040 align:start position:0%
to leave it as a local decision
 
04:16:25.670 --> 04:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
something that the municipality has
 
04:16:27.710 --> 04:16:27.720 align:start position:0%
control over because you're right there
 
04:16:29.109 --> 04:16:29.119 align:start position:0%
could be in a situation where you have a
 
04:16:30.429 --> 04:16:30.439 align:start position:0%
you know someone gets a variance to do
 
04:16:32.830 --> 04:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
conget living in a multif family um
 
04:16:34.910 --> 04:16:34.920 align:start position:0%
zoning District where they have all the
 
04:16:36.630 --> 04:16:36.640 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and all the parking
 
04:16:39.070 --> 04:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
Arrangements necessary to facilitate
 
04:16:40.550 --> 04:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
having six people that could have up to
 
04:16:42.189 --> 04:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
six cars that they need to park and to
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
have the infrastructure
 
04:16:44.910 --> 04:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
the ability to do with the waste water
 
04:16:46.990 --> 04:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
but I know where I live in Wolf bro
 
04:16:48.510 --> 04:16:48.520 align:start position:0%
there are some zoning districts where
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
that just wouldn't be feasible it two
 
04:16:52.469 --> 04:16:52.479 align:start position:0%
people per bedroom in in a house that
 
04:16:53.550 --> 04:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
has three bedrooms that wouldn't be
 
04:16:56.229 --> 04:16:56.239 align:start position:0%
feasible yeah okay thank
 
04:16:58.750 --> 04:16:58.760 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
04:17:00.990 --> 04:17:01.000 align:start position:0%
buolo thank you Mr
 
04:17:02.750 --> 04:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for your
 
04:17:05.990 --> 04:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
testimony um previously on an unrelated
 
04:17:08.630 --> 04:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
bill I asked you about fair housing and
 
04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
if I recall your response was something
 
04:17:13.469 --> 04:17:13.479 align:start position:0%
like oh well that never happens and
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
I look at this current situation going
 
04:17:17.910 --> 04:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
on in this current bill and that thing
 
04:17:20.229 --> 04:17:20.239 align:start position:0%
that never happens looks like it's
 
04:17:22.790 --> 04:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
happening it looks like there is a town
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
that is discriminating based on familial
 
04:17:27.790 --> 04:17:27.800 align:start position:0%
status regardless of how the current you
 
04:17:29.590 --> 04:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire Supreme Court has
 
04:17:31.950 --> 04:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
ruled on ordinances like this there
 
04:17:33.910 --> 04:17:33.920 align:start position:0%
worth practices in the past such as red
 
04:17:35.870 --> 04:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
lining which at the time were legal but
 
04:17:38.550 --> 04:17:38.560 align:start position:0%
later on were found to be illegal so my
 
04:17:40.590 --> 04:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
question is does the New Hampshire
 
04:17:44.149 --> 04:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
Municipal Association support support
 
04:17:47.950 --> 04:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
discriminating in zoning no no we don't
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
we don't support um discrimination in
 
04:17:52.670 --> 04:17:52.680 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances it's illegal can I
 
04:17:55.309 --> 04:17:55.319 align:start position:0%
follow let finish I'd like to yeah I
 
04:17:57.469 --> 04:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate it Mr chairman thank you um
 
04:18:00.149 --> 04:18:00.159 align:start position:0%
look we're treating it doesn't matter
 
04:18:02.189 --> 04:18:02.199 align:start position:0%
the status of the person what matters is
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
that the change that there's a change of
 
04:18:06.149 --> 04:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
use of the dwelling that's the only
 
04:18:08.070 --> 04:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
thing from the municipality standpoint
 
04:18:10.429 --> 04:18:10.439 align:start position:0%
that it's regulating is what the usage
 
04:18:12.309 --> 04:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
is that's happening on that lot and with
 
04:18:14.870 --> 04:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
that build and so when you go from a
 
04:18:16.710 --> 04:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
regular dwelling unit and turn it into
 
04:18:19.590 --> 04:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
congregate housing it's much different
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
in the type of Housing and it needs to
 
04:18:22.950 --> 04:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
be regulated much differently depending
 
04:18:25.149 --> 04:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
on the zoning district and so it's not a
 
04:18:27.389 --> 04:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
discrimination against people it's
 
04:18:29.790 --> 04:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
treating different uses differently like
 
04:18:32.269 --> 04:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
we do in all of our zoning ordinances
 
04:18:33.790 --> 04:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so you know it's
 
04:18:37.309 --> 04:18:37.319 align:start position:0%
like treating a a two family um dwelling
 
04:18:39.670 --> 04:18:39.680 align:start position:0%
in a two family Zone differently than a
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
one family dwelling in a single
 
04:18:45.590 --> 04:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:48.389 --> 04:18:48.399 align:start position:0%
zone so let's do do a hypothetical then
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
talking about the different uses let's
 
04:18:54.149 --> 04:18:54.159 align:start position:0%
say all right you have a thin line go
 
04:18:56.189 --> 04:18:56.199 align:start position:0%
ahead okay I'm sorry let me ask maybe a
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
more in a more direct way if there's a
 
04:19:00.830 --> 04:19:00.840 align:start position:0%
if there is a home that has a single
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
bedroom and there are two people living
 
04:19:05.950 --> 04:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
in that home and there is another home
 
04:19:08.429 --> 04:19:08.439 align:start position:0%
with a single bedroom and two people
 
04:19:10.630 --> 04:19:10.640 align:start position:0%
living in that home how is the use
 
04:19:12.750 --> 04:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
different well you're not changing the
 
04:19:14.910 --> 04:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
the usage it sounds like in both cases
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:21.830 --> 04:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
use well the difference is is one of one
 
04:19:23.950 --> 04:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
of those homes is occupied by two
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
students who are unrelated and one of
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
those homes is occupied by people who
 
04:19:29.630 --> 04:19:29.640 align:start position:0%
happen to be legally married is the use
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
still different well because that's a
 
04:19:32.910 --> 04:19:32.920 align:start position:0%
residential use but we're talking about
 
04:19:34.309 --> 04:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
congregate living situations and
 
04:19:36.149 --> 04:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
congregate living is different than
 
04:19:38.469 --> 04:19:38.479 align:start position:0%
single family residential it's treated
 
04:19:40.070 --> 04:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
differently it's a different use and
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
additionally in DM's case it becomes a
 
04:19:44.030 --> 04:19:44.040 align:start position:0%
commercial once you're leasing It Out by
 
04:19:46.269 --> 04:19:46.279 align:start position:0%
bedroom so yeah it is it is a different
 
04:19:48.269 --> 04:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
use I know I had a long conversation for
 
04:19:50.269 --> 04:19:50.279 align:start position:0%
an hour with um some of the public
 
04:19:52.309 --> 04:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
health Advocates over at New Futures
 
04:19:53.469 --> 04:19:53.479 align:start position:0%
while we're trying to work through this
 
04:19:55.630 --> 04:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
recovery homes Bill to try to explain
 
04:19:57.349 --> 04:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
like the change of use isn't necessarily
 
04:20:00.269 --> 04:20:00.279 align:start position:0%
who's using it it's how it's being used
 
04:20:01.870 --> 04:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
so if you're using it as single family
 
04:20:03.910 --> 04:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
residential then the municipalities and
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
their zoning ordinances if that's Zone
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
if that zoning District permits it they
 
04:20:09.590 --> 04:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
don't have a problem the problem becomes
 
04:20:11.550 --> 04:20:11.560 align:start position:0%
once it starts to become you know you're
 
04:20:13.790 --> 04:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
packing a lot of people into congregate
 
04:20:15.710 --> 04:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
living into a lot of rooms and then you
 
04:20:18.070 --> 04:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
have larger issues that could impact the
 
04:20:20.030 --> 04:20:20.040 align:start position:0%
people living in the dwelling and those
 
04:20:21.790 --> 04:20:21.800 align:start position:0%
who are budding the dwelling and other
 
04:20:22.990 --> 04:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
people in the community too because of
 
04:20:24.990 --> 04:20:25.000 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure impact and services
 
04:20:28.309 --> 04:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
impact what if if we legalize polygamy
 
04:20:30.950 --> 04:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
and we say eight students could get
 
04:20:33.750 --> 04:20:33.760 align:start position:0%
married and live in one house that would
 
04:20:36.630 --> 04:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
that would be okay we'd run into well it
 
04:20:37.870 --> 04:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
would it wouldn't change the use because
 
04:20:39.870 --> 04:20:39.880 align:start position:0%
it's a single family
 
04:20:42.630 --> 04:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
right it's one family of eight people
 
04:20:44.910 --> 04:20:44.920 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting hypothetical uh no
 
04:20:45.710 --> 04:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm wondering what the
 
04:20:46.750 --> 04:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
difference if you bring forward that
 
04:20:48.070 --> 04:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
bill next year we'd have to raise some
 
04:20:49.790 --> 04:20:49.800 align:start position:0%
of the housing concerns that would be
 
04:20:52.389 --> 04:20:52.399 align:start position:0%
impacted by that but I'm just just
 
04:20:54.710 --> 04:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
trying to follow along no I I I see your
 
04:20:57.910 --> 04:20:57.920 align:start position:0%
point but like that's you know it's kind
 
04:21:00.149 --> 04:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
of that's so far out of the realm of
 
04:21:01.830 --> 04:21:01.840 align:start position:0%
conceivably what would ever happen in
 
04:21:03.149 --> 04:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
the state and what would be permitted
 
04:21:05.349 --> 04:21:05.359 align:start position:0%
and how our laws would be you know set
 
04:21:07.309 --> 04:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
up we're we're what we're trying to do
 
04:21:08.990 --> 04:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
is make sure that congrate living
 
04:21:11.109 --> 04:21:11.119 align:start position:0%
situations are in zones where they're
 
04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
permitted and that they're put in proper
 
04:21:14.429 --> 04:21:14.439 align:start position:0%
zones that have the infrastructure and
 
04:21:16.349 --> 04:21:16.359 align:start position:0%
the capacity to handle those congrate
 
04:21:18.149 --> 04:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
living situations the adequate parking
 
04:21:20.149 --> 04:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
the proper traffic patterns that
 
04:21:21.670 --> 04:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes they need to be near like
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
public transit has been mentioned so
 
04:21:25.510 --> 04:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
again we can't we don't want to treat
 
04:21:26.910 --> 04:21:26.920 align:start position:0%
congregate living the same as single
 
04:21:30.030 --> 04:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
family living I I see your point um but
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
I I think it's kind of a moot point
 
04:21:32.710 --> 04:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
because the legislature isn't going to I
 
04:21:34.910 --> 04:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
mean fingers crossed the legislature
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
won't be legalizing polygamy any time
 
04:21:39.269 --> 04:21:39.279 align:start position:0%
soon personal opinion of mine but you
 
04:21:41.590 --> 04:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
know we're just trying to figure out the
 
04:21:44.030 --> 04:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
best way to reasonably responsibly Zone
 
04:21:47.309 --> 04:21:47.319 align:start position:0%
communities that respect the landowner
 
04:21:49.109 --> 04:21:49.119 align:start position:0%
respect the occupants if it's not the
 
04:21:51.149 --> 04:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
landowner and that respects the abutters
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
in the entire Community that's that's
 
04:21:55.910 --> 04:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
the goal thank you representative
 
04:21:59.630 --> 04:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um I have a
 
04:22:01.870 --> 04:22:01.880 align:start position:0%
question and then a followup regarding
 
04:22:04.630 --> 04:22:04.640 align:start position:0%
congregated housing um were you
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
referring to the type of housing
 
04:22:10.630 --> 04:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
described in HB 432 that is recovery
 
04:22:12.670 --> 04:22:12.680 align:start position:0%
housing were you referring to that that
 
04:22:15.189 --> 04:22:15.199 align:start position:0%
type of housing as congregate housing
 
04:22:18.109 --> 04:22:18.119 align:start position:0%
and I should full disclosure here um I'm
 
04:22:19.990 --> 04:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor of HB
 
04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
432 were you describing that as concrete
 
04:22:25.630 --> 04:22:25.640 align:start position:0%
at housing in many zoning ordinances
 
04:22:29.070 --> 04:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
throughout the state recovery homes or
 
04:22:32.269 --> 04:22:32.279 align:start position:0%
recovery houses as defined in RSA 153
 
04:22:37.229 --> 04:22:37.239 align:start position:0%
col 10-d Roman 2 they fall under um
 
04:22:40.309 --> 04:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
congregate housing zoning ordinances
 
04:22:42.990 --> 04:22:43.000 align:start position:0%
typically are you aware that
 
04:22:45.790 --> 04:22:45.800 align:start position:0%
followup um that there is a federal
 
04:22:47.710 --> 04:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
definition of congregate housing and I
 
04:22:50.950 --> 04:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't have it memorized but it refers to
 
04:22:53.830 --> 04:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
much larger housing developments and not
 
04:22:57.870 --> 04:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
at all to the type of small group um
 
04:23:00.189 --> 04:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
housing for people with disabilities as
 
04:23:03.429 --> 04:23:03.439 align:start position:0%
is described in HB 432 it's a totally
 
04:23:07.429 --> 04:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
different animal um I was aware but it's
 
04:23:09.189 --> 04:23:09.199 align:start position:0%
based on like I'll give an example the
 
04:23:11.510 --> 04:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
example is the city of Kean city of keen
 
04:23:13.389 --> 04:23:13.399 align:start position:0%
has a congregate house in ordinance and
 
04:23:15.189 --> 04:23:15.199 align:start position:0%
then it defines all the different types
 
04:23:17.070 --> 04:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
of housing that fall under that Conger
 
04:23:18.550 --> 04:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
housing and they tend to be like
 
04:23:21.990 --> 04:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
fraternities sororities recovery houses
 
04:23:23.990 --> 04:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
um you know group living and so they
 
04:23:25.870 --> 04:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
make sure essentially it's like well if
 
04:23:27.309 --> 04:23:27.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to change the use we want
 
04:23:28.870 --> 04:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you have the adequate
 
04:23:30.830 --> 04:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to accompany the change
 
04:23:32.830 --> 04:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
of use to accompany the conget housing
 
04:23:35.189 --> 04:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
so then it's not a negative detriment to
 
04:23:36.590 --> 04:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
those who are Butters the rest of the
 
04:23:38.630 --> 04:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
community and so then people can safely
 
04:23:40.590 --> 04:23:40.600 align:start position:0%
live in them um so we are I know we have
 
04:23:41.990 --> 04:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
a work session tomorrow for your bill so
 
04:23:43.229 --> 04:23:43.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be talking about a lot of
 
04:23:44.830 --> 04:23:44.840 align:start position:0%
those things in regards to recovery
 
04:23:47.670 --> 04:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
housings but a lot of it is um let's um
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
let's keep it focused to the say a lot
 
04:23:50.590 --> 04:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
of that a lot of thank you
 
04:23:52.790 --> 04:23:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs you can talk to Mr
 
04:23:55.710 --> 04:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
Des about that later representative Reed
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:24:01.750 --> 04:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
my question um so to piggyback off the
 
04:24:03.590 --> 04:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
last question the federal definition of
 
04:24:05.710 --> 04:24:05.720 align:start position:0%
congregate housing is specifically low
 
04:24:07.950 --> 04:24:07.960 align:start position:0%
rent housing for people who need help
 
04:24:09.590 --> 04:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
with daily activities such as cooking
 
04:24:12.990 --> 04:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
and personal care so while conce
 
04:24:14.670 --> 04:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
um a recovery house might fall under
 
04:24:16.990 --> 04:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
that I don't think student housing does
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
and and this is getting to the point and
 
04:24:22.750 --> 04:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
the question that I keep trying to ask
 
04:24:25.670 --> 04:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
and I keep not hearing a real answer it
 
04:24:28.189 --> 04:24:28.199 align:start position:0%
sounds like congregate housing is now
 
04:24:30.950 --> 04:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
the veil under which we are
 
04:24:33.630 --> 04:24:33.640 align:start position:0%
discriminating against a entire group of
 
04:24:36.269 --> 04:24:36.279 align:start position:0%
people because we think they don't fit
 
04:24:38.870 --> 04:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
in because they have these problematic
 
04:24:41.910 --> 04:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
behaviors but we all know that the
 
04:24:43.630 --> 04:24:43.640 align:start position:0%
single family houses have the same
 
04:24:45.349 --> 04:24:45.359 align:start position:0%
behaviors the students there are plenty
 
04:24:48.910 --> 04:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
of students who study and are quiet so
 
04:24:53.109 --> 04:24:53.119 align:start position:0%
why isn't the op the the correct
 
04:24:55.550 --> 04:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
solution to Simply enforce your noise
 
04:24:57.510 --> 04:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
ordinances your garbage ordinances and
 
04:24:59.389 --> 04:24:59.399 align:start position:0%
not take an entire group of people and
 
04:25:01.670 --> 04:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
say they are the problem because we
 
04:25:04.630 --> 04:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
think we have a stigma that they engage
 
04:25:06.189 --> 04:25:06.199 align:start position:0%
in those types of behaviors more than
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
other people why isn't the noise
 
04:25:09.670 --> 04:25:09.680 align:start position:0%
ordinance and the garbage ordinance and
 
04:25:11.550 --> 04:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
all those things the solution to your
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
supposed problem instead of taking an
 
04:25:15.950 --> 04:25:15.960 align:start position:0%
entire class of people and treating them
 
04:25:18.389 --> 04:25:18.399 align:start position:0%
differently um I would say that
 
04:25:20.550 --> 04:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
congregate so first congregate housing
 
04:25:23.030 --> 04:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
as defined in the city of keen zoning
 
04:25:25.189 --> 04:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
ordinances is unrelated to the federal
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
definition that's just what they call
 
04:25:28.870 --> 04:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
congr housing those types of group
 
04:25:30.309 --> 04:25:30.319 align:start position:0%
living situations and there different
 
04:25:32.229 --> 04:25:32.239 align:start position:0%
types of housing that would fall under
 
04:25:34.790 --> 04:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
that so it's those are you know while
 
04:25:36.990 --> 04:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's the same term Conger housing it's
 
04:25:38.790 --> 04:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
two very different governments doing
 
04:25:41.030 --> 04:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
very different things without definition
 
04:25:44.149 --> 04:25:44.159 align:start position:0%
um my point isn't you know I'm not
 
04:25:46.269 --> 04:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
intimately aware of all the things that
 
04:25:48.070 --> 04:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
are happening in Durham where they're
 
04:25:50.389 --> 04:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
trying to enforce ordinances and the
 
04:25:52.269 --> 04:25:52.279 align:start position:0%
exact minutia of the different updates
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
they've made to their zoning ordinances
 
04:25:57.269 --> 04:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
what I'm speaking to is reasonable
 
04:25:59.590 --> 04:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
responsible development and making sure
 
04:26:00.830 --> 04:26:00.840 align:start position:0%
that when there's a change of use that
 
04:26:02.550 --> 04:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
communities have the tools to ensure
 
04:26:04.349 --> 04:26:04.359 align:start position:0%
that the proper infrastructure exists
 
04:26:05.790 --> 04:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
for that change of use the adequate
 
04:26:09.389 --> 04:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
parking spaces the proper um um uh
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
traffic pattern the waste disposal that
 
04:26:14.469 --> 04:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
those types of things can be included
 
04:26:16.349 --> 04:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
when they apply for the variance and so
 
04:26:18.189 --> 04:26:18.199 align:start position:0%
it's not against students because anyone
 
04:26:19.469 --> 04:26:19.479 align:start position:0%
could live in a congregate living
 
04:26:21.109 --> 04:26:21.119 align:start position:0%
situation this entire committee could
 
04:26:22.389 --> 04:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
decide it wants to live in a congregate
 
04:26:25.510 --> 04:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
living situation if it wants to you know
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
and you would have to go depending on
 
04:26:28.830 --> 04:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
where it is I know it would be an
 
04:26:31.109 --> 04:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
interesting house wouldn't it um but
 
04:26:33.189 --> 04:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
this you would have to go to your to
 
04:26:34.790 --> 04:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
your zoning board and apply for a
 
04:26:36.349 --> 04:26:36.359 align:start position:0%
variance if it was in an area that
 
04:26:39.269 --> 04:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
wasn't zoned for congregate living so I
 
04:26:40.790 --> 04:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
mean that's the thing it's not about
 
04:26:42.389 --> 04:26:42.399 align:start position:0%
students it's about congregate living as
 
04:26:43.429 --> 04:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
a whole and making sure that
 
04:26:45.469 --> 04:26:45.479 align:start position:0%
municipalities are ensuring that these
 
04:26:46.870 --> 04:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
types of uses are done in zoning
 
04:26:49.229 --> 04:26:49.239 align:start position:0%
districts where it's reasonable to the
 
04:26:50.830 --> 04:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
people living in them the people who own
 
04:26:55.550 --> 04:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.070 --> 04:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
whole then I'll give
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
up so I keep hearing I didn't hear an
 
04:27:02.750 --> 04:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
answer to why the enforcing the noise
 
04:27:04.750 --> 04:27:04.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances wasn't the solution but I'll
 
04:27:07.830 --> 04:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll move to on to this change of
 
04:27:10.790 --> 04:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
use concept and I'm really struggling to
 
04:27:13.189 --> 04:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
understand why you continually call
 
04:27:16.070 --> 04:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
congregate housing but we are saying
 
04:27:17.550 --> 04:27:17.560 align:start position:0%
that seems to be a totally different
 
04:27:19.269 --> 04:27:19.279 align:start position:0%
thing and I don't know K's not here with
 
04:27:22.870 --> 04:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
us today so I can't speak for Keen but
 
04:27:25.469 --> 04:27:25.479 align:start position:0%
this change of use people living in a
 
04:27:27.990 --> 04:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
house is a residential use all of this
 
04:27:30.429 --> 04:27:30.439 align:start position:0%
is residential it's not a change of use
 
04:27:33.309 --> 04:27:33.319 align:start position:0%
it's not so like it's literally it's not
 
04:27:35.469 --> 04:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
commercial right it's people who need to
 
04:27:38.189 --> 04:27:38.199 align:start position:0%
live and why is we're talking about
 
04:27:41.550 --> 04:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
these problematic behaviors right but
 
04:27:43.309 --> 04:27:43.319 align:start position:0%
the behavior that we're talking about
 
04:27:45.630 --> 04:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
here is living just living sleeping in a
 
04:27:49.149 --> 04:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
bedroom representative ask a
 
04:27:52.030 --> 04:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
question I think I we understand we
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
understand your I understand how is it a
 
04:27:56.269 --> 04:27:56.279 align:start position:0%
change of use if what we're not we're
 
04:27:57.830 --> 04:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
not talking about people who need
 
04:27:59.149 --> 04:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
assistance but we're talking about
 
04:28:01.469 --> 04:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
people sleeping in bedrooms and how is
 
04:28:03.990 --> 04:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
that going to help the situation with
 
04:28:05.750 --> 04:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
your with your Workforce housing when
 
04:28:07.389 --> 04:28:07.399 align:start position:0%
you're literally keeping people from
 
04:28:10.910 --> 04:28:10.920 align:start position:0%
accessing lower uh cost housing because
 
04:28:12.710 --> 04:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying that somehow living
 
04:28:14.189 --> 04:28:14.199 align:start position:0%
together where it's cheaper is a change
 
04:28:16.070 --> 04:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
of use when you're just living in a
 
04:28:18.309 --> 04:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
place okay so first let me address the
 
04:28:19.630 --> 04:28:19.640 align:start position:0%
first thing that you mentioned which is
 
04:28:22.189 --> 04:28:22.199 align:start position:0%
zoning and occupancy ordinances they
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
they exist to help limit the potential
 
04:28:26.950 --> 04:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
violations to no noise nuisance trash
 
04:28:29.070 --> 04:28:29.080 align:start position:0%
waste disposal etc those other
 
04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances and it's expensive to try to
 
04:28:32.349 --> 04:28:32.359 align:start position:0%
enforce all those ordinances so by
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
making sure that the zoning districts
 
04:28:36.830 --> 04:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
that the uses conform it's to limit
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
those things and it's to limit the
 
04:28:39.189 --> 04:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
impact on other property owners who are
 
04:28:40.790 --> 04:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
going to be the ones you know the ones
 
04:28:42.550 --> 04:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
who aren't living in the property that
 
04:28:43.990 --> 04:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
could be having these violations they're
 
04:28:45.550 --> 04:28:45.560 align:start position:0%
the ones who call and get upset and
 
04:28:47.670 --> 04:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
there's an expectation that their Town
 
04:28:49.590 --> 04:28:49.600 align:start position:0%
reacts to you know to their call and
 
04:28:51.189 --> 04:28:51.199 align:start position:0%
their request to enforce ordinances and
 
04:28:53.870 --> 04:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
that's expensive um the goal of zoning
 
04:28:55.309 --> 04:28:55.319 align:start position:0%
ordinances is to prevent those things
 
04:28:57.030 --> 04:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
from happening that is that and the
 
04:28:58.750 --> 04:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
health safety and that's where the
 
04:29:00.870 --> 04:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
general welfare part comes in now
 
04:29:03.189 --> 04:29:03.199 align:start position:0%
regarding change of use you could change
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
the use to commercial if you're leasing
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
it out the space um in most situations
 
04:29:08.149 --> 04:29:08.159 align:start position:0%
though the change of use is because
 
04:29:09.590 --> 04:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
you've gone from a single family
 
04:29:11.550 --> 04:29:11.560 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit where everything that you
 
04:29:13.670 --> 04:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
need in the dwelling unit the places
 
04:29:15.670 --> 04:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
where you sleep your waste disposal the
 
04:29:18.710 --> 04:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
kitchen bathrooms other amenities your
 
04:29:20.510 --> 04:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
waste disposal waste water and other
 
04:29:23.070 --> 04:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
waste that's all part of the unit right
 
04:29:24.910 --> 04:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
it's like you know so when you go to
 
04:29:26.349 --> 04:29:26.359 align:start position:0%
congregate living though there are
 
04:29:28.510 --> 04:29:28.520 align:start position:0%
shared communal spaces for using the
 
04:29:30.030 --> 04:29:30.040 align:start position:0%
bathroom there shared communal spaces
 
04:29:32.149 --> 04:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
for using the kitchen um it's like the
 
04:29:34.910 --> 04:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
difference between my house or someone's
 
04:29:37.750 --> 04:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
apartment in a college dorm and
 
04:29:39.910 --> 04:29:39.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities have an interest in
 
04:29:42.149 --> 04:29:42.159 align:start position:0%
regulating that congregate living
 
04:29:46.309 --> 04:29:46.319 align:start position:0%
differently than regular um Zone than
 
04:29:49.189 --> 04:29:49.199 align:start position:0%
regular dwelling units they're just very
 
04:29:52.550 --> 04:29:52.560 align:start position:0%
different um types of use yes they're
 
04:29:54.550 --> 04:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
both used in a way where people are
 
04:29:56.149 --> 04:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
living and sleeping and eating and
 
04:29:57.710 --> 04:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
breathing and hanging out and doing
 
04:30:00.429 --> 04:30:00.439 align:start position:0%
their thing studying going to work but
 
04:30:02.030 --> 04:30:02.040 align:start position:0%
the use is still different just by the
 
04:30:04.670 --> 04:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
very nature of How It's utilized and how
 
04:30:06.670 --> 04:30:06.680 align:start position:0%
The Residency operates and the types of
 
04:30:08.429 --> 04:30:08.439 align:start position:0%
people who are in those types of
 
04:30:10.429 --> 04:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
congrate living situations it's very
 
04:30:12.309 --> 04:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
it's very distinct okay okay we've been
 
04:30:13.469 --> 04:30:13.479 align:start position:0%
going an hour and a half on this I'm
 
04:30:15.229 --> 04:30:15.239 align:start position:0%
going to hope that if there's a question
 
04:30:17.469 --> 04:30:17.479 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been asked yet I will also
 
04:30:19.389 --> 04:30:19.399 align:start position:0%
behave but if there's a question that
 
04:30:20.830 --> 04:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
hasn't been asked yet feel free to ask
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
it I don't want to limit anybody but um
 
04:30:24.870 --> 04:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
let's be cognizant of time
 
04:30:26.630 --> 04:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
representative Axton go
 
04:30:29.830 --> 04:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
ahead I I I may have missed the answer
 
04:30:31.790 --> 04:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
to this question representative Reed
 
04:30:34.910 --> 04:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
asked you why do your existing
 
04:30:37.790 --> 04:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
ordinances on trash collection
 
04:30:40.950 --> 04:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance Etc why would they why do
 
04:30:43.149 --> 04:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
they not
 
04:30:46.269 --> 04:30:46.279 align:start position:0%
work on this type of
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
housing they work they work so they work
 
04:30:51.510 --> 04:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
to the best of their ability right so
 
04:30:53.429 --> 04:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
obviously if someone's VI I mean
 
04:30:55.790 --> 04:30:55.800 align:start position:0%
congrate housing creates the kind of
 
04:30:58.389 --> 04:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
environment sometimes where like any
 
04:31:00.109 --> 04:31:00.119 align:start position:0%
high density areas where there's just
 
04:31:02.510 --> 04:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
additional waste and there's additional
 
04:31:03.910 --> 04:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
um you know people living closer
 
04:31:05.710 --> 04:31:05.720 align:start position:0%
together so the noise impacts other
 
04:31:09.269 --> 04:31:09.279 align:start position:0%
people um more so the nature of it is
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
that there will be more calls and it
 
04:31:12.710 --> 04:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
will be more administra it will be more
 
04:31:15.269 --> 04:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
work for the municipality to be able to
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
enforce its zoning ordinances and
 
04:31:19.389 --> 04:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
sometimes there's an interest to not
 
04:31:21.950 --> 04:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
have coner housing in a single family um
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
residential Zone because one it's a
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
totally different type of use but two to
 
04:31:27.670 --> 04:31:27.680 align:start position:0%
limit the number of ordinance violations
 
04:31:29.030 --> 04:31:29.040 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to be going out to
 
04:31:30.910 --> 04:31:30.920 align:start position:0%
the same property getting the same calls
 
04:31:32.750 --> 04:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not just about students I
 
04:31:34.469 --> 04:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
really want to make that clear too it's
 
04:31:36.389 --> 04:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
about just the nature of the use being
 
04:31:37.870 --> 04:31:37.880 align:start position:0%
different and how it could impact the
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
number of calls and number of zoning or
 
04:31:41.469 --> 04:31:41.479 align:start position:0%
sorry not zoning ordinance number of
 
04:31:43.309 --> 04:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
ordinance violations for those types of
 
04:31:45.469 --> 04:31:45.479 align:start position:0%
things so um I hope that answers your
 
04:31:46.990 --> 04:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
question I I just think the type of
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
housing begets you know possibility of
 
04:31:52.149 --> 04:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
or increases the possibility of
 
04:31:55.229 --> 04:31:55.239 align:start position:0%
ordinances being violated so follow up
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
follow up so just so I'm clear what
 
04:31:59.070 --> 04:31:59.080 align:start position:0%
you're really saying what your answer
 
04:32:00.630 --> 04:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
boils down to if I understand you
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
correctly is that this is not a matter
 
04:32:06.510 --> 04:32:06.520 align:start position:0%
of it's not that your existing rules
 
04:32:08.670 --> 04:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
don't work it's that you'd have to
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
enforce them no it's that's not my
 
04:32:15.630 --> 04:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
answer my answer is that there would be
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
more cases of violation and more needing
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
to enforce them and that creates stress
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
and strain on
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities okay representative
 
04:32:28.229 --> 04:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you I'll try and be brief as
 
04:32:32.389 --> 04:32:32.399 align:start position:0%
I can um okay suppose I have a large
 
04:32:35.469 --> 04:32:35.479 align:start position:0%
four-bedroom house and I have a husband
 
04:32:37.389 --> 04:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
and six children that's eight people
 
04:32:39.429 --> 04:32:39.439 align:start position:0%
living in a four-bedroom house with one
 
04:32:41.870 --> 04:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
bathroom and one kitchen Shar and don't
 
04:32:43.229 --> 04:32:43.239 align:start position:0%
say that's impossible because that's how
 
04:32:45.990 --> 04:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
I grew up um low-income people have to
 
04:32:48.910 --> 04:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
live that way all the time y
 
04:32:52.590 --> 04:32:52.600 align:start position:0%
um okay then suppose I am a disabled
 
04:32:55.030 --> 04:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
person never mind recovery housing just
 
04:32:58.149 --> 04:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
any kind of disability and I want to
 
04:33:00.510 --> 04:33:00.520 align:start position:0%
live with seven other disabled people so
 
04:33:03.030 --> 04:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
we can help each other out in that same
 
04:33:05.470 --> 04:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
four bedroomroom house how is that a
 
04:33:09.949 --> 04:33:09.959 align:start position:0%
change of use because by having by
 
04:33:13.150 --> 04:33:13.160 align:start position:0%
having it exceed the amount of the
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
unrelated parties or the unre unrelated
 
04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
people who are living there you've now
 
04:33:19.750 --> 04:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
kind of kicked in where fire codes now
 
04:33:21.510 --> 04:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
come into play and municipalities have
 
04:33:22.869 --> 04:33:22.879 align:start position:0%
an interest in saying well that's a
 
04:33:25.029 --> 04:33:25.039 align:start position:0%
congre living situation now versus a
 
04:33:27.349 --> 04:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
single family uh residential dwelling
 
04:33:28.709 --> 04:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
and by the very nature as we kind of
 
04:33:30.949 --> 04:33:30.959 align:start position:0%
discuss unrelated people they behave
 
04:33:32.269 --> 04:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
differently especially depending on what
 
04:33:34.109 --> 04:33:34.119 align:start position:0%
their lease Agreements are and that has
 
04:33:36.590 --> 04:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
an impact on the neighborhoods and the
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
municipality and the zoning District um
 
04:33:40.429 --> 04:33:40.439 align:start position:0%
it would be I mean we'd be essentially
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
saying um with this bill that that
 
04:33:46.109 --> 04:33:46.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities have zero interest in in
 
04:33:48.230 --> 04:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
regulating um congregate living
 
04:33:51.990 --> 04:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
situations when very clearly there's
 
04:33:54.830 --> 04:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
a that's fine um when when they clearly
 
04:33:56.230 --> 04:33:56.240 align:start position:0%
do have an interest to promote the
 
04:33:57.789 --> 04:33:57.799 align:start position:0%
general welfare the safety and the
 
04:33:59.230 --> 04:33:59.240 align:start position:0%
health of
 
04:34:02.830 --> 04:34:02.840 align:start position:0%
folks but never mind follow followup
 
04:34:07.150 --> 04:34:07.160 align:start position:0%
thank you never mind um what you call it
 
04:34:09.551 --> 04:34:09.561 align:start position:0%
okay and for the moment let's not think
 
04:34:11.709 --> 04:34:11.719 align:start position:0%
about the fire code because remember the
 
04:34:14.709 --> 04:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
the number of people is the same M okay
 
04:34:16.390 --> 04:34:16.400 align:start position:0%
so if there's going to be a fire the
 
04:34:17.429 --> 04:34:17.439 align:start position:0%
number of people who are going to be
 
04:34:20.830 --> 04:34:20.840 align:start position:0%
burned down is the same mhm okay so for
 
04:34:23.470 --> 04:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
practical purposes regardless of what
 
04:34:26.429 --> 04:34:26.439 align:start position:0%
you call it okay whether you call it
 
04:34:29.990 --> 04:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
congr housing or whatever you call it
 
04:34:32.949 --> 04:34:32.959 align:start position:0%
how is that a change of
 
04:34:35.869 --> 04:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
use because it's no longer single family
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
residential it's now congregate like
 
04:34:39.910 --> 04:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
that's the very essence of what we're
 
04:34:41.230 --> 04:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
kind of discussing and like for example
 
04:34:41.240 --> 04:34:42.230 align:start position:0%
kind of discussing and like for example
congreg

04:34:42.230 --> 04:34:42.240 align:start position:0%
congreg
 
04:34:44.230 --> 04:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
comes with their because of the way it's
 
04:34:45.510 --> 04:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
used and because of the very nature of
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
it like for example your family I I can
 
04:34:49.949 --> 04:34:49.959 align:start position:0%
assume growing up didn't have a car for
 
04:34:51.629 --> 04:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
every single individual but in many
 
04:34:53.429 --> 04:34:53.439 align:start position:0%
congrate living situations it's ideal
 
04:34:55.070 --> 04:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
for people to each have a car because
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
they're not all working at the same
 
04:34:57.949 --> 04:34:57.959 align:start position:0%
place and it's not always feasible for
 
04:35:00.310 --> 04:35:00.320 align:start position:0%
them to all carpool together so just by
 
04:35:01.429 --> 04:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
that very nature if someone were to
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
change your single family dwelling um
 
04:35:06.830 --> 04:35:06.840 align:start position:0%
unit to a congrate living situation A a
 
04:35:08.709 --> 04:35:08.719 align:start position:0%
um zba a zoning Board of adjustment
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
might say well you need to make sure you
 
04:35:11.910 --> 04:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
increase your parking capacity you might
 
04:35:13.629 --> 04:35:13.639 align:start position:0%
need to build a parking lot and oh yeah
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
you need to make sure it meets the
 
04:35:16.830 --> 04:35:16.840 align:start position:0%
current traffic patterns it's just it's
 
04:35:19.109 --> 04:35:19.119 align:start position:0%
it becomes so much different than just
 
04:35:21.310 --> 04:35:21.320 align:start position:0%
if I have a kid tomorrow right or if I
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
have 10 kids tomorrow that I decide to
 
04:35:24.709 --> 04:35:24.719 align:start position:0%
adopt me and my wife aren going to have
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
more than two cars we're still going to
 
04:35:27.869 --> 04:35:27.879 align:start position:0%
have two cars in our single family
 
04:35:30.230 --> 04:35:30.240 align:start position:0%
residential home in our village district
 
04:35:32.390 --> 04:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
is zoned in a way where I have two
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
parking spots that are on my property
 
04:35:37.109 --> 04:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
for me and probably run into an issue in
 
04:35:38.150 --> 04:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
the future where I need to get a third
 
04:35:39.910 --> 04:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
or a fourth car for kids if I had 10 of
 
04:35:42.150 --> 04:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
them but still the municip ipal is going
 
04:35:43.310 --> 04:35:43.320 align:start position:0%
to say well you can't park on the side
 
04:35:45.910 --> 04:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
of the road and so just just things like
 
04:35:47.990 --> 04:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
that this bill doesn't consider and it
 
04:35:49.830 --> 04:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
takes a tool away from municipalities to
 
04:35:52.590 --> 04:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
be able to have reasonable zoning
 
04:35:55.470 --> 04:35:55.480 align:start position:0%
regulations that help everyone coexist
 
04:35:58.310 --> 04:35:58.320 align:start position:0%
in a community uh further very brief
 
04:36:04.029 --> 04:36:04.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:07.750 --> 04:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
um but isn't that your assumption of how
 
04:36:09.990 --> 04:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
people are going to act I mean is that
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
based on any kind of a study or any kind
 
04:36:15.070 --> 04:36:15.080 align:start position:0%
of demographic information we I've heard
 
04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of assumptions about how people
 
04:36:19.949 --> 04:36:19.959 align:start position:0%
act and how different kinds of people
 
04:36:23.910 --> 04:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
act and I'm not sure how much um basis
 
04:36:27.269 --> 04:36:27.279 align:start position:0%
it has I think by the very by the very
 
04:36:29.070 --> 04:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
fact that these zoning ordinances exist
 
04:36:31.470 --> 04:36:31.480 align:start position:0%
is because of real world problems that
 
04:36:32.949 --> 04:36:32.959 align:start position:0%
happened in the municipalities where
 
04:36:34.150 --> 04:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
they said we need to find a way to
 
04:36:36.070 --> 04:36:36.080 align:start position:0%
regulate this so we can balance the
 
04:36:37.470 --> 04:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
needs of those who are trying to live in
 
04:36:39.670 --> 04:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
the style of Housing and the needs of
 
04:36:40.750 --> 04:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
those in the community and the
 
04:36:42.349 --> 04:36:42.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure Capac capity that exists
 
04:36:44.670 --> 04:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
in that community so um I have heard of
 
04:36:46.390 --> 04:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
real world examples in our cities and I
 
04:36:48.109 --> 04:36:48.119 align:start position:0%
think Durham brought up some some real
 
04:36:50.310 --> 04:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
world examples of how Conger housing is
 
04:36:52.390 --> 04:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
just different in nature than the
 
04:36:54.830 --> 04:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
residential use um committee members are
 
04:36:56.629 --> 04:36:56.639 align:start position:0%
more than fine to disagree with this I'm
 
04:36:58.269 --> 04:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
just representing our municipalities and
 
04:37:00.349 --> 04:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
what they've told me and what they have
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
me share with you um to the best of my
 
04:37:05.150 --> 04:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
ability so I think he's answered he's
 
04:37:07.789 --> 04:37:07.799 align:start position:0%
answered it as best as he can thank you
 
04:37:07.799 --> 04:37:10.029 align:start position:0%
answered it as best as he can thank you
representative

04:37:10.029 --> 04:37:10.039 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:37:12.109 --> 04:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
reinford thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so who is it that
 
04:37:17.590 --> 04:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
is enforcing this by door knocking to
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
see if representative Alexander married
 
04:37:22.429 --> 04:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
eight of his roommates or representative
 
04:37:25.150 --> 04:37:25.160 align:start position:0%
Gibbs um changed the people that are
 
04:37:26.590 --> 04:37:26.600 align:start position:0%
living with her to the disability
 
04:37:28.670 --> 04:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
Community or that the students actually
 
04:37:31.551 --> 04:37:31.561 align:start position:0%
have another College um student move in
 
04:37:33.070 --> 04:37:33.080 align:start position:0%
who's actually doing the door knocking
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
to enforce this um well it's not like
 
04:37:37.789 --> 04:37:37.799 align:start position:0%
they're going around and knocking on
 
04:37:39.310 --> 04:37:39.320 align:start position:0%
every single door so I don't want people
 
04:37:41.869 --> 04:37:41.879 align:start position:0%
to think that municipalities are basic
 
04:37:44.349 --> 04:37:44.359 align:start position:0%
like hey you know like your ra like hey
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
you know dorm check how many people are
 
04:37:48.070 --> 04:37:48.080 align:start position:0%
in your dorm tonight you know it's past
 
04:37:49.830 --> 04:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
quiet hours like that's not happening
 
04:37:51.590 --> 04:37:51.600 align:start position:0%
but you know they get calls from people
 
04:37:53.429 --> 04:37:53.439 align:start position:0%
that say hey there's like eight people
 
04:37:54.990 --> 04:37:55.000 align:start position:0%
living in the single family residence n
 
04:37:56.510 --> 04:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
of them seem related and they're parking
 
04:37:57.551 --> 04:37:57.561 align:start position:0%
all over the street and they're parking
 
04:37:58.990 --> 04:37:59.000 align:start position:0%
in front of my house or maybe they're
 
04:38:00.869 --> 04:38:00.879 align:start position:0%
parking my driveway so you know a code
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer or someone from the
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
fire department or someone from the
 
04:38:05.910 --> 04:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
planning department might go out and be
 
04:38:07.789 --> 04:38:07.799 align:start position:0%
like hey how many people are living in
 
04:38:09.551 --> 04:38:09.561 align:start position:0%
this residence who are unrelated and
 
04:38:12.310 --> 04:38:12.320 align:start position:0%
then they might say oh it ceeds what's
 
04:38:14.590 --> 04:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
required in this um in this residential
 
04:38:15.830 --> 04:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
district or it might you know be in
 
04:38:17.709 --> 04:38:17.719 align:start position:0%
violation of fire code and then they
 
04:38:19.709 --> 04:38:19.719 align:start position:0%
have to work with the property owner and
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
those who are you know inhabiting the
 
04:38:23.189 --> 04:38:23.199 align:start position:0%
dwelling um to figure out how to get
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
them in compliance and it's supposed to
 
04:38:28.269 --> 04:38:28.279 align:start position:0%
be a collaborative process followup okay
 
04:38:31.429 --> 04:38:31.439 align:start position:0%
um so basically what you're saying um or
 
04:38:33.269 --> 04:38:33.279 align:start position:0%
are is what you're saying that basically
 
04:38:36.349 --> 04:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers are are paying for their own
 
04:38:38.789 --> 04:38:38.799 align:start position:0%
discrimination against their own people
 
04:38:40.470 --> 04:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
no T because there is no discrimination
 
04:38:41.830 --> 04:38:41.840 align:start position:0%
that's happening it's just just change
 
04:38:44.590 --> 04:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
of use so the taxpayers are not funding
 
04:38:47.150 --> 04:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
any discrimination the taxpayers are
 
04:38:50.070 --> 04:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
funding um the enforcement of the voter
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
adopted zoning ordinances and respecting
 
04:38:54.310 --> 04:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
the will of the voters the same voters
 
04:38:56.590 --> 04:38:56.600 align:start position:0%
who pay taxes so thank you so that would
 
04:38:59.109 --> 04:38:59.119 align:start position:0%
not be my interpretation I'm sorry
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative representative miles
 
04:39:04.230 --> 04:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm just want would you
 
04:39:09.429 --> 04:39:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:12.269 --> 04:39:12.279 align:start position:0%
would I'm wondering if there's any
 
04:39:15.470 --> 04:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
property owners in the zoning areas that
 
04:39:16.990 --> 04:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
are you
 
04:39:19.189 --> 04:39:19.199 align:start position:0%
know we're talking about today in this
 
04:39:21.551 --> 04:39:21.561 align:start position:0%
bill I wonder if any of those Property
 
04:39:24.310 --> 04:39:24.320 align:start position:0%
Owners feel like this is an infringement
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
on their property
 
04:39:29.789 --> 04:39:29.799 align:start position:0%
rights um I would personally believe
 
04:39:31.349 --> 04:39:31.359 align:start position:0%
that they would go and vote for the
 
04:39:33.429 --> 04:39:33.439 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances that they support to
 
04:39:35.230 --> 04:39:35.240 align:start position:0%
allow permitted uses whether it's in
 
04:39:37.189 --> 04:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
their zones or others that the community
 
04:39:39.030 --> 04:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
feels is most appropriate for making
 
04:39:42.470 --> 04:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
sure that People's Health safety General
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
Welfare um and the balance of you know
 
04:39:48.030 --> 04:39:48.040 align:start position:0%
private property ownership rights and um
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
and Municipal um requirements to help
 
04:39:53.190 --> 04:39:53.200 align:start position:0%
promote General Welfare so I think
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
that's I think voting is the best way in
 
04:39:56.990 --> 04:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with this and I think local
 
04:39:59.190 --> 04:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
control is the best way to allow for
 
04:40:01.628 --> 04:40:01.638 align:start position:0%
local go sorry local public bodies the
 
04:40:03.990 --> 04:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
legislative bodies to decide what kinds
 
04:40:05.708 --> 04:40:05.718 align:start position:0%
of powers and what kinds of regulations
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
their municipality is going to have to
 
04:40:09.110 --> 04:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
deal with these types of
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
situations representative Reed thank
 
04:40:12.990 --> 04:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I really appreciate
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
it thank you for taking my question
 
04:40:16.350 --> 04:40:16.360 align:start position:0%
again so what I've heard is that the
 
04:40:17.990 --> 04:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
reason that the ordinances around noise
 
04:40:19.990 --> 04:40:20.000 align:start position:0%
and garbage are not the solution to the
 
04:40:22.230 --> 04:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
problem is because it's expensive to do
 
04:40:25.110 --> 04:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
the enforcement so my question is do you
 
04:40:27.750 --> 04:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
believe that a university brings in lots
 
04:40:30.350 --> 04:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
of business into a community that the
 
04:40:32.390 --> 04:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
students patronize the local businesses
 
04:40:34.350 --> 04:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
and entire businesses and districts of
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
businesses pop up around the university
 
04:40:39.310 --> 04:40:39.320 align:start position:0%
bringing in Revenue to that town and if
 
04:40:42.190 --> 04:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
you do believe that as I do why isn't
 
04:40:44.510 --> 04:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
the increased cost of of enforcement the
 
04:40:46.628 --> 04:40:46.638 align:start position:0%
fair trade-off for that community that
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
gets a benefit from that University well
 
04:40:51.270 --> 04:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
as I've previously mentioned the zoning
 
04:40:53.230 --> 04:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
ordinances that exists that when
 
04:40:55.550 --> 04:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
enforced and when abided by they're
 
04:40:57.110 --> 04:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
supposed to limit all those things so
 
04:40:59.910 --> 04:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
then that investment can be made towards
 
04:41:01.070 --> 04:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
other things that are important in the
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
community and growing the general
 
04:41:04.270 --> 04:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
welfare like for example education I
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean you don't want to be funneling all
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
year and remember it's property taxes so
 
04:41:08.670 --> 04:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
just because a lot of college students
 
04:41:10.510 --> 04:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
are going to a bar a lot of that bar
 
04:41:12.430 --> 04:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue the business tax revenue all of
 
04:41:14.230 --> 04:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
it actually goes to the state it's just
 
04:41:16.430 --> 04:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
the property taxes that assess value it
 
04:41:18.190 --> 04:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
does change with the real estate market
 
04:41:20.070 --> 04:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not like all of a sudden
 
04:41:21.750 --> 04:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
because a business is highly frequented
 
04:41:24.230 --> 04:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
by any population of people that that
 
04:41:25.910 --> 04:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
means that you know all of a sudden
 
04:41:27.550 --> 04:41:27.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to pay more
 
04:41:30.350 --> 04:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes um so the reality is is
 
04:41:32.550 --> 04:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
that these towns are squeezed they have
 
04:41:34.270 --> 04:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
very tight budgets they're working their
 
04:41:36.430 --> 04:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
hardest to enforce existing ordinances
 
04:41:38.788 --> 04:41:38.798 align:start position:0%
and zoning ordinances exist as a way to
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
prevent these neighborly conflicts and
 
04:41:42.470 --> 04:41:42.480 align:start position:0%
to prevent these these um ordinance
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
violations and so they're trying their
 
04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
hardest to enforce them with the
 
04:41:47.470 --> 04:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
resources that they have and the zoning
 
04:41:49.830 --> 04:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
ordinances exist and the reason why the
 
04:41:51.788 --> 04:41:51.798 align:start position:0%
state law permits municipalities to have
 
04:41:53.310 --> 04:41:53.320 align:start position:0%
these zoning ordinances is to make it so
 
04:41:55.470 --> 04:41:55.480 align:start position:0%
that these other ordinances aren't
 
04:41:56.910 --> 04:41:56.920 align:start position:0%
constantly being violated because
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
there're people who are just in
 
04:42:00.990 --> 04:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
disagreement over you know even things
 
04:42:03.670 --> 04:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
like parking parking is such a big thing
 
04:42:05.470 --> 04:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
that in high density communities or high
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
population communities gets people
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
really really at each other so you know
 
04:42:12.948 --> 04:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
just making there's adequate parking is
 
04:42:15.110 --> 04:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
than you thank you for testifying on the
 
04:42:16.590 --> 04:42:16.600 align:start position:0%
bill regarding parking we're going to
 
04:42:19.590 --> 04:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
keep it to the well just thank you I
 
04:42:23.270 --> 04:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate it all right seeing no other
 
04:42:24.750 --> 04:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
04:42:32.310 --> 04:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:35.550 --> 04:42:35.560 align:start position:0%
Sasso and I just um am reminded that to
 
04:42:38.310 --> 04:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
stay within three minutes if
 
04:42:40.670 --> 04:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
possible good afternoon honorable
 
04:42:40.680 --> 04:42:43.230 align:start position:0%
possible good afternoon honorable
members

04:42:43.230 --> 04:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:44.990 --> 04:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
sorry good afternoon honorable committee
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
members my name is Patrick Sasso I am
 
04:42:49.070 --> 04:42:49.080 align:start position:0%
currently a sophomore at the University
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire I am here today in
 
04:42:54.070 --> 04:42:54.080 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
457 um sorry so what's sorry I'm here to
 
04:42:59.470 --> 04:42:59.480 align:start position:0%
talk about something that's affecting
 
04:43:01.708 --> 04:43:01.718 align:start position:0%
the students and Durham which is uh zon
 
04:43:03.670 --> 04:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
and laws keeping rent rental prices
 
04:43:06.070 --> 04:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
artificially high rent prices are out of
 
04:43:08.070 --> 04:43:08.080 align:start position:0%
control and they average around
 
04:43:11.190 --> 04:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
$2,925 a month which is about 50% higher
 
04:43:13.230 --> 04:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
than the national average this is
 
04:43:14.948 --> 04:43:14.958 align:start position:0%
because of the student discrimination
 
04:43:16.708 --> 04:43:16.718 align:start position:0%
laws that allow only three unrelated
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
people to live together in Durham House
 
04:43:22.350 --> 04:43:22.360 align:start position:0%
Bill 457 is a simple fix it gets rid of
 
04:43:24.830 --> 04:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
these outdated rules and lets landlords
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
and tenants make their own decisions
 
04:43:29.150 --> 04:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
about housing instead of the government
 
04:43:31.470 --> 04:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
deciding who can live where it will make
 
04:43:33.430 --> 04:43:33.440 align:start position:0%
housing more affordable help students
 
04:43:34.788 --> 04:43:34.798 align:start position:0%
and give young professionals more
 
04:43:36.788 --> 04:43:36.798 align:start position:0%
options in a market that desperately
 
04:43:39.550 --> 04:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
needs it but instead of supporting this
 
04:43:41.990 --> 04:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
much-needed change the Durham Town
 
04:43:43.510 --> 04:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
Council is fighting to preserve
 
04:43:45.868 --> 04:43:45.878 align:start position:0%
traditional neighborhoods this forces
 
04:43:47.470 --> 04:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
the assumption that students aren't a
 
04:43:50.190 --> 04:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
part of the community of Durham we live
 
04:43:51.750 --> 04:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
work and contribute to this town just
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%

affordable housing and recognize that
 
04:44:04.230 --> 04:44:04.240 align:start position:0%
students just like everyone else deserve

a place to live thank you thank you for
 
04:44:07.830 --> 04:44:07.840 align:start position:0%

04:44:33.910 --> 04:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
as lease agreements I am legally an
 
04:44:36.708 --> 04:44:36.718 align:start position:0%
adult I am 20 years old and I believe

botin welcome thank you good afternoon
 
04:44:59.270 --> 04:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members my name is
 
04:45:01.350 --> 04:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
Elliot boen and I'm here before you as a
 
04:45:04.510 --> 04:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
UNH student and I'm here to advocate for
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
House Bill 457 a bill that is essential
 
04:45:09.868 --> 04:45:09.878 align:start position:0%
to restoring fairness and affordability
 
04:45:12.510 --> 04:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
to D students housing market I want to
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
share the story of my friend Mark
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
riggers a sophomore at the University of
 
04:45:18.270 --> 04:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire who like many students was
 
04:45:20.590 --> 04:45:20.600 align:start position:0%
blocked from securing off-campus housing
 
04:45:22.110 --> 04:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
last year to Durham's outdated
 
04:45:24.948 --> 04:45:24.958 align:start position:0%
discriminatory zoning laws marking a
 
04:45:26.628 --> 04:45:26.638 align:start position:0%
group of friends out early to find
 
04:45:28.470 --> 04:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
private housing for their junior year
 
04:45:30.190 --> 04:45:30.200 align:start position:0%
they planned they budgeted they searched
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
through every available listing
 
04:45:33.628 --> 04:45:33.638 align:start position:0%
eventually they found a house that
 
04:45:35.430 --> 04:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
seemed like the perfect fit for bedroom
 
04:45:37.030 --> 04:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
home close to campus within their
 
04:45:39.470 --> 04:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
financial means but when they went to
 
04:45:41.430 --> 04:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
close the deal the landlord said they
 
04:45:43.510 --> 04:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
could only rent to three students due to
 
04:45:47.270 --> 04:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
DM's three unrelated rule under this law
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
no more than three unrelated well we
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
know all that either one
 
04:45:54.110 --> 04:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
person the group had to face an
 
04:45:56.750 --> 04:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
impossible choice either one person had
 
04:45:58.550 --> 04:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
to drop out and find another group last
 
04:46:00.750 --> 04:46:00.760 align:start position:0%
minute or they had to give up the house
 
04:46:03.590 --> 04:46:03.600 align:start position:0%
altogether for Mark this rule made
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
housing unaffordable splitting rent
 
04:46:07.470 --> 04:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
fourways was within his budget but
 
04:46:10.110 --> 04:46:10.120 align:start position:0%
dividing it by three made it impossible
 
04:46:11.948 --> 04:46:11.958 align:start position:0%
the extra cost forced him and his
 
04:46:13.270 --> 04:46:13.280 align:start position:0%
friends to abandon their search for
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
private housing and stay on campus with
 
04:46:19.190 --> 04:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
the combination of dorm uh dorm rent
 
04:46:21.510 --> 04:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
meal plans and parking permits often
 
04:46:23.788 --> 04:46:23.798 align:start position:0%
cost more than the off-campus housing
 
04:46:26.990 --> 04:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
itself Mark situation is not unique is
 
04:46:29.110 --> 04:46:29.120 align:start position:0%
happening to hundreds if not thousands
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
of students every year Durham zoning
 
04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
laws artificially restrict housing
 
04:46:36.150 --> 04:46:36.160 align:start position:0%
supply near campus driving up costs and
 
04:46:37.470 --> 04:46:37.480 align:start position:0%
making it harder for students to find
 
04:46:41.150 --> 04:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable living options as Jeffrey B L
 
04:46:42.670 --> 04:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
point out in his recent opad the
 
04:46:44.990 --> 04:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
economics of the rule are very clear if
 
04:46:46.868 --> 04:46:46.878 align:start position:0%
you restrict Supply but demand stands
 
04:46:50.030 --> 04:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
the same prices go up and more students
 
04:46:51.948 --> 04:46:51.958 align:start position:0%
are allowed to rent homes based on the
 
04:46:53.948 --> 04:46:53.958 align:start position:0%
number of bedrooms now arbitrary zoning
 
04:46:56.270 --> 04:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
rules rents would naturally decrease
 
04:46:58.310 --> 04:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
instead these restrictions benefit
 
04:46:59.830 --> 04:46:59.840 align:start position:0%
wealthy landlords and large
 
04:47:01.910 --> 04:47:01.920 align:start position:0%
institutional property owners who profit
 
04:47:04.270 --> 04:47:04.280 align:start position:0%
from keeping housing options limited
 
04:47:05.910 --> 04:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
durm officials argue that they're just
 
04:47:07.110 --> 04:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
trying to preserve the character of the
 
04:47:09.190 --> 04:47:09.200 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods like we've heard today but
 
04:47:11.030 --> 04:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
let's be honest it's not about
 
04:47:13.150 --> 04:47:13.160 align:start position:0%
complaints or safety the town has
 
04:47:15.990 --> 04:47:16.000 align:start position:0%
already has rules to handle these issues
 
04:47:17.390 --> 04:47:17.400 align:start position:0%
this is about pushing the students out
 
04:47:18.470 --> 04:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
making it hard for them to live
 
04:47:20.110 --> 04:47:20.120 align:start position:0%
affordably and making the housing market
 
04:47:22.628 --> 04:47:22.638 align:start position:0%
closed off to those who need it most is
 
04:47:24.670 --> 04:47:24.680 align:start position:0%
fundamentally unfair that forworking
 
04:47:26.868 --> 04:47:26.878 align:start position:0%
responsible adults cannot legally rent a
 
04:47:28.910 --> 04:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
four-bedroom home simply because they're
 
04:47:32.030 --> 04:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
students if this rule was applied to any
 
04:47:34.868 --> 04:47:34.878 align:start position:0%
other demographic young professionals
 
04:47:37.150 --> 04:47:37.160 align:start position:0%
relocated workers or military personnel
 
04:47:39.350 --> 04:47:39.360 align:start position:0%
there would be immediate blacklash this
 
04:47:42.670 --> 04:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
is why House Bill 457 must pass House
 
04:47:44.548 --> 04:47:44.558 align:start position:0%
Bill 457 would put an end to this
 
04:47:46.310 --> 04:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
discrimination and ensure that housing
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
laws were based on fairness non-
 
04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
outdated biases against students it
 
04:47:52.190 --> 04:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
would open up the market allowing
 
04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
students like Mark and other many others
 
04:47:55.750 --> 04:47:55.760 align:start position:0%
to opportunity to live where they can
 
04:47:57.830 --> 04:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
afford rather than being forced in
 
04:47:59.270 --> 04:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
financial hardship or staying in
 
04:48:01.708 --> 04:48:01.718 align:start position:0%
overpriced campus housing students are a
 
04:48:03.750 --> 04:48:03.760 align:start position:0%
part of the community we contribute to
 
04:48:06.070 --> 04:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
Durham's economy its culture and its
 
04:48:07.868 --> 04:48:07.878 align:start position:0%
future it's time for durm to stop
 
04:48:09.788 --> 04:48:09.798 align:start position:0%
treating students like Outsiders and
 
04:48:11.310 --> 04:48:11.320 align:start position:0%
start treating them like the residents
 
04:48:14.628 --> 04:48:14.638 align:start position:0%
they are passing House Bill 4557 isn't
 
04:48:16.708 --> 04:48:16.718 align:start position:0%
just about housing it's about fairness
 
04:48:18.350 --> 04:48:18.360 align:start position:0%
affordability and the right to live
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
where you can afford I urge you support
 
04:48:24.270 --> 04:48:24.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill 457 let's fix this thank you
 
04:48:26.190 --> 04:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
very much thank you Mr botin questions
 
04:48:27.868 --> 04:48:27.878 align:start position:0%
representative miles and represent Allen
 
04:48:30.190 --> 04:48:30.200 align:start position:0%
thank you um at the beginning can you
 
04:48:33.030 --> 04:48:33.040 align:start position:0%
just um clarify did you say that the
 
04:48:35.470 --> 04:48:35.480 align:start position:0%
property owner wanted to rent to the
 
04:48:38.030 --> 04:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
four but his property rights were
 
04:48:41.230 --> 04:48:41.240 align:start position:0%
infringed upon absolutely thank you
 
04:48:43.230 --> 04:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
it's a great question represent howand
 
04:48:46.310 --> 04:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
did so did you speak out uh when UNH
 
04:48:47.430 --> 04:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
then because you're talking about
 
04:48:50.390 --> 04:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
affordability but UNH then passed a
 
04:48:53.030 --> 04:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
requirement that made sophomores live on
 
04:48:56.230 --> 04:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
campus so did you speak out against UNH
 
04:48:58.270 --> 04:48:58.280 align:start position:0%
for the extra cost that it would impose
 
04:49:00.788 --> 04:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
upon students making it less affordable
 
04:49:04.788 --> 04:49:04.798 align:start position:0%
then I was not on campus at that point
 
04:49:07.390 --> 04:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
so I was able to do it follow but I
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
would have just to follow up so since
 
04:49:12.070 --> 04:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
you are on campus now now are you active
 
04:49:13.990 --> 04:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
in speaking out against UN about the
 
04:49:15.548 --> 04:49:15.558 align:start position:0%
increased requirement because it's
 
04:49:19.350 --> 04:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:23.310 --> 04:49:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:25.910 --> 04:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
yes well okay that comes back to the The
 
04:49:28.190 --> 04:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
Freshman sopore rule I believe in free
 
04:49:31.110 --> 04:49:31.120 align:start position:0%
market housing I believe in just ending
 
04:49:35.830 --> 04:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination policies based on just an
 
04:49:39.628 --> 04:49:39.638 align:start position:0%
arbitr relationship rule the the just
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that
 
04:49:43.628 --> 04:49:43.638 align:start position:0%
we're unrelated doesn't mean the
 
04:49:47.390 --> 04:49:47.400 align:start position:0%
requirements change for the house itself
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
if the the safeties there the fire
 
04:49:53.070 --> 04:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
safety is there there's like no reason
 
04:49:56.350 --> 04:49:56.360 align:start position:0%
if the landlord himself agrees to
 
04:50:00.590 --> 04:50:00.600 align:start position:0%
renting to that status people are
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
people other questions seeing on thank
 
04:50:05.030 --> 04:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
04:50:20.548 --> 04:50:20.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:22.548 --> 04:50:22.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
04:50:24.390 --> 04:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to testify
 
04:50:26.750 --> 04:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
here today my name is Sarah Scott and
 
04:50:28.350 --> 04:50:28.360 align:start position:0%
I'm with Americans for Prosperity here
 
04:50:30.470 --> 04:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire uh I'm here today to
 
04:50:33.510 --> 04:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
testify in support of House Bill 457
 
04:50:35.350 --> 04:50:35.360 align:start position:0%
which seeks to prohibit local zoning
 
04:50:37.070 --> 04:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
ordinances from limiting the number of
 
04:50:38.830 --> 04:50:38.840 align:start position:0%
occupants in a dwelling unit to fewer
 
04:50:40.670 --> 04:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
than two per bedroom and from
 
04:50:42.830 --> 04:50:42.840 align:start position:0%
restricting occupancy based on familial
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
status uh as was mentioned recently
 
04:50:47.670 --> 04:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
these regulations infringe upon Property
 
04:50:49.708 --> 04:50:49.718 align:start position:0%
Owners rights to utilize the property as
 
04:50:52.190 --> 04:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
they see fit and often lead to increased
 
04:50:54.150 --> 04:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
housing costs by artificially limiting
 
04:50:56.628 --> 04:50:56.638 align:start position:0%
housing availability by removing these
 
04:50:58.628 --> 04:50:58.638 align:start position:0%
constraints Property Owners will have
 
04:51:00.470 --> 04:51:00.480 align:start position:0%
greater freedom and the housing market
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
can better respond to the diverse needs
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
of our community New Hampshire faces a
 
04:51:06.868 --> 04:51:06.878 align:start position:0%
significant challenge in retaining young
 
04:51:08.990 --> 04:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
people many are leaving due to high
 
04:51:11.350 --> 04:51:11.360 align:start position:0%
housing costs and limited avail ility
 
04:51:14.430 --> 04:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
partly driven by restrictive zoning laws
 
04:51:16.030 --> 04:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
I grew up in New Hampshire and watched
 
04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
as many of my childhood friends and
 
04:51:19.270 --> 04:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
friends from college were forced to
 
04:51:21.750 --> 04:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
leave the state uh due to the high cost
 
04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
of housing this is something that my
 
04:51:26.868 --> 04:51:26.878 align:start position:0%
family is facing right now as uh one of
 
04:51:28.910 --> 04:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
my sisters who stayed in New Hampshire
 
04:51:30.750 --> 04:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
for college and planned to stay
 
04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
Hereafter is now looking at the housing
 
04:51:35.070 --> 04:51:35.080 align:start position:0%
market and realizing that even with a
 
04:51:37.788 --> 04:51:37.798 align:start position:0%
job she can't afford rent on her own um
 
04:51:39.948 --> 04:51:39.958 align:start position:0%
I think the days of having one roommate
 
04:51:42.430 --> 04:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
and being able to afford rent are over
 
04:51:44.270 --> 04:51:44.280 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of young people that
 
04:51:46.030 --> 04:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
are graduating and still looking for
 
04:51:49.070 --> 04:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
jobs or taking lower paying jobs that
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
are not able to afford rent by easing
 
04:51:54.708 --> 04:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
the restrictive regulations through HB
 
04:51:57.788 --> 04:51:57.798 align:start position:0%
457 we can increase housing options in
 
04:51:59.670 --> 04:51:59.680 align:start position:0%
affordability making our state more
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
attractive to Young professionals and
 
04:52:03.590 --> 04:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
college students and this not only helps
 
04:52:05.628 --> 04:52:05.638 align:start position:0%
retain our youth but stimulates economic
 
04:52:08.510 --> 04:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
growth and Community Vitality so we
 
04:52:10.548 --> 04:52:10.558 align:start position:0%
think this is a crucial step forward and
 
04:52:12.510 --> 04:52:12.520 align:start position:0%
and uh urge you to support this Bill
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your testimony
 
04:52:15.670 --> 04:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
questions for Miss
 
04:52:26.310 --> 04:52:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:28.430 --> 04:52:28.440 align:start position:0%
Hooper thank you Mr chair members of the
 
04:52:29.990 --> 04:52:30.000 align:start position:0%
committee again Samuel Hooper with the
 
04:52:31.948 --> 04:52:31.958 align:start position:0%
institute for justice um speaking in
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
support of this bill um I think I
 
04:52:36.350 --> 04:52:36.360 align:start position:0%
believe that the co-sponsor jokingly
 
04:52:37.868 --> 04:52:37.878 align:start position:0%
referred to the bill as the Frat House
 
04:52:39.548 --> 04:52:39.558 align:start position:0%
bill which um and obviously there is a
 
04:52:41.990 --> 04:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
strong student Veil but one could also
 
04:52:44.270 --> 04:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
call it I suppose the sitcom bill and we
 
04:52:45.750 --> 04:52:45.760 align:start position:0%
think of all our favorites you know
 
04:52:47.590 --> 04:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
friends Big Bang Theory How I Met Your
 
04:52:50.030 --> 04:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
Mother Golden Girls you know all of them
 
04:52:51.948 --> 04:52:51.958 align:start position:0%
you know perhaps idealized versions of
 
04:52:53.788 --> 04:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
American Life at certain times and all
 
04:52:55.350 --> 04:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
of them depicting people at different
 
04:52:57.628 --> 04:52:57.638 align:start position:0%
stages and phases of life you know
 
04:52:59.510 --> 04:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
utilizing housing as they see best
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
whether it's for companionship to save
 
04:53:03.310 --> 04:53:03.320 align:start position:0%
money to combat the loneliness epidemic
 
04:53:04.708 --> 04:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
you know things that were as relevant in
 
04:53:07.390 --> 04:53:07.400 align:start position:0%
the 1970s as they are now but a lot more
 
04:53:09.470 --> 04:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
now given the house prices are a lot
 
04:53:11.470 --> 04:53:11.480 align:start position:0%
more expensive um I wanted to talk just
 
04:53:13.150 --> 04:53:13.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit about the legal part of
 
04:53:15.868 --> 04:53:15.878 align:start position:0%
this because um I think the um the moral
 
04:53:17.430 --> 04:53:17.440 align:start position:0%
question the free market question and
 
04:53:18.868 --> 04:53:18.878 align:start position:0%
the housing crisis elements have all
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
been discussed quite a lot so I would
 
04:53:23.628 --> 04:53:23.638 align:start position:0%
just like to talk about um the fact that
 
04:53:25.430 --> 04:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
um you know legally restrictions on
 
04:53:27.030 --> 04:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
roommate Agreements are generally
 
04:53:29.548 --> 04:53:29.558 align:start position:0%
disfavored in the courts um it varies
 
04:53:31.590 --> 04:53:31.600 align:start position:0%
Circuit by Circuit in the ninth circuit
 
04:53:33.830 --> 04:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
though there was um quite a compelling
 
04:53:36.030 --> 04:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
um statement made in the case Fair
 
04:53:37.868 --> 04:53:37.878 align:start position:0%
Housing Council of San Fernando Valley
 
04:53:40.548 --> 04:53:40.558 align:start position:0%
versus roommate.com um where the court
 
04:53:42.230 --> 04:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
said the right of intimate Association
 
04:53:44.670 --> 04:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
isn't restricted exclusively to family
 
04:53:46.670 --> 04:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
and the roommate relationship easily
 
04:53:49.070 --> 04:53:49.080 align:start position:0%
qualifies um and while the Supreme Court
 
04:53:52.190 --> 04:53:52.200 align:start position:0%
has generally um um hasn't looked at the
 
04:53:53.868 --> 04:53:53.878 align:start position:0%
qu the question for a while but has in
 
04:53:55.910 --> 04:53:55.920 align:start position:0%
the past upheld restrictions on the man
 
04:53:57.708 --> 04:53:57.718 align:start position:0%
the number of unrelated people living
 
04:54:01.270 --> 04:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
together it has also um it has also
 
04:54:04.470 --> 04:54:04.480 align:start position:0%
cracked down on unduly um narrow
 
04:54:06.110 --> 04:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
definitions of what actually constitutes
 
04:54:08.350 --> 04:54:08.360 align:start position:0%
a family and I provided some citations
 
04:54:09.910 --> 04:54:09.920 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony that I'll submit
 
04:54:11.750 --> 04:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
to the committee as well generally
 
04:54:13.830 --> 04:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
speaking House Bill 457 is a good step
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
toward preserving and restoring property
 
04:54:17.990 --> 04:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
rights which we strongly support um and
 
04:54:19.830 --> 04:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
promoting free market Housing Solutions
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
avoiding the need for kind of more
 
04:54:23.830 --> 04:54:23.840 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed government intervention I
 
04:54:26.510 --> 04:54:26.520 align:start position:0%
did want to just reot one um piece of um
 
04:54:28.030 --> 04:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
testimony from a previous witness
 
04:54:29.548 --> 04:54:29.558 align:start position:0%
talking about the fact that if you have
 
04:54:31.310 --> 04:54:31.320 align:start position:0%
more density and you allow this kind of
 
04:54:33.350 --> 04:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
housing then it can increase the cost of
 
04:54:35.070 --> 04:54:35.080 align:start position:0%
providing services and I think you know
 
04:54:37.708 --> 04:54:37.718 align:start position:0%
waste collection and garbage collection
 
04:54:39.788 --> 04:54:39.798 align:start position:0%
was one thing that was discussed um in
 
04:54:39.798 --> 04:54:41.070 align:start position:0%
was one thing that was discussed um in
fact

04:54:41.070 --> 04:54:41.080 align:start position:0%
fact
 
04:54:42.830 --> 04:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
adding density can lower those costs
 
04:54:44.310 --> 04:54:44.320 align:start position:0%
because it tends to be more expensive
 
04:54:46.430 --> 04:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
and studies do bear this out to have to
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
spread all of your utilities whether
 
04:54:52.750 --> 04:54:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's sewage power uh telecoms um garbage
 
04:54:54.628 --> 04:54:54.638 align:start position:0%
collection over a wider area and that's
 
04:54:55.990 --> 04:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
what you're doing if you prevent people
 
04:54:57.948 --> 04:54:57.958 align:start position:0%
from being able to live where they want
 
04:55:00.708 --> 04:55:00.718 align:start position:0%
to live in walkable areas particularly
 
04:55:02.390 --> 04:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
students but not only students then
 
04:55:03.788 --> 04:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
you're forcing them to the periphery
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
where it then becomes necessary to have
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
more cars it creates more traffic and
 
04:55:09.670 --> 04:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
and involves more maintenance costs for
 
04:55:11.910 --> 04:55:11.920 align:start position:0%
all of the infrastru structure so um I
 
04:55:13.470 --> 04:55:13.480 align:start position:0%
think in the long run and in the short
 
04:55:14.548 --> 04:55:14.558 align:start position:0%
run as well actually it's more
 
04:55:17.990 --> 04:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial to allow through just basic
 
04:55:19.470 --> 04:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
property rights people to live where
 
04:55:20.750 --> 04:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
they want to live in the manner that
 
04:55:21.868 --> 04:55:21.878 align:start position:0%
best suits them where they're not
 
04:55:24.070 --> 04:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
causing a nuisance to anyone else so
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much again for the
 
04:55:26.750 --> 04:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to testify for the last time
 
04:55:28.230 --> 04:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
I will trouble you today but the
 
04:55:29.548 --> 04:55:29.558 align:start position:0%
institute for justice very strongly
 
04:55:31.788 --> 04:55:31.798 align:start position:0%
supports House Bill 457 and I'm happy to
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
take any questions thank you for your
 
04:55:35.190 --> 04:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
testimony questions from Mr
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%

back it's been a few week thank you for
 
04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
being back I haven't been here in I
 
04:55:48.670 --> 04:55:48.680 align:start position:0%
don't know a
 
04:55:51.548 --> 04:55:51.558 align:start position:0%
week um um I skip the introduction we're
 
04:55:53.830 --> 04:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
short on time I'm sure you know me well
 
04:55:56.708 --> 04:55:56.718 align:start position:0%
we're here to support this bill we think
 
04:56:01.190 --> 04:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
it would infringe property rights to not
 
04:56:05.310 --> 04:56:05.320 align:start position:0%
be able to rent to unrelated
 
04:56:08.110 --> 04:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
people uh just a couple points
 
04:56:10.910 --> 04:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I agree so much with people are
 
04:56:13.628 --> 04:56:13.638 align:start position:0%
people in today's world there's so many
 
04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
different ways that people live and
 
04:56:16.868 --> 04:56:16.878 align:start position:0%
Lifestyles they live and the types of
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
people that they are I see no reason we
 
04:56:23.110 --> 04:56:23.120 align:start position:0%
see no reason to restrict housing based
 
04:56:26.590 --> 04:56:26.600 align:start position:0%
on um familial status and whether people
 
04:56:29.670 --> 04:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
are related or not I like the example of
 
04:56:31.990 --> 04:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
you you have okay so it's okay now to
 
04:56:33.990 --> 04:56:34.000 align:start position:0%
have eight people in a four
 
04:56:36.910 --> 04:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
bedroom if they're each couple is
 
04:56:40.430 --> 04:56:40.440 align:start position:0%
married but it's not okay if they're not
 
04:56:41.948 --> 04:56:41.958 align:start position:0%
it just the whole thing just doesn't
 
04:56:46.510 --> 04:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
make sense um as property owners and
 
04:56:48.750 --> 04:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
housing providers sometimes we get
 
04:56:51.030 --> 04:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
people coming to us that we got a two
 
04:56:53.868 --> 04:56:53.878 align:start position:0%
bedroom available it's two
 
04:56:56.990 --> 04:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
couples adult couples and they might not
 
04:57:00.110 --> 04:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
be married but we see no reason why
 
04:57:03.628 --> 04:57:03.638 align:start position:0%
would we restrict that rental maybe
 
04:57:05.788 --> 04:57:05.798 align:start position:0%
they're together because they're trying
 
04:57:07.430 --> 04:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
to save costs it's
 
04:57:09.430 --> 04:57:09.440 align:start position:0%
expensive and that's one of the ways
 
04:57:11.310 --> 04:57:11.320 align:start position:0%
they can do it and maybe they've been
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
great friends for a long time I like
 
04:57:15.830 --> 04:57:15.840 align:start position:0%
some of the examples that that Gibbs uh
 
04:57:18.548 --> 04:57:18.558 align:start position:0%
as representative Gibbs gave of people
 
04:57:20.070 --> 04:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
living together in a supportive
 
04:57:22.430 --> 04:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
environment there just no reason to see
 
04:57:22.440 --> 04:57:23.670 align:start position:0%
environment there just no reason to see
these

04:57:23.670 --> 04:57:23.680 align:start position:0%
these
 
04:57:25.990 --> 04:57:26.000 align:start position:0%
restrictions um what else did I want to
 
04:57:29.590 --> 04:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
say quickly uh it's too much government
 
04:57:31.628 --> 04:57:31.638 align:start position:0%
inference don't you
 
04:57:35.230 --> 04:57:35.240 align:start position:0%
think government comes in to
 
04:57:37.830 --> 04:57:37.840 align:start position:0%
say you can't you can't stay here
 
04:57:39.390 --> 04:57:39.400 align:start position:0%
because we don't like your your
 
04:57:39.400 --> 04:57:41.190 align:start position:0%
because we don't like your your
lifestyle

04:57:41.190 --> 04:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
lifestyle
 
04:57:42.390 --> 04:57:42.400 align:start position:0%
your your
 
04:57:44.590 --> 04:57:44.600 align:start position:0%
relationship U there's way too many
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
there's many types of people and
 
04:57:49.350 --> 04:57:49.360 align:start position:0%
students come in all kind of variety
 
04:57:51.628 --> 04:57:51.638 align:start position:0%
right there's people that are quiet and
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
focused and and life will be around and
 
04:57:57.110 --> 04:57:57.120 align:start position:0%
and some that cause problems so yes I
 
04:58:00.190 --> 04:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
think we should have the the laws that
 
04:58:02.350 --> 04:58:02.360 align:start position:0%
already exist for trash and disturbance
 
04:58:05.070 --> 04:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
and so forth be enforced that's that's
 
04:58:05.080 --> 04:58:08.190 align:start position:0%
and so forth be enforced that's that's
the

04:58:08.190 --> 04:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:11.390 --> 04:58:11.400 align:start position:0%
solution um I
 
04:58:12.830 --> 04:58:12.840 align:start position:0%
I guess that's really all I want to say
 
04:58:15.910 --> 04:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
we're in support of the bill as written
 
04:58:18.510 --> 04:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
and um I'd be happy to take any
 
04:58:19.548 --> 04:58:19.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Norman
 
04:58:23.110 --> 04:58:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative Kerwin thank you chair um
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
I know that we're talking about um
 
04:58:27.590 --> 04:58:27.600 align:start position:0%
student housing in this bill but taking
 
04:58:29.750 --> 04:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
your philosophy would you then apply
 
04:58:33.230 --> 04:58:33.240 align:start position:0%
that to sober homes halfway houses um
 
04:58:35.230 --> 04:58:35.240 align:start position:0%
other group homes and boarding houses
 
04:58:38.310 --> 04:58:38.320 align:start position:0%
they're sort of I see no reason to have
 
04:58:41.190 --> 04:58:41.200 align:start position:0%
restrictions based on
 
04:58:44.310 --> 04:58:44.320 align:start position:0%
um familial first of all it it's got to
 
04:58:44.320 --> 04:58:45.110 align:start position:0%
um familial first of all it it's got to
be

04:58:45.110 --> 04:58:45.120 align:start position:0%
be
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
illegal it's discriminatory to say
 
04:58:50.788 --> 04:58:50.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to discriminate based on
 
04:58:54.150 --> 04:58:54.160 align:start position:0%
familial status based on
 
04:58:56.590 --> 04:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
relationship so yeah I think we all of
 
04:58:58.350 --> 04:58:58.360 align:start position:0%
the all of the possibilities should be
 
04:59:00.270 --> 04:59:00.280 align:start position:0%
open we should have all possibilities
 
04:59:03.590 --> 04:59:03.600 align:start position:0%
open especially now in this housing uh
 
04:59:06.430 --> 04:59:06.440 align:start position:0%
issue that we have you know why why
 
04:59:08.750 --> 04:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
tighten it up and make it more restrict
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
we need to loosen things get more
 
04:59:12.110 --> 04:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
housing options
 
04:59:14.150 --> 04:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
available certainly not government's
 
04:59:15.788 --> 04:59:15.798 align:start position:0%
business to put their nose in people's
 
04:59:15.798 --> 04:59:17.110 align:start position:0%
business to put their nose in people's
private

04:59:17.110 --> 04:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
private
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
lives thank you for the question any
 
04:59:23.070 --> 04:59:23.080 align:start position:0%
other questions seeing none thank you
 
04:59:24.390 --> 04:59:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else here to
 
04:59:26.470 --> 04:59:26.480 align:start position:0%
testify on HP

457 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:59:30.030 --> 04:59:30.040 align:start position:0%

04:59:37.590 --> 04:59:37.600 align:start position:0%
to recognize the prime sponsor
 
04:59:42.030 --> 04:59:42.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wade welcome
 
04:59:43.310 --> 04:59:43.320 align:start position:0%

04:59:44.470 --> 04:59:44.480 align:start position:0%

04:59:47.270 --> 04:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
with that's all right I know it's a
 
04:59:49.750 --> 04:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
boring one so I I don't know about that
 
04:59:53.070 --> 04:59:53.080 align:start position:0%
expect it but yeah we'll see all righty
 
04:59:55.030 --> 04:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
um well thank you very much everyone and
 
04:59:58.830 --> 04:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um so I'm uh Alice
 
05:00:02.670 --> 05:00:02.680 align:start position:0%
sued I represent do Ward 2 uh and
 
05:00:05.750 --> 05:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
straford County 15 and I'm the prime
 
05:00:07.390 --> 05:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor of this bill and here to
 
05:00:09.670 --> 05:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
introduce it today um so the goal of
 
05:00:12.190 --> 05:00:12.200 align:start position:0%
this bill is to take the existing
 
05:00:16.310 --> 05:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
Housing Opportunity Zone Program and um
 
05:00:18.628 --> 05:00:18.638 align:start position:0%
basically clarify a lot of existing
 
05:00:21.430 --> 05:00:21.440 align:start position:0%
language um that's pretty vague that's
 
05:00:24.510 --> 05:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
made it difficult to implement um and
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
make it more effective for
 
05:00:28.628 --> 05:00:28.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities to use as a tool to
 
05:00:30.590 --> 05:00:30.600 align:start position:0%
incentivize more affordable housing
 
05:00:34.150 --> 05:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
development in their communities um so
 
05:00:35.868 --> 05:00:35.878 align:start position:0%
overall the goal is just to improve this
 
05:00:39.150 --> 05:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
program for municipalities for landlords
 
05:00:40.708 --> 05:00:40.718 align:start position:0%
and for tenants
 
05:00:43.110 --> 05:00:43.120 align:start position:0%
uh to make it more adaptable um for
 
05:00:46.830 --> 05:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
different communities needs so uh this
 
05:00:51.110 --> 05:00:51.120 align:start position:0%
program is within RSA 79e and basically
 
05:00:54.430 --> 05:00:54.440 align:start position:0%
how it works is uh if you have a
 
05:00:58.868 --> 05:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
property um that falls under one of the
 
05:01:01.430 --> 05:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh requirements uh for this program so
 
05:01:04.230 --> 05:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
it might be renovating a historic
 
05:01:05.948 --> 05:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
property that's kind of fallen into
 
05:01:09.190 --> 05:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
disrepair or maybe it's improving a
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
property to make it get more flood
 
05:01:13.230 --> 05:01:13.240 align:start position:0%
resilience uh converting Office
 
05:01:16.310 --> 05:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
Buildings to residential space and um
 
05:01:17.868 --> 05:01:17.878 align:start position:0%
the particularly important one in this
 
05:01:23.230 --> 05:01:23.240 align:start position:0%
case is affordable housing um so if uh
 
05:01:25.708 --> 05:01:25.718 align:start position:0%
you are a developer you want to make
 
05:01:28.190 --> 05:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
more affordable housing if you apply for
 
05:01:31.590 --> 05:01:31.600 align:start position:0%
this program what you can do is you can
 
05:01:33.390 --> 05:01:33.400 align:start position:0%
designate a certain number of those
 
05:01:36.190 --> 05:01:36.200 align:start position:0%
units as affordable to somebody making
 
05:01:39.910 --> 05:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
80% or less of the area median income
 
05:01:42.150 --> 05:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
and if you do that and the municipality
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
grants your request then it will freeze
 
05:01:49.190 --> 05:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
your property value at the current rate
 
05:01:52.190 --> 05:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
uh and um basically the additional
 
05:01:54.350 --> 05:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
developments that you make will be
 
05:01:56.270 --> 05:01:56.280 align:start position:0%
frozen for a certain number of years
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
determined by the municipality so it's
 
05:02:02.270 --> 05:02:02.280 align:start position:0%
basically a tradeoff so um a
 
05:02:04.948 --> 05:02:04.958 align:start position:0%
municipality temporarily foros that
 
05:02:07.350 --> 05:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
additional tax revenue from the increase
 
05:02:11.390 --> 05:02:11.400 align:start position:0%
in property value as a off to develop
 
05:02:14.830 --> 05:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and to improve uh
 
05:02:18.350 --> 05:02:18.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure so uh yeah that's that's
 
05:02:21.190 --> 05:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
how the existing program works however
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
the language for the affordable housing
 
05:02:27.628 --> 05:02:27.638 align:start position:0%
section is very very open-ended so um
 
05:02:29.430 --> 05:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
all it says is that no less than
 
05:02:31.430 --> 05:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
onethird of the current H or of the
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
housing units constructed shall be
 
05:02:35.830 --> 05:02:35.840 align:start position:0%
designated for households with an income
 
05:02:39.390 --> 05:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
of 80% or less of the area Medan income
 
05:02:42.990 --> 05:02:43.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the whole thing um so it says
 
05:02:46.628 --> 05:02:46.638 align:start position:0%
nothing about what happens when somebody
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
starts making more than 80% uh how
 
05:02:52.390 --> 05:02:52.400 align:start position:0%
frequently do you verify income um of
 
05:02:55.830 --> 05:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
those tenants and all of those sort of
 
05:02:58.310 --> 05:02:58.320 align:start position:0%
um additional guidelines there's nothing
 
05:03:01.350 --> 05:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
about that anywhere at all um so that's
 
05:03:03.750 --> 05:03:03.760 align:start position:0%
left this program very open-ended for
 
05:03:06.910 --> 05:03:06.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities and uh I've been told
 
05:03:09.750 --> 05:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
personally by uh the do housing
 
05:03:11.628 --> 05:03:11.638 align:start position:0%
coordinator or the former do housing
 
05:03:14.590 --> 05:03:14.600 align:start position:0%
coordinator um that one of the reasons
 
05:03:16.628 --> 05:03:16.638 align:start position:0%
that do didn't adopt this is just
 
05:03:19.030 --> 05:03:19.040 align:start position:0%
because it's it's you can't you don't
 
05:03:21.670 --> 05:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
have any guidelines on how to actually
 
05:03:26.590 --> 05:03:26.600 align:start position:0%
implement this um so yeah this bill does
 
05:03:28.750 --> 05:03:28.760 align:start position:0%
not change the income requirement it
 
05:03:30.470 --> 05:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
does not change anything in regards to
 
05:03:34.350 --> 05:03:34.360 align:start position:0%
zoning of where these can go or uh it's
 
05:03:36.548 --> 05:03:36.558 align:start position:0%
it's all still controlled by the
 
05:03:39.430 --> 05:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
town um but what it does is it kind of
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
gives these these guardrails in place
 
05:03:45.030 --> 05:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
and this guidance for things like income
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
verification so to start off um there
 
05:03:50.590 --> 05:03:50.600 align:start position:0%
was a question in regards to how
 
05:03:52.788 --> 05:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
frequently do you verify a tenant's
 
05:03:57.110 --> 05:03:57.120 align:start position:0%
income um do you verify it annually uh
 
05:03:58.990 --> 05:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
do you because you want quick turnover
 
05:04:01.750 --> 05:04:01.760 align:start position:0%
of the program if somebody starts making
 
05:04:03.270 --> 05:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
enough money that they can sustain
 
05:04:04.590 --> 05:04:04.600 align:start position:0%
themselves without this affordable
 
05:04:06.910 --> 05:04:06.920 align:start position:0%
housing do you want quick turnover so
 
05:04:09.030 --> 05:04:09.040 align:start position:0%
that unit can then go to somebody who
 
05:04:11.150 --> 05:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
needs it more
 
05:04:15.590 --> 05:04:15.600 align:start position:0%
um the other option is you would only
 
05:04:18.590 --> 05:04:18.600 align:start position:0%
verify when they sign the lease and then
 
05:04:20.830 --> 05:04:20.840 align:start position:0%
um just let them stay in that unit so
 
05:04:23.948 --> 05:04:23.958 align:start position:0%
long as they're in good standing um and
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
the unit is still priced affordably um I
 
05:04:29.070 --> 05:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
reached out to a number of different
 
05:04:31.750 --> 05:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
people across the aisle and um different
 
05:04:33.310 --> 05:04:33.320 align:start position:0%
municipalities to kind of get their
 
05:04:35.750 --> 05:04:35.760 align:start position:0%
perspective on what they thought the
 
05:04:37.350 --> 05:04:37.360 align:start position:0%
right answer was and I got a whole range
 
05:04:40.190 --> 05:04:40.200 align:start position:0%
of different answers um which is exactly
 
05:04:44.070 --> 05:04:44.080 align:start position:0%
why I didn't want to specify a specific
 
05:04:47.150 --> 05:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
um annual verification or infrequent
 
05:04:49.110 --> 05:04:49.120 align:start position:0%
verification because the thing is it
 
05:04:51.510 --> 05:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of time for
 
05:04:53.670 --> 05:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities um to track down this
 
05:04:55.190 --> 05:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
information for landlords to make sure
 
05:04:57.470 --> 05:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
they have it all in order and for
 
05:05:00.350 --> 05:05:00.360 align:start position:0%
tenants um so smaller municipalities
 
05:05:03.670 --> 05:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
might struggle to verify a lot of these
 
05:05:06.788 --> 05:05:06.798 align:start position:0%
units annually over and over again so
 
05:05:08.470 --> 05:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
they might say we'd love to have
 
05:05:09.990 --> 05:05:10.000 align:start position:0%
affordable housing we'd love to
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
encourage more developers here using
 
05:05:15.230 --> 05:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
this program but we just don't have the
 
05:05:19.628 --> 05:05:19.638 align:start position:0%
staff to um verify that frequently and
 
05:05:21.150 --> 05:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
bigger communities were saying oh we
 
05:05:23.270 --> 05:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
have the staff we can do this and we
 
05:05:25.430 --> 05:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
want quick turnover so we can make sure
 
05:05:27.990 --> 05:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
this goes to the people who need it so
 
05:05:30.590 --> 05:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
that's why in this bill that I'm
 
05:05:32.310 --> 05:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
proposing there's a lower bound and
 
05:05:33.628 --> 05:05:33.638 align:start position:0%
there's an upper bound so you can
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
basically choose to verify once during
 
05:05:39.350 --> 05:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
the initial um lease signing or you can
 
05:05:42.190 --> 05:05:42.200 align:start position:0%
choose choose to do annually um and
 
05:05:43.830 --> 05:05:43.840 align:start position:0%
that's totally up for the municipalities
 
05:05:43.840 --> 05:05:45.030 align:start position:0%
that's totally up for the municipalities
to

05:05:45.030 --> 05:05:45.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:05:47.230 --> 05:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
decide um just cuz I I didn't think a
 
05:05:52.350 --> 05:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
one size approach made sense here um so
 
05:05:54.150 --> 05:05:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that this does is it
 
05:05:56.150 --> 05:05:56.160 align:start position:0%
clarifies the question of what happens
 
05:05:58.030 --> 05:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
if you start making
 
05:06:02.270 --> 05:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
81% of a median income Uh current
 
05:06:05.310 --> 05:06:05.320 align:start position:0%
statute do you get evicted immediately
 
05:06:07.750 --> 05:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
um you how does that whole process work
 
05:06:10.708 --> 05:06:10.718 align:start position:0%
there's nothing at all um explaining
 
05:06:12.670 --> 05:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
that so what this does is it adds a bit
 
05:06:17.510 --> 05:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
of a grace period to say if you um if
 
05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
you uh no longer qualify under the
 
05:06:22.868 --> 05:06:22.878 align:start position:0%
income portion you have one year where
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
you can just continue signing your lease
 
05:06:27.390 --> 05:06:27.400 align:start position:0%
um and that's just to allow them to find
 
05:06:29.868 --> 05:06:29.878 align:start position:0%
alternative housing and that grace
 
05:06:32.948 --> 05:06:32.958 align:start position:0%
period um it doesn't say that you can't
 
05:06:35.270 --> 05:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
be evicted at all it just says you
 
05:06:38.350 --> 05:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
aren't ineligible to renew your lease um
 
05:06:39.788 --> 05:06:39.798 align:start position:0%
because of this program because obvious
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
if you have a bad tenant you should
 
05:06:43.788 --> 05:06:43.798 align:start position:0%
still be able to evict them when you
 
05:06:48.070 --> 05:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
know under under um other statutes but
 
05:06:49.510 --> 05:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
this is just saying if they're in good
 
05:06:51.750 --> 05:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
standing if their landlord likes them if
 
05:06:54.190 --> 05:06:54.200 align:start position:0%
they um want to continue living there
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
they can just keep renewing their lease
 
05:06:57.030 --> 05:06:57.040 align:start position:0%
if they so
 
05:07:00.350 --> 05:07:00.360 align:start position:0%
choose um the last thing is expanding
 
05:07:03.830 --> 05:07:03.840 align:start position:0%
the eligibility of this to adus so the
 
05:07:06.390 --> 05:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
thought process there is adus are often
 
05:07:09.310 --> 05:07:09.320 align:start position:0%
smaller landlords um they might not want
 
05:07:10.548 --> 05:07:10.558 align:start position:0%
the hassle of going through the
 
05:07:13.548 --> 05:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
paperwork of verifying their tenants
 
05:07:15.430 --> 05:07:15.440 align:start position:0%
income over and over again and it can
 
05:07:19.350 --> 05:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
also be difficult to scout out for that
 
05:07:22.030 --> 05:07:22.040 align:start position:0%
lower inome tenant in the first place so
 
05:07:25.350 --> 05:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
the thought is that so long as that Adu
 
05:07:29.628 --> 05:07:29.638 align:start position:0%
um landlord prices the unit affordably
 
05:07:32.548 --> 05:07:32.558 align:start position:0%
then you don't have to like anybody can
 
05:07:34.030 --> 05:07:34.040 align:start position:0%
can stay in that unit you don't need to
 
05:07:36.110 --> 05:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
verify their income and that's just to O
 
05:07:37.590 --> 05:07:37.600 align:start position:0%
increase the overall supply of
 
05:07:40.310 --> 05:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
affordable housing because everybody
 
05:07:42.390 --> 05:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
could use a bit more of that right now
 
05:07:44.470 --> 05:07:44.480 align:start position:0%
um but yeah so that's the overall
 
05:07:46.910 --> 05:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
summary of the changes in this law you
 
05:07:48.030 --> 05:07:48.040 align:start position:0%
know we're in the midst of a housing
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
crisis as I'm sure you all in the
 
05:07:52.270 --> 05:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
committee here know um and this just
 
05:07:54.350 --> 05:07:54.360 align:start position:0%
tries to improve this existing program
 
05:07:56.190 --> 05:07:56.200 align:start position:0%
give municipalities an extra tool that's
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
a bit more
 
05:08:00.430 --> 05:08:00.440 align:start position:0%
flexible um but yeah so I urge you to
 
05:08:03.310 --> 05:08:03.320 align:start position:0%
vote all to pass on HB 465 and I'm happy
 
05:08:04.430 --> 05:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions about the
 
05:08:06.430 --> 05:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
program thank you representative are
 
05:08:08.830 --> 05:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
questions for representative weade um
 
05:08:10.190 --> 05:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative Howen then represent
 
05:08:11.670 --> 05:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
Goods I just have a quick one the way I
 
05:08:14.430 --> 05:08:14.440 align:start position:0%
read it so the 80 the the designation of
 
05:08:17.310 --> 05:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
the units uh that are designed for 80%
 
05:08:21.150 --> 05:08:21.160 align:start position:0%
of Ami what we're really verifying is
 
05:08:23.948 --> 05:08:23.958 align:start position:0%
that the that that that's establishing
 
05:08:26.910 --> 05:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
the rental rate and so the verification
 
05:08:29.628 --> 05:08:29.638 align:start position:0%
program is really to verify that your
 
05:08:31.708 --> 05:08:31.718 align:start position:0%
the the rental rate has remained the
 
05:08:33.470 --> 05:08:33.480 align:start position:0%
same that it still qualifies because we
 
05:08:35.788 --> 05:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
as a municipality just gave you a tax
 
05:08:37.190 --> 05:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
break so we want to make sure that we're
 
05:08:39.628 --> 05:08:39.638 align:start position:0%
getting what we paid forre so it's not
 
05:08:41.350 --> 05:08:41.360 align:start position:0%
so at least what we're looking at
 
05:08:42.590 --> 05:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
although we don't have we haven't put
 
05:08:44.830 --> 05:08:44.840 align:start position:0%
one together but it's in our Workforce
 
05:08:47.548 --> 05:08:47.558 align:start position:0%
overlay the verification is really the
 
05:08:52.230 --> 05:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
apartment rent not the the income of the
 
05:08:54.030 --> 05:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
renter is that is that what you're
 
05:08:58.350 --> 05:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
looking to fix I should I will say so um
 
05:08:59.830 --> 05:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
to my understanding and to the do
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
housing coordinator understanding is
 
05:09:05.110 --> 05:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
that the verification because the
 
05:09:07.948 --> 05:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
existing statute says designated for
 
05:09:11.150 --> 05:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
individuals making 80% or less they
 
05:09:13.310 --> 05:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
interpreted that and I believe the New
 
05:09:17.708 --> 05:09:17.718 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Municipal um uh organization
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted that to mean that you have
 
05:09:23.310 --> 05:09:23.320 align:start position:0%
to verify tenant income to make sure
 
05:09:25.548 --> 05:09:25.558 align:start position:0%
that they make below
 
05:09:29.310 --> 05:09:29.320 align:start position:0%
80% um so 80% is used both to calculate
 
05:09:32.110 --> 05:09:32.120 align:start position:0%
the rental rate the maximum rental rate
 
05:09:34.110 --> 05:09:34.120 align:start position:0%
of a property under this program and
 
05:09:38.190 --> 05:09:38.200 align:start position:0%
also to verify tenant income to my
 
05:09:41.190 --> 05:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
understanding um um yeah so I I had not
 
05:09:43.310 --> 05:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
heard that that was another so that's
 
05:09:44.868 --> 05:09:44.878 align:start position:0%
part of the reason this law is super
 
05:09:46.788 --> 05:09:46.798 align:start position:0%
super vague and part of the reason I
 
05:09:48.548 --> 05:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
think we really need to make some of
 
05:09:49.830 --> 05:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
these improvements so I'm happy to help
 
05:09:52.190 --> 05:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
with an amendment if that would be I was
 
05:09:53.350 --> 05:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
just going to say would you be open to
 
05:09:55.230 --> 05:09:55.240 align:start position:0%
an amendment to to fixing that because I
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
think absolutely um and on the note of
 
05:10:00.910 --> 05:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
amendments if I may real quick um there
 
05:10:03.110 --> 05:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
was one thing that came up after I had
 
05:10:05.708 --> 05:10:05.718 align:start position:0%
submitted this which is the idea of if
 
05:10:06.990 --> 05:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
you expand this to
 
05:10:10.030 --> 05:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
adus you know I don't want it to freeze
 
05:10:12.190 --> 05:10:12.200 align:start position:0%
the property valuation on the entire
 
05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
property I basically want to consider it
 
05:10:17.708 --> 05:10:17.718 align:start position:0%
as if imagine an appraiser goes to you
 
05:10:18.628 --> 05:10:18.638 align:start position:0%
and they'll
 
05:10:21.910 --> 05:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
just pretend there's no Adu on the home
 
05:10:24.750 --> 05:10:24.760 align:start position:0%
if you make other renovations to the
 
05:10:27.310 --> 05:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
primary residents that I don't think
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
should be Frozen as part of this program
 
05:10:33.910 --> 05:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
I think it should just be the Adu itself
 
05:10:37.750 --> 05:10:37.760 align:start position:0%
um that counts towards that freeze um
 
05:10:39.350 --> 05:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
but yeah so if we're going to amend it
 
05:10:42.390 --> 05:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to fix that too right yeah
 
05:10:42.400 --> 05:10:44.590 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to fix that too right yeah
representative

05:10:44.590 --> 05:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:49.230 --> 05:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um
 
05:10:52.510 --> 05:10:52.520 align:start position:0%
so just to be sure I understand this is
 
05:10:58.110 --> 05:10:58.120 align:start position:0%
it then up to the town um if someone um
 
05:11:00.830 --> 05:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
if they do periodic ver income
 
05:11:03.270 --> 05:11:03.280 align:start position:0%
verification um and someone's income
 
05:11:05.788 --> 05:11:05.798 align:start position:0%
changes so that they now make above the
 
05:11:09.708 --> 05:11:09.718 align:start position:0%
80% is it then up to the town um to make
 
05:11:12.990 --> 05:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
a policy as to whether that tenant would
 
05:11:16.110 --> 05:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
have to leave or can renew the leas and
 
05:11:19.708 --> 05:11:19.718 align:start position:0%
say yeah so um the idea behind the grace
 
05:11:22.708 --> 05:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
period was to say um currently there's
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
there's nothing about what happens if
 
05:11:27.788 --> 05:11:27.798 align:start position:0%
somebody starts making more than that um
 
05:11:30.230 --> 05:11:30.240 align:start position:0%
and in my mind I wouldn't want somebody
 
05:11:31.868 --> 05:11:31.878 align:start position:0%
to make
 
05:11:35.030 --> 05:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
81% um so they're still not making much
 
05:11:37.990 --> 05:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh money and then immediately be evicted
 
05:11:40.590 --> 05:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
and they can't find alternative housing
 
05:11:42.030 --> 05:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
I don't think that's fair to the
 
05:11:44.230 --> 05:11:44.240 align:start position:0%
landlord the tenant or the municipality
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
or anybody involved if they're otherwise
 
05:11:49.510 --> 05:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
in good standing um so what the grace
 
05:11:51.548 --> 05:11:51.558 align:start position:0%
period does is all it says is you can
 
05:11:56.070 --> 05:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
renew your lease for that one year um
 
05:11:58.910 --> 05:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
and after that is when you'd be
 
05:12:01.310 --> 05:12:01.320 align:start position:0%
ineligible to renew your lease under
 
05:12:03.070 --> 05:12:03.080 align:start position:0%
this type of
 
05:12:07.910 --> 05:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
property uh follow-up question y um what
 
05:12:09.750 --> 05:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
about home ownership un
 
05:12:13.310 --> 05:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
if somebody buys one of these houses um
 
05:12:16.230 --> 05:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
that is intended for people uh who make
 
05:12:18.868 --> 05:12:18.878 align:start position:0%
below 80% of the median income what
 
05:12:22.670 --> 05:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
happens to them if um their income now
 
05:12:25.310 --> 05:12:25.320 align:start position:0%
increases um are they required to sell
 
05:12:25.320 --> 05:12:29.670 align:start position:0%
increases um are they required to sell
their

05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
house sorry uh so this this applies to
 
05:12:33.830 --> 05:12:33.840 align:start position:0%
renters if I'm understanding right so
 
05:12:35.910 --> 05:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
are you saying if the land if the owner
 
05:12:39.230 --> 05:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
of the property changes no it the it
 
05:12:41.948 --> 05:12:41.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to make a differentiation
 
05:12:44.430 --> 05:12:44.440 align:start position:0%
between rental and Home Ownership units
 
05:12:46.948 --> 05:12:46.958 align:start position:0%
it is not clear that it applies only to
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
rental units yeah so this program is
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
saying that the rental rate um so it's
 
05:12:54.190 --> 05:12:54.200 align:start position:0%
meant for things like rental units and
 
05:12:56.948 --> 05:12:56.958 align:start position:0%
apartments it's not meant for for
 
05:13:00.070 --> 05:13:00.080 align:start position:0%
housing um it's saying that the rental
 
05:13:02.310 --> 05:13:02.320 align:start position:0%
rate is fixed at that
 
05:13:06.948 --> 05:13:06.958 align:start position:0%
80% um uh area median income uh
 
05:13:09.110 --> 05:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
affordable guidelines which is done by
 
05:13:11.670 --> 05:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
by that Federal Housing Authority that
 
05:13:12.750 --> 05:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
05:13:16.990 --> 05:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
clarified okay represent Faxton so just
 
05:13:19.708 --> 05:13:19.718 align:start position:0%
79e is an extensive law and covers a lot
 
05:13:23.310 --> 05:13:23.320 align:start position:0%
of things with reference to uh
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gibb's question my
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
understanding is that what you are
 
05:13:31.628 --> 05:13:31.638 align:start position:0%
proposing here only applies to those
 
05:13:35.230 --> 05:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
situations where a town has adopted 79e
 
05:13:38.430 --> 05:13:38.440 align:start position:0%
which most towns have not yeah and where
 
05:13:41.070 --> 05:13:41.080 align:start position:0%
a specific ific tax exemption has been
 
05:13:45.708 --> 05:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
obtained for providing renovated housing
 
05:13:48.310 --> 05:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
spaces to people whose income is at or
 
05:13:51.310 --> 05:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
below 80% of the median or whatever
 
05:13:54.510 --> 05:13:54.520 align:start position:0%
you're correct um so but wouldn't apply
 
05:13:57.430 --> 05:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
to if the Property Transfers if you do
 
05:13:58.990 --> 05:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
that and then I buy it from you and
 
05:14:01.830 --> 05:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
those tenants remain it has no impact on
 
05:14:06.510 --> 05:14:06.520 align:start position:0%
the tax def the tax uh deferral to the
 
05:14:09.190 --> 05:14:09.200 align:start position:0%
best of my understanding yes um but I
 
05:14:11.070 --> 05:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
don't I haven't explored that case into
 
05:14:14.948 --> 05:14:14.958 align:start position:0%
too much detail um where but your my my
 
05:14:17.910 --> 05:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
my question to clarify for per
 
05:14:21.590 --> 05:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs purposes and my own
 
05:14:23.548 --> 05:14:23.558 align:start position:0%
is that what we are talking about is
 
05:14:26.230 --> 05:14:26.240 align:start position:0%
only in The Limited section of the law
 
05:14:29.190 --> 05:14:29.200 align:start position:0%
that applies to tax benefits obtained by
 
05:14:33.708 --> 05:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
provid by providing housing to uh
 
05:14:35.948 --> 05:14:35.958 align:start position:0%
renovated housing to people at 80% or
 
05:14:38.310 --> 05:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
below the poverty level exctly so this
 
05:14:40.910 --> 05:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
this all all of these changes are only
 
05:14:43.750 --> 05:14:43.760 align:start position:0%
applicable to 79
 
05:14:46.350 --> 05:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
e-4c which is the Housing Opportunity
 
05:14:50.670 --> 05:14:50.680 align:start position:0%
Zone program within the broader 79
 
05:14:55.910 --> 05:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
statute um yeah so that's yeah so yes
 
05:14:58.948 --> 05:14:58.958 align:start position:0%
you you right and in understanding that
 
05:15:01.310 --> 05:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
all right other questions represent Wade
 
05:15:03.788 --> 05:15:03.798 align:start position:0%
see none thank you thanks so much um
 
05:15:14.110 --> 05:15:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:15.350 --> 05:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
05:15:17.070 --> 05:15:17.080 align:start position:0%
committee I'll be brief I'm Nick Taylor
 
05:15:18.390 --> 05:15:18.400 align:start position:0%
the director of housing action New
 
05:15:19.830 --> 05:15:19.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there were a couple questions
 
05:15:23.070 --> 05:15:23.080 align:start position:0%
on the 79e program so figured I would
 
05:15:27.150 --> 05:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
speak up um a couple points around the
 
05:15:29.590 --> 05:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh income verific verification question
 
05:15:31.190 --> 05:15:31.200 align:start position:0%
there are some municipalities that use
 
05:15:33.470 --> 05:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
Hud's fair market rate when they're
 
05:15:35.510 --> 05:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
looking at their affordability statutes
 
05:15:36.990 --> 05:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
this is what Durham is looking at this
 
05:15:39.990 --> 05:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
is what Dover does there are other
 
05:15:42.230 --> 05:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
communities and state law which use the
 
05:15:45.270 --> 05:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
area median income which are slightly
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
different they're very similar numbers
 
05:15:49.190 --> 05:15:49.200 align:start position:0%
but they are different in terms of what
 
05:15:51.670 --> 05:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
is being measured um the HUD fair market
 
05:15:54.230 --> 05:15:54.240 align:start position:0%
rate typically sticks with the rental
 
05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
unit as you were talking about where the
 
05:15:57.788 --> 05:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
area meeting income sticks with the
 
05:16:00.390 --> 05:16:00.400 align:start position:0%
person and so that's where there's been
 
05:16:03.150 --> 05:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
some question about whether the unit
 
05:16:06.310 --> 05:16:06.320 align:start position:0%
price versus the uh income that someone
 
05:16:08.510 --> 05:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
is earning is the best sort of barometer
 
05:16:10.910 --> 05:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
in policy the decision for which you
 
05:16:13.670 --> 05:16:13.680 align:start position:0%
were going to give your tradeoff to um
 
05:16:15.590 --> 05:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
so I would just say from housing actions
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
perspective we appreciate the intent
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
here we support the bill we think the
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
flexibility around adus especially
 
05:16:23.310 --> 05:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
without verifying it's expensive it's
 
05:16:25.868 --> 05:16:25.878 align:start position:0%
difficult makes tons of sense we
 
05:16:28.510 --> 05:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
generally support the unit rather than
 
05:16:32.470 --> 05:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
the income um qualifying piece just
 
05:16:34.150 --> 05:16:34.160 align:start position:0%
because it is really tough to verify it
 
05:16:36.470 --> 05:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
can disincentivize work when folks are
 
05:16:38.430 --> 05:16:38.440 align:start position:0%
doing well but they earn a couple extra
 
05:16:40.510 --> 05:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
dollars per hour then it forces them out
 
05:16:42.868 --> 05:16:42.878 align:start position:0%
of a unit and I don't think folks want
 
05:16:44.590 --> 05:16:44.600 align:start position:0%
that so extending this from even a year
 
05:16:47.230 --> 05:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
to perpetuity I think would be fine
 
05:16:49.470 --> 05:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
because folks move on um in different
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
stages of their life and the 79e
 
05:16:54.430 --> 05:16:54.440 align:start position:0%
question you're exactly right that a lot
 
05:16:56.470 --> 05:16:56.480 align:start position:0%
of communities do not use the Housing
 
05:16:58.948 --> 05:16:58.958 align:start position:0%
Opportunity Zone element of 79e they use
 
05:17:01.350 --> 05:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
the community redevelopment section of
 
05:17:04.070 --> 05:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
79e which is really made for like
 
05:17:06.510 --> 05:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
downtowns and so that's uh where a lot
 
05:17:09.990 --> 05:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
of the apartment building that u79 come
 
05:17:12.350 --> 05:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
in not the Housing Opportunity Zone
 
05:17:14.390 --> 05:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
Program which is still relatively
 
05:17:16.510 --> 05:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
new hopefully that answered a couple
 
05:17:19.150 --> 05:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
questions right any questions seeing
 
05:17:20.868 --> 05:17:20.878 align:start position:0%
none thank you is there anyone else
 
05:17:23.070 --> 05:17:23.080 align:start position:0%
that's here to testify on HB
 
05:17:25.270 --> 05:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
465 seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:17:28.310 --> 05:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
public hearing at 3:14 we're running a
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
little bit behind I know representative
 
05:17:31.750 --> 05:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
howand had noticed a subcommittee but I
 
05:17:33.110 --> 05:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
think there's a couple bills that I want

there's a lot of great merits to the
 
05:36:41.070 --> 05:36:41.080 align:start position:0%

05:36:43.030 --> 05:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
is um making its way through the body
 
05:36:45.948 --> 05:36:45.958 align:start position:0%
that we shall not name um but I think
 
05:36:47.628 --> 05:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see both of those bills in
 
05:36:49.868 --> 05:36:49.878 align:start position:0%
one spot where um the committee on
 
05:36:51.310 --> 05:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
housing that is tasked to deal with this
 
05:36:52.948 --> 05:36:52.958 align:start position:0%

less than 750 ft which is already an
 
05:40:47.750 --> 05:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
existing law it adds that back in it
 
05:40:50.788 --> 05:40:50.798 align:start position:0%
also gives municipalities the right to
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
um regulate if the an owner occupies one
 
05:40:56.030 --> 05:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
of the existing adus which I think is a
 
05:40:58.270 --> 05:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
key um component to allowing U
 
05:41:01.628 --> 05:41:01.638 align:start position:0%
municipalities discretion in in this um
 
05:41:05.070 --> 05:41:05.080 align:start position:0%
but um it really goes a long way I think
 
05:41:07.270 --> 05:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
in helping move the housing crisis and I
 
05:41:08.750 --> 05:41:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think that five I think the amendment
 
05:41:10.868 --> 05:41:10.878 align:start position:0%
will um enhance the bill and hopefully
 
05:41:11.910 --> 05:41:11.920 align:start position:0%
get it over the Finish Line at least
 
05:41:14.030 --> 05:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
through the house um is there any
 
05:41:16.750 --> 05:41:16.760 align:start position:0%

05:41:20.350 --> 05:41:20.360 align:start position:0%
all okay is a um show hands okay with
 
05:41:20.360 --> 05:41:21.628 align:start position:0%
all okay is a um show hands okay with
the

05:41:21.628 --> 05:41:21.638 align:start position:0%

05:41:26.310 --> 05:41:26.320 align:start position:0%

which I made in representative Cole
 
05:41:44.590 --> 05:41:44.600 align:start position:0%

05:41:48.750 --> 05:41:48.760 align:start position:0%

cheer read I support this bill as
 
05:42:01.390 --> 05:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
amended I think it could do a lot more
 
05:42:05.310 --> 05:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
but we get what we get and so
 
05:42:09.270 --> 05:42:09.280 align:start position:0%

on HB
 
05:43:51.868 --> 05:43:51.878 align:start position:0%
685 and I'm going to recognize myself
 
05:43:55.230 --> 05:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
for a motion of a to pass representative
 
05:43:57.750 --> 05:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
Grant would you like to second that
 
05:44:00.030 --> 05:44:00.040 align:start position:0%
second by representative Grant um and
 
05:44:02.150 --> 05:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
now I'm going to move Amendment
 
05:44:04.110 --> 05:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
0392 representative Grant would you like
 
05:44:07.350 --> 05:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
to second that perfect um by
 
05:44:08.750 --> 05:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative Grant so real quickly
 
05:44:11.390 --> 05:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
this amendment again does things that I
 
05:44:15.350 --> 05:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
addressed during the work session um it
 
05:44:17.070 --> 05:44:17.080 align:start position:0%
first of all it keeps the main which is
 
05:44:19.350 --> 05:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
the heart of the bill section one really
 
05:44:21.110 --> 05:44:21.120 align:start position:0%
puts a key definition of manufactured
 
05:44:22.390 --> 05:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
housing makes sure it's a permanent
 
05:44:25.270 --> 05:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
chassis um it's it's connected to
 
05:44:26.910 --> 05:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
existing utilities Plumbing Heating
 
05:44:28.788 --> 05:44:28.798 align:start position:0%
electrical um but it's just built
 
05:44:30.468 --> 05:44:30.478 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and shipped in so that's
 
05:44:32.830 --> 05:44:32.840 align:start position:0%
really is the the Crux of that I think
 
05:44:34.190 --> 05:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
that there's no reason why that
 
05:44:35.708 --> 05:44:35.718 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be allowed as a as a house on
 
05:44:38.030 --> 05:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
any property um I I think it's a key
 
05:44:39.628 --> 05:44:39.638 align:start position:0%
solution to the housing crisis because
 
05:44:41.868 --> 05:44:41.878 align:start position:0%
it allows for smaller houses and more
 
05:44:44.070 --> 05:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
affordable houses on on existing
 
05:44:46.708 --> 05:44:46.718 align:start position:0%
properties um the amendment moves out
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
the effective date allows municipalities
 
05:44:51.270 --> 05:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
a little more time to um uh amend their
 
05:44:54.430 --> 05:44:54.440 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances um and allows for
 
05:44:57.310 --> 05:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination against manufactured
 
05:44:59.670 --> 05:44:59.680 align:start position:0%
housing representative Hicks yeah thank
 
05:45:01.868 --> 05:45:01.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um I wish representative
 
05:45:03.750 --> 05:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
Reed was here to hear me say this but I
 
05:45:07.230 --> 05:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a great Bill to
 
05:45:09.548 --> 05:45:09.558 align:start position:0%
start to change the narrative about what
 
05:45:10.548 --> 05:45:10.558 align:start position:0%
type of
 
05:45:13.708 --> 05:45:13.718 align:start position:0%
housing is allowed or pref I should say
 
05:45:16.430 --> 05:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
preferred in certain neighborhoods in
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
certain towns in New Hampshire and it's
 
05:45:22.110 --> 05:45:22.120 align:start position:0%
about time we did this thank you other
 
05:45:24.548 --> 05:45:24.558 align:start position:0%
comments representative
 
05:45:27.270 --> 05:45:27.280 align:start position:0%
Gibs am I correct in understanding that
 
05:45:29.628 --> 05:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
the main substantive difference between
 
05:45:31.590 --> 05:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment and the original bill is
 
05:45:33.230 --> 05:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
the elimination of the reference to the
 
05:45:34.430 --> 05:45:34.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and Urban
 
05:45:37.468 --> 05:45:37.478 align:start position:0%
Development yes thank you
 
05:45:39.868 --> 05:45:39.878 align:start position:0%
we don't have a state department and I
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
don't like relying on the federal
 
05:45:43.750 --> 05:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
government I don't think the federal
 
05:45:45.830 --> 05:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
Housing Department of Housing and Urban
 
05:45:47.670 --> 05:45:47.680 align:start position:0%

05:45:50.510 --> 05:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
