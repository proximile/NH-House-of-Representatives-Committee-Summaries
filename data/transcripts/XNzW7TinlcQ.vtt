00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
.

00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Thank you.

Thank you.

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
Thank you.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Thank you.

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
Okay.

14
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,000
All right.

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Good morning.

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
I think it's a good morning.

17
00:00:33,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Welcome to the executive session, Wednesday, House resources recreation and development committee first I'd like ask you to rise and we play bridge of allegiance representative Crichton would you lead us in the pledge to the flag of the United States of America and to the republic for which it stands, one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Thank you very much.

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,500
We might as well move right into the business.

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:25,000
The committee opened the hearing, or excuse me, opened the executive session on House Bill 1167, establishing a maximum containment level, contaminant level for perfluorinated chemicals in surface water.

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,500
Chair recognizes Representative Kelly for a motion.

22
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,500
Thank you, Mr.

23
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,500
Chairman.

24
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,000
I'd like to make a motion of interim study on House Bill 1167.

25
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Thank you.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,500
Do I have a second?

27
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,500
Second.

28
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
Second by Representative Perez.

29
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,500
Thank you very much.

30
00:01:49,500 --> 00:02:00,000
Before I ask you to speak on the motion, Representative Smith, can you introduce the people you have brought for substitutions?

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Thank you, Mr.

32
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Chair.

33
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:14,000
We have Representative Marty Jack sitting in for Representative Spang and then Representative Maria Perez sitting in for Melbourne Moran.

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Welcome to the committee.

35
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Glad you could come.

36
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,500
Representative Kelly to speak on your motion.

37
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:27,000
I think that from what we heard, DES is Thank you.

38
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
could come.

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,500
Representative Kelly to speak on your motion.

40
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:42,000
I think that from what we heard DES is bringing forward their MCL for fluorinated carbons and surface water.

41
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So I think that interim study will give them time to finish their work.

42
00:02:49,000 --> 00:03:04,500
But I think there were a number of issues raised by this bill and by the other bill about surface water that could use our work at a later time possibly.

43
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:10,500
Thank you very much would you like to speak to your second?

44
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
No.

45
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:19,000
Is there anyone on the committee who wishes to speak to the motion?

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Motion of IS or interim study.

47
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:31,500
Seeing none, on the motion of interim study for House Bill 1167, will the clerk please call the roll?

48
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,500
Thank you.

Yes.

74

Representative Grassi.

75

Yes.

76

Representative Gotland.

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,500
Yes.

78
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,500
Representative Cohen.

79
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,500
Yes.

80
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,500
Yes.

81
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
Yes.

82
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,500
Yes.

83
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,500
Yes.

84
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,500
Yes.

85
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Yes.

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,500
Yes.

87
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,500
Yes.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,500
Yes.

89
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,500
Yes.

90
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,500
Yes.

91
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,500
Thank you.

92
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
Yes.

93
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,500
Representative Renzullo.

94
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,500
Yes.

95
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,500
Yes.

96
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,500
Passed unanimously.

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,500
Consent?

98
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Pardon?

99
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,500
Consent?

100
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,500
Consent?

101
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,500
Yes.

102
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,500
Any objection?

103
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,500
The bill will be on consent.

104
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:33,500
I will close the hearing, or excuse me, I will close the executive session on House Bill 1167.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:38,000
I will open the session on House Bill 1185.

106
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,500
Representative Healy for a motion.

107
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:46,500
I'd like to make the motion with ought to pass with amendment.

108
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:50,500
A motion of ought to pass with amendment.

109
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,000
And the amendment is 0583H.

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
0583H.

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:01,500
I would like, Chair would call Representative Rung, who was put amendment 0583H.

112
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,000
These are small businesses that serve residents that are on a septic system.

113
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Following that hearing, I met with Representative Mr.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,500
Natch-Graise from the New Hampshire Municipal Association and Ms.

115
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:31,500
Rita Croce, who is the Deputy Director of the Merrimack Wastewater Treatment Facility, to address those concerns, because we did feel that that was a shortcoming in the original bill.

116
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:43,500
So we worked together to produce the Amendment 0583, and I want to point out the changes in that amendment from the original bill.

117
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:55,500
One, New Hampshire Municipal Association added a statement of findings and purpose, just to establish really what the intent of this legislation would be.

118
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:06,500
So you'll see on line 20, that's really, that's going to be the same as what you saw in the original bill.

119
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:39,500
But then back on line 14, what we've done is distinguish between private septage haulers that serve residential units versus those that serve any commercial or industrial purposes so it's allowing wastewater treatment facilities they may collect if they feel they need to samples for PFAS from septage loads originating from residential sources so it makes that distinction between the residential septage haulers and other ones.

120
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:50,500
Non-residential septage loads from commercial or industrial sources shall have prior approval by the municipality before discharging to a wastewater treatment facility.

121
00:07:50,500 --> 00:08:16,000
That statement refers, in a way, back to a new line on line 9 of page 2, where the Merrimack deputy director really wanted to make clear that municipalities that do not have wastewater treatment facilities have to enter into agreements with other ones, and those agreements have to be honored.

122
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,500
So let me give you an example.

123
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,000
Let's say Brookline does not have its own wastewater treatment system.

124
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They contract with Merrimack to accept their waste.

125
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Merrimack has to accept that waste.

126
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
They can't deny it.

127
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
But with this amendment, Merrimack may test that.

128
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:49,000
They don't have to refuse it, but they can test it so that they can understand the PFAS coming into their site.

129
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I hope I made that clear.

130
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,500
I'd be happy to answer any questions.

131
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:00,500
Any questions on the amendment by members of the board?

132
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,000
Representative Cohen, then Representative Crichton.

133
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Mr.

134
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:11,500
Chairperson, I just want to second Representative Healy's motion to make this legal.

135
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
Thank you.

136
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you for correcting me.

137
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Thank you very much.

138
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Thank you.

139
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,500
Thank you for correcting me.

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,500
Thank you very much.

141
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:27,000
Representative Creighton for a question.

142
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Thank you, Mr.

143
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Chairman.

144
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:35,500
Representative Rugg, I appreciate your efforts to do this.

145
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:43,500
I just want to make sure I understand, based on the last testimony that we had.

146
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:53,500
As I read this, it says a wastewater treatment plant may require any industrial or commercial facilities or septic haulers.

147
00:09:53,500 --> 00:10:02,000
So then it's up to the wastewater treatment plant to decide whether the septic haulers are tested.

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:21,000
So if I'm a septic hauler and I go to three different houses and I pick up all their stuff and I go to the plant, it's up to the wastewater treatment plant to decide whether they charge.

149
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:34,500
Remember the discussion about, well, we've got to wait for a day and we don't know when it's going to happen and which house it came from.

150
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,500
There was all that.

151
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,500
That's still in here.

152
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:49,000
It's still in here that if the director of the wastewater treatment plant wants to arbitrarily Thank you for your comment.

153
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:54,500
With septage haulers, there are those that service industrial commercial customers.

154
00:10:54,500 --> 00:11:00,000
So there's different ways that waste can enter wastewater treatment system.

155
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:14,500
It can come by industrial commercial that are discharging into a sewer system, but it can also come from industrial commercial that are contracting with a private septic hauler.

156
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:23,000
This amendment distinguishes those septic haulers from the ones that go to homes to pick up waste.

157
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:32,500
For instance, in Merrimack, we have a car wash that hires a septic hauler to take away its waste.

158
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:41,000
We're distinguishing that from the septic hauler who comes to my house to pick up my waste.

159
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,500
We're treating them the same.

160
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:53,000
So if a septic hauler is bringing industrial commercial waste, they would be subject to having that waste tested.

161
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:01,500
And if it's very high in PFAS, for instance from a car wash, they could be regulated.

162
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:19,500
haulers are different so it would put the it would put a responsibility on the wastewater treatment plant to identify if a septage coming into the plant is from a residential source or manufacturing industrial source.

163
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:28,500
It's distinguishing between the types of septage that are privately hauled and brought to a wastewater treatment plant.

164
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,500
For a follow-up, sir?

165
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,500
For a follow-up.

166
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:36,000
Can you explain how it does that?

167
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
You lost me.

168
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,500
I've got industrial commercial facilities.

169
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,500
I understand that.

170
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,500
And then septicolers.

171
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:50,000
Those are the only two categories that I see in here.

172
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,500
There's not a residential versus a commercial.

173
00:12:53,500 --> 00:13:02,500
On line 14, on page 2, that's the due language that distinguishes septage loads originating from residential sources.

174
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:17,000
They may collect, but they wouldn't be held to the same standard as manufacturing industrial sources that come either from a septage contractor or through the wastewater treatment system.

175
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Okay.

176
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Okay, thank you, ma'am.

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Okay, thank you.

178
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Any other questions concerning the amendment?

179
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Representative Harb.

180
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:33,500
Thank you, and thank you for taking this comment or question.

181
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:55,000
Representative Rung, I heard what you said about line 14, but like my fellow rep, I'm a little confused because line 23 that says they may require a septic collar to test, and then I look at line six on the second page.

182
00:13:55,000 --> 00:14:00,500
They may refuse a discharge from a hauler that has levels.

183
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:15,000
I'm getting the impression that if a residential analysis is made and he exceeds the PFAS level, under page two, line six, they can refuse to take is septic.

184
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Is that true?

185
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,500
I think that is the reason why.

186
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Well, thank you for your question.

187
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:46,500
I think that is the reason why line 9 on page 2 was included, that if the wastewater treatment plant is in a contract to accept municipal septage from another community, whether it's high in PFAS or not, they have to accept it per that contract.

188
00:14:46,500 --> 00:15:10,500
This does not supersede the contract they have with municipalities, but it does empower the wastewater treatment facility to request testing so that they can understand the PFAS load coming into their system, knowing that they can't control that residential septic that's under the contract with other municipalities.

189
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,500
Thank you.

190
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:19,000
And I should say, too, that when we were discussing this amendment, Ms.

191
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Croce from Merrimack did reiterate strongly it's important for them to know how much PFAS is coming in, even though some of it may not be regulated if it's under contract from another municipality.

192
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:46,000
but it allows some predictive data for what may end up in their compost or discharged into the Merrimack River.

193
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Any other questions?

194
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,500
I do have a question.

195
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:59,000
I'm just trying to get my hands around what exactly is happening to the residential septic collar.

196
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:11,500
The way the things seem to be written, we're talking about line three on the page two, an industrial or commercial facility or septic hauler.

197
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:18,500
It doesn't say or commercial or industrial septic hauler, it just says septic hauler.

198
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
That could be a residential.

199
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:31,500
I'm not certain what protection the residential septic hauler has that from having to treat or having to analyze their load.

200
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,000
Am I making myself clear on that?

201
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:40,500
Yeah, I think, well, thank you for your question, Representative Renzullo.

202
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:55,500
I think we have to understand that not all septic haulers serve residents, that many of them, and it could be the same septicolor, may service car washes, painting companies.

203
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,000
They're not restricted just to residential loads.

204
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:13,000
If they do bring a residential load into the wastewater treatment plant, they are not held to testing or regulatory standards that they would under the previous section.

205
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:25,500
If they're under contract with the municipality and that septic collar on that run is bringing in residential septage, the plant has to take it.

206
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,000
The plant has the opportunity to request a testing.

207
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Ms.

208
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Croce said it could be once a year.

209
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,500
We just want to understand, is there PFAS in residential septage?

210
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:59,500
But septic collars, regardless of if they do serve residential, if they bring in industrial commercial waste through their septic, there is the expectation that it may contain PFAS, and they would be subject to this.

211
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:05,500
So it really is the nature of the septage that's coming in.

212
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:24,500
And the clarifying language, including the language on Line 9 about RSA 485-A, is really just to establish the fact that wastewater treatment plants cannot reject septage when they're under contract from a community to accept that waste.

213
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:28,000
Representative Connors, did you have a question?

214
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Just a comment.

215
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Is this just a matter of grammar, where a comma is or is not?

216
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:40,000
That may very well be true.

217
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:52,500
Do you have an English expert here that could tell us whether there should be a comma there or not a comma there to include?

218
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:55,500
It's a little more than comma.

219
00:18:55,500 --> 00:19:14,000
It's just maybe an addition of a better definition or a more specific, instead of saying, for instance, an industrial or commercial facility or an industrial or commercial septic hauler, hauler when hauling commercial or industrial waste.

220
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That's what I'm saying.

221
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
I think it's a language.

222
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Right.

223
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:28,000
And I think it's that's, yeah, as Representative Creighton, is that kind of your feeling?

224
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:34,500
I mean, listening to your question, you're kind of in the same ballpark.

225
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
Yeah, sure.

226
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:43,500
That it's the definitions are not specific enough or the delineations aren't specific enough.

227
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:59,000
So that we don't want to have the residential septic hauler having to go and check his tank and wait three weeks before they can dump it, that type of thing.

228
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Mr.

229
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:08,500
Chairman, would the committee be – I'd be happy if you wanted to recess this.

230
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:28,500
I can run to OLS and have an amendment that in line three, it would say an industrial or commercial facility or hauler of industrial commercial waste that receives a notification from wastewater treatment plant, you know, blah, blah, blah.

231
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:41,000
So wherever there's septic hauler that would be under the requirement of testing, I would specify it would be septic collar of industrial commercial waste.

232
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:49,500
And I believe that's in line three, but I also see it is occurring in line seven.

233
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,500
Representative Harb.

234
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Thank you, Representative Rung.

235
00:20:53,500 --> 00:21:17,500
In response to your inquiry, I think if you were to word search septic collar, because it comes in in line 24 and other places, I would be receptive personally to pass an amendment that identifies wherever you see septic collar, septic collars of industrial or commercial waste.

236
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:22,000
That way you've limited what the facility can do.

237
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Then you still keep your line nine, and then you can have other things.

238
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:35,500
So I think personally that would be an amendment that I could support.

239
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:43,000
Okay, so let me run over to OLS and come back with a new amendment.

240
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:51,000
So whenever septic hauler is specified, it's specified to the type of waste that they're hauling.

241
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,000
I'll see you soon.

242
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
Thank you.

243
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:05,500
I think I will recess this session until she's able to come back and go on to something different, something else.

244
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I am recessing the executive session on House Bill 1188.

245
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:17,000
House Bill 1188, establishing a commission to study OHRV use in the state.

246
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Chair recognizes Representative Smith.

247
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I make a motion of ought to pass.

248
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:27,500
Representative Smith makes a motion of ought to pass.

249
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:29,500
Representative?

250
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,000
I'd like to second that.

251
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Seconded by Representative Egan.

252
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,000
And do you have an amendment?

253
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:44,500
Yes, I'd like to move amendment number 0582H, which everyone should have on their desks.

254
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:58,500
And there's a couple of extra copies on the side table over there for members of the audience, but I think there's only two or three of them.

255
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:03,500
It's very similar to what I handed out last week.

256
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:09,000
Would you like to speak to your motion for the amendment?

257
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Why, surely.

258
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:16,500
Am I speaking on the amendment or the bill as amended?

259
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,500
On the amendment.

260
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,500
All right.

261
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:37,000
So last week during the public hearing, I passed out a draft that I had put together with ideas for changing the membership somewhat from what I had originally introduced on the bill.

262
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:41,000
And so here it is in official form.

263
00:23:41,000 --> 00:24:05,000
I clarified that if I go to the membership and compensation, which is the gist of the amendment, the legislative members I broke out so that it's very clear that there are four members and not five, because it sounded to some people like there were five members.

264
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,000
So we tried to clarify that.

265
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:16,500
And then we removed from the original bill that the director of New Hampshire Parks was on.

266
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:36,500
We removed him because in speaking with Director Bryce, he told me that the chief supervisor for Bureau of Trails was enough and that they're in constant communication, so he would be learning all about what was happening from him.

267
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:49,000
And then I removed the sheriff and put in one representative of municipal police departments appointed by the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police.

268
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,000
And let's see.

269
00:24:51,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Oh, and then I added the one member representing landowners appointed jointly by the New Hampshire Timberland Association and the Farm Bureau.

270
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:09,500
And the word jointly kind of makes it clear that there's only one member there.

271
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:23,000
And then the one representative from New Hampshire Auto Dealers Association appointed by the association is added, and that is because they represent those who sell OHRVs.

272
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:34,500
And then we have one member representing the New Hampshire Society for Protection of Forests, the Appalachian Mountain Club, and the Nature Conservancy.

273
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,500
And these people all have a lot to do with land use and conservation.

274
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:46,000
But it's one person and they are appointed jointly.

275
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:56,000
And the word jointly kind of makes it clear that there's only one member there, appointed jointly by those organizations.

276
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:03,500
And then one representative of the New Hampshire Rail Trail Coalition appointed by that coalition.

277
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:36,000
And I had a lot of requests from a few different people on that one and then two members of the public one of whom appointed by New Hampshire Association of Conservation Commission's and one appointed by the North Country Council which is the regional planning Commission for the whole North Country from Plymouth going north and that is what the amendment is and does.

278
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,000
Thank you, Representative Smith.

279
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,000
Representative, was your first motion ought to pass or ought to pass an amendment?

280
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
Whatever is the legal way to do it.

281
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,000
Oh, okay.

282
00:26:51,000 --> 00:27:00,000
I was just, if it was, well, just to be certain, on the amendment, I presume you are...

283
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:03,000
I just spoke on the amendment.

284
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:05,000
You're moving the amendment.

285
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:07,000
Yes.

286
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,000
And I would second the amendment.

287
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,000
Yes, Mr.

288
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,000
Chair.

289
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Thank you.

290
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:21,000
Would you like to speak on the amendment, Representative Egan?

291
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,500
I think it was well thought out.

292
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Thank you.

293
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
Thank you very much.

294
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,000
Any questions or comments on the amendment?

295
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000
On the amendment 0582A?

296
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
A2H.

297
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
Seeing none.

298
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,500
On the amendment 0582H, will the clerk please call the roll?

299
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,500
Harb.

300
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,500
Yes.

301
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Representative Huff.

302
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,500
Yes.

303
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,500
Representative Huff.

304
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:55,500
Yes.

305
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
Representative Gould.

306
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
Yes.

307
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,500
Representative Horgan.

308
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,500
Yes.

309
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Representative Creighton.

310
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,500
Yes.

311
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,500
Representative Dodge.

312
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,500
Yes.

313
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,500
The clerk votes yes.

314
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Representative Healy.

315
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,500
Yes.

316
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,500
Representative Mayville.

317
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
Yes.

318
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,500
Representative Post.

319
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,500
Yes.

320
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,500
Representative Smith.

321
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,500
Yes.

322
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
Representative Post.

323
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,500
Yes.

324
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,500
Representative Smith.

325
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,500
Yes.

326
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
Representative Perez.

327
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,500
Yes.

328
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,500
Representative Grassi.

329
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,500
Yes.

330
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,500
Representative Gottling.

331
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,500
Yes.

332
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,500
Representative Cohen.

333
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Yes.

334
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,500
Representative Connors.

335
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,500
Yes.

336
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,500
Representative Vail.

337
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500

343

344
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
And we're...

345

And Representative Renzullo?

354
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,500
Yes.

355
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,500
Passed unanimously.

356
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Consent?

357
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:42,500
That was just on the amendment.

358
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:49,500
Does anyone wish to speak to House Bill 1188, ought to pass as amended?

359
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,500
Representative Smith.

360
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Thank you, Mr.

361
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
Chair.

362
00:29:55,500 --> 00:30:25,000
As I said at the public hearing, this bill came out of many past pieces of legislation that have been heard by this committee having to do with OHRV and their expanded use presently in New Hampshire and all over the country, actually, and how some of our statutes are out of date and everything's been put together piecemeal.

363
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:37,500
And a group of stakeholders met in August representing the OHRV industry, fish and Game, sheriffs, state police, legislators, and a lot of other people.

364
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:45,000
And the idea proposed by Executive Counselor Kenny was that we needed a long-term commission.

365
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:52,500
And so I began working on that, and this bill is the result of that.

366
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:57,500
The bill will last up until the election in 2026.

367
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:14,500
I didn't want it to be any shorter because I really wanted to give the Commission time to do their work, but I didn't want it to extend past that election in November 2026.

368
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
I ask you support.

369
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,000
I worked with a lot of stakeholders on this, and I thank them.

370
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,000
Any other one?

371
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,500
Anyone else wish to speak?

372
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Representative Egan.

373
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:51,000
I think this commission is essential because it equally balances the interest of the industry as economic development and tourism, but also respects the points of view and gets input from landowners and homeowners, and I will be supporting this piece of legislation.

374
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:55,000
Anyone else wish to speak to the motion?

375
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,000
Representative Vail.

376
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,000
Thank you, Mr.

377
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,000
Chair.

378
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:10,500
I'm speaking in support of the bill as amended, and I'm just really glad to see this moving forward.

379
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:12,500
Thank you, Mr.

380
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,500
Chair.

381
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm speaking in support of the bill as amended, and I'm just really glad to see this moving forward.

382
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:42,500
I hope that everyone will vote in favor of it because the five-year commission is really the way to go with trying to sort out a lot of the problems that we've been having and move ahead.

383
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,500
So thank you, Mr.

384
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:46,500
Chair.

385
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,500
Thank you.

386
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:52,500
Anyone else wish to speak on the motion?

387
00:32:52,500 --> 00:33:00,500

00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:51,500
I mean, okay, I'm sorry, I didn't do this one.

412
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:54,000

414
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:58,000
Well, see.

415
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Okay, go ahead.

416
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:05,000
It's on the notes here that says who's replacing who.

417
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,500
I'm sorry, Perez votes yes?

418
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,500
Yes.

419
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:11,500

Yes.

432
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Representative Jack.

433
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:39,500
Yes.

434
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:41,500
Representative Egan.

435
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,500
Thank you.

436
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,500
Connors.

437
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,500
Yes.

438
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Representative Vail.

439
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Yes.

440
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Representative Kelly.

441
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500

Representative Jack.

Representative Egan.

445
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,500
Yes.

446
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,500
And Representative Renzulu.

447
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,500
Yes.

448
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,000
Unanimously passed 21 to 0.

449
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,000
Unanimously passed.

450
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,000
Consent.

451
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,000
Seeing no objection, it's on consent.

452
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,000
All right.

453
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:21,000
House Bill 1227.

454
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,500
Open the hearing on 1227.

455
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:30,500
Relative to the definition of prime wetland, Chair recognizes Representative Huff for a motion.

456
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,500
Thank you, Mr.

457
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:34,500
Chairman.

458
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:40,000
I move that HB 1227 is rendered an expedient to legislate.

459
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,500
I'd ask for a second, and I'd like to speak to my motion.

460
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:49,000
Do we have a second?

461
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,000
Representative Creighton, second.

462
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:54,000
Representative Up, the floor is yours.

463
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
Thank you, Mr.

464
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,000
Chairman.

465
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:09,000
On this bill, in testimony, we heard from numerous organizations from the state as well as private that were against this bill.

466
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:21,500
Primarily because of the definitions, it would make it very, very difficult and cause costs, unforeseen costs and delays in pertaining basically to our highways.

467
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:31,500
And for that reason, that's why I would like this to be ITL'd, and I ask that you support that.

468
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,500
Thank you.

469
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,500
Representative Creighton, speak to your second.

470
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,500
Thank you, Mr.

471
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,500
Chairman.

472
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:51,000
I think it was said very well thank you anyone wish to speak to the motion representative grassy thank you mr.

473
00:36:51,000 --> 00:37:13,500
chairman and I'm sorry I couldn't be here when this bill was originally heard but and I'll keep it as brief as possible I think one of the comments that was just made is this will have additional cost to our highways if it's passed.

474
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:23,000
And there is an exemption in here to basically exempt DOT from work that they're doing within the wetlands.

475
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,500
But let me get back to the primary thing.

476
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:45,500
And one of the comments that was made during the testimony was that this, since they changed the rules to take out the supposed fingers and toes of a wetland that we haven't had any problems.

477
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:56,000
Well yeah they haven't any problems because they're there basically haven't been any new wetlands approved by any community since then.

478
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,500
Under current regulations I mean you can't really do a lot within a wetland anyway.

479
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,000
It's very restrictive building within a wetland.

480
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:31,000
It's these fingers and toes, which are the sensitive areas, that communities need to take a look at when they're concerned with erosion control, when they're looking at sediment going into major water bodies, when they're looking at contaminant filtering, when they're looking at flooding in their communities.

481
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:40,500
And communities that would consider this are communities which are basically have critical concerns within their towns or cities.

482
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:43,000
Communities just don't adopt this.

483
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:49,000
There's a major criteria that have to be taken a look at.

484
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:58,000
And it's reviewed by local and state as well before a community is approved for a prime wetlands.

485
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:09,500
And one of the things is that this is not a bill which is just going to automatically affect everybody in the state.

486
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:14,500
This is a bill which is a local option, basically.

487
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:45,500
It says that if you have a reason and a need to protect certain smaller portions of a wetland, which the main wetland is already pretty much protected, it's these smaller portions, then you need to go through the process, have it mapped, to have it identified, and to make sure that it meets the criteria for adoption as a prime wetland.

488
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:51,000
A local community will then have a vote of its town.

489
00:39:51,000 --> 00:40:03,000
Under the bill, the planning board that is doing these hearings are required to take into consideration the landowners that are involved and impacted.

490
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:16,000
And it's something that's not taken lightly in communities just for the fact that even prior to this, not a lot of communities adopted prime hotlands.

491
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Only those communities that felt that it was needed in their community.

492
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,500
And I would hope that this committee would vote in favor of it.

493
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:35,500
This has passed the House and the Senate previously, was vetoed by the governor.

494
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:46,500
This bill was worked out in a bipartisan way in the conference committee, the wording that we have here before us today.

495
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:59,000
It does exempt DOT from work because I know a lot of work that they do within wetlands and within other areas in the state.

496
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:01,500
Sometimes it's a critical need.

497
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,500
It's an emergency.

498
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:07,000
So we've taken care of those things.

499
00:41:07,000 --> 00:42:00,000
It's the developers who basically are going to go in and damage these wetlands that communities want to take a look at before they do to make sure that their concerns are addressed to make sure that they're not impacting flood storage of those areas or the ability to filter out contaminants are not impacted by these building within these areas or development with these areas and I would hope that the committee would would pass this and that we could send it to the the full house for consideration thank you so I vote no on ITL anyone else wish to speak on the motion?

500
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:10,000
Seeing no one, on House Bill 1227, the motion of inexpedient to legislate, will the clerk please call the roll?

501
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
Thank you, Mr.

502
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,000

Representative Harb?

504
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,000

Representative Gould?

508
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,000
Yes.

Thank you, Mr.

510
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000

We're not putting this on consent, right, Mr.

557
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,500
Chairman?

558
00:44:10,500 --> 00:44:12,500
I'm not.

559
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:14,500
I would.

560
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:16,500
No, that's all right.

561
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:19,000
No, I don't think so.

562
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
I don't think so.

563
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
I will have the minority report for you this weekend.

564
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Thank you.

565
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,500
And I will write the majority report.

566
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:39,000
How do I, after four to five times, how can we make it any different?

567
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:46,000
You did the minority report the last time we actually dealt with this bill.

568
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:48,000
That's right.

569
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:50,000
Okay.

570
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:54,500
I will close the hearing on House Bill 1227.

571
00:44:54,500 --> 00:45:01,500
Representative Egan, you do have some bills that are coming a little bit later.

572
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:05,500
Would you want me to move them forward?

573
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
I know you have...

574
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:11,000
Yes, they're delayed at that other committee.

575
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:13,000
Would it help?

576
00:45:13,000 --> 00:45:15,000
Would it...

577
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,000
It would.

578
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:23,500
I want to be able to admit that I will move them forward.

579
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,500
You're so kind, Mr.

580
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,500
Chair.

581
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:29,500
Thank you.

582
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
On House Bill 1498.

583
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:38,000
House bill 1498 establishing a safety program for off-highway recreational vehicles and snowmobiles.

584
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Representative Egan, I recognize you for a motion.

585
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:44,000
Thank you, Mr.

586
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:46,000
Chair.

587
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:57,500
I move for this bill to go to interim study, and I'd like to speak to my motion and ask for a second.

588
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:00,000
Do I have a second?

589
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Thank you, Mr.

590
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
Chair.

591
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,000
I'll be succinct.

592
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:51,000
In working with the industry and the Fish and Game Agency, there is a little bit of work to do on this bill to help refine costs to the riders, and that is why I think a study would require us, within a short amount of time, knowing the study would need to be completed by November, that I'd be able to work with Fish and Game, with the industry, with law enforcement to refine the concerns that folks have about the costs of safety training program to the riders.

593
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,000
And I want to respect that.

594
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:00,500
Therefore, I ask for it to go to interim study and thank you.

595
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,000
Representative Kelly to speak to your second.

596
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:19,500
I think that safety is an issue that we should be dealing with but at the same time it's a very tricky subject that we need to balance different competing interests.

597
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:32,500
So I think giving us time to talk with the parties involved and work towards a bill that works for everybody would be a good idea.

598
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:39,000
Anyone wish to speak or have a comment or speak to the motion?

599
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Representative Smith.

600
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,000
Thank you, Mr.

601
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Chair.

602
00:47:45,000 --> 00:48:11,500
And I wanted to add to that that since this is a complicated issue and we have just passed House Bill 1188, that any work that is done, if it hasn't come to its finale conclusion by November, that that work can be adopted by the Commission to help solidify the safety plan.

603
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:18,000
Because we know that there have been a lot of accidents this year.

604
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,500
I know I passed out a handout on that.

605
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:28,000
And many of those accidents are due to inexperience of riders.

606
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:34,500
And so this safety program is really needed, both for snowmobiles and OHRVs.

607
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,500
Thank you, Representative.

608
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,000
Is there anyone else who wishes to speak on the motion?

609
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:47,500
Seeing none, motion on House Bill 1498, motion of interim study.

610
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:49,500
It's tough to swallow.

611
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,500
Interim study.

612
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:55,000
Will the clerk please call the roll?

613
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,000

614
00:48:57,000 --> 00:48:59,000

An interim...

673
00:50:55,000 --> 00:50:57,000
Okay, read it down.

674
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,000

679
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:09,500

684

Representative Gottling, you wish to speak to your motion.

685
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:37,000
Thank you.

686
00:51:37,000 --> 00:52:00,500
You may remember when we considered this bill with this new and unusual method of having fun on the water and the fact that it is classified as a boat at present, And it really needs to have safety and all kinds of specifications made for it.

687
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:12,500
And we need to give Marine Patrol the authority to write the rules that will pertain to having this boat operate safely for everyone.

688
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:16,500
Do you wish to speak to your second?

689
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Thank you.

690
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:38,500
I just want to state that the current classification as a boat does not meet the needs of this new craft, and as Representative Gottling says, we need to move forward with some more requirements and safety protocol for this.

691
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:40,500
Thank you.

692
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:44,500
Does anyone wish to speak to the motion?

693
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:54,500

Yes.

717
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,500
Representative Jack.

718
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,500
Yes.

719
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:48,500
Representative Egan.

720
00:53:48,500 --> 00:53:50,500
And Representative Renzullo.

721
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:52,500
Yes.

722
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:54,500
That's 20 to 0.

723
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:57,000
You name is the past.

724
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,000
Consent?

725
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:01,000
It's consent.

726
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,000
It is on consent.

727
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:05,000
All right.

728
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:09,500
We'll open the hearing, close the hearing on 13th.

729
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:22,000
the here close the hearing on 1316 and open on House Bill 1440 I'll spill 1440 relative to surface water quality standards for perfluorinated chemicals.

730
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:25,500
Chair recognizes Representative Creighton for a motion.

731
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,500
Thank you, sir.

732
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,000
I move HB 1440 for interim study.

733
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,500
Do I have a second?

734
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,500
Second.

735
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,500
Second by Representative Harb.

736
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:42,500
Will you wish to speak to your motion, Representative Creighton?

737
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,500
Yes, sir.

738
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:52,500
The HB 1440 brings up an important point, which is protecting the waters in New Hampshire.

739
00:54:52,500 --> 00:55:21,000
Department of Environmental Services is charged with that task and has a study ongoing with imminent results to that study which will cover the chemicals associated in HP 1440 so I move interim study to allow the department to complete a study make its recommendations and take care of the health and safety of New Hampshire citizens.

740
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
Thank you.

741
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,500
Representative Harb to speak to your second.

742
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:39,500
I echo the comments of my fellow representative, and I think a study is required and would be of great assistance for this very important bill.

743
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:41,500
Thank you.

744
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:45,000
Anyone else to speak on the motion?

745
00:55:45,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Representative Smith.

746
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,000
Thank you, Mr.

747
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:51,000
Chair.

748
00:55:51,000 --> 00:56:13,000
I just wanted to add that in testimony, DES spoke that they are working on developing the rules for these, the PFCs in surface water, and that the rules will be out in the next couple of months, and they are in review now.

749
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:24,000
So hopefully we won't have to do too much because they will have done the work before we have a chance to.

750
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,500
But yes, I support the interim study.

751
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:31,500
Anyone else wish to speak on the motion?

752
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:39,000
Seeing none on the motion for on House Bill 1440, the motion is interim study.

753
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:42,500
Will the clerk please call the roll.

754
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,500
Thank you Mr.

755
00:56:44,500 --> 00:56:46,500
Chair.

756
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,500
Representative Harb.

757
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:50,500
Thank you, Mr.

758
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:52,500
Chair.

759
00:56:52,500 --> 00:56:54,500
Representative Harb?

760
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,500
Yes.

761
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:58,500
Representative Huff?

762
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,500
Yes.

763
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,500
Representative Gould?

764
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,500
Yes.

765
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
Representative Horgan?

766
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:08,500
Yes.

767
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:10,500
Representative Creighton?

768
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:12,500
Yes.

769
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:14,500
Representative Dodge?

770
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,500
Yes.

771
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:18,500
The clerk votes yes.

772
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,500
Representative Healy?

773
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,500
Yes.

774
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:24,500
Representative Mayville?

775
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:26,500
Yes.

776
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,500
Representative Post?

777
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:30,500

778

779
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:34,500

780
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:36,500
The clerk votes yes.

781
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:38,500
Representative Healy?

782
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:40,500
Yes.

783
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,500
Representative Mayville?

784
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,500
Yes.

785
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,500
Representative Post?

786
00:57:46,500 --> 00:57:48,500
Yes.

787
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,500
Representative Smith?

788
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,500
Yes.

789
00:57:52,500 --> 00:57:54,500
Representative Perez?

790
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:56,500
Yes.

791
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:58,500
Representative Grassi?

792
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,500
Yes.

793
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:02,500
Representative Gottling?

794
00:58:02,500 --> 00:58:04,500
Yes.

795
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:06,500
Representative Cohen?

796
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,500
Yes.

797
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:10,500
Representative Connors?

798
00:58:10,500 --> 00:58:12,500
Yes.

799
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:14,500
Representative Vail?

800
00:58:14,500 --> 00:58:16,500
Yes.

801
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
Representative Kelly?

802
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:20,500
Yes.

803
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:22,500
Representative Jack?

804
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,500
Yes.

805
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:26,500
Representative Egan?

806
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:28,500
And Representative Renzula?

807
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,500
Yes.

808
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:33,000
Unanimously passed 20 to 0.

809
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,000
Passes unanimously.

810
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:37,000
Consent?

811
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,000
Say consent it is.

812
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,000
All right.

813
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,500
Close the hearing on House Bill 1440.

814
00:58:44,500 --> 00:59:03,500
I'd like to actually step out of order because House Bill 1554 is Representative Egan's bill, and out of courtesy he is prime on another bill and another committee at the moment, and he is testifying at that.

815
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:14,500
I feel out of courtesy I will skip over and let him finish where he's doing and he'll come right back here.

816
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:19,000
I'd like to go on to House Bill 1602.

817
00:59:19,000 --> 00:59:24,000
First, I will not be taking any motions on this.

818
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:29,000
I'd like to discuss it a bit with the committee.

819
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:36,000
In our caucus this morning, we had some questions that went beyond the amendment.

820
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:46,000
I'd like to be able to have a work session on this to see if we can work that out.

821
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:52,500
We do have executive sessions on the 23rd, but the afternoon is open.

822
00:59:52,500 --> 01:00:02,500
So I'd like to be able to schedule a work session for this to work out those questions if possible.

823
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:14,500
And we will also, at the time, also schedule it for exacting no matter which way the work session works, how it works out.

824
01:00:14,500 --> 01:00:16,500
That's my plan.

825
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:33,500
I'd like to, obviously it's my right as chair to do it, but I think I do want to also get general consensus among the committee that it is the right thing to do.

826
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:36,000
It would be, oh, Mr.

827
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,000
Chair?

828
01:00:38,000 --> 01:01:02,000
I think it would be good to know what the concerns are because the amendment does make it so that schools and child care facilities, the only ones who would be required to do the testing would be those that are not on a public drinking water system.

829
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:16,000
And then also, as DES had requested, it also makes it so that the water is tested at the source, not at the individual faucet in the building.

830
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:34,000
So if we knew what the issues were that we're going to study, and we might have to get someone in here to help us out to figure it out, that would be good to know.

831
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,000
Yeah, Mr.

832
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:38,500
Chair, thank you very much.

833
01:01:38,500 --> 01:02:20,000
The major concern on here was where it says under line 21, public and private schools and licensed child care facilities shall within 30 days compare the results results and if they don't meet those standards then get a new test and the question is who's paying for that new test there was some confusion or whether DS just comes and does that or whether that is then incumbent upon those facilities to get that test and then the cost of the test.

834
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:33,500
I know, I just wanted to make sure that we knew what we were doing in terms of putting an onus on those companies to do that.

835
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:42,500
So I think it's the right thing to do, but it was just unclear who's paying for that.

836
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:45,500
Does that answer your question, Representative?

837
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,500
Yes.

838
01:02:47,500 --> 01:02:55,000
Not to say that between now and then, we had to think of some more.

839
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:05,000
I know I was going to suggest we ask Ted Dears to fill us in, but he has stepped out.

840
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:07,000
Oh, Brandon Kiernan's here.

841
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,000
That's good.

842
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:11,000
Mr.

843
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:13,000
Kiernan.

844
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:15,000
Thank you.

845
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,000
I'm Brandon Kiernan.

846
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:28,500
I'm the administrator of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Bureau at DES, and we had submitted a letter of testimony for this bill.

847
01:03:28,500 --> 01:03:41,000
One incremental option could be, and we offer this in our letter, is that there's about 150 entities that aren't testing for PFAS right now.

848
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:45,500
All the other schools, child care facilities are addressed.

849
01:03:45,500 --> 01:04:13,000
Is there're either public water system or get their water from public water system but there's about 150 in the next 18 months with our own staff and our own funds the bill would require the facilities to test every five years for three five-year periods perhaps we just see what this initial data says.

850
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:22,500
I can summarize the existing data for the public water systems for these facilities and share that with you.

851
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:25,000
We have that in hand.

852
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:30,000
And then within 18 months, we'd have those private wells.

853
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:44,000
And then once you see that data, you could see if it really made sense to keep testing every five years for the next 15 years after that.

854
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:51,500
Of course, you're not volunteering to do it for the next 15 years, are you?

855
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:56,000
No, we have funding for the next 18 months.

856
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:04,500
The funding expires, so that's why we offered to do one round in the next 18 months.

857
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:15,500
But then you would have data in hand to see if you think it's necessary to keep that requirement ongoing or not.

858
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:19,000
You could assess based on some information.

859
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:21,000
Okay.

860
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,000
Thank you.

861
01:05:23,000 --> 01:05:28,000
Any other questions by any other members of the committee?

862
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:38,500
Just as a question of order, the motion was, or you were suggesting that we continue this, but I hear Mr.

863
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,500
Kiernan saying he needs 18 months.

864
01:05:41,500 --> 01:05:47,500
How does that work into anything we might do with this bill?

865
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:58,000
Because we don't have 18 months to study this bill or do anything with it if we wait for his results.

866
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,500
I think we could achieve a shorter time frame.

867
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,500
18 months is just the window.

868
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:07,500
We have funding.

869
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:12,500
We do have a backlog of private wells, a sample.

870
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:19,500
We have hundreds we're trying to do in southern New Hampshire because of contamination.

871
01:06:19,500 --> 01:06:28,000
But we could try getting the majority of those 150 sampled in the next few months, potentially.

872
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,500
Right now, it's voluntary, though.

873
01:06:30,500 --> 01:06:51,000
We have no authority to enter their premise and collect samples, and some of them really hesitate to take on any more sort of discretionary assessments than they have to because they already are burdened with a lot of other things.

874
01:06:51,000 --> 01:06:58,500
So it's not a guarantee we'll get access to all 150 sites thank you mr.

875
01:06:58,500 --> 01:07:00,500
chair thank you mr.

876
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:17,500
Karen I'm sorry I didn't see you hiding in the back there would we need to amend the bill further to stipulate that DES would cover the first round of testing, in your opinion?

877
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:21,000
No, we're prepared to do the work.

878
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:31,000
I mean, it's totally the committee's discretion if they want to pass a law to require us to do it.

879
01:07:31,000 --> 01:07:41,000
But I can commit to you that we'll make an effort to sample those 150 over the next several months.

880
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,000
Again, several of them may decline that opportunity.

881
01:07:45,000 --> 01:08:09,000
And also we can summarize the data for the other 750 or so entities that we already have data for, the schools and child care facilities, so that for the work session you'll have some information to see the wisdom of making this an ongoing requirement or not.

882
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:11,000
Thank you.

883
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:13,000
Representative Grassi.

884
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:15,000
Yes.

885
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:29,000
Would requiring, would passing this bill give you more power as far as testing all the wells, you said, because some of them may not comply with testing?

886
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:41,000
Would passages of this bill, basically making it mandatory that they be tested, give you more authority to go in and test those wells?

887
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:49,500
It would give us the authority to require those wells to be tested one way or another.

888
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:59,000
The entity could still decline us doing the work, and then they could do it at their own expense.

889
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:03,000
But, yes, as proposed, it would be required.

890
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:07,500
The testing would get done one way or another.

891
01:09:07,500 --> 01:09:09,500
That is correct.

892
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:11,500
Any other?

893
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,500
Representative Cohen.

894
01:09:13,500 --> 01:09:17,500
Thank you for taking my question on this.

895
01:09:17,500 --> 01:09:32,500
So if we pass this bill today, would the department need for this year or next year to raise additional funds somehow or be funded additionally to make this happen?

896
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:43,500
Are you saying if we pass this, you have the funds for this year and next year all ready to do this?

897
01:09:43,500 --> 01:09:50,500
The legislature already allocated a sum of money to do PFAS investigations Thank you.

898
01:09:50,500 --> 01:09:58,000
you have the funds for this year and next year all ready to do this.

899
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:04,000
The legislature already allocated a sum of money to do PFAS investigations.

900
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:08,500
That money is available for the next 18 months.

901
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:17,000
So we have adequate funding to sample for the next 18 months for those 150 private wells.

902
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,500
Thank you for the clarification.

903
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,500
Seeing no further questions, thank you.

904
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:34,000
Rather than rush forward, I think it's easy enough to have our work session, talk it out, and hopefully come to a consensus.

905
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:39,500
Because I think there's a lot of value in this bill.

906
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:41,500
I know.

907
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:54,000
So I'm going to withdraw House Bill 1602 and we have a work session on it and also we will be executing it on 223.

908
01:10:54,000 --> 01:11:05,000
We have a, we will be, I will be adding that to the executive, excuse me, the execing list for that day.

909
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:07,000
right.

910
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:19,500
So right now we have only 15 54 and that is Representative Egan and also we have 1185 Representative Rung is bringing in an amendment.

911
01:11:19,500 --> 01:11:25,500
So I call a recess until one of those individuals shows up.

912
01:11:25,500 --> 01:11:28,500
Then we'll start the hearing again.

913
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:32,000
So Selva, I can save 10 minutes.

914
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,500
No, no, I saw them.

915
01:11:34,500 --> 01:11:36,500
Yeah.

916
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,500
Okay, well.

917
01:11:38,500 --> 01:11:40,500
Thank you.

918
01:11:40,500 --> 01:11:42,500
Thank you.

919
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:44,500
Thank you.

920
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,500
Thank you.

921
01:11:46,500 --> 01:11:48,500
Thank you.

922
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:50,500
Thank you.

923
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:52,500
Thank you.

924
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:54,500
Thank you.

925
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:56,500
Thank you.

926
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,500
Thank you.

927
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:00,500
Thank you.

928
01:12:00,500 --> 01:12:02,500
Thank you.

929
01:12:02,500 --> 01:12:04,500
Thank you.

930
01:12:04,500 --> 01:12:06,500
Thank you.

931
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:08,500
Thank you.

932
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Thank you.

933
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,500
Call the executive session to order for House Bill 1554.

934
01:12:15,500 --> 01:12:24,500
relative to online payment of fees and fines relating to the operation of off-highway recreational vehicles and snowmobiles.

935
01:12:24,500 --> 01:12:28,000
Chair recognizes Representative Egan for a motion.

936
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Thank you, Mr.

937
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,000
Chair.

938
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:42,000
I'd like to make a motion to pass House Bill 1554 with an amendment, Amendment 0548H, which you have received.

939
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,000
And I'm glad after a second to speak to both.

940
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,000
Okay.

941
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,500
Do I have a second?

942
01:12:51,500 --> 01:12:53,500
Second by Representative Gottling.

943
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:58,500
Representative Egan, do you wish to speak to your motion?

944
01:12:58,500 --> 01:13:00,500
Thank you, Mr.

945
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:02,500
Chair.

946
01:13:02,500 --> 01:14:23,500
What this bill does is basically enabling legislation allows the Fish and Game Department to be able to offer online registration for snowmobiles and OHRVs, allows them to to build that infrastructure and optionally be able to figure out then in their own rulemaking how to execute that and the amendment removed and optionally be able to figure out then in their own rulemaking how to execute that and the amendment removed fines because as we heard in testimony Fish and Game was concerned that they would have to work with the courts to figure out revenue distribution and a lot of other aspects that would make this bill more complicated than trying to help Dealers get vehicles OHRVs and snowmobiles registered allow fish and game to put the process online so we can have better data that could be used for it and That's why the amendment exists is to make the bill much more streamlined Oh, your amendment is 0548H.

947
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:25,500
No, this is 27.

948
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,500
I got 0274.

949
01:14:27,500 --> 01:14:29,500
Oh, OK.

950
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:31,500
Just all right.

951
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:43,000
7 4 oh okay just alright you wish to speak to your second representative let's keep it to the amendment first you're fine?

952
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:45,000
Okay.

953
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,000
All right.

954
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,500
Any questions on the amendment?

955
01:14:49,500 --> 01:14:51,500
Representative Harb.

956
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:55,500
Representative, thank you for maybe taking this question.

957
01:14:55,500 --> 01:15:05,500
My memory, and it's only my memory, was that Fish and Game had suggested renewal fees, not initial registration fees.

958
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:11,000
Is there a reason why your amendment didn't say renewal fees?

959
01:15:11,000 --> 01:15:13,000
Yes.

960
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:58,000
So in talking with the attorneys at OLS, the idea of giving more flexibility for Fish and Game to have rulemaking authority in the future if they decided that they wanted to include new registrations in an online process if we did if we just specified renewal then there would potentially have to be another bill created in the future more legislation to say you can register your new vehicles so that's why it just says establish any procedures that may be necessary to enable online payment of registration fees.

961
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:13,000
So you may still have to go into a dealer and register your new vehicle and verify your identification and your VIN numbers, And you could do that paperwork there.

962
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:22,000
You could potentially pay the fee online later, but it allows flexibility for the agency to do so.

963
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:26,500
And that's why renewal was not specifically called out.

964
01:16:26,500 --> 01:17:11,000
But the key for me in this amendment is that fines were what complicated it for tickets or violations and that we were just trying to streamline the process to make it easier on Fish and Game to register snowmobiles and OHRVs and make it easier for folks that have them to register online as opposed to burden retailers where they might normally go for all their goods before they go out and not have to hold up the line trying to register a new their snowmobile or HRV.

965
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,500
Representative Creighton for a question.

966
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,500
Yes, Mr.

967
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:17,500
Chair.

968
01:17:17,500 --> 01:17:28,000
Would it be possible to get Captain Eastman to testify on this just to verify that they have the same reading?

969
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:30,000
Absolutely.

970
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,500
Captain, could you come forward?

971
01:17:32,500 --> 01:17:34,500
Thank you, Mr.

972
01:17:34,500 --> 01:17:36,500
Chairman.

973
01:17:36,500 --> 01:17:50,000
When I testified earlier about renewal, I didn't want to be disingenuous or unclear that that's our intent, that this program would start as a renewal program.

974
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,000
program.

975
01:17:52,000 --> 01:18:17,500
Now certainly between now and 2025 when this comes into effect that we would have to have something in place if technology had evolved where we could dot our I's and cross our T's and make sure all that happened certainly we would be you know amicable to all of that.

976
01:18:17,500 --> 01:18:21,500
So we're satisfied with how the amendment looks.

977
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:28,000
So just to clarify for me, I'm from Hudson, I'm kind of thick.

978
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:36,500
It's that you're satisfied that within rules, you can go in either direction if you wanted to.

979
01:18:36,500 --> 01:18:44,500
You could say we will not do a, you will do, you will only do renewals.

980
01:18:44,500 --> 01:18:51,500
You can limit that without going, being contrary to the ordinance, to the statute.

981
01:18:51,500 --> 01:19:00,000
Yes, we would establish this all in rules and that we would be able to do renewals.

982
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:11,500
If that were to change in the future, yes, we would be able to change it within rules and then go from there.

983
01:19:11,500 --> 01:19:13,500
Thank you.

984
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:16,000
Representative Huff for a question.

985
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
Thank you, Mr.

986
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:20,000
Chairman.

987
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,000
Thank you for taking my question.

988
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:32,500
My question is, and I'm trying not to make this the hearing, you already have administrative rules making authority.

989
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:40,000
You already take in money, either by check or cash or however you do that.

990
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:49,000
Why do we need a law that says you can still do it at just a different avenue?

991
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
I'm not understanding.

992
01:19:51,000 --> 01:20:02,000
If you have the authority to take in money, why can't you just make the rule to take it in via internet?

993
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:05,000
I wish it were that simple.

994
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:18,500
Unfortunately, this would kind of is what we need to do or an impetus to get those who need to get this moving, if that makes sense.

995
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:22,000
Representative Egan, a question for Captain Eastman.

996
01:20:22,000 --> 01:21:19,000
And Captain, this does not preclude allowing retailers to still take registration live and it just creates an additional way for registration to take place online say for folks that might be out of state but if someone is still the local person that wants to go down to the local dealer and see their friend and register the machine it still allows that local relationship with their dealer or or agent to take place correct that's correct it's never our intent to get rid of registration agents or anything of that nature just to bring it online so that they would make it easier for our constituents thank you thank you very much.

997
01:21:19,000 --> 01:21:22,000
I haven't seen any other questions.

998
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:25,500
Anyone wish to speak on the motion?

999
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:29,500
First of all, to speak on the amendment.

1000
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:31,500
Anyone wish to speak?

1001
01:21:31,500 --> 01:21:33,500
Okay, by the way.

1002
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:39,500
On the amendment of 0548, will the clerk please call the roll?

1003
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:42,500
On the amendment of Representative Harb?

1004
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,500
Yes.

1005
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:46,500

Representative Horgan?

1010
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:56,500

Representative Goulds?

1012
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:00,500
Yes.

Representative Horgan?

1014
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:04,500
Yes.

1015

1016
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:08,500
Yes.

1017

Representative Dodge?

1018
01:22:10,500 --> 01:22:12,500
Yes.

1019
01:22:12,500 --> 01:22:14,500
The clerk votes yes.

1020

Representative Mayville?

1023
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:22,500
Yes.

Yes.

Representative Smith?

1027
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,500
Yes.

1028
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:32,500
Representative Perez?

1029
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500

Yeah, we'll just – To make it clear.

All right.

1131
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:04,000
Looking for a motion to adapt Amendment 0623H.

1132
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Moved by Representative Connors.

1133
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,000
Who second?

1134
01:29:08,000 --> 01:29:10,000
I'll second.

1135
01:29:10,000 --> 01:29:12,000
Representative Healy.

1136
01:29:12,000 --> 01:29:14,500
This is on the amendment.

1137
01:29:14,500 --> 01:29:17,000
He's speaking to the amendment.

1138
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:19,500
Thank you very much, Mr.

1139
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,500
Chair.

1140
01:29:21,500 --> 01:29:26,000
Also, for the record, my name is Rosemary Rung.

1141
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:32,000
I'm a representative for Hillsboro 21, which is the town of Merrimack.

1142
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:43,500
I want to thank the committee very much for their comments earlier this morning about some of the shortcomings of the previous amendment.

1143
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:51,500
It's a very popular amendment day at OLS, so I apologize for not getting here sooner.

1144
01:29:51,500 --> 01:29:59,500
But after discussing this with the drafting attorney, we made four changes to the previous amendment.

1145
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:16,500
And this is in response to your concerns about differentiating between septic collars that are unloading waste from a residential source compared to those that are bringing waste from a municipal or manufacturing source.

1146
01:30:16,500 --> 01:30:26,000
So you will see on line 24 on page one the term septic collars of industrial or commercial waste.

1147
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:31,500
We've also made that distinction on line 27 of page one.

1148
01:30:31,500 --> 01:30:38,000
And on page two, line three, and also on page two, line 7.

1149
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:50,000
Those are all the occurrences where septicol, or that term was used to describe the mode of waste going into a wastewater treatment plant.

1150
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,500
I'd be happy to entertain any questions.

1151
01:30:53,500 --> 01:30:55,500
Any questions?

1152
01:30:55,500 --> 01:30:57,500
Representative Post.

1153
01:30:57,500 --> 01:30:59,500
Yes, thank you, Mr.

1154
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:03,500
Chair, and thank you for taking my question.

1155
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:16,000
In line 15, on the back side, it says wastewater treatment facilities may collect samples for PFAS analysis from septage loads originating from residential sources.

1156
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:22,500
So that doesn't define the commercial industrial aspect, so they are still required.

1157
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:27,500
Well, I know it's a may, but it doesn't define.

1158
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:46,500
The reason that line was put in is the wastewater treatment facility has to take that waste when it's under contract with the municipality, but they want to be able to track the level of PFAS coming in.

1159
01:31:46,500 --> 01:32:10,000
So they may want to just get a baseline of the PFAS of that septage coming in in order to be able to predict how much may end up in their compost, in the case of Merrimack, or biosolids that would be discharged into a water body.

1160
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:13,000
So just for a follow-up, please.

1161
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:15,000
For a follow-up.

1162
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:20,500
Therefore, these folks will not be turned away from thank you.

1163
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,500
Correct.

1164
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:24,500
Any other questions?

1165
01:32:24,500 --> 01:32:26,500
Representative Harb.

1166
01:32:26,500 --> 01:32:29,000
I just have a comment.

1167
01:32:29,000 --> 01:32:34,500
I want to thank the representative for bringing forth this amendment.

1168
01:32:34,500 --> 01:32:39,500
It does meet the concerns that I had addressed earlier.

1169
01:32:39,500 --> 01:32:41,500
Thank you.

1170
01:32:41,500 --> 01:32:44,500
Thank you very much, Representative Harb.

1171
01:32:44,500 --> 01:32:46,500
And I concur.

1172
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:48,500
Anyone else?

1173
01:32:48,500 --> 01:32:50,500
Questions on the amendment?

1174
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:52,500
Seeing none.

1175
01:32:52,500 --> 01:32:58,000
On the amendment, 0623H, will the clerk please call the roll?

1176
01:32:58,000 --> 01:33:00,000
Thank you, Mr.

1177
01:33:00,000 --> 01:33:02,000
Chair.

1178
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:04,500

1179
01:33:04,500 --> 01:33:06,500

Representative Horgan?

1185
01:33:16,500 --> 01:33:18,500
Yes.

1186

Representative Creighton?

1187
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,500
Yes.

1188

Representative Dodge?

1189
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,500

1384
01:40:48,500 --> 01:40:50,500
Thank you.

1385
01:40:50,500 --> 01:40:52,500
Thank you.

1386
01:40:52,500 --> 01:40:54,500
Thank you.

1387
01:40:54,500 --> 01:40:56,500
Thank you.

1388
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,500
Thank you.

1389
01:40:58,500 --> 01:41:00,500
Thank you.

1390
01:41:00,500 --> 01:41:02,500
Thank you.

1391
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:04,500
Thank you.

1392
01:41:04,500 --> 01:41:06,500
Thank you.

1393
01:41:06,500 --> 01:41:08,500
Thank you.

1394
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:10,500
Thank you.

1395
01:41:10,500 --> 01:41:12,500
Thank you.

1396
01:41:12,500 --> 01:41:14,500
Thank you.

1397
01:41:14,500 --> 01:41:16,500
Thank you.

1398
01:41:16,500 --> 01:41:18,500
Thank you.

1399
01:41:18,500 --> 01:41:20,500
Thank you.

1400
01:41:20,500 --> 01:41:22,500
Thank you.

1401
01:41:22,500 --> 01:41:27,500
We have a piece of paper for everything we do.

1402
01:41:27,500 --> 01:41:48,500
This one, now this is a work session, so it comes on a different piece of paper, as opposed to the hearing, which comes on a different sheet of paper, and the executive session, which comes on a third type of paper.

1403
01:41:48,500 --> 01:42:00,000
But anyway, we're having a work session on House Bill 1438 relative to the use of moorings by persons other than permit holders.

1404
01:42:00,000 --> 01:42:04,000
We have had a hearing on this bill.

1405
01:42:04,000 --> 01:42:16,500
And toward the end of the hearing, we found out that the issues really revolved around moorings on the seacoast, and not moorings on lakes.

1406
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:21,500
Turns out they're under different jurisdictions, which everybody said, what?

1407
01:42:21,500 --> 01:42:31,500
So our committee researcher researched it, wrote a report for us on it, and got us in touch with Ms.

1408
01:42:31,500 --> 01:42:37,000
Marconi, who is, you'll have to give out your title, sir.

1409
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:39,000
But, Mr.

1410
01:42:39,000 --> 01:42:46,500
Marconi, if you could come up and talk to us about moorings on the seacoast.

1411
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:49,500
Identify yourself and your title, sir.

1412
01:42:49,500 --> 01:42:51,500
Good morning, Mr.

1413
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:53,500
Chairman.

1414
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,500
Good afternoon, Mr.

1415
01:42:55,500 --> 01:42:58,000
Chairman, members of the committee.

1416
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:11,500
For the record, Gino Marconi, I am the director of the Pease Development Authority Division of Ports and Harbors, affectionately known as the New Hampshire Port Authority.

1417
01:43:11,500 --> 01:43:24,500
By statute, RSA 12G, which is our enabling statute, we are responsible for the permitting and management and the placement of moorings in the tidal waters.

1418
01:43:24,500 --> 01:43:46,500
And so those tidal waters are from the Massachusetts border to the main border, three miles outside the Isles of Shoals, and up the estuaries like to the dam in Exeter, the dam in Newmarket, the dam in Durham, and the dam in Dover.

1419
01:43:46,500 --> 01:43:52,000
And in those tidal waters we permit upwards of 1,500 moorings.

1420
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:57,500
But with those moorings, the demand is greater than the areas.

1421
01:43:57,500 --> 01:44:11,500
So all of those procedures for moorings and wait lists are set forth in the Code of Administrative Rules, which from time to time we amend as necessary.

1422
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,500
Thank you.

1423
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:21,000
in the Code of Administrative Rules, which from time to time we amend as necessary.

1424
01:44:21,000 --> 01:44:34,000
This subject of the use of moorings, other than by the permit T, has been a subject that has come up many times over the years.

1425
01:44:34,000 --> 01:44:44,000
And the last time that it came up, at the time, it was Senator Fuller Clark who introduced some legislation.

1426
01:44:44,000 --> 01:44:57,000
And after some lengthy discussion about it, that piece of legislation required the Port Authority to establish a program for the temporary seasonal use of moorings.

1427
01:44:57,000 --> 01:45:15,000
And what that did was, and she used herself as an example, she and her husband are avid sailboaters and they would go down the coast of Maine at the time and their mooring was unused.

1428
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:24,500
So what she proposed was, and this is what we did through administrative rules, to set up this program.

1429
01:45:24,500 --> 01:45:53,000
If you was a mooring holder, we're not going to use your mooring, and you wanted to make it available for someone else to use, you would notify the Port Authority, and then in accordance with our waitlist regulations, we would go to the first few people on the wait list and say, there's a mooring available.

1430
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:56,000
It's only available for one season.

1431
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:58,500
Are you interested in it?

1432
01:45:58,500 --> 01:46:04,000
And so through the administrative rules process, we set that up.

1433
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:10,000
You couldn't go back and use it more than one consecutive year.

1434
01:46:10,000 --> 01:46:15,500
Any individual could not use that mooring more than one season.

1435
01:46:15,500 --> 01:46:18,000
I'll say it that way.

1436
01:46:18,000 --> 01:46:44,000
During the discussion in the committee hearings over that, one of the questions that was raised by the senator on the committee was, and I on the committee was, and I remember this very vividly, it was Senator Barnes, and he was sitting there, and he said, so I have a boat.

1437
01:46:44,000 --> 01:46:50,000
He says, and my buddy over here, Senator Odell, has a mooring.

1438
01:46:50,000 --> 01:46:56,000
And he says to me, Jack, you want to use my mooring?

1439
01:46:56,000 --> 01:46:58,000
And I say, sure.

1440
01:46:58,000 --> 01:47:14,000
And so because I'm friends with him, I get to go ahead of the 500 people on the wait list that have been waiting on the wait list for years about that.

1441
01:47:14,000 --> 01:47:29,000
And so that's why the language was amended in that, and that's why we went in under the direction of the legislature and set up this temporary seasonal mooring use.

1442
01:47:29,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Moorings are a very emotional issue.

1443
01:47:32,000 --> 01:47:50,500
We post the wait lists on the website and believe me people, if there's any change in that wait list position, we get phone calls because sometimes doing data entry, it doesn't always come across what's actual.

1444
01:47:50,500 --> 01:47:55,500
We're in the middle of the mooring reapplication period now.

1445
01:47:55,500 --> 01:48:04,500
And people are coming in because it's a treasured privilege to have a mooring in the tidal waters.

1446
01:48:04,500 --> 01:48:10,500
So I don't know what else I can say about the subject.

1447
01:48:10,500 --> 01:48:27,500
We get a lot of phone calls in the course of the summer from someone who will say, I'm sitting on my mooring and, you know, John, it has the mooring next to me.

1448
01:48:27,500 --> 01:48:29,500
Thank you.

1449
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:51,500
We get a lot of phone calls in the course of the summer from someone who will say, I'm sitting on my mooring and, you know, John that has the mooring next to me, he's not there but somebody else is on the mooring.

1450
01:48:51,500 --> 01:49:00,500
So if we have an asset available, we'll send one of the harbormasters down and look into it.

1451
01:49:00,500 --> 01:49:10,500
And if there is a boat that is not permitted to that mooring, we'll tell them that it's not acceptable.

1452
01:49:10,500 --> 01:49:26,000
But there's a lot of coast including the moorings out at the Isles of Shoals that we're responsible for and we've got a small force that is out there managing that.

1453
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:34,500
So I'd be glad to answer any more questions if you want more details on the process.

1454
01:49:34,500 --> 01:49:36,500
Chair's privilege.

1455
01:49:36,500 --> 01:49:40,500
Just as a clarification, you have now a...

1456
01:49:40,500 --> 01:50:00,500
a, someone can have a, if they're going to be gone they will tell you they will tell you or your organization that they're going to be gone and you will put someone else on that mooring from a list.

1457
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:06,500
And so it isn't like somebody else can, they can't choose somebody.

1458
01:50:06,500 --> 01:50:13,500
It's whoever's on the next one on the list for X amount of time.

1459
01:50:13,500 --> 01:50:15,500
That's correct.

1460
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:45,500
The way the administrative rule is is that we go to the wait list and make it known but I have to tell the committee in the number of years and I don't remember how many years it's been we have never had a mooring permit holder come to us and say, I want to make my mooring space available.

1461
01:50:45,500 --> 01:50:50,000
And we've never had anyone ask us about it.

1462
01:50:50,000 --> 01:50:55,000
We are not in the business of managing private property.

1463
01:50:55,000 --> 01:51:02,000
We are only in the business of permitting the use of submerged public land.

1464
01:51:02,000 --> 01:51:07,500
The mooring block and tackle and equipment belongs to the individual.

1465
01:51:07,500 --> 01:51:12,000
And we went through these scenarios in the discussion.

1466
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:16,500
So we put person A and person B together.

1467
01:51:16,500 --> 01:51:22,500
Now how they arrange the use of that mooring is between them.

1468
01:51:22,500 --> 01:51:29,500
Person B may say, I'll pay you and use your block and your tackle.

1469
01:51:29,500 --> 01:51:41,000
Person A may say, oh no, no, no, you're not using my gear, you bring your own gear, which is a substantial investment.

1470
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:47,500
These are questions that came up when we were working through these things.

1471
01:51:47,500 --> 01:51:57,000
Something that we're separated from, we're not involved in any personal business arrangements between player A and player B.

1472
01:51:57,000 --> 01:52:13,500
We just know that player B was next on the wait list, it It was offered to them, And whatever arrangements they made with the permit holder, we would issue them a permit.

1473
01:52:13,500 --> 01:52:17,500
But I just say that it's never happened.

1474
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:21,500
And the rules are still on the books.

1475
01:52:21,500 --> 01:52:30,000
And if someone came to us, we would certainly follow the administrative rules and making those available.

1476
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Thank you.

1477
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:34,000
All right.

1478
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,500
First, Representative, you wanted to speak first?

1479
01:52:37,500 --> 01:52:40,500
Thank you for taking my question.

1480
01:52:40,500 --> 01:52:43,500
You answered part of my question.

1481
01:52:43,500 --> 01:53:03,000
The other question that I realized from what you said, the person who takes it for one month, is that person put at the bottom of the list or does he still stay at the top of the list?

1482
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:05,000
Thank you, Mr.

1483
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:07,000
Chairman.

1484
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:10,000
Sir, thank you for your testimony.

1485
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:13,500
Just in the bill, it's more limited.

1486
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:19,000
It's not for the whole summer, so it's 30 days max.

1487
01:53:19,000 --> 01:53:28,500
And the person that is permitted gets to choose who picks it, gets to choose who uses the mooring.

1488
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:32,000
Do you foresee a problem with that?

1489
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:40,500
If we pass this, would that cause consternation among the list of people on the waiting list?

1490
01:53:40,500 --> 01:53:45,000
Or how do you think that would be handled?

1491
01:53:45,000 --> 01:53:57,000
I don't think there's any doubt in my mind or the staff's mind that this opens the door up for abuse of the mooring.

1492
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:19,500
One of the things that we're very diligent about down there is the illegal renting of moorings, falsifying of documents for someone who, you know, presents themselves as a boat owner and using a mooring that is not, the two pieces don't match each other.

1493
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:29,000
We think that this is an opportunity for abuse and for rental of moorings that are beyond our control.

1494
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:31,500
Yes, sir, for a follow-up.

1495
01:54:31,500 --> 01:54:53,000
So from your perspective, this bill would not be helpful in that there is already a system in place that could be used if bone rotors wanted to let the harbor master know that they were going to be gone for a month?

1496
01:54:53,000 --> 01:54:55,000
Yes, sir.

1497
01:54:55,000 --> 01:55:11,000
sir okay thank you thank you mr chair and thank you mr marconi for taking my question the temporary seasonal use of moorings program and the wait list is on that program?

1498
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:15,000
No, the wait list is for all moorings.

1499
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:17,000
Okay.

1500
01:55:17,000 --> 01:55:36,000
And the legislature and the jail car agreed that to be fair to the people on the mooring wait list who have been waiting, that if a mooring comes available, we would go through a process of notifying.

1501
01:55:36,000 --> 01:55:44,000
The rules say we'll notify by certified mail the first five people on the wait list.

1502
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:47,500
We give them ten days to respond.

1503
01:55:47,500 --> 01:55:57,000
If they respond no or they don't respond, we go to the next 10 people on the wait list.

1504
01:55:57,000 --> 01:55:59,500
That's how we do moorings.

1505
01:55:59,500 --> 01:56:13,000
And so that would be the process we would use if someone did come to us and want to be part of the seasonal temporary permit program.

1506
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,000
Thank you.

1507
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:24,000
And so I think I heard you say that no one has applied to do the temporary seasonal.

1508
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:31,000
No one has come to you and said, I'm going away for the summer.

1509
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:33,500
Someone can use my mooring.

1510
01:56:33,500 --> 01:56:35,500
That's correct.

1511
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:38,500
No one has ever done that.

1512
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,500
If I may, Mr.

1513
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:48,000
Chairman, I believe that a big part of that is the liability involved in it.

1514
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:54,500
And this is one of the things that we instruct our harbor masters.

1515
01:56:54,500 --> 01:57:00,500
Unless it is an emergency with immediate threat to life, limb, property.

1516
01:57:00,500 --> 01:57:20,000
Do not ever tell anybody, go hang on that mooring because if you're on that mooring and the condition of the mooring below the water is inadequate for that boat, that boat breaks loose, what's the liability of it?

1517
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:27,000
If we tell them to get on the mooring, then we're responsible for it.

1518
01:57:27,000 --> 01:57:45,000
If you're the person that has the permit and you allow somebody else to go on your mooring, there's a liability there unless there's a contractual agreement between you, which is something that we don't see.

1519
01:57:45,000 --> 01:58:03,500
So I think from what I've heard and understood from the voting public is the individuals have a concern over liability of letting somebody else use their private property, which is the block and the ground tackle.

1520
01:58:03,500 --> 01:58:05,500
Thank you.

1521
01:58:05,500 --> 01:58:08,500
Thank you for taking my question.

1522
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:10,500
Yes, sir.

1523
01:58:10,500 --> 01:58:25,000
I'm looking at the bill, and I'm thinking there's an unintended consequence here, and I want to know if it's a way you can enforce it if this happens.

1524
01:58:25,000 --> 01:58:30,000
I don't think this was the intent of the bill.

1525
01:58:30,000 --> 01:59:02,000
But if I own a home in the Seacoast area, and I use an Airbnb-type type situation and I don't say included is, you know, you're going to pay $75 extra a day because you're getting a mooring, but as part of the rental of that home for whatever period of time, mooring use is included, is there a way you can enforce that?

1526
01:59:02,000 --> 01:59:04,000
A way you'd know?

1527
01:59:04,000 --> 01:59:06,000
Sure.

1528
01:59:06,000 --> 01:59:08,000
Thank you.

1529
01:59:08,000 --> 01:59:12,000
Is there a way you can enforce that?

1530
01:59:12,000 --> 01:59:14,000
The way you'd know?

1531
01:59:14,000 --> 01:59:16,000
Sure.

1532
01:59:16,000 --> 01:59:31,500
In 2001, when the Port Authority was merged administratively with Pease, we had to go in and rewrite all of the mooring regulations because Port Authority's admin rules did not transfer.

1533
01:59:31,500 --> 01:59:40,000
And then at the time, there had been changes in the processes and forms of admin rules.

1534
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:48,500
So we went in, and before we even put pen to paper, we had several public outreach.

1535
01:59:48,500 --> 02:00:05,000
We mailed out to all of the existing mooring and wait list people that were on the books, invited them in to give comment on issues that they would like us to address.

1536
02:00:05,000 --> 02:00:12,500
So one of the things that we did do, we structured different types of moorings.

1537
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:19,000
We have commercial use moorings, commercial for hire moorings, and in those categories...

1538
02:00:19,000 --> 02:00:21,500
structured different types of moorings.

1539
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:51,500
We have commercial use moorings, commercial for hire moorings, and in those categories, a property owner can, if the use of the mooring has something to do with the business that he runs on the shore, he can come in and have his mooring declared a commercial use or a commercial for hire mooring if it's associated with a business.

1540
02:00:51,500 --> 02:01:06,500
That being said, once you deem a mooring a commercial use mooring, you have to year to year demonstrate that it continues to be used as a commercial use mooring.

1541
02:01:06,500 --> 02:01:10,000
And then furthermore, if I may, Mr.

1542
02:01:10,000 --> 02:01:19,500
Chairman, a commercial mooring is the only mooring in the system, the mooring permit in the system, that's transferable.

1543
02:01:19,500 --> 02:01:44,500
Because what we heard and what we saw was that over the years since the mooring program was put in in the 60s, that there had been a decline in commercial use of commercial activities in some of the harbors because everyone on the wait list was a pleasure boater.

1544
02:01:44,500 --> 02:01:50,000
And the commercial fishermen, they just, they don't think that way.

1545
02:01:50,000 --> 02:02:03,500
So that's why we established the commercial use boring so that we could flatline any decline in commercial activities in our harbor and it's maintained that way.

1546
02:02:03,500 --> 02:02:06,000
So, you know, if Mr.

1547
02:02:06,000 --> 02:02:08,500
Jones passes away and Mrs.

1548
02:02:08,500 --> 02:02:30,500
Jones is a surviving spouse and she wants to sell the lobster boat and the traps and all of the business, she has the ability to sell that equipment and that mooring permit can be transferred to the buyer if they meet certain criteria.

1549
02:02:30,500 --> 02:02:51,500
So the long way around to your question is if someone had a rental property, and and this even applies to condominium associations, they have the ability to have a commercial mooring that they could rent out or allow someone to use.

1550
02:02:51,500 --> 02:02:53,500
Thank you.

1551
02:02:53,500 --> 02:02:56,000
Representative Post for a question.

1552
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,000
Anyone else?

1553
02:02:58,000 --> 02:03:03,000
Raise your hand and I'll put you on the list.

1554
02:03:03,000 --> 02:03:05,000
Representative Post.

1555
02:03:05,000 --> 02:03:07,000
Thank you, Mr.

1556
02:03:07,000 --> 02:03:09,500
Chair, and thank you, Mr.

1557
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:12,000
Marconi, for being here today.

1558
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:22,000
I just wondered, for the seasonal mooring use for non-commercial, how many would you say folks take advantage of that?

1559
02:03:22,000 --> 02:03:49,500
are there people that are aware that they can do that yes I believe there are and like I said I mean there was there was when we do administrative rules or changes to them we send out notices public it's all public notices and as I said said, moorings are a very emotional subject.

1560
02:03:49,500 --> 02:03:53,000
People watch what goes on very carefully.

1561
02:03:53,000 --> 02:04:02,500
So to the best of my knowledge, people know about it, and we've never had any requests for it.

1562
02:04:02,500 --> 02:04:10,500
So would you say how many people use a temporary or non-commercial moorings during the season?

1563
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:14,500
Do you have any idea what turns over?

1564
02:04:14,500 --> 02:04:16,500
No one does.

1565
02:04:16,500 --> 02:04:21,500
There's been no demand, no questions, no asked about it.

1566
02:04:21,500 --> 02:04:24,000
No one's applied for it.

1567
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:37,500
No one's come to us and said, I want to make my mooring available it's just I don't know why thank you representative Huff thank you mr.

1568
02:04:37,500 --> 02:04:51,500
chairman and thank you for being here and helping us understand this my question is a little bit more basic I'm just not quite clear on this point.

1569
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:53,500
Somebody gets a mooring.

1570
02:04:53,500 --> 02:04:58,500
I'm curious as to the actual ownership of that mooring.

1571
02:04:58,500 --> 02:05:14,000
And by that I mean if I get a mooring, how long do I have it for and what do I have to do to keep it for is that term?

1572
02:05:14,000 --> 02:05:20,500
The mooring permit is issued for one year, April 1st to March 31st.

1573
02:05:20,500 --> 02:05:37,000
There is a reapplication period which we send out, the statute says, or the rules say, on or before January 15th, we will send out the pre-printed mooring reapplications to the current permittee.

1574
02:05:37,000 --> 02:05:47,500
The application with its required documentation and payment has to be received at the Port Office no later than March 1st.

1575
02:05:47,500 --> 02:05:58,000
There is, however, a 10-day late filing period, and it's 10 business days, so that can extend down to March 15th.

1576
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:08,500
For them to provide the application, the application fee, and then they have to show proof of ownership of the vessel.

1577
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:17,000
So in New Hampshire, the only way you can do that is by providing a boat registration.

1578
02:06:17,000 --> 02:06:53,000
So it comes in, everything is time-stamped when when they open the mail or someone comes in in person and then the administrative assistant she reviews it and if you're standing there she'll go through and say wait a minute I need it you didn't put your boat registration oh I left it in the tag out in Atlanta we'll make a copy of it so that they can complete the transaction.

1579
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:59,000
Then that's put into each box for each of the individual harbors.

1580
02:06:59,000 --> 02:07:11,000
So we hire harbormasters in the local harbor, and they're usually people that are from that area because they're more familiar with the constituency.

1581
02:07:11,000 --> 02:07:28,000
So down in Hampton Harbor, our harbormaster, you sit at his dining kitchen table, have a cup of coffee, he's got a glass window, he's looking right at the harbor so he knows everybody.

1582
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:36,000
So he'll take the permits in his area and he'll go through them and double check.

1583
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:47,500
Make sure that the proper documentation there and look to see if there are any issues that are outstanding with the permit applicant.

1584
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:49,500
Excuse me.

1585
02:07:49,500 --> 02:08:19,500
Then he'll sign off on it, and it goes back to the main office, and the chief and the deputy chief harbormaster, they'll take another second look at it, and if there's something that they flagged they'll talk to the local harbormaster then it's put it in the database and the mooring the mooring permit is issued to the applicant.

1586
02:08:19,500 --> 02:08:30,500
So basically every year it's theoretically a new owner or a leasee, I guess, even though it might be the same person.

1587
02:08:30,500 --> 02:08:32,500
Okay.

1588
02:08:32,500 --> 02:08:34,500
Yep.

1589
02:08:34,500 --> 02:08:36,500
Thank you.

1590
02:08:36,500 --> 02:08:38,500
If I may, Mr.

1591
02:08:38,500 --> 02:08:42,500
Chairman, we refer to it as a reapplication.

1592
02:08:42,500 --> 02:09:01,500
It's not a renewal because of a couple of court opinions that we went through way back in the day that the Superior Court said that these individuals that have the permit do not have a property right.

1593
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:10,000
It is a permit for the use of the submerged lands of the state of New Hampshire.

1594
02:09:10,000 --> 02:09:14,000
Any other questions by members of the committee?

1595
02:09:14,000 --> 02:09:16,000
You do?

1596
02:09:16,000 --> 02:09:18,000
Thank you, Mr.

1597
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:20,500
Chair, and thank you, Mr.

1598
02:09:20,500 --> 02:09:23,000
Narkoni, for taking my question.

1599
02:09:23,000 --> 02:09:26,500
How often do these moorings turn over?

1600
02:09:26,500 --> 02:09:29,500
Because I'm trying to clarify this.

1601
02:09:29,500 --> 02:09:35,500
I don't know anything about it, and I've been trying to read.

1602
02:09:35,500 --> 02:09:39,000
It doesn't sound like they ever do.

1603
02:09:39,000 --> 02:10:01,000
This is a season pass that someone owns public property for as long as they darn well please, and the other folks that are on the waiting list are going to have to wait until they expire or remove their boat from their registration.

1604
02:10:01,000 --> 02:10:04,000
So is that what I'm hearing?

1605
02:10:04,000 --> 02:10:11,500
I'm trying to get an idea on what this means for this waiting list people.

1606
02:10:11,500 --> 02:10:17,000
They use the public property for as long as they reapply.

1607
02:10:17,000 --> 02:10:19,000
That's correct.

1608
02:10:19,000 --> 02:10:29,000
We do track on a year-to-year basis, again, going back to the first time we went to court over it.

1609
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:45,500
And we looked at it and we tracked each year how many mooring reapplications were sent out, how many were returned by March 1st, how many were returned during the late filing period.

1610
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:49,500
How many of those are shorefront property owners?

1611
02:10:49,500 --> 02:11:06,000
Because by statute, a shorefront property owner is exempt from a wait list, so they can apply for a mooring directly in front of their property as an extension of their property line.

1612
02:11:06,000 --> 02:11:16,000
We have a line in that Excel sheet that says how many people have voluntarily given up their mooring permit.

1613
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:22,000
People will call us and say, I'm out of the boat business.

1614
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:25,500
My mooring is going to be available.

1615
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:28,500
I'm not going to renew it.

1616
02:11:28,500 --> 02:11:32,500
We know how many people have passed away.

1617
02:11:32,500 --> 02:11:39,500
And then we have a bottom line that we don't, they did not reapply.

1618
02:11:39,500 --> 02:11:43,000
We don't know what happened to them.

1619
02:11:43,000 --> 02:11:46,500
They may have moved out of town.

1620
02:11:46,500 --> 02:11:56,000
So those are the ones we know are going to be available at the end of the permit season.

1621
02:11:56,000 --> 02:12:08,500
However, we do get people that come in that are willing to take a mooring in a location that does not have a wait list.

1622
02:12:08,500 --> 02:12:44,000
Somebody came in and they wanted a mooring in the marsh behind Odeon Point it's not a desirable area but you know a young lady came in she had a small sailboat and she wanted a place to put it so she didn't have to launch it all the time and up behind Odeon Point by the golf course where there's no water at low tide, she was happy with that.

1623
02:12:44,000 --> 02:12:49,000
So it's examples like that that are less desirable places.

1624
02:12:49,000 --> 02:13:04,500
When you get into areas that are very desirable, for example, Rye Harbor, the person number one on the wait list down here has been on the wait list since 1993.

1625
02:13:04,500 --> 02:13:35,000
My wife was on the wait list for 19 years before she got a mooring and it wasn't in a very desirable place and then it was a couple of years later that another wait list spot that she was on that was actually close to the dock that my sister and I owned that we could keep a skiff at.

1626
02:13:35,000 --> 02:13:37,000
It was happy time.

1627
02:13:37,000 --> 02:13:48,000
But can you imagine what would have happened if, you know, oh, yeah, go ahead, here's a mooring for you over here.

1628
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:55,500
I would have 500 people that would burn my garage down if that ever happened.

1629
02:13:55,500 --> 02:14:01,000
One of the, if I may, just one last comment, Mr.

1630
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:03,000
Chairman.

1631
02:14:03,000 --> 02:15:23,000
One of the things that the staff, and we all discuss this during our staff meetings, especially with mooring permits, we go on the perception that one of these days, the Attorney General's office is going to walk through that door, and they're going to say say I want to see Tracy Shaddock's mooring profile and that better have a piece of paper from the day they were on the wait list to the day they were offered a mooring how they were offered the mooring a copy of the certified letter the original application every year that they reapplied for that morning permit because it happened in my predecessors and if there's one thing I learned from the legislative budget assistance audit division that did a 2000 year 2000 audit I keep that audit on my desk just to remind me don't let that happen again thank you for for the opportunity to give a little commentary there, sir.

1632
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
Representative Cohen for the second time.

1633
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:28,500
Thank you for the opportunity.

1634
02:15:28,500 --> 02:15:38,500
Yes, just for the record, for this bill, are you taking a position for or against this bill either way?

1635
02:15:38,500 --> 02:15:57,500
To take a position on this bill is a policy issue, Representative, and the policy is set by the PDA Board of Directors, and they have not discussed this because this just, as you know, came up recently.

1636
02:15:57,500 --> 02:16:00,500
So I'm here to answer questions.

1637
02:16:00,500 --> 02:16:21,000
My personal opinion is the director is, and I would give this advice to the board, is this would open the door for abuse of the mooring permits, and it would adversely affect the people that are on the wait list.

1638
02:16:21,000 --> 02:16:23,000
Thank you.

1639
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
Yes, sir.

1640
02:16:25,000 --> 02:16:27,000
Anyone else for questions?

1641
02:16:27,000 --> 02:16:33,500
Just thinking whether I should have another question, but I think I'll pass.

1642
02:16:33,500 --> 02:16:35,500
Thank you very much.

1643
02:16:35,500 --> 02:16:39,500
I think we all appreciate your coming in.

1644
02:16:39,500 --> 02:16:43,500
I think we I appreciate your coming in.

1645
02:16:43,500 --> 02:16:53,500
I think we all appreciate your coming in and enlightening us on an area that we know very little about.

1646
02:16:53,500 --> 02:17:01,000
It's my pleasure, and thank you for the opportunity to talk about the Port Authority.

1647
02:17:01,000 --> 02:17:08,500
And if you ever have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to us.

1648
02:17:08,500 --> 02:17:11,000
That's what we're here for.

1649
02:17:11,000 --> 02:17:13,000
Thank you.

1650
02:17:13,000 --> 02:17:15,000
Thank you, sir.

1651
02:17:15,000 --> 02:17:18,000
Thank you, members of the committee.

1652
02:17:18,000 --> 02:17:20,000
Thank you.

1653
02:17:20,000 --> 02:17:36,500
Members of the committee, by the way, just Representative Tarosian has passed in an amendment concerning his bill on 1438, which basically encompasses now the moorings in the shore, in the harbor waters.

1654
02:17:36,500 --> 02:17:43,500
Anything else that we want to just, you know, this is a work session.

1655
02:17:43,500 --> 02:18:05,500
it was just to collect additional information I've got a few additional minutes I think I will just let Representative Tarosian just for just for a few minutes if you wish to speak to your memo or your amendment just because Thank you, Mr.

1656
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:08,500
Chair and members of the committee.

1657
02:18:08,500 --> 02:18:17,000
Yes, as the chair said, when the bill was drafted, it used the wrong RSA in there.

1658
02:18:17,000 --> 02:18:22,000
This amendment cleans it up to be the appropriate reference.

1659
02:18:22,000 --> 02:18:32,500
If I may, I'd just like to say that I think the Director and I are talking about something slightly different.

1660
02:18:32,500 --> 02:18:34,500
different.

1661
02:18:34,500 --> 02:18:51,500
What the intent was and what you heard when I testified on this bill prior was to allow permit holders to make their mooring available to people when they're going to be away traveling.

1662
02:18:51,500 --> 02:19:07,500
So in other words, a lot of boat owners travel up to Maine or down to the Cape or Islands, and their mooring may be empty for two weeks or a month.

1663
02:19:07,500 --> 02:19:19,000
To be clear, and I testified this before, it never said, and the intent was not for it to be a paid situation.

1664
02:19:19,000 --> 02:19:21,500
It was a non-paid use.

1665
02:19:21,500 --> 02:19:29,000
And you heard the director say that there aren't many people on the waiting list.

1666
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:34,000
The intent of this legislation is not to undermine that.

1667
02:19:34,000 --> 02:19:39,000
And you heard that people don't take advantage of that.

1668
02:19:39,000 --> 02:19:50,500
If you have a vessel that's not a trailer boat, you're not going to put it in for two weeks or a month.

1669
02:19:50,500 --> 02:19:53,000
There is your summer mooring.

1670
02:19:53,000 --> 02:20:06,500
If you have a boat that size and you don't have a mooring, it's either not going in the water or you have a mooring someplace else.

1671
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:18,000
This is practice in other states, in many other locations where sale clubs, of which I'm a member of one, does a list.

1672
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:27,000
You put down the mooring you have, and you let membership know if it's going to be vacant.

1673
02:20:27,000 --> 02:20:42,500
And as I said before, I've observed and many people have told me that many of these moorings, I've seen it myself, sit empty most or a lot of the summer.

1674
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:59,500
The intent of this was to take a resource that's underutilized at that point and make it available to allow voters to use that resource, come in and visit the state, and spend money.

1675
02:20:59,500 --> 02:21:02,500
It was a good economic thing.

1676
02:21:02,500 --> 02:21:33,500
It's a little bit different than being on the wait list and say, I want to use it for part of the summer so just for a point of clarification I think we're talking about something slightly different there you know you take any questions if the committee has any any questions thank you thank you that's it for our work session.

1677
02:21:33,500 --> 02:21:38,500
And we'll start the hearing on 1071 in five minutes.

1678
02:21:38,500 --> 02:21:40,500
Thank you.

1679
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:42,500
Thank you.

1680
02:21:42,500 --> 02:21:44,500
Thank you.

1681
02:21:44,500 --> 02:21:46,500
Thank you.

1682
02:21:46,500 --> 02:21:48,500
Thank you.

1683
02:21:48,500 --> 02:21:50,500
Thank you.

1684
02:21:50,500 --> 02:21:52,500
Thank you.

1685
02:21:52,500 --> 02:21:54,500
Thank you.

1686
02:21:54,500 --> 02:21:56,500
Thank you.

1687
02:21:56,500 --> 02:21:58,500
Thank you.

1688
02:21:58,500 --> 02:22:00,500
Thank you.

1689
02:22:00,500 --> 02:22:05,500
Representative Gottling, you will be the presenter of the bill.

1690
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:07,500
Okay.

1691
02:22:07,500 --> 02:22:11,500
I'm trying to get separated for how many?

1692
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:13,500
Four.

1693
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:15,500
Four.

1694
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,500
Okay.

1695
02:22:17,500 --> 02:22:19,500
I'm looking at four.

1696
02:22:19,500 --> 02:22:22,000
I got four and against.

1697
02:22:22,000 --> 02:22:24,000
And I'll try to.

1698
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:26,000
Yeah.

1699
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:28,000
All right.

1700
02:22:28,000 --> 02:22:32,000
I'm going to call the hearing to order.

1701
02:22:32,000 --> 02:22:38,000
I'm going to, the chair calls Representative Gottling to introduce the bill.

1702
02:22:38,000 --> 02:22:40,000
Thank you.

1703
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,000
Thank you, Mr.

1704
02:22:42,000 --> 02:22:44,000
Chairman and committee members.

1705
02:22:44,000 --> 02:22:50,000
I'm Representative Sue Gottling from Sullivan District 2, representing Sunapee and Croydon.

1706
02:22:50,000 --> 02:23:06,000
Thank you for the opportunity to present HB 1071 relative to wake surfing, a bill that, like its predecessors, has generated many enthusiastic responses from the environmental community and the recreation community.

1707
02:23:06,000 --> 02:23:20,000
First, I would like to make clear that this bill is not a step toward banning wake surfing and the boats that create the wakes for this activity.

1708
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:39,000
Second, I believe that those who favor HB 1071 agree with those who oppose it, that ramping up education of the boating public and firm enforcement of boating rules are important components of protecting New Hampshire's water bodies.

1709
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:53,500
In fact, the efforts of wakeboat dealers to promote the Wake Responsibly campaign is contributing to boater safety and increased respect for one's neighbors on and off the water.

1710
02:23:53,500 --> 02:24:07,500
Despite this campaign, however, as you may know, concerns and problems remain, and this was made even clearer by the host of emails that you have been receiving.

1711
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:15,500
At my last count, there were more than 200 in favor of 1071 and 30 opposed.

1712
02:24:15,500 --> 02:24:27,500
In favor were several lake and watershed associations, the Lake Management Advisory Commission, the Rivers Management Advisory Commission, and the Lake Sunapee Rowing Club.

1713
02:24:27,500 --> 02:24:35,000
The vote online at last count was the other direction, perhaps about 1,000 to 600.

1714
02:24:35,000 --> 02:24:42,000
So shall we say there is no lack of response to this particular bill.

1715
02:24:42,000 --> 02:25:01,000
250 feet clearance, an interest of 100 feet from the present requirement of 150 feet, was chosen as a reasonable step forward in responding to citizen concerns about the detrimental effects of wake surfing waves, height, and strength.

1716
02:25:01,000 --> 02:25:13,000
These concerns include damage to shoreline and to docks, as well as boats tied up at docks, and even lounge furniture on the docks.

1717
02:25:13,000 --> 02:25:21,000
Further concerns were threats to kayakers, paddleboarders, swimmers, and waiting children confronted with large forceful waves.

1718
02:25:21,000 --> 02:25:24,500
Emails cited specific evidence of these threats.

1719
02:25:24,500 --> 02:25:39,000
250 feet was also seen as allowing wake surfing activity on virtually all of New Hampshire's water bodies, although it might be limited on some of the narrower portions.

1720
02:25:39,000 --> 02:25:54,500
Because Marine Patrol officers are highly trained in determining distances, and some carry laser devices for even more accurate measurement, enforcement would not be made more difficult with a 250-foot separation.

1721
02:25:54,500 --> 02:26:02,000
When HB 1071 was filed, the University of Minnesota study was still in peer review.

1722
02:26:02,000 --> 02:26:15,500
Recently, the study has been issued, and many of the comments in favor of 1071 are related to the scientific conclusions about wakeboat waves' height and force.

1723
02:26:15,500 --> 02:26:22,000
They express a strong desire for a much greater distance than 250 feet.

1724
02:26:22,000 --> 02:26:28,500
However, many understand that this bill, as written, is an important step forward.

1725
02:26:28,500 --> 02:26:50,000
At the present time, I remain in favor of the distance in this bill as a first step in a fair direction intended to enhance protection of our economically important shoreline and water bodies while allowing wake surfing to continue with minimal adjustment.

1726
02:26:50,000 --> 02:27:03,500
As the University of Minnesota study is further examined, it will lead to more research and perhaps legislation to answer some of those questions it has raised.

1727
02:27:03,500 --> 02:27:07,500
But that's for tomorrow and not for today.

1728
02:27:07,500 --> 02:27:09,500
Thank you.

1729
02:27:09,500 --> 02:27:12,000
Any questions of the representative.

1730
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:18,000
Seeing none, you may take your position back on the board, please.

1731
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:24,500
Anybody wants to borrow my copy of the 102-page report, I'll end it.

1732
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:26,500
Chair calls Representative Smith.

1733
02:27:26,500 --> 02:27:29,500
Good afternoon, committee members and Mr.

1734
02:27:29,500 --> 02:27:34,000
Chair, and thank you for the opportunity to testify.

1735
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
I am Suzanne Smith.

1736
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:46,000
I represent the towns of Plymouth, Hebron, and Holderness, Grafton County, District 8, home of both Squam Lake and Newfoundland.

1737
02:27:46,000 --> 02:27:48,000
am Suzanne Smith.

1738
02:27:48,000 --> 02:27:58,500
I represent the towns of Plymouth, Hebron, and Holderness, Grafton County, District 8, home of both Squam Lake and Newfound Lake.

1739
02:27:58,500 --> 02:28:18,000
And I'm speaking in support of House Bill 1071, which will extend the safe passage area on our lakes and ponds from 150 feet to 250 feet, only when the boater is engaged in the sport of wake surfing.

1740
02:28:18,000 --> 02:28:36,500
If you're just cruising around in your wake boat or any other boat, you would not be subject to the increased distance, nor would you be affected if you are towing a wakeboarder or a water skier.

1741
02:28:36,500 --> 02:28:41,500
This bill only applies to the activity of wake surfing.

1742
02:28:41,500 --> 02:28:49,500
In 2019-2020, I served as chair of the Commission to Study Wake Boats in New Hampshire.

1743
02:28:49,500 --> 02:29:07,500
In addition to state reps and senators, members on the commission represented lake associations in New Hampshire, members of the public, Department of Environmental Services, Marine Patrol, the Marine Trades Organization, water sports industry, and others.

1744
02:29:07,500 --> 02:29:14,000
In fact, one gentleman flew up monthly from Florida to attend our meetings.

1745
02:29:14,000 --> 02:29:27,500
We didn't always agree, but we did learn a lot about wake boats, wakeboarding, wake surfing, and the wakes that these boats produce, the waves they produce.

1746
02:29:27,500 --> 02:29:37,500
We did review a study titled Wake Sport Wave Energy Study, which was funded by the Water Sports Industry Association.

1747
02:29:37,500 --> 02:29:43,500
A long-awaited study, which was referenced by Representative Gottling, conducted by St.

1748
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:53,000
Anthony Falls Library at the University of Minnesota, titled Boat-Generated Wake Wave Study, was finally published a week ago.

1749
02:29:53,000 --> 02:30:00,000
Now, back when I was on the commission, this study was just being started.

1750
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:06,000
They were just trying to get funding together to do the study.

1751
02:30:06,000 --> 02:30:17,500
And it took them, since fall of 2020, when they went out on the lake and did their review of wakes and waves.

1752
02:30:17,500 --> 02:30:28,000
It took them this long to release the results because after reviewing the data and doing all their research, it's peer-reviewed.

1753
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:33,500
So it has a lot of people did look at this.

1754
02:30:33,500 --> 02:30:45,000
I distributed the FAQs on the study to all of you, so you can take a look at that in your spare time.

1755
02:30:45,000 --> 02:31:47,500
And studies put together to learn about the waves produced by different sports is really important, and it's important that that is really trustworthy research because as we know from our field trip last summer or from our personal experiences on our lakes of New Hampshire large waves are necessary to surf the wake the final analysis of the University of Minnesota study was that wake surfing boats fully ballasted, that means they are containing up to 2,000 pounds of water to weigh them down, and being driven at speeds of 10 to 12 miles an hour, which is the speed that works best when a wake surfer is behind the boat, it took 500 feet or the the waves produced, to dissipate at shore.

1756
02:31:47,500 --> 02:31:57,000
You know, if it was 250, 200, the waves were still really strong when they got to the shore.

1757
02:31:57,000 --> 02:32:11,500
And I do have some maps, which I believe were passed around also, that shows a 500-foot buffer versus the existing 150-foot buffer on some of our major lakes.

1758
02:32:11,500 --> 02:32:23,500
Now, Winnipesaukee isn't included because it is so large that there is a lot of space for wake boating and wake surfing on Winnipesaukee.

1759
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:35,000
But Newfound Lake, you can see most of Newfound Lake is still available for wake surfing, because it is a fairly wide lake.

1760
02:32:35,000 --> 02:32:45,500
Squam, there are a lot of little coves, so those little coves would be more problematic if you were wake surfing.

1761
02:32:45,500 --> 02:33:01,500
However, you can start at your dock no matter where it is on a lake and just travel at headway speed out to that 500-foot area and then do your wake surfing.

1762
02:33:01,500 --> 02:33:10,000
If you're not carrying a wake surfer, you only have that 150-foot buffer if this bill passes.

1763
02:33:10,000 --> 02:33:13,000
So I ask you to consider.

1764
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:21,000
New Hampshire's waters are held in trust for the public, for the people of New Hampshire.

1765
02:33:21,000 --> 02:33:28,500
And yes, those who enjoy motorized water boats, which produce wakes, should be able to.

1766
02:33:28,500 --> 02:33:39,500
But the peaceful enjoyment of those who enjoy swimming, sunbathing on their docks, or enjoying non-motorized water activities should not be ignored.

1767
02:33:39,500 --> 02:33:42,000
The water belongs to all.

1768
02:33:42,000 --> 02:33:59,500
We need to find a balance, and extending the buffer for boats engaged in wakesurfing, which has been shown more than once to produce large waves, larger than water skiing or even tubing, is reasonable.

1769
02:33:59,500 --> 02:34:04,500
So I ask for your support for House Bill 1071.

1770
02:34:04,500 --> 02:34:11,500
So there's a place for everyone on New Hampshire's lakes, great ponds, and rivers.

1771
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:13,500
And thank you.

1772
02:34:13,500 --> 02:34:19,500
And if anyone has any questions, I will try to answer them.

1773
02:34:19,500 --> 02:34:22,000
Representative Gould for a question.

1774
02:34:22,000 --> 02:34:25,000
Thank you for taking my question.

1775
02:34:25,000 --> 02:34:31,500
And does the depth of the lake make a difference with these boats?

1776
02:34:31,500 --> 02:34:37,500
Because I always thought that Squam Lake, for example, is rather shallow.

1777
02:34:37,500 --> 02:34:40,000
Depth definitely makes a difference.

1778
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:48,500
The engines for these type of boats kind of point the way back, point the energy down.

1779
02:34:48,500 --> 02:34:54,500
So the more shallow the lake, the more problematic that can be.

1780
02:34:54,500 --> 02:34:56,500
The people at St.

1781
02:34:56,500 --> 02:35:09,000
Anthony's Falls, University of Minnesota, their next study is going to be the effects on the underlying ground because there are concerns of sediment being.

1782
02:35:09,000 --> 02:35:31,000
We did have on the Wake Boat Study Commission website, there are studies that talk about sediment, and the final report has about two pages on the sediment that's churned up when people are running these boats at speeds where the water is shallow.

1783
02:35:31,000 --> 02:35:33,000
Any other questions?

1784
02:35:33,000 --> 02:35:35,000
Representative Creighton.

1785
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:37,000
Thank you, Mr.

1786
02:35:37,000 --> 02:35:39,000
Chairman.

1787
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:46,000
Representative, I appreciate the maps you sent around with the 500 indicated on them.

1788
02:35:46,000 --> 02:35:50,000
Those are the biggest lakes in New Hampshire.

1789
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:57,500
As you did your study, how many of the smaller lakes are there wakeboards on?

1790
02:35:57,500 --> 02:36:15,500
The concern is that much of that water is taken away, especially in the coves, and so you have a small, narrow strip in the middle of the lake where you can actually use a wakeboat.

1791
02:36:15,500 --> 02:36:20,000
On a smaller lake, you're really prohibiting, then boats.

1792
02:36:20,000 --> 02:36:31,500
If you get to anything, Franklin Pierce, for example, you probably couldn't use a wake boat because that strip would be so narrow.

1793
02:36:31,500 --> 02:36:35,000
What did your study say to that?

1794
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:38,500
What did the commission say to that?

1795
02:36:38,500 --> 02:36:57,500
Actually, if I go back to the initial public hearing on the bill that formed the Wake Boat Study Commission, we had people who came and were on small lakes, and there were wake boats on those lakes.

1796
02:36:57,500 --> 02:37:09,000
And then we had people who lived on the lakes that had a wake boat, and they said, I just bought this boat.

1797
02:37:09,000 --> 02:37:15,000
Now you're going to tell me I can't be on this lake?

1798
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:19,000
And so it's trying to find that balance.

1799
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:23,000
But this bill is particularly for wake surfing.

1800
02:37:23,000 --> 02:37:40,500
On wake boats, you can also be doing wakeboarding, which this bill does not apply to, which is where you're – the distance behind the boat that, say, for instance, a water skier would be.

1801
02:37:40,500 --> 02:37:44,500
And that is not covered by this legislation.

1802
02:37:44,500 --> 02:38:07,000
It's just the wake surfing because there was a study out of Georgia, which I don't have the particulars on, but probably someone behind me could answer that, that talked about the waves produced by wake surfing were so much higher than even for wakeboarding.

1803
02:38:07,000 --> 02:38:42,500
So it would limit your use but not eliminate the ability to use the boat and I have asked people who sell the boats do you ask people what lake they're going to use the boat on so they don't get into situation where all of a sudden their neighbors are all complaining because it's such a small lake I mean the the maps I passed around there is one there.

1804
02:38:42,500 --> 02:38:55,000
There are a couple small ones on there to show you, and those are lakes that I believe do have at least one wake bone.

1805
02:38:55,000 --> 02:38:57,000
Sure.

1806
02:38:57,000 --> 02:39:00,000
Any other questions from Representative Cohen?

1807
02:39:00,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Thank you for taking my question, Representative Smith.

1808
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:17,000
We've received a lot of emails and a lot of information or pictures of environmental damage from wakes, and I appreciate looking at that as well.

1809
02:39:17,000 --> 02:39:33,000
I'm just wondering on your committee, one thing that didn't come across in anything yet was, has anything on your committee discovered anything to exotic species, any damage because of wakeboat surfing?

1810
02:39:33,000 --> 02:39:36,500
Do you have any information on that?

1811
02:39:36,500 --> 02:39:41,000
On the Wakeboat Study Commission, we did address that.

1812
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:50,000
We had a presentation from Amy Smagula, who's the expert in New Hampshire, in my opinion, on it.

1813
02:39:50,000 --> 02:40:16,500
And she did express concerns, but more of her concerns were when on the boats themselves with the ballast bags, filling them with water and taking in eggs and small pieces of plant that are then shot back out into the water of another lake or a different part of that particular lake.

1814
02:40:16,500 --> 02:40:30,000
However, when you're talking about shallow water stirring up the bottom, it can definitely unhinge exotic species who then are transmittable to different parts of the lake.

1815
02:40:30,000 --> 02:40:32,000
Thank you.

1816
02:40:32,000 --> 02:40:36,000
Any other questions from members of the committee?

1817
02:40:36,000 --> 02:40:39,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

1818
02:40:39,000 --> 02:40:42,000
You may take your seat back.

1819
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:44,000
Clean off the microphone.

1820
02:40:44,000 --> 02:40:46,000
Thank you.

1821
02:40:46,000 --> 02:40:51,500
Chair calls John Walley from the New Hampshire Marine Trades Association.

1822
02:40:51,500 --> 02:40:53,500
Oh, where are you?

1823
02:40:53,500 --> 02:40:55,500
Not here.

1824
02:40:55,500 --> 02:40:57,500
Thank you.

1825
02:40:57,500 --> 02:40:59,500
Thank you.

1826
02:40:59,500 --> 02:41:01,500
Where did he go?

1827
02:41:01,500 --> 02:41:03,500
Thank you.

1828
02:41:03,500 --> 02:41:05,500
Hey.

1829
02:41:05,500 --> 02:41:07,500
All right.

1830
02:41:07,500 --> 02:41:09,500
Sorry about that.

1831
02:41:09,500 --> 02:41:12,000
My name is John Wally.

1832
02:41:12,000 --> 02:41:26,000
I'm the general manager at Silver Sands Marina and the vice president of the New Hampshire Marine Trades Association, and we are here to oppose House Bill 1071.

1833
02:41:26,000 --> 02:41:33,000
I'd like to give you an overview of the boating culture in New Hampshire.

1834
02:41:33,000 --> 02:41:35,000
The culture is strong.

1835
02:41:35,000 --> 02:41:47,000
Boating and fishing providing $1.2 billion to the outdoor recreation portion of the New Hampshire economy in 2020, supporting 275 businesses and 6,800 jobs.

1836
02:41:47,000 --> 02:41:54,500
That data comes from 2019, and we anticipate those numbers to be high when reported.

1837
02:41:54,500 --> 02:42:07,000
2021, we saw the all-time high of 107,000 boat registrations in the state of New Hampshire, providing people with a lot of fun this summer.

1838
02:42:07,000 --> 02:42:14,000
But those boats chose challenges for public use and a lot of active waterways.

1839
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:24,500
It is important to recognize that New Hampshire relies on summer tourism, and recreational boating is a pivotal part of that.

1840
02:42:24,500 --> 02:42:29,000
Bills like House Bill 1071 will limit public access.

1841
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:40,500
It will create dangerous water conditions by forcing wake surfers into bigger parts of the lake where boats travel quickly and more densely.

1842
02:42:40,500 --> 02:42:45,000
This bill just moves issues into somebody else's backyard.

1843
02:42:45,000 --> 02:42:47,000
This poses unintended consequences.

1844
02:42:47,000 --> 02:42:51,500
Rather than restricting, we would like to see education.

1845
02:42:51,500 --> 02:43:04,000
The New Hampshire Marine Transit Center Station has worked hard in the last year to raise awareness for responsible boating through the Wake Responsibility Campaign.

1846
02:43:04,000 --> 02:43:10,500
In 2021, the State Marine Patrol received just 29 calls wake surfing related.

1847
02:43:10,500 --> 02:43:14,000
That is of 2,290 statewide service calls.

1848
02:43:14,000 --> 02:43:16,000
That's 1%.

1849
02:43:16,000 --> 02:43:18,000
Roughly 1%.

1850
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:34,500
Our goal through education is to minimize repetitive passes, continue to keep music levels at a responsible level, stay at least 200 feet from shore, and direct surf waves away from the shore.

1851
02:43:34,500 --> 02:43:37,500
Does everyone understand what that means?

1852
02:43:37,500 --> 02:43:43,500
Wake surf boats surf on one side of the boat, not both.

1853
02:43:43,500 --> 02:44:04,000
So you can drive your boat down the lake and you can focus the wave away from shore, still being within 150 feet of safe passage, or 200, which is the recommended length from the Water Sports Association, or further out.

1854
02:44:04,000 --> 02:44:09,000
You do not need to direct your wave toward shore.

1855
02:44:09,000 --> 02:44:19,000
While some people may ask if wake surfing is only done on one specific type of boat, that is incorrect.

1856
02:44:19,000 --> 02:44:27,000
Wake surfing is gaining popularity year over year because of its slow speed, low impact fun.

1857
02:44:27,000 --> 02:44:33,500
It creates a social atmosphere that multi-generations of water sports enthusiasts may enjoy.

1858
02:44:33,500 --> 02:44:43,500
It's one of the safest, if not the safest, water sport towed behind boats we have on our lakes today.

1859
02:44:43,500 --> 02:44:51,500
And more and more boat manufacturers continue to adapt their models to meet the public demand.

1860
02:44:51,500 --> 02:45:00,500
You have been provided now handouts of different types of wake surf boats now offered in the public.

1861
02:45:00,500 --> 02:45:16,000
There are new style pontoon boats, personal watercraft, jet boats, deck boats, traditional inboard, traditional inboard outboard bow riders, and even a fishing type of boat that has an employed propulsion.

1862
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:25,500
We are aware that some boaters, mostly due to inexperience, do not understand the current laws of safe passage.

1863
02:45:25,500 --> 02:45:36,500
All of the marinas in New Hampshire have pledged to do thorough boat orientations, providing safe training and courteous tow sport operation.

1864
02:45:36,500 --> 02:45:42,500
And by that, I mean when we sell a boat, it's expensive.

1865
02:45:42,500 --> 02:45:44,500
It's fancy.

1866
02:45:44,500 --> 02:45:46,500
It's new.

1867
02:45:46,500 --> 02:45:48,500
It's fresh.

1868
02:45:48,500 --> 02:45:50,500
It's confusing.

1869
02:45:50,500 --> 02:45:54,000
There's a lot going on with it.

1870
02:45:54,000 --> 02:46:01,500
And these people typically have done one or two demos or demo orientations with us.

1871
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:10,000
But now they take it home and need to operate it safely with courtesy to their neighbors.

1872
02:46:10,000 --> 02:46:31,500
I personally will spend, and I know a lot of my constituents behind me that work at the marina, spend two to three hours on these boats showing them how to operate it properly, safely for friends and loved ones in the water.

1873
02:46:31,500 --> 02:46:34,000
I have an eight-year-old daughter.

1874
02:46:34,000 --> 02:46:53,000
I want to make sure that she's safe and she's understanding as we're using the boat that she's going to be okay and she understands where to be, where not to be in the boat, in the water.

1875
02:46:53,000 --> 02:46:55,000
It's critical.

1876
02:46:55,000 --> 02:46:59,500
So that's a very important part of the process.

1877
02:46:59,500 --> 02:47:18,500
And we want to make sure that when these people leave with their boat, that they're being good stewards to the lakes that they're on and their neighbors, because we don't need to continue to create bad habits.

1878
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:21,500
House Bill 1071 will create confusion.

1879
02:47:21,500 --> 02:47:23,500
Where can people wakeboard?

1880
02:47:23,500 --> 02:47:28,000
Where can they water ski but not wake surf?

1881
02:47:28,000 --> 02:47:43,000
It could also create a public access concern for those on smaller lakes who will no longer be able to use their boat on their property where they pay taxes.

1882
02:47:43,000 --> 02:47:54,500
It's important to point out that laws regarding wake damage are already on our books in New Hampshire, and this is the law.

1883
02:47:54,500 --> 02:48:09,000
To provide full visibility and control and to prevent their weight from being thrown into or causing excessive rocking to other boats, barges, water skiers, aquaplanes, rafts, or floats.

1884
02:48:09,000 --> 02:48:20,500
All vessels shall maintain headway speed within 150 feet of rafts, floats, swimmers, permitted swimming areas, shores, dock mooring fields, and other vessels.

1885
02:48:20,500 --> 02:48:36,000
We have always appreciated the State Marine Patrol has taken an approach of being welcome ambassadors onto our waterways, doing a great job demonstrating the 150-foot passage law without posing tickets.

1886
02:48:36,000 --> 02:49:15,500
But it does not mean that we need new current laws and new legislation because borders under don't understand the rules we already have laws on the books do not need further setbacks we need more education my father Mike Wally served in this committee for many years he excuse me sponsored the border education bill and it has been proven through the Coast Guard that states with boater education have fewer fatalities and fewer incidents than those without.

1887
02:49:15,500 --> 02:49:17,500
Boater education works.

1888
02:49:17,500 --> 02:49:42,500
I ask you, as the Vice President of the New Hampshire Marine's Association, to let us do our jobs, let us be responsible, and continue to demonstrate good habits to new boaters, reaffirm best practices to those already existing in our towboat community while we resolve the challenges through education.

1889
02:49:42,500 --> 02:49:44,500
Thank you.

1890
02:49:44,500 --> 02:49:46,500
Any questions, Mr.

1891
02:49:46,500 --> 02:49:48,500
Walley?

1892
02:49:48,500 --> 02:49:51,000
Representative Smith, for a question.

1893
02:49:51,000 --> 02:49:53,500
Yeah, I guess you can.

1894
02:49:53,500 --> 02:49:55,500
you can.

1895
02:49:55,500 --> 02:50:00,000
Well, you can have someone else to go first.

1896
02:50:00,000 --> 02:50:02,000
No, no.

1897
02:50:02,000 --> 02:50:04,000
Thank you, Mr.

1898
02:50:04,000 --> 02:50:06,000
Chair.

1899
02:50:06,000 --> 02:50:08,000
And thank you, Mr.

1900
02:50:08,000 --> 02:50:10,500
Walley, for taking my question.

1901
02:50:10,500 --> 02:50:12,500
You're welcome.

1902
02:50:12,500 --> 02:50:15,000
Nice to see you again.

1903
02:50:15,000 --> 02:50:18,500
Yeah, nice to see you again, too.

1904
02:50:18,500 --> 02:50:30,000
And I should say that we were cleaning out some file cabinets in the office, and we found a picture of your dad.

1905
02:50:30,000 --> 02:50:32,000
Oh, yeah?

1906
02:50:32,000 --> 02:50:35,500
His fellow reps on a field trip.

1907
02:50:35,500 --> 02:50:37,500
It was pretty nice.

1908
02:50:37,500 --> 02:50:39,500
I have a question.

1909
02:50:39,500 --> 02:50:41,500
You were testified.

1910
02:50:41,500 --> 02:50:43,500
Oh, right.

1911
02:50:43,500 --> 02:50:45,500
I can't ask questions.

1912
02:50:45,500 --> 02:50:47,500
I forgot.

1913
02:50:47,500 --> 02:50:49,500
Yep.

1914
02:50:49,500 --> 02:50:51,500
She can ask.

1915
02:50:51,500 --> 02:50:53,500
Fire away.

1916
02:50:53,500 --> 02:50:58,000
And, you know, I screw up too many times.

1917
02:50:58,000 --> 02:51:01,000
Don't let me screw up anymore.

1918
02:51:01,000 --> 02:51:03,000
Come on.

1919
02:51:03,000 --> 02:51:05,000
Just never mind.

1920
02:51:05,000 --> 02:51:12,000
If she wants to pass a note to somebody else, I'm all for it.

1921
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:14,000
Let's go.

1922
02:51:14,000 --> 02:51:20,500
If you could find somebody else who wants to ask you a question.

1923
02:51:20,500 --> 02:51:22,500
Okay.

1924
02:51:22,500 --> 02:51:27,000
Is there anyone else who wishes to ask Mr.

1925
02:51:27,000 --> 02:51:29,000
Wally a question?

1926
02:51:29,000 --> 02:51:31,500
I just have one question.

1927
02:51:31,500 --> 02:51:36,000
You say that when you wake surf, it's unidirectional.

1928
02:51:36,000 --> 02:51:40,000
It goes one way or the other way.

1929
02:51:40,000 --> 02:51:42,000
Either way.

1930
02:51:42,000 --> 02:51:47,000
The boats are designed to allow surfing on either side.

1931
02:51:47,000 --> 02:52:00,500
The driver of the boat typically has a software system in the boat that allows you to choose which side of the boat you want to surf.

1932
02:52:00,500 --> 02:52:04,500
So it's very easy, very functional to adjust.

1933
02:52:04,500 --> 02:52:10,500
The adjustability of it now can happen within three to four seconds.

1934
02:52:10,500 --> 02:52:20,000
So there's no real excuse for someone to not be able to surf their surf wave away from shore.

1935
02:52:20,000 --> 02:53:01,000
Okay and just an additional question is that true on some of these other craft that are multi-use they can And the ones that are not specifically was it wake boats but other things like pontoon boats and that have the ability to generate I would say that the unique thing about a specific in board is that it's multifunctional first it's a boat that you can take to dinner and get an ice cream cone, water ski with, wake surf, wakeboard.

1936
02:53:01,000 --> 02:53:12,000
And the industry saw those shifts and saw that not all consumers wanted that type of style boat by looking that way.

1937
02:53:12,000 --> 02:53:21,000
So they're adapting pontoon boats, pre-existing boats, to now work towards surfing because it's such a popular sport.

1938
02:53:21,000 --> 02:53:38,000
That's why you see with the handouts fishing boats, a pontoon boat, or people just really have regular old bow riders, and the drive, not to get too technical, is spun around 180 degrees.

1939
02:53:38,000 --> 02:53:42,500
So the propeller is no longer towards the back.

1940
02:53:42,500 --> 02:53:56,500
It's now pulling the boat forwards, creating safety so that the propeller is not spinning by anyone's foot if they're behind the swim platform off the boat itself.

1941
02:53:56,500 --> 02:54:02,000
So they're adapting because the consumers are asking for these products.

1942
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:06,500
If I could point out one more thing, Tim.

1943
02:54:06,500 --> 02:54:24,000
During the wake surf study that I was on with Representative Smith, it was brought up that with the concern of aquatic invasive species, only 3 to 4% of typical wake surf boats are transient.

1944
02:54:24,000 --> 02:54:34,000
They all kind of live where they go, and they stay on those lakes primarily their whole life while owned.

1945
02:54:34,000 --> 02:54:41,500
The lake hosts at a lot of the boat ramps were able to confirm that.

1946
02:54:41,500 --> 02:54:54,000
We were all surprised by that, too, but data from the lake hosts at boat ramps were able to confirm that that number was accurate.

1947
02:54:54,000 --> 02:55:20,500
It wasn't just basically how we just called around to all of our customers and asked, hey, are you using your boat at your house, at your lake, or are you popping in the trailer and buzzing it around, and then 3% to 4% said, we're moving it around, and 3% to 4%.

1948
02:55:20,500 --> 02:55:24,000
And the rest of them said no.

1949
02:55:24,000 --> 02:55:28,000
But the lake host said they confirmed that.

1950
02:55:28,000 --> 02:55:36,500
And typically when you fill a ballast tank, you don't do it in a water that's shallow.

1951
02:55:36,500 --> 02:55:41,000
Most boats are required to idle away from shore.

1952
02:55:41,000 --> 02:55:47,500
You need to continue to allow your alternator to help charge your battery.

1953
02:55:47,500 --> 02:56:02,500
So you're idling at headway speed, filling your boat away from shore, not near water that has milfoil, not near water with sedimentation, not disturbing the bottom of the lake.

1954
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:23,000
So when I fill a boat on a demo or an orientation, it may take us the better part of a quarter to half a mile until we're out into fresh water where it's full and that we're able to surf.

1955
02:56:23,000 --> 02:56:29,500
Just to clear up some of the other questions that were mentioned earlier.

1956
02:56:29,500 --> 02:56:31,500
Thank you.

1957
02:56:31,500 --> 02:56:34,000
Representative Huff for our question.

1958
02:56:34,000 --> 02:56:36,000
Thank you, Mr.

1959
02:56:36,000 --> 02:56:40,000
Chairman, and thank you for taking my question.

1960
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:49,000
You mentioned earlier, and I might have the number wrong, that there was 107,000 voter registrations last year.

1961
02:56:49,000 --> 02:56:51,000
That's correct.

1962
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:58,500
Is there any way to tell how many of those voter registration people wakes up?

1963
02:56:58,500 --> 02:57:02,500
I don't, that's a hard question to answer.

1964
02:57:02,500 --> 02:57:11,000
There's probably someone in the back of the room that maybe can answer better than I can.

1965
02:57:11,000 --> 02:57:19,000
A lot of our boats are purchased for people that want the accessibility to do it.

1966
02:57:19,000 --> 02:57:38,000
I'm always surprised sometimes when we go pick up a boat at the customer's house for the winter and we check the hours versus this year or last year, and it may only have 25 hours on it.

1967
02:57:38,000 --> 02:57:42,000
Some have more, which we love to see.

1968
02:57:42,000 --> 02:57:48,500
But not every boat is used 100% of the time to wake surf.

1969
02:57:48,500 --> 02:57:53,500
I myself, on a normal year, will average 100 hours.

1970
02:57:53,500 --> 02:57:59,500
I would estimate that I probably use it that way 25 hours.

1971
02:57:59,500 --> 02:58:07,500
We're doing a lot of ice cream runs, a lot of sunset cruises, go to breakfast.

1972
02:58:07,500 --> 02:58:11,500
It's just kind of like having an SUV.

1973
02:58:11,500 --> 02:58:25,500
Just because you have an SUV or a pickup truck, you don't go to a Home Depot or go to the ski area every minute of the day.

1974
02:58:25,500 --> 02:58:35,500
You jump the kids off at school and go to the grocery store and do a lot of different things.

1975
02:58:35,500 --> 02:58:48,500
So it's a very utilitarian boat that allows for a lot of different access and a lot of different sports and a lot of different purposes.

1976
02:58:48,500 --> 02:58:50,500
Thank you.

1977
02:58:50,500 --> 02:58:53,000
Representative Cohen for a question.

1978
02:58:53,000 --> 02:58:55,000
Mr.

1979
02:58:55,000 --> 02:58:59,000
Wall, I thank you for taking my question.

1980
02:58:59,000 --> 02:59:09,500
So the current statute says that wake surfing needs to be done behind a boat that's specifically designed for wake surfing.

1981
02:59:09,500 --> 02:59:22,000
With some of these newer boats like the pontoon boats, do they have that same kind of propulsion system that the wake boat now has?

1982
02:59:22,000 --> 02:59:26,500
Yes, they've been amended or modified to be safe.

1983
02:59:26,500 --> 02:59:34,000
The last thing any of these manufacturers want to do is have some inclusive foot.

1984
02:59:34,000 --> 02:59:46,500
And in that statute that we did during our wake study, that was our concern, is that there were people that wanted to wake surf.

1985
02:59:46,500 --> 03:00:05,000
And they were buying any kind of a boat, filling it with tubs of concrete, cinder blocks, bags of water, so that it would kind of pump up the wave to make it surf in some capacity.

1986
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:09,500
And we've all deemed that it was exceptionally dangerous.

1987
03:00:09,500 --> 03:00:20,000
And also in that study, too, we added that wave surfing should be surfed with life jackets, like in the ocean.

1988
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:34,500
It was a positive event that we did during the study that we came away with a lot of good things that improved the sport and improved people's safety.

1989
03:00:34,500 --> 03:00:36,500
Thank you.

1990
03:00:36,500 --> 03:00:39,000
Representative Bost for a question.

1991
03:00:39,000 --> 03:00:41,000
Thank you, Mr.

1992
03:00:41,000 --> 03:00:45,000
Chair, and thank you for being here today.

1993
03:00:45,000 --> 03:01:02,500
Last year we had something come up like this, and we talked about wakeboats, and it was my understanding that out of any vessel you're on the water with, you could make it a wakeboat.

1994
03:01:02,500 --> 03:01:10,000
But it seems now that there is a boat specifically made that is a wakeboat.

1995
03:01:10,000 --> 03:01:12,000
That's my question.

1996
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:38,500
Our primary manufacturers, Malibu, Mastercraft, Dautique, and various others, have specific technology built into their boats, and it basically has a trim tab, and a trim tab is designed to help kind of settle the boat to do what you want it to do, whether it ride more comfortably, surf, do various things.

1997
03:01:38,500 --> 03:01:41,000
Those boats are purposely built.

1998
03:01:41,000 --> 03:01:49,500
More manufacturers now are kind of getting into ways to modify their boats to do that also.

1999
03:01:49,500 --> 03:01:52,000
Does that answer your question?

2000
03:01:52,000 --> 03:01:54,000
Yes, thank you.

2001
03:01:54,000 --> 03:01:56,000
In a safe fashion.

2002
03:01:56,000 --> 03:01:58,000
It's through the manufacturer.

2003
03:01:58,000 --> 03:02:00,500
It's not done at home.

2004
03:02:00,500 --> 03:02:08,000
So it's done on a level that meets lawyers and insurance and everything else, too.

2005
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:10,000
Anyone else?

2006
03:02:10,000 --> 03:02:12,000
Same.

2007
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,000
Thank you, Mr.

2008
03:02:14,000 --> 03:02:16,000
Waller, for being here.

2009
03:02:16,000 --> 03:02:18,000
Thank you, Mr.

2010
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:20,500
Chairman, for letting me ask.

2011
03:02:20,500 --> 03:02:38,500
My question is, when you're teaching somebody, when you're going through that guided tutorial of the boat, do you have a rule or do you have some way of teaching them what 150 feet looks like?

2012
03:02:38,500 --> 03:02:44,000
Because I don't think I could say what 150 feet is.

2013
03:02:44,000 --> 03:02:46,000
Yeah, we do.

2014
03:02:46,000 --> 03:02:55,000
We're fortunate enough that we have at our marina a gas dock that comes off of our property.

2015
03:02:55,000 --> 03:02:58,500
And there's a big flamingo-looking pink building.

2016
03:02:58,500 --> 03:03:09,500
And when we get past that, I kind of put the boat to idle and designate to them, this is 150 feet.

2017
03:03:09,500 --> 03:03:14,000
My bigger concern with this new law Thank you.

2018
03:03:14,000 --> 03:03:19,000
to idle and designate to them, this is 150 feet.

2019
03:03:19,000 --> 03:03:32,000
My bigger concern with this new law or bill that's on the books is I don't know how, people have a tough time at 150 feet.

2020
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:35,000
You can just say it yourself.

2021
03:03:35,000 --> 03:03:54,500
And I'm sure if we all stood in a line and closed our eyes and walked 150 feet to what we all thought was 150 feet, we'd all be in different spots, especially to where shorelines are not static.

2022
03:03:54,500 --> 03:03:56,500
They move.

2023
03:03:56,500 --> 03:03:59,000
They are curved and stopped.

2024
03:03:59,000 --> 03:04:11,500
I see it as a big concern that if 150 feet is hard to gauge, that's half a football field, half a soccer field roughly.

2025
03:04:11,500 --> 03:04:15,500
250 feet is kind of a strange number.

2026
03:04:15,500 --> 03:04:19,500
It doesn't really correlate to a football field.

2027
03:04:19,500 --> 03:04:22,000
It's not 300 feet long.

2028
03:04:22,000 --> 03:04:30,000
And it's even more concerning where all this topic now, 500 feet, that's a long way.

2029
03:04:30,000 --> 03:04:38,500
I have a pretty good eye, I feel, and I have a pretty good gauge of distance.

2030
03:04:38,500 --> 03:04:43,000
I could not tell you what 500 feet is.

2031
03:04:43,000 --> 03:04:50,500
And I actually looked it up this morning trying to find what is 500 feet?

2032
03:04:50,500 --> 03:04:54,000
A 10-story building is 100 feet tall.

2033
03:04:54,000 --> 03:05:00,000
So we don't have 10-story buildings in Concord, not to my knowledge.

2034
03:05:00,000 --> 03:05:03,500
But that's five of them stacked up.

2035
03:05:03,500 --> 03:05:05,500
That's a long way.

2036
03:05:05,500 --> 03:05:11,500
And that's a hard way to gauge for anybody in the public.

2037
03:05:11,500 --> 03:05:18,000
And I think it's important to remember, too, that 250 really means 500.

2038
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:22,000
It's just on both sides of the shoreline.

2039
03:05:22,000 --> 03:05:26,500
It's not 250 on one side of the shoreline.

2040
03:05:26,500 --> 03:05:32,000
So if it's a narrow lake, then that compounds even more.

2041
03:05:32,000 --> 03:05:40,000
If it's 500 feet on either side of the shoreline, your window of opportunity is small.

2042
03:05:40,000 --> 03:05:48,000
You're going to have a lot of boats running that same pattern, people in the water.

2043
03:05:48,000 --> 03:05:50,500
It poses some serious concerns.

2044
03:05:50,500 --> 03:05:52,500
Thank you.

2045
03:05:52,500 --> 03:05:55,500
Representative Post, for a second time.

2046
03:05:55,500 --> 03:05:57,500
Thank you.

2047
03:05:57,500 --> 03:06:11,000
Do you believe that would preclude a lot of the lakes in New Hampshire not being able to have wake boats there because of the 500-foot restriction?

2048
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:13,500
Based off my opinion, yes.

2049
03:06:13,500 --> 03:06:23,500
Based off the amount of fact and investment you need to look into that, I can't answer that question honestly.

2050
03:06:23,500 --> 03:06:28,000
I know that a lake is not a circle.

2051
03:06:28,000 --> 03:06:33,000
There's coves, there's pockets, some are long, some are wide.

2052
03:06:33,000 --> 03:06:43,500
It would definitely cause a lot of lakes, I think, to be having limited areas where they can and can't use.

2053
03:06:43,500 --> 03:06:45,500
I was disappointed.

2054
03:06:45,500 --> 03:06:52,000
I read a testimony that was added on to the opposition in four.

2055
03:06:52,000 --> 03:07:03,000
And a lot of people – I shouldn't say a lot, but a handful of people said, I live in this cove.

2056
03:07:03,000 --> 03:07:05,500
It's this many feet wide.

2057
03:07:05,500 --> 03:07:09,500
If this passes, they can ban these boats.

2058
03:07:09,500 --> 03:07:32,000
And that's the verbiage that someone said in the email, which I was kind of disappointed by and surprised because I feel as though anyone, including my mother, who owns as a home of Winnipesaukee or any other lake, you're there for the time being.

2059
03:07:32,000 --> 03:07:36,000
This is not something that you're there forever.

2060
03:07:36,000 --> 03:07:39,000
These lakes are in public access.

2061
03:07:39,000 --> 03:07:51,000
You're lucky enough to have property on the shoreline while you're here on this earth, and it's going to be someone else's later on.

2062
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:59,000
And that's important that we don't limit who can be on a lake, where and when.

2063
03:07:59,000 --> 03:08:04,000
I had someone else who was a Wake Surf customer.

2064
03:08:04,000 --> 03:08:16,500
She said, you know, it'd be great if they could eliminate and say, there's only so many boats on a lake at any particular day.

2065
03:08:16,500 --> 03:08:24,000
I said, they would never be able to be able to enforce that, number one.

2066
03:08:24,000 --> 03:08:36,500
And number two, what gives you the right to be on the lake more than somebody else because you're a taxpayer that owns the property?

2067
03:08:36,500 --> 03:08:39,000
That's just not New Hampshire.

2068
03:08:39,000 --> 03:08:41,000
Thank you.

2069
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:43,000
You're welcome.

2070
03:08:43,000 --> 03:08:46,500
Is there anyone else for a question?

2071
03:08:46,500 --> 03:08:49,500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2072
03:08:49,500 --> 03:08:51,500
Thank you.

2073
03:08:51,500 --> 03:08:55,500
Chair calls David Neals from New Hampshire DES.

2074
03:08:55,500 --> 03:08:57,500
Pardon?

2075
03:08:57,500 --> 03:08:59,500
Thank you.

2076
03:08:59,500 --> 03:09:06,000
good afternoon mr chair members of committee thanks for having me here today.

2077
03:09:06,000 --> 03:09:08,500
My name is David Neils.

2078
03:09:08,500 --> 03:09:12,500
I work for the Department of Environmental Services.

2079
03:09:12,500 --> 03:09:15,500
I'm the chief water pollution biologist.

2080
03:09:15,500 --> 03:09:27,000
And DES takes no position on this bill, but we would like to offer some facts and comments on various things about it.

2081
03:09:27,000 --> 03:10:00,000
in 2021 House Bill 115 defined wake surfing as an activity and we think that was a really important step in moving this consideration of this activity forward that is is really important because we think that defining it as as an activity is really helpful for safety patrols can observe the activity going on versus trying to define the boat that's on the water body.

2082
03:10:00,000 --> 03:10:03,500
Vessels are also specifically designed, as Mr.

2083
03:10:03,500 --> 03:10:37,500
Wally just talked about, to participate in the activity or not participate in the activity, depending on the controls and the way the boat is set up and we also think that by addressing the activity these vessel restrictions can be avoided so rather than banning of certain boat type from a water body by it's just being a certain type of boat the activity can be controlled.

2084
03:10:37,500 --> 03:10:54,500
I also want to point out that DES was part of the 2019 Wake Boat Commission that explored the recreational benefits of this activity as well as the safety concerns and the environmental risk.

2085
03:10:54,500 --> 03:11:30,500
I want to talk about some of the risks that were pointed out on that Wake Boat Commission and those were primarily things that were mentioned before shoreline erosion and aquatic invasive species this bill House Bill 1071 really addresses the environmental environmental concern of shoreline erosion and the fact that the wakeboat commission and the report that was put out acknowledged the fact that these boats produce larger, more powerful waves.

2086
03:11:30,500 --> 03:11:42,500
And I want to talk about the study that was brought up earlier, specifically the one from University of Minnesota that was just released.

2087
03:11:42,500 --> 03:12:09,000
And this study and a couple of facts I want to point out, the maximum wave size produced by wake surfing boats at the 150 foot mark from water from the shoreline are basically twice the size of a regular inboard outboard motor which is sort of what most people see on lakes.

2088
03:12:09,000 --> 03:12:23,500
So that's you know basically from that distance wake boats were shown to have about a 15 inchinch maximum wave height versus an inboard-outboard vessel, which was 6 inches.

2089
03:12:23,500 --> 03:12:43,000
Similarly, that same study measured energy, and that the energy of waves were 5 times higher from wake boats, and that the power of the waves were 10 times higher from wake boats than from a regular inboard-outboard vessel.

2090
03:12:43,000 --> 03:12:48,000
And again, DES does not take a position on this.

2091
03:12:48,000 --> 03:12:54,000
I just wanted to make sure that those facts were clearly stated.

2092
03:12:54,000 --> 03:13:32,500
Research also shows that by increasing, and I think this is really important, increasing the distance from 150 feet to a 250 feet 250 foot setback as proposed as is proposed by this legislation that the wake or the weight and the maximum wave size from a wake boat would decrease by 27 percent and that the power would power of the wave would decrease by 48% and the energy of the wave would decrease by 35%.

2093
03:13:32,500 --> 03:13:47,500
So there is some advantage in increasing that weight or that setback if you're looking to decrease the size, the power, and the energy of a wave reaching the shoreline.

2094
03:13:47,500 --> 03:13:53,500
Wave size, power, and energy are the most problematic on protected shorelines.

2095
03:13:53,500 --> 03:13:58,000
And I think that's really important to point out.

2096
03:13:58,000 --> 03:14:03,000
It's not every shoreline that is subjected to these waves.

2097
03:14:03,000 --> 03:14:07,500
Protected shorelines are ones that are protected from wind.

2098
03:14:07,500 --> 03:14:17,000
So this proposed bill may eliminate some of the wake surf waves in these areas, but certainly not all.

2099
03:14:17,000 --> 03:14:27,500
There are certain wave or shorelines that are still protected from wind that could still certainly be subjected to larger waves.

2100
03:14:27,500 --> 03:14:36,000
So DES understands the recreational value of wake surfing and certainly understand the value of our lakes.

2101
03:14:36,000 --> 03:14:51,500
We look forward to working with the industry and recreational water users to minimize the environmental risks that wake boats were recognized to present in the 2020 Wake Boat Commission report.

2102
03:14:51,500 --> 03:15:31,000
We think that this bill takes a step forward to addressing one of these risks, namely shoreline erosion, while simultaneously, and I think this again is really important to recognize, by doing this through attempting to regulate the activity that rather than the vessel type I think that's really a critical step forward in this legislation and thank you for the opportunity and I'm happy to answer any questions that you might have any questions representative post thank you.

2103
03:15:31,000 --> 03:15:35,000
Chair, and thank you for your testimony today.

2104
03:15:35,000 --> 03:16:02,500
My question is, now with these boats having the ability to direct the wave opposite from the shore, do you feel there's still a concern about the wave action against the shore since they will have the ability at a push of a button to change it if they're going around in circles or whatever?

2105
03:16:02,500 --> 03:16:09,500
So I'm not a wakeboat owner, so I don't know everything about the wakeboats.

2106
03:16:09,500 --> 03:16:13,500
I know that that is certainly an advantage.

2107
03:16:13,500 --> 03:16:25,000
I think that presents a certain amount of subjective sort of decision to be made by the safety patrols that are out there.

2108
03:16:25,000 --> 03:16:40,000
It would be hard to tell, I think, from the distance that they would travel, unless they were very close to define which way the surf wave was being directed.

2109
03:16:40,000 --> 03:16:44,500
And I'm not sure how new that technology is.

2110
03:16:44,500 --> 03:16:48,500
I know it's been around for a while.

2111
03:16:48,500 --> 03:17:04,000
I'm not sure that all the boats that are out there that would be doing this activity have the capability of directing the particular side of the wave, the surf wave.

2112
03:17:04,000 --> 03:17:06,000
Thank you very much.

2113
03:17:06,000 --> 03:17:08,000
You're welcome.

2114
03:17:08,000 --> 03:17:10,000
Any other questions?

2115
03:17:10,000 --> 03:17:12,000
Representative Egan.

2116
03:17:12,000 --> 03:17:14,000
Thank you, Mr.

2117
03:17:14,000 --> 03:17:16,000
Chair.

2118
03:17:16,000 --> 03:17:19,500
Thank you, sir, for taking my question.

2119
03:17:19,500 --> 03:17:25,500
In your testimony, you referenced the Minnesota report and its estimated footage.

2120
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:43,000
Can you give us a perception of what other five New England states are doing, knowing that changing any sort of rule for participation on a waterfront can change how tourists look at the state?

2121
03:17:43,000 --> 03:18:23,500
and given that's our second largest to general tourism is our second largest generator of economy it's important to sort of factor in what our competition in New England for tourists does so if you could give us a little insight into our neighbors thank you for the question I think that's an excellent question if you're asking me if I know whether other states in New England have similar setback restrictions, I can't honestly answer that question well for you.

2122
03:18:23,500 --> 03:18:35,000
There may be somebody in the building here in the room here today that knows more about the safety regulations from other states.

2123
03:18:35,000 --> 03:18:43,500
follow up does your office your agency working to communicate with some of those other agents states.

2124
03:18:43,500 --> 03:18:45,500
Follow-up?

2125
03:18:45,500 --> 03:18:55,500
Does your office, your agency, work to communicate with some of those other agencies that that information can get sourced?

2126
03:18:55,500 --> 03:18:59,500
Certainly we could pick that up for you.

2127
03:18:59,500 --> 03:19:01,500
Yeah, absolutely.

2128
03:19:01,500 --> 03:19:03,500
Wonderful.

2129
03:19:03,500 --> 03:19:05,500
Thank you, sir.

2130
03:19:05,500 --> 03:19:07,500
Thank you, Mr.

2131
03:19:07,500 --> 03:19:09,500
Chair.

2132
03:19:09,500 --> 03:19:11,500
Representative Mayfield.

2133
03:19:11,500 --> 03:19:13,500
Thank you, Mr.

2134
03:19:13,500 --> 03:19:15,500
Chair.

2135
03:19:15,500 --> 03:19:17,500
And thank you, Mr.

2136
03:19:17,500 --> 03:19:20,000
Neils, for taking the question.

2137
03:19:20,000 --> 03:19:24,000
And this is related to the Minnesota study.

2138
03:19:24,000 --> 03:19:34,500
So I just had a couple of questions that, as a scientist, that hopefully you'll be able to answer for me.

2139
03:19:34,500 --> 03:19:43,500
I can't find the study in the academic library, so I'm trying to kind of hunt that down.

2140
03:19:43,500 --> 03:19:52,000
But looking at the sample size, that's the N in academia, it's very small with four boats.

2141
03:19:52,000 --> 03:19:58,500
And I'm wondering about the confounding variable because I don't see those anywhere.

2142
03:19:58,500 --> 03:20:21,000
And things such as the depth of water that was tested, the water temperature, the roughness of the surface at the time of the testing, that to me would conclude that perhaps this study might not be generalizable to the state of New Hampshire lakes.

2143
03:20:21,000 --> 03:20:26,000
So I'm wondering what your opinion might be on that.

2144
03:20:26,000 --> 03:20:29,000
And thank you for the answer.

2145
03:20:29,000 --> 03:20:31,000
Yes, absolutely.

2146
03:20:31,000 --> 03:20:47,000
So I will say, as some of the others have mentioned, the study, which is available, I'm happy to share it with you, it did go through a very thorough review process.

2147
03:20:47,000 --> 03:20:59,000
They do give some basic morphometric measures of the water body, as well as what the depth was that they ran the boats in.

2148
03:20:59,000 --> 03:21:06,500
And I will say that, you know, as part of a scientific study, Thank you.

2149
03:21:06,500 --> 03:21:16,000
morphometric measures of the water body, as well as what the depth was that they ran the boats in.

2150
03:21:16,000 --> 03:21:36,500
And I will say that, you know, as part of a scientific study, one of the things you want to do is replicate the same conditions for each of the boats that you're running, each of the experiments that you're running.

2151
03:21:36,500 --> 03:21:44,000
And they did run the experiment with all four boats in the same exact area.

2152
03:21:44,000 --> 03:23:51,500
And that they also ran each of those boats multiple times and got the same measures through each of those sort of they're called replicates so yeah that that was done I found the study to to be very objective and very informative and well done so it's it's a very well thought out and useful study I think as people start thinking about how this how this issue could be addressed I don't think you quite answered my question sure what I'm asking is is the lake that this study was done on generalizable to New Hampshire lakes was at the same depth as all of the lakes that we see in New Hampshire you see what I mean so you do it on one lake but is that the same kind of a lake the same depth the same surface the same water area the same surrounding edges as a New Hampshire lake I get that it's peer-reviewed and that's definitely a tight study but does it match our lakes here well so that's a really tough question the answer because our lakes here vary in size depth roughness and all those various components I feel like the lake that they did their work on they provide some information about it and I think it is transferable to the conditions we have here in New Hampshire it's it tends to be in a similar cold climactic area that's been glaciated, so the sediment type and shoreline type is likely to be relatively similar.

2153
03:23:51,500 --> 03:24:02,000
I'd have to go back and look at the exact details of what the depths and everything that we're run through.

2154
03:24:02,000 --> 03:24:04,000
Yeah, you're welcome.

2155
03:24:04,000 --> 03:24:06,500
Is there any other questions?

2156
03:24:06,500 --> 03:24:08,500
Seeing none.

2157
03:24:08,500 --> 03:24:10,500
Thank you.

2158
03:24:10,500 --> 03:24:12,500
Oh, I'm sorry.

2159
03:24:12,500 --> 03:24:14,500
No, no.

2160
03:24:14,500 --> 03:24:16,500
Go ahead.

2161
03:24:16,500 --> 03:24:18,500
Just a simple question.

2162
03:24:18,500 --> 03:24:21,500
Thank you for being here, Mr.

2163
03:24:21,500 --> 03:24:23,500
Nils.

2164
03:24:23,500 --> 03:24:31,500
Could you just define the difference between energy and power, just for if you don't mind?

2165
03:24:31,500 --> 03:24:34,000
Well, I'm not a physicist.

2166
03:24:34,000 --> 03:24:36,000
I am a biologist.

2167
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:49,000
So energy is the ability of the wave to do work, and power is the amount of work that it does over an amount of time.

2168
03:24:49,000 --> 03:24:51,000
Thank you.

2169
03:24:51,000 --> 03:24:53,000
You're welcome.

2170
03:24:53,000 --> 03:24:55,000
Anyone else?

2171
03:24:55,000 --> 03:24:57,000
Seeing no one?

2172
03:24:57,000 --> 03:24:59,000
Thank you very much.

2173
03:24:59,000 --> 03:25:04,000
Chair calls Jody Grimlis and Mike Farrelly for five minutes.

2174
03:25:04,000 --> 03:25:09,500
Representing New Hampshire Marine Trades Association and Water Sports Industry Association.

2175
03:25:09,500 --> 03:25:11,500
Thank you, Mr.

2176
03:25:11,500 --> 03:25:14,000
Chairman, members of the committee.

2177
03:25:14,000 --> 03:25:16,500
My name is Jody Grimbelis.

2178
03:25:16,500 --> 03:25:19,500
I'm a lobbyist here in Concord.

2179
03:25:19,500 --> 03:25:22,000
I'm always in your committee.

2180
03:25:22,000 --> 03:25:26,000
I know I actually see most of you.

2181
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:30,000
I represent the New Hampshire Marine Trades Association.

2182
03:25:30,000 --> 03:25:37,500
I also do work for the Water Sports Industry Association, the National Marine Manufacturers Association.

2183
03:25:37,500 --> 03:25:52,000
I'm going to have Mike here, Forelli, is going to speak to a letter that you would have received in your emails from Peter McCallum, who could not attend.

2184
03:25:52,000 --> 03:25:55,000
You've seen him before, your committee.

2185
03:25:55,000 --> 03:26:14,000
Mike is going to cover the high points of his testimony, and then I will offer a couple things and hopefully answer a couple questions that came up so I will turn it to Mike good afternoon mr.

2186
03:26:14,000 --> 03:26:41,500
chairman and members of the committee my name is Michael Farrelly I have worked McCallum's Boathouse for some 15 years alongside Peter McCallum the current president of the New Hampshire Marine Trades Association who is out of state and cannot be present today my personal background is that I've been a bo my whole life.

2187
03:26:41,500 --> 03:27:06,500
I have served on the board of directors of the New Hampshire Lakes Association in 2017 and 2018, worked and volunteered for the New Hampshire Lakes with their Lake Coast program for many years, and have boated all over New Hampshire as well as many other states in the country.

2188
03:27:06,500 --> 03:27:14,500
My personal love of the water and boating is why I have chosen this career path.

2189
03:27:14,500 --> 03:27:21,000
I am proud of the work of the marine industry in New Hampshire.

2190
03:27:21,000 --> 03:27:30,000
The main, there will be plenty of testimony about House Bill 1071 and how it should not pass.

2191
03:27:30,000 --> 03:27:36,500
The main focus of my testimony today is one of the reasons why.

2192
03:27:36,500 --> 03:27:41,000
It is called the New Hampshire Wake Responsibly Campaign.

2193
03:27:41,000 --> 03:27:53,500
It's a public and private partnership between industry and New Hampshire Marine Patrol to specifically educate water sports enthusiasts about best practices for wake surfing.

2194
03:27:53,500 --> 03:28:29,500
New Hampshire Marine Trades Association committed to this committee during last year's debate on House Bill 229 that we would undertake such an effort and i would like to report our results in the summer 2021 a local and national boating industry contributed over fifteen thousand dollars in funds and additional personnel and resource time toward building a campaign to educate families about the best best practices and proper etiquette for wake.

2195
03:28:29,500 --> 03:28:36,500
It is based on the national campaign called Wake Responsibly that promotes three practices.

2196
03:28:36,500 --> 03:28:41,000
One, staying 200 feet from shore when wake surfing.

2197
03:28:41,000 --> 03:28:44,500
Two, playing music at a reasonable level.

2198
03:28:44,500 --> 03:28:47,000
And three, minimizing repetitive passes.

2199
03:28:47,000 --> 03:31:05,000
In partnership with New Hampshire Marine Patrol and New Hampshire Association of broadcasters we created two radio advertisements that ran from June through August as well as three social media ads that were distributed through marina social media platforms and boater voting databases to get the message out these safety messages were heard by New Hampshire residents and vacationers alike the ad ran 2,363 times for total total dollar or messages were heard by New Hampshire residents and vacationers alike the ad ran 2,363 times for total total dollar value of fifty eight thousand four hundred ninety six dollars according to the New Hampshire Association of broadcasters in addition New Hampshire Marine Patrol marina members and individual boaters installed signage at public and private boat launches across the state additionally palm cards marketing stands and stickers compliance exams have been used by local marinas to assist an educational campaign with water sports families finally the New Hampshire Department of Safety included the New Hampshire wake responsibly campaign messaging and its recent boat registration renewal notices that was mailed to a hundred and seven thousand voters we strongly believe that this message is catching on we believe efforts to change course now when the campaign is connecting with voters is ill-advised I will take it for a couple more seconds couple more topics on behalf of the water sports industry Association National Marine Manufacturers Association and the marine retailers associations of America I have a letter in opposition to the bill this is probably the first bill of this this nature to establish such a far setback and then have the discussion of the 500-foot Minnesota study.

2200
03:31:05,000 --> 03:31:10,000
It might be the first time it's being heard today.

2201
03:31:10,000 --> 03:31:13,500
It's very concerning to the overall industry.

2202
03:31:13,500 --> 03:31:17,000
I'm not going to read the letter.

2203
03:31:17,000 --> 03:31:28,000
I'm going to pass it out, but I think you'll get some of the same points and some of the testimony today.

2204
03:31:28,000 --> 03:31:30,000
A couple other things.

2205
03:31:30,000 --> 03:31:54,500
There were a lot of folks that could not make today because of work or family challenges with child care, but they sent me a lot of letters that I printed out, which I will put for the file, but a couple asked me to point out particular issues.

2206
03:31:54,500 --> 03:32:03,500
The Lakes Region Tourism Association, which boasts 450 businesses in Central and the Lakes Region of New Hampshire.

2207
03:32:03,500 --> 03:32:24,500
As opposed to this bill, they're concerned about the tourist economy, our residents and tourists, and what kind of message are we sending for recreational boaters that really take up a lot of our bringing a lot of revenue to our community.

2208
03:32:24,500 --> 03:32:29,500
There's a second letter which I think is of interest.

2209
03:32:29,500 --> 03:32:44,500
It's a member of, it's a boater from the seacoast who boats on Great Bay and questioned the language of the bill that said this bill applies to inland waters.

2210
03:32:44,500 --> 03:32:51,500
Does that include Great Bay or some of those rivers, Bellamy River, et cetera?

2211
03:32:51,500 --> 03:32:54,000
It's a very good question.

2212
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:56,000
I called Captain Dunlavy.

2213
03:32:56,000 --> 03:32:59,500
We weren't sure what the answer was.

2214
03:32:59,500 --> 03:33:07,500
So I raised that question for you, that we're not sure how far does this go.

2215
03:33:07,500 --> 03:33:20,000
The other thing that that homeowner wanted me to know is that in living in Great Bay, they are part of a living shoreline project.

2216
03:33:20,000 --> 03:33:31,500
It kind of makes me think of Representative Post's legislation about having shorefront owners have abilities to kind of buttress up their shorelines.

2217
03:33:31,500 --> 03:33:41,500
They are part of that project at UNH, DES, and a lot of coastal program groups are part of that.

2218
03:33:41,500 --> 03:33:56,500
But what he has on his testimony is that part of that site evaluation, boat weight pressure is unlikely to be causing the erosion, is a statement in the document.

2219
03:33:56,500 --> 03:34:08,000
and he wanted to make sure that we knew, or that I passed along, that the issue of erosion is not generally wake-related.

2220
03:34:08,000 --> 03:34:14,000
And then the last voter specifically asked me to mention his letter.

2221
03:34:14,000 --> 03:34:20,500
He is a double master's degree geophysicist engineer with transportation and engineering background.

2222
03:34:20,500 --> 03:34:28,500
But he has given me an entire letter of review of that University of Minnesota study.

2223
03:34:28,500 --> 03:34:35,500
Some of the questions that Representative Mayville asked are kind of noted in here.

2224
03:34:35,500 --> 03:34:40,000
There are questions about the type of boats used.

2225
03:34:40,000 --> 03:34:54,500
One of the boats used was a very well-designed, light, tournament ski boat, which most folks would know is going to make the least wake, the smallest wake possible.

2226
03:34:54,500 --> 03:34:58,000
So I think there's questions about that.

2227
03:34:58,000 --> 03:35:03,000
There's also more scientific things that I don't always understand.

2228
03:35:03,000 --> 03:35:07,500
So I will pass this packet in as well.

2229
03:35:07,500 --> 03:35:13,500
Finally, Representative Egan, you had a question about setbacks in other states.

2230
03:35:13,500 --> 03:35:19,500
I had asked National to give me a little bit of understanding.

2231
03:35:19,500 --> 03:35:24,500
Not everybody has a 150-foot setback like New Hampshire does.

2232
03:35:24,500 --> 03:35:27,000
Connecticut has a 100-foot setback.

2233
03:35:27,000 --> 03:35:31,000
They have 200 feet for different personal watercraft.

2234
03:35:31,000 --> 03:35:33,000
Delaware has 100 feet.

2235
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:35,000
Georgia has 100 feet.

2236
03:35:35,000 --> 03:35:37,000
Indiana has 200 feet.

2237
03:35:37,000 --> 03:35:40,000
Maine has 200 feet while towing.

2238
03:35:40,000 --> 03:35:42,000
Michigan has 100 feet.

2239
03:35:42,000 --> 03:35:53,000
Massachusetts doesn't have one, but they do have a statewide law saying you cannot be within 100 feet of a swimming area.

2240
03:35:53,000 --> 03:35:59,000
So just to give you some sense, Virginia has a 50-foot setback.

2241
03:35:59,000 --> 03:36:01,500
Florida doesn't have a setback.

2242
03:36:01,500 --> 03:36:09,000
You have a 300-foot setback if you're near a commercial vessel or the law enforcement.

2243
03:36:09,000 --> 03:36:14,500
What we're looking at here is, again, much further than that.

2244
03:36:14,500 --> 03:36:28,000
It would be unprecedented, and I would want to make sure that New Hampshire would realize that we would be the first to undertake such a setback.

2245
03:36:28,000 --> 03:36:35,000
And that has unintended consequences that I think you'll hear from others behind me.

2246
03:36:35,000 --> 03:36:43,000
The last piece I'll make, and then I'll be quiet, we talk about safety and enforcement.

2247
03:36:43,000 --> 03:36:48,000
The Department of Safety has given us some great statistics.

2248
03:36:48,000 --> 03:36:51,500
I appreciate the help from Captain Dunleavy.

2249
03:36:51,500 --> 03:37:02,500
We've talked about the increase in boat registrations, and just to give you a snapshot, 2017 we had about 95,000 boats registered.

2250
03:37:02,500 --> 03:37:07,000
And I will leave these with the committee too.

2251
03:37:07,000 --> 03:37:09,000
2021, 106,000, 107,000 boats.

2252
03:37:09,000 --> 03:37:11,000
Accidents in 2017, 50.

2253
03:37:11,000 --> 03:37:13,000
Accidents in 2021, 39.

2254
03:37:13,000 --> 03:37:16,000
Calls for service in 2017, 2,304.

2255
03:37:16,000 --> 03:37:20,500
Calls for service in 2021, 2,290, about 14 shy.

2256
03:37:20,500 --> 03:37:26,000
They do give summons, or I call tickets, for safe passage.

2257
03:37:26,000 --> 03:37:29,000
2017, 171 tickets, but 683 warnings.

2258
03:37:29,000 --> 03:37:41,000
As Marine Patrol has always done, they really try to educate folks first, which I think is very good in terms of our tourism.

2259
03:37:41,000 --> 03:37:46,500
In 2020, the last numbers they have, 166 tickets, 659 warnings.

2260
03:37:46,500 --> 03:37:54,500
So there are efforts to educate from Marine Patrol and enforce the laws that we have.

2261
03:37:54,500 --> 03:38:03,500
But I think the most important statistic that they have in this document is the number of officers.

2262
03:38:03,500 --> 03:38:09,000
The number of officers for Marine Patrol was 35 in 2017.

2263
03:38:09,000 --> 03:38:13,000
The number of officers in 2021 is 35.

2264
03:38:13,000 --> 03:38:17,000
There was a peak in 2019 of 44.

2265
03:38:17,000 --> 03:38:24,500
This committee is recommending an interim study on a bill to look at vessel registrations.

2266
03:38:24,500 --> 03:38:30,500
We've talked to Captain Dunley about the need to look at those.

2267
03:38:30,500 --> 03:38:34,500
We need to look at our law enforcement.

2268
03:38:34,500 --> 03:38:38,000
We need to look at Marine Patrol.

2269
03:38:38,000 --> 03:38:47,500
That is a better answer to the issues on the lakes than what this bill is here before you.

2270
03:38:47,500 --> 03:38:52,500
So again, I thank you, and we'll take any questions.

2271
03:38:52,500 --> 03:39:00,000
I'd be happy to take any questions about wake boats or surfing specifically as well.

2272
03:39:00,000 --> 03:39:04,000
Does anyone have any questions of those testifying?

2273
03:39:04,000 --> 03:39:06,000
Representative Cohen?

2274
03:39:06,000 --> 03:39:08,500
Thank you for taking me.

2275
03:39:08,500 --> 03:39:13,500
I'm sorry, I didn't write down your last name, sir.

2276
03:39:13,500 --> 03:39:15,500
Fairly.

2277
03:39:15,500 --> 03:39:17,500
Mr.

2278
03:39:17,500 --> 03:39:19,500
Fairly, just a curiosity.

2279
03:39:19,500 --> 03:39:26,000
So the New Hampshire Wake Responsibility Program, you say, is being very successful.

2280
03:39:26,000 --> 03:39:32,000
Can you just help me understand what your criteria is for successful?

2281
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:43,500
I don't know if it is or not because there are a lot of people wanting this bill to become law as well.

2282
03:39:43,500 --> 03:39:51,000
So can you just tell me how do you define and know what success is?

2283
03:39:51,000 --> 03:40:02,000
I'm not challenging if it's successful, but what are you using or what makes you say, okay, I can say it's successful?

2284
03:40:02,000 --> 03:40:04,000
Sure.

2285
03:40:04,000 --> 03:40:19,500
And I think a lot of that comes to word of mouth, whether it's successful, but what are you using or what makes you say, okay, I can say it's successful?

2286
03:40:19,500 --> 03:40:21,500
Sure.

2287
03:40:21,500 --> 03:40:37,000
And I think a lot of that comes to word of mouth, whether it be talking to somebody in person or on posts on social media, what you see out there.

2288
03:40:37,000 --> 03:40:43,000
But these three main focuses is what we've been pushing towards people.

2289
03:40:43,000 --> 03:40:56,500
I, like John Wally, spend hours with somebody in their new boat to orient them about the boat and then about boating safety as well as courtesy.

2290
03:40:56,500 --> 03:41:16,500
And five years ago, this conversation wasn't happening, and not many people knew about it, but a lot of the people that I'll bring this up to nowadays already know what I'm talking about and what I'm about to say.

2291
03:41:16,500 --> 03:41:25,500
And that goes for staying 200 feet away, keeping the music low, and then minimizing the repetitive passes.

2292
03:41:25,500 --> 03:41:36,000
That's a big one so that you're not in front of the same group of individuals, houses, businesses all day long.

2293
03:41:36,000 --> 03:41:44,000
But it would be tough to completely gauge how many people this has been introduced to.

2294
03:41:44,000 --> 03:42:02,000
But all I can say is from my personal experience and experiences of people like me, like John Wally, we see a lot more individuals that are educated on this than we have in years past.

2295
03:42:02,000 --> 03:42:04,500
Thank you for your answer.

2296
03:42:04,500 --> 03:42:08,000
I would just add one other thing.

2297
03:42:08,000 --> 03:42:16,000
One of the great programs I think many people agree to is the Lake Host Program.

2298
03:42:16,000 --> 03:42:26,000
The Lake Host Program was a volunteer clean, drain, and dry your boat before you go into your next launch.

2299
03:42:26,000 --> 03:42:29,000
20 years, that was a volunteer.

2300
03:42:29,000 --> 03:42:31,000
There was no law.

2301
03:42:31,000 --> 03:42:34,000
It was just education, education, education.

2302
03:42:34,000 --> 03:42:41,500
That seems to have been a very, and continues to be a very successful program.

2303
03:42:41,500 --> 03:42:50,000
That was actually added into law, I think, two years ago in 2019, but it hadn't been.

2304
03:42:50,000 --> 03:42:52,500
It had been worked on.

2305
03:42:52,500 --> 03:43:07,000
I also, and again, this is very anecdotal, but the written complaints to Marine Patrol two years ago were 30 about wake boats, and this year there were nine.

2306
03:43:07,000 --> 03:43:12,500
So I'm going to say that maybe we're making some progress.

2307
03:43:12,500 --> 03:43:14,500
Any other questions?

2308
03:43:14,500 --> 03:43:16,500
Seeing none.

2309
03:43:16,500 --> 03:43:18,500
Thank you.

2310
03:43:18,500 --> 03:43:20,500
Thank you.

2311
03:43:20,500 --> 03:43:25,000
If you could, anything you have to pass in.

2312
03:43:25,000 --> 03:43:33,000
Okay, and if you have any copies of your testimony, that would be appreciated as well.

2313
03:43:33,000 --> 03:43:35,000
Okay.

2314
03:43:35,000 --> 03:43:37,000
Okay.

2315
03:43:37,000 --> 03:43:39,000
All right.

2316
03:43:39,000 --> 03:43:42,000
June Fichter, representing SELF and LSPA.

2317
03:43:42,000 --> 03:43:45,000
I presume L stands for lake.

2318
03:43:45,000 --> 03:43:47,000
Yes, yes, it does.

2319
03:43:47,000 --> 03:43:49,500
I have copies of mine.

2320
03:43:49,500 --> 03:43:51,500
Okay.

2321
03:43:51,500 --> 03:43:57,000
Put your copies there, and then he'll make his second pass.

2322
03:43:57,000 --> 03:43:59,000
Thank you.

2323
03:43:59,000 --> 03:44:01,000
Yes, yes, yes.

2324
03:44:01,000 --> 03:44:03,500
I have copies of mine.

2325
03:44:03,500 --> 03:44:09,500
Okay, put your copies there, and then he'll make his second pass.

2326
03:44:09,500 --> 03:44:14,000
I also have one full copy of the study.

2327
03:44:14,000 --> 03:44:18,000
I only have one of those, but okay.

2328
03:44:18,000 --> 03:44:21,500
Okay, let him finish passing stuff out.

2329
03:44:21,500 --> 03:44:26,500
It's hard to speak through a mask, so excuse me.

2330
03:44:26,500 --> 03:44:35,500
Well, thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to lend my support for House Bill 1071.

2331
03:44:35,500 --> 03:44:44,000
I speak for myself and also the Lake Centipede Association, the board, and our members as well.

2332
03:44:44,000 --> 03:44:49,000
Earlier, a gentleman did quote what I will quickly do.

2333
03:44:49,000 --> 03:45:13,500
The current law in the book is Chapter 270D2 of the New Hampshire Boating and Water Safety to provide visibility control and prevent wakes from being thrown into or causing excessive rocking to water skiers barges boats swimmers docks shore etc that currently applies to all boats including boats.

2334
03:45:13,500 --> 03:45:16,500
And that is from the 1990s.

2335
03:45:16,500 --> 03:45:30,000
The recently released peer review study, as by now you know, from the University of Minnesota compared wakes of wake surfing boats and wakes from ordinary boats.

2336
03:45:30,000 --> 03:45:43,500
We should consider that the current 150 distance intended for non-wake surfing boats should be increased proportionally for boats generating bigger wakes than those in the 1990s.

2337
03:45:43,500 --> 03:45:46,000
The question is, how much?

2338
03:45:46,000 --> 03:45:57,500
And in the graphs, at 100 feet, the study showed that wakeboat wake heights were two to three times that of non-wakesurfing boats.

2339
03:45:57,500 --> 03:46:05,000
And the power, as was previously stated, was up more than that, six times approximately.

2340
03:46:05,000 --> 03:46:21,000
So the study indicates that distances of over 400 feet, 425 feet, are needed for wake surf boats wakes to be equivalent, if you will, to non-wake boats at that same distance.

2341
03:46:21,000 --> 03:46:28,000
So I urge the committee to, one, either pass House Bill 1071, as is.

2342
03:46:28,000 --> 03:46:37,000
It's not enough, but it's an improvement over what we have today, which goes back to the 1990s.

2343
03:46:37,000 --> 03:46:44,000
90 two, preferably to consider an amendment increasing the distance to further than 250.

2344
03:46:44,000 --> 03:46:48,500
And I understand that's a compromise, a judgment call.

2345
03:46:48,500 --> 03:46:58,000
350, which would be my preference, gets us 80% of the way there if you look at those graphs.

2346
03:46:58,000 --> 03:47:06,500
In terms of tourism, I have to say what we're talking about here isn't so much erosion.

2347
03:47:06,500 --> 03:47:16,500
It is, and I do have members who complain about that, and it depends what kind of shore you have.

2348
03:47:16,500 --> 03:47:26,000
But in terms of tourism, you know, kayakers complain that the wakes near shore are too big to kayak.

2349
03:47:26,000 --> 03:47:30,500
It's too big to swim, to have kids swimming.

2350
03:47:30,500 --> 03:47:41,000
It's too big to, you know, it just interrupts that small 1990s distance interrupts other kinds of activities on the lake.

2351
03:47:41,000 --> 03:47:48,000
So the lakes aren't only for people with big expensive boats with big wakes.

2352
03:47:48,000 --> 03:47:52,000
So I just wanted to point that out.

2353
03:47:52,000 --> 03:47:56,000
So we're in support of House Bill 10-71.

2354
03:47:56,000 --> 03:47:59,000
Any questions that I can answer?

2355
03:47:59,000 --> 03:48:01,500
Representative Post for a question.

2356
03:48:01,500 --> 03:48:03,500
Thank you.

2357
03:48:03,500 --> 03:48:06,000
I didn't get your name.

2358
03:48:06,000 --> 03:48:08,000
Oh, June Fichter.

2359
03:48:08,000 --> 03:48:10,500
C-H is a hard C-H.

2360
03:48:10,500 --> 03:48:25,500
F-I-C-H-T-E-R, and I'm the executive director of the Lake Centipede Protective Association, and also I am fortunate enough to live on Lake Centipede, and I do have a ski boat.

2361
03:48:25,500 --> 03:48:44,500
I'm not, you know, I sail, I kayak, I also, our family water skis, so we enjoy sometimes just a cocktail cruise and and it'd be nice not to spill my beer, but, you know, it's enough said.

2362
03:48:44,500 --> 03:48:46,500
Thank you very much.

2363
03:48:46,500 --> 03:48:48,500
You're welcome.

2364
03:48:48,500 --> 03:48:50,500
Anyone else?

2365
03:48:50,500 --> 03:48:52,500
Seeing none.

2366
03:48:52,500 --> 03:48:54,500
Oh, excuse me.

2367
03:48:54,500 --> 03:48:56,500
Representative Egan.

2368
03:48:56,500 --> 03:48:58,500
Thank you, Mr.

2369
03:48:58,500 --> 03:49:00,500
Chair.

2370
03:49:00,500 --> 03:49:04,000
Thank you, Matt, for taking my question.

2371
03:49:04,000 --> 03:49:14,500
Given that you water ski, are there rules that you're required to abide by for distance to shore for water skiing?

2372
03:49:14,500 --> 03:49:22,000
For water skiing, on the books, it's still 150 feet, but we don't do that.

2373
03:49:22,000 --> 03:49:26,000
We go in the middle of the lake.

2374
03:49:26,000 --> 03:49:42,000
And I should say that we have some wakeboat owners who are members who are for this bill, and they always practice in the middle of the lake, not in narrow spots.

2375
03:49:42,000 --> 03:49:44,000
Thank you.

2376
03:49:44,000 --> 03:49:46,000
Any other questions?

2377
03:49:46,000 --> 03:49:48,000
Seeing none.

2378
03:49:48,000 --> 03:49:50,000
Thank you very much.

2379
03:49:50,000 --> 03:49:52,000
No?

2380
03:49:52,000 --> 03:49:57,000
You notice I'm trying to go pro, con, pro, con.

2381
03:49:57,000 --> 03:50:00,000
This is now someone in opposition.

2382
03:50:00,000 --> 03:50:02,000
The Raymond family.

2383
03:50:02,000 --> 03:50:04,000
Steve, Emily, and Samantha.

2384
03:50:04,000 --> 03:50:06,500
You asked for five minutes.

2385
03:50:06,500 --> 03:50:10,000
I hope it's not five minutes each.

2386
03:50:10,000 --> 03:50:12,000
Thank you.

2387
03:50:12,000 --> 03:50:14,000
Good afternoon, Mr.

2388
03:50:14,000 --> 03:50:17,000
Chairman and members of the committee.

2389
03:50:17,000 --> 03:50:21,000
For the record, my name is Steve Raymond.

2390
03:50:21,000 --> 03:50:25,500
This is my wife, Emily, and my daughter, Samantha.

2391
03:50:25,500 --> 03:50:30,500
I'm a New Hampshire native, born and raised in Goffstown.

2392
03:50:30,500 --> 03:50:43,500
When I was eight years old, my parents bought a camp on Lake Winnesquam, where we spent many summers water skiing and tubing on the lake.

2393
03:50:43,500 --> 03:50:46,000
It was our family time.

2394
03:50:46,000 --> 03:50:48,000
Thank you.

2395
03:50:48,000 --> 03:50:50,500
born and raised in Gothstown.

2396
03:50:50,500 --> 03:51:03,500
When I was eight years old, my parents bought a camp on Lake Winnesquam where we spent many summers water skiing and tubing on the lake.

2397
03:51:03,500 --> 03:51:06,000
It was our family time.

2398
03:51:06,000 --> 03:51:13,000
In the 90s, I took to wakeboarding and eventually competed at the national level.

2399
03:51:13,000 --> 03:51:27,500
I met my wife, Emily, through friends at the lake, and we spent much of our younger days working towards the goal of what is sometimes termed lake life.

2400
03:51:27,500 --> 03:51:33,500
Today, Emily and I live in Manchester, raising our 11-year-old daughter Samantha.

2401
03:51:33,500 --> 03:51:43,500
We continue the tradition of family time on the lake in the summer, sometimes wakeboarding, sometimes tubing, and oftentimes wakesurfing.

2402
03:51:43,500 --> 03:51:45,500
We love it all.

2403
03:51:45,500 --> 03:51:55,500
I'd like to offer our opposition to HB 1071 based on our family's experience with boating and enjoyment of wakesurfing.

2404
03:51:55,500 --> 03:52:06,000
I'd also like to offer my knowledge as an engineer on the causes of erosion and how this bill is misguided.

2405
03:52:06,000 --> 03:52:11,500
We've been very lucky to spend many summers on Lake Winnesquam.

2406
03:52:11,500 --> 03:52:17,000
Recreational boating and water sports are very important to our family.

2407
03:52:17,000 --> 03:52:23,500
We are outside with friends, family, enjoying New Hampshire and its natural resources.

2408
03:52:23,500 --> 03:52:30,000
We are limiting screen time for the kids and enjoying each other's company.

2409
03:52:30,000 --> 03:52:48,000
About three years ago I stopped wakeboarding and turned to full-time wakesurfing as wakesurfing is a great sport that can keep you active and healthy and you can share the experience with a lot of people.

2410
03:52:48,000 --> 03:53:00,500
My daughter has wakeboarded and wakesurfed since she was five and absolutely loves her time on the water with her parents, extended family, and friends.

2411
03:53:00,500 --> 03:53:04,500
We are also avid paddleboarders on the lake.

2412
03:53:04,500 --> 03:53:08,000
We take our boating very Thank you.

2413
03:53:08,000 --> 03:53:15,500
and absolutely loves her time on the water with her parents, extended family, and friends.

2414
03:53:15,500 --> 03:53:19,500
We are also avid paddleboarders on the lake.

2415
03:53:19,500 --> 03:53:22,500
We take our boating very seriously.

2416
03:53:22,500 --> 03:53:28,000
It's important to learn the laws and be courteous to others.

2417
03:53:28,000 --> 03:53:37,500
I feel like the reason we are here today is because some boaters don't act in the same manner.

2418
03:53:37,500 --> 03:53:41,000
I don't believe it is always purposeful.

2419
03:53:41,000 --> 03:53:44,000
I think they are just unaware.

2420
03:53:44,000 --> 03:53:48,000
We are responsible and respectful when we surf.

2421
03:53:48,000 --> 03:53:58,000
We watch our distances, obey the laws, and often surf with the wave directed toward the middle of the lake.

2422
03:53:58,000 --> 03:54:03,500
It is out of courtesy and in line with current laws.

2423
03:54:03,500 --> 03:54:05,500
These laws work.

2424
03:54:05,500 --> 03:54:13,500
We have yet to see any damage to shoreline that can be attributed to the sport.

2425
03:54:13,500 --> 03:54:17,000
Which brings me to my professional knowledge.

2426
03:54:17,000 --> 03:54:27,500
Because of my love of water when I was young, I wanted to pursue a career in civil and environmental engineering.

2427
03:54:27,500 --> 03:54:35,500
I went to WPI, graduated with a degree in civil engineering with a concentration in environmental.

2428
03:54:35,500 --> 03:54:45,500
After I graduated, I took a job with one of New England's leading environmental engineering firms as an entry-level engineer.

2429
03:54:45,500 --> 03:55:01,500
I have been at the same firm for over 20 years and I have worked almost almost exclusively in the environmental remediation industry, which specializes in the cleanup of environmentally impacted areas.

2430
03:55:01,500 --> 03:55:16,000
I am currently a senior vice president of construction management, responsible for the implementation of remediation projects throughout the country, including significant cleanups of water bodies, groundwater, and soil.

2431
03:55:16,000 --> 03:55:27,000
I am currently managing one of the largest environmental cleanup projects in the country on the Gowanus Canal in Brooklyn, New York.

2432
03:55:27,000 --> 03:55:32,500
Many of our remediation projects include restoration of wetlands and shorelines.

2433
03:55:32,500 --> 03:55:40,500
Because of this background, I understand the water-related issues that can affect remediation and restoration projects.

2434
03:55:40,500 --> 03:55:51,500
I also understand the water-related issues that impact our shorelines that from what I've read and heard are incorrectly attributed to wakesurfing.

2435
03:55:51,500 --> 03:56:02,000
What I hope the committee understands is that there are many factors that contribute to erosion more than wakesurfing ever could.

2436
03:56:02,000 --> 03:56:09,000
These factors include development, improper shoreline improvements, stormwater runoff, ice, wind, and water levels.

2437
03:56:09,000 --> 03:56:19,500
For example, ice is a factor that many do not think of because they don't see it or understand its impact.

2438
03:56:19,500 --> 03:56:23,500
It's out of sight, therefore out of mind.

2439
03:56:23,500 --> 03:56:32,500
However, during the winter months and in the spring, ice can cause significant damage and erosion to shorelines.

2440
03:56:32,500 --> 03:56:58,000
During the hard winter freeze, ice forms around the rocks and soil in the shoreline, and if lake levels fluctuate either upward or downward, the ice will push rocks further up onto the shore, destabilizing the soil below it, or it can pull rocks into the water, destabilizing the soil above.

2441
03:56:58,000 --> 03:57:15,500
In addition, during the spring thaw, ice drifts moving due to quick melting or due to wind can pull rock and soil off the shore or can push rocks and soil up onto the shore.

2442
03:57:15,500 --> 03:57:28,000
These natural events described above cause more erosion in one season than years of wave action from a boat could ever cause to the shoreline.

2443
03:57:28,000 --> 03:57:37,500
I am happy to tell you more or answer any questions about these factors in erosion of our shorelines.

2444
03:57:37,500 --> 03:57:39,500
HB 1071 is misguided.

2445
03:57:39,500 --> 03:57:45,500
There is no need to establish a separate setback for wake surfing.

2446
03:57:45,500 --> 03:58:02,500
It will cause confusion and will not solve problems related to inexperienced boat or operation on the lakes, nor will it address issues related to erosion that are more impacted by other natural factors.

2447
03:58:02,500 --> 03:58:06,000
Thank you for your time and consideration.

2448
03:58:06,000 --> 03:58:08,000
Thank you.

2449
03:58:08,000 --> 03:58:12,500
Is there any questions by members of the committee?

2450
03:58:12,500 --> 03:58:14,500
Representative Creighton.

2451
03:58:14,500 --> 03:58:16,500
Thank you, Mr.

2452
03:58:16,500 --> 03:58:18,500
Chairman.

2453
03:58:18,500 --> 03:58:21,500
Sir, thank you for your testimony.

2454
03:58:21,500 --> 03:58:35,000
The lake that you boat on with your family, if this law passed, what would that do to the skiable water that you have available to you?

2455
03:58:35,000 --> 03:58:41,500
So, I mean, Winnesquam is one of the bigger lakes in New Hampshire.

2456
03:58:41,500 --> 03:58:46,000
I think it's either the third or fourth largest.

2457
03:58:46,000 --> 03:59:02,500
It is a long, skinny lake, so it would, in effect, take away many portions of the lake and only allow the widest portions of the lake to be available for wake surfing.

2458
03:59:02,500 --> 03:59:16,500
And I think one of the concerns with that is, you know, Winnesquam is a lake that has a lot of boaters, you know, especially on the weekends.

2459
03:59:16,500 --> 03:59:18,500
It gets very busy.

2460
03:59:18,500 --> 03:59:48,000
And if you're now trying to concentrate everybody in one area of the lake, just being able to follow the safe passage rule on 150-foot setback of, you know, whether it's about cruising, about water skiing, about tubing, about wake surfing, you know, especially with the wake surface, they're all going to be in one spot on the lake.

2461
03:59:48,000 --> 03:59:58,000
So I think it has a potential to be a serious safety issue, you know, even on the larger lakes.

2462
03:59:58,000 --> 04:00:00,000
Okay, thank you.

2463
04:00:00,000 --> 04:00:02,000
Representative Egan.

2464
04:00:02,000 --> 04:00:04,000
Mr.

2465
04:00:04,000 --> 04:00:09,500
Chair, if it may please you, I don't have a question.

2466
04:00:09,500 --> 04:00:15,000
I just want to commend you bringing your daughter to testify.

2467
04:00:15,000 --> 04:00:25,000
I think it's important that young people get an understanding of how our process works, and I applaud you, sir.

2468
04:00:25,000 --> 04:00:27,000
Thank you.

2469
04:00:27,000 --> 04:00:29,000
Thank you.

2470
04:00:29,000 --> 04:00:46,000
I will say she's upset with me because three years ago she had testimony, and she couldn't testify because of COVID, and this time she didn't have one ready but I wish she had.

2471
04:00:46,000 --> 04:00:48,000
Follow-up Mr.

2472
04:00:48,000 --> 04:00:50,000
Chair.

2473
04:00:50,000 --> 04:00:54,000
May I ask your daughter a question sir?

2474
04:00:54,000 --> 04:00:56,000
Sure.

2475
04:00:56,000 --> 04:01:00,000
So what do you like about wake surfing?

2476
04:01:00,000 --> 04:01:11,000
Honestly, it's just really fun and it's very relaxing too and it's nice to be able to do with friends and family.

2477
04:01:11,000 --> 04:01:13,500
Thank you for your testimony.

2478
04:01:13,500 --> 04:01:16,000
Thank you for your testimony.

2479
04:01:16,000 --> 04:01:18,000
Thank you.

2480
04:01:18,000 --> 04:01:20,000
Representative Post.

2481
04:01:20,000 --> 04:01:22,000
Thank you, Mr.

2482
04:01:22,000 --> 04:01:25,500
Chairman, and thank you, Raymond, for coming.

2483
04:01:25,500 --> 04:01:27,500
It's Emily.

2484
04:01:27,500 --> 04:01:31,500
Demi, may I ask your daughter a question?

2485
04:01:31,500 --> 04:01:33,500
Yes.

2486
04:01:33,500 --> 04:01:35,500
Okay, Demi.

2487
04:01:35,500 --> 04:01:39,500
So, Demi, you're the future of New Hampshire.

2488
04:01:39,500 --> 04:01:41,500
Sammy, sorry.

2489
04:01:41,500 --> 04:01:43,500
Say it?

2490
04:01:43,500 --> 04:01:45,500
Sammy.

2491
04:01:45,500 --> 04:01:47,500
Sammy.

2492
04:01:47,500 --> 04:01:49,500
Sammy.

2493
04:01:49,500 --> 04:01:58,500
You're the future of New Hampshire, and we all really appreciate you coming here, as a representative stated.

2494
04:01:58,500 --> 04:02:10,500
So I just wanted to ask you a question as a young person, and that is, you know, you've learned a lot about boating.

2495
04:02:10,500 --> 04:02:14,500
What do you think helps these inexperienced boaters?

2496
04:02:14,500 --> 04:02:17,000
In your experience, what helps?

2497
04:02:17,000 --> 04:02:20,000
I don't really know that much.

2498
04:02:20,000 --> 04:02:25,000
What do you think helps people to know the rules?

2499
04:02:25,000 --> 04:02:37,500
Did you learn things about how to safely operate a boat from your parents and from the New Hampshire laws and from postings on signs?

2500
04:02:37,500 --> 04:02:39,500
Okay, thank you.

2501
04:02:39,500 --> 04:02:42,500
That's what I needed to know.

2502
04:02:42,500 --> 04:02:46,500
Thank you very much for taking my question.

2503
04:02:46,500 --> 04:02:49,000
Representative Post for a question.

2504
04:02:49,000 --> 04:02:51,000
Thank you.

2505
04:02:51,000 --> 04:02:56,000
I did not see that you submitted any testimony online.

2506
04:02:56,000 --> 04:03:01,000
Would you be able to send that to the committee?

2507
04:03:01,000 --> 04:03:03,000
Yes.

2508
04:03:03,000 --> 04:03:05,000
Thank you.

2509
04:03:05,000 --> 04:03:09,000
Any other questions from members of the committee?

2510
04:03:09,000 --> 04:03:12,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2511
04:03:12,000 --> 04:03:14,000
Thank you very much.

2512
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:16,000
Okay.

2513
04:03:16,000 --> 04:03:18,000
A few more.

2514
04:03:18,000 --> 04:03:22,500
On the supporting side, Michelle Davis, New Hampshire Lakes.

2515
04:03:22,500 --> 04:03:24,500
Oh, yeah.

2516
04:03:24,500 --> 04:03:27,500
We've got another couple of hours.

2517
04:03:27,500 --> 04:03:29,500
Don't worry, folks.

2518
04:03:29,500 --> 04:03:33,500
You don't need to go home for dinner.

2519
04:03:33,500 --> 04:03:35,500
One, two.

2520
04:03:35,500 --> 04:03:37,500
Thank you.

2521
04:03:37,500 --> 04:03:42,000
Thank you, Chair and Zullo, members of the committee.

2522
04:03:42,000 --> 04:03:53,500
We're passing around testimony from New Hampshire Lakes, but also letters from the Lakes Management Advisory Committee and the Rivers Management Advisory Committee.

2523
04:03:53,500 --> 04:03:56,000
I wanted to thank you.

2524
04:03:56,000 --> 04:03:58,500
My name is Michelle Davis.

2525
04:03:58,500 --> 04:04:04,000
I'm the Policy and Advocacy Program Manager at New Hampshire Lakes.

2526
04:04:04,000 --> 04:04:16,000
And we are in support of House Bill 1071 and encourage the committee to amend the bill to be more protective of lake health.

2527
04:04:16,000 --> 04:04:18,500
I will keep this brief.

2528
04:04:18,500 --> 04:04:22,000
You've already heard a lot of testimony.

2529
04:04:22,000 --> 04:04:37,000
But as you've heard, the University of Minnesota study concluded that at least 500 feet are needed for wake surfing waves to diminish compared to waves created by non-wakesurf boats.

2530
04:04:37,000 --> 04:04:45,500
And I just wanted to address a few arguments that you've heard and will continue to hear.

2531
04:04:45,500 --> 04:04:50,000
One being that the study was potentially not comprehensive.

2532
04:04:50,000 --> 04:04:59,000
The authors acknowledge that there are many other types of boats that were not included in the study.

2533
04:04:59,000 --> 04:05:07,000
I would also point out that the study was conducted, excuse me, on an empty lake.

2534
04:05:07,000 --> 04:05:15,000
It did not test or address the compounding impact of multiple on-water activities all producing wakes.

2535
04:05:15,000 --> 04:05:31,500
Several other studies from around the country have come to the same conclusion that increased setbacks all greater than 250 feet are necessary to mitigate the impact of enhanced waves from wake surfing.

2536
04:05:31,500 --> 04:07:28,000
Second, the study did not address impacts on shorelines and lake bottoms this is valid that said it's common knowledge that waves erode shorelines and that the bigger the waves the more energy they have and the more damaging effect they have on shoreline stability a georgia study indicated that at a 250 foot setback waves for wake surfing produces waves with more than six times the energy of those produced by a cruising vessel when they reach the shoreline third uh that requiring an increased setback will concentrate wake surfing activities in the center of our lakes simple mapping exercises show that this is true for some of the smaller lakes but without protective zoning approaches like increased setbacks for high impact activities we are in real danger of loving our lakes to death it won't concentrate necessarily all activities um there'll it'll there'll still be plenty of space on a lot of our lakes left for you know tubers to use one lane potentially and wake surfers to use another and just finally I will say that we are not suggesting that wake surfing should be banned from New Hampshire's lakes we maintain that when done far enough from shore and in deep enough water wake surfing is a fun activity for families and water sports enthusiasts alike with minimal impacts to Lake health I thank you for the opportunity comment.

04:07:28,000 --> 04:07:36,500
We urge you to help keep New Hampshire's lakes clean and healthy by amending House Bill 1071.

2538
04:07:36,500 --> 04:07:38,500
Thank you.

2539
04:07:38,500 --> 04:07:40,500
Thank you very much.

2540
04:07:40,500 --> 04:07:42,500
Is there any questions?

2541
04:07:42,500 --> 04:07:45,000
Any questions from the committee?

2542
04:07:45,000 --> 04:07:48,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2543
04:07:48,000 --> 04:07:50,000
Thank you.

2544
04:07:50,000 --> 04:07:52,000
Okay.

2545
04:07:52,000 --> 04:07:54,000
In opposition, Shane Carey.

2546
04:07:54,000 --> 04:07:57,000
Thank you members of the committee.

2547
04:07:57,000 --> 04:08:04,500
My name is Shane Carey and I live in Nottingham with my wife and kids.

2548
04:08:04,500 --> 04:08:12,000
I work in the auto industry and have enjoyed boating on Patakwe Lake for decades.

2549
04:08:12,000 --> 04:08:17,000
I'm here to testify in opposition to House Bill 1071.

2550
04:08:17,000 --> 04:08:24,500
I had the pleasure of serving on House Bill 137, Legislative Commission on wake boats.

2551
04:08:24,500 --> 04:08:30,000
We spent almost a year studying all aspects of the issue.

2552
04:08:30,000 --> 04:08:36,000
The proposal for this setback in House Bill 1071 was never discussed.

2553
04:08:36,000 --> 04:08:44,500
At one meeting, we did hear from a wave energy expert who explained his study on waves.

2554
04:08:44,500 --> 04:08:54,500
He was upfront that his study was sponsored by water sports industry, but it was clear findings were his own.

2555
04:08:54,500 --> 04:09:02,000
He had a 30-year career at MIT as an engineer and now is a consultant.

2556
04:09:02,000 --> 04:09:10,000
His report showed that the best practices for wake surfing would be 200 feet from shore.

2557
04:09:10,000 --> 04:09:20,500
He also noted that the waves from the surfing were similar to those created by a 10 mile an hour wind.

2558
04:09:20,500 --> 04:09:31,500
The pushback on the study from a New Hampshire Lakes representative on the commission was that his study was not peer reviewed.

2559
04:09:31,500 --> 04:09:34,000
I've been told that Mr.

2560
04:09:34,000 --> 04:10:17,000
Gaudi's study is currently going through the peer review process we should not pass House Bill 1071 we should wait to see the results of that review in my experience the best way to change behavior is through education and communication we've discussed wake responsibility campaign during the Commission and we have worked hard to develop and implement campaign to educate boaters I can I can tell you a story about a boater on Patakaway who was going too close to shore and upsetting several neighbors.

2561
04:10:17,000 --> 04:10:26,000
We took it upon ourselves to reach out to him, let him know his actions were being perceived.

2562
04:10:26,000 --> 04:10:33,000
He was very apologetic, didn't know the operation was incorrect and appreciated the outreach.

2563
04:10:33,000 --> 04:10:37,500
There is no longer a problem on Patakawai Lake.

2564
04:10:37,500 --> 04:10:49,000
In New Hampshire, we can talk to each other, and as boaters, we need to continue our outreach to solve problems without legislation.

2565
04:10:49,000 --> 04:10:52,500
We do not need House Bill 1071.

2566
04:10:52,500 --> 04:10:56,500
It will create more problems than it solves.

2567
04:10:56,500 --> 04:10:59,000
Thank you for your time.

2568
04:10:59,000 --> 04:11:01,000
Thank you very much.

2569
04:11:01,000 --> 04:11:04,500
Is there any questions from the committee?

2570
04:11:04,500 --> 04:11:07,500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2571
04:11:07,500 --> 04:11:11,000
In support of the bill, Susan Price.

2572
04:11:11,000 --> 04:11:13,000
Thank you, Mr.

2573
04:11:13,000 --> 04:11:16,000
Chairman and members of the committee.

2574
04:11:16,000 --> 04:11:23,500
I am Susan Price, and I'm also the Fish and Game Commissioner for Carroll County.

2575
04:11:23,500 --> 04:11:29,500
We did not, as a commission, take a position on this bill.

2576
04:11:29,500 --> 04:11:56,000
It came to our attention yesterday, and so we were a little late to the party so the commission does not have a position but I had intended to testify based upon my personal experience as well so I did discuss the bill with the director of inland fisheries that, that's Diane Timmons.

2577
04:11:56,000 --> 04:11:58,500
And her concerns were twofold.

2578
04:11:58,500 --> 04:12:03,500
One was already mentioned, the hitchhikers in the ballast tanks.

2579
04:12:03,500 --> 04:12:09,000
Everything from milfoil to zebra mussels, those are the common ones.

2580
04:12:09,000 --> 04:12:18,000
But the other issue is, and I actually have an aerial photo of this, is direct habitat destruction.

2581
04:12:18,000 --> 04:12:29,000
When these boats are filled with their ballast tanks and pulled down, they can increase turbidity up to 10 feet in depth.

2582
04:12:29,000 --> 04:12:45,000
And so the suspended sediment can stay in the water depending upon the water body and a number of factors for quite some time and possibly cause negative impact to aquatic life.

2583
04:12:45,000 --> 04:12:59,500
I actually do have an aerial photo of a lake in Indiana where you can see the scarring from the wake boats in the shallower areas of the lake.

2584
04:12:59,500 --> 04:13:02,000
So those were her concerns.

2585
04:13:02,000 --> 04:13:07,500
We apologize for not bringing an official position to the table.

2586
04:13:07,500 --> 04:13:12,000
We lost our legal coordinator, Paul Sanderson, to retirement.

2587
04:13:12,000 --> 04:13:14,500
So we've been over there.

2588
04:13:14,500 --> 04:13:22,500
Everybody's wearing a little different hat right now, trying to keep up with the legislative session.

2589
04:13:22,500 --> 04:13:27,500
I personally, I live in Moultonboro, near the Tuftonboro line.

2590
04:13:27,500 --> 04:13:31,500
We slip a boat at Melvin Village Marina.

2591
04:13:31,500 --> 04:13:33,500
It's a powerboat.

2592
04:13:33,500 --> 04:13:37,000
It is, by most standards, quite fast.

2593
04:13:37,000 --> 04:13:40,000
It is a Lund fishing boat.

2594
04:13:40,000 --> 04:13:46,500
I am also a certified stand-up paddleboard instructor with the American Canoe Association.

2595
04:13:46,500 --> 04:13:55,500
So I enjoy the lake both as a paddler as well as a fisherman and a powerboat owner.

2596
04:13:55,500 --> 04:14:03,000
And I've had some very, what I feel are safety issues with wakeboard boats personally.

2597
04:14:03,000 --> 04:14:07,500
They do make a high amplitude, low frequency wave.

2598
04:14:07,500 --> 04:14:13,000
And these waves tend to sort of sneak up on you.

2599
04:14:13,000 --> 04:14:17,000
I would consider myself a very experienced paddleboarder.

2600
04:14:17,000 --> 04:14:25,500
I will typically paddle from Melvin Bay down to Wolfboro, have lunch, go over to Center Harbor.

2601
04:14:25,500 --> 04:14:29,000
I spend hours on the lake paddleboarding.

2602
04:14:29,000 --> 04:14:35,000
So I can take, personally, I can take these type of waves.

2603
04:14:35,000 --> 04:14:43,500
But I can't give an instruction, I can't give a lesson on Lake Winnipesaukee to a beginner.

2604
04:14:43,500 --> 04:14:54,000
And I do see people in kayaks, on paddle boards, also small fishing craft, like shorter 12-foot single-haul boats, small horsepower.

2605
04:14:54,000 --> 04:15:01,000
These wake boats have created wakes that break over the bow of their boat.

2606
04:15:01,000 --> 04:15:10,000
So I do support personally an increase in the setback due to my personal experience on the lake.

2607
04:15:10,000 --> 04:15:20,000
Regarding my powerboat, it is it's rigged for fishing, or the one I had before the one I have now.

2608
04:15:20,000 --> 04:15:23,000
How many boats do I own?

2609
04:15:23,000 --> 04:15:25,000
That's my salesman.

2610
04:15:25,000 --> 04:15:30,500
So I don't know if you're familiar with a trolling motor.

2611
04:15:30,500 --> 04:15:41,500
You typically mount them on the bow of the boat, and you deploy them when you want to maintain a fishing position.

2612
04:15:41,500 --> 04:16:36,000
And the newer trolling motors are all GPSed, so you can maintain your your position in one spot I have had a wakeboat outside of the 150 rule I'm there they're in compliance but their wake the amplitude of that wake is so great that I have a 60 inch bow on my depth and the trolling motor will be lifted out of the water and cavitate in the air so I do see a need because these boats have a specific purpose that causes a specific type of wave I do see a need from a safety standpoint for an increased setback I personally enjoy watching the wakeboats.

2613
04:16:36,000 --> 04:16:46,000
I think it's fun to watch people that are substantially younger and fitter than I do these aerobatics and stuff.

2614
04:16:46,000 --> 04:16:48,000
I'm not anti-wakeboat.

2615
04:16:48,000 --> 04:17:07,000
But my personal experience leads me to believe that there are people in other craft that have safety issues, and there's just a need to increase that safety buffer for those paddlers and the smaller craft out there.

2616
04:17:07,000 --> 04:17:11,000
So I'd be happy to take any questions.

2617
04:17:11,000 --> 04:17:13,000
Thank you.

2618
04:17:13,000 --> 04:17:17,500
Is there any questions by members of the committee?

2619
04:17:17,500 --> 04:17:19,500
Any other questions?

2620
04:17:19,500 --> 04:17:21,500
Thank you.

2621
04:17:21,500 --> 04:17:31,000
Is there already a buffer that needs to be observed between a boat and a person in the water?

2622
04:17:31,000 --> 04:17:34,000
That would be the 150-foot rule.

2623
04:17:34,000 --> 04:17:39,000
It's against any craft, any dock, basically any person, anything.

2624
04:17:39,000 --> 04:17:46,500
The other thing that comes to mind as well, getting more to the habitat destruction.

2625
04:17:46,500 --> 04:17:52,500
Winnipesaukee is like a lot of smaller lakes within one big lake.

2626
04:17:52,500 --> 04:18:35,500
And I think people who don't spend time on this lake don't understand that If you look at a chart of the lake the Moultonboro Tuftonboro part of the lake tends to be very narrow we have some large bays but when you get up into the the greens basin area the There are some loon habitat and the wakeats in there, they have had problems with the, not specifically tied to the wakeboats, but the loon, some of the loon nests have been washed out.

2627
04:18:35,500 --> 04:18:42,000
And I could see some of these waves potentially having a loon impact.

2628
04:18:42,000 --> 04:18:45,000
I have no evidence of that.

2629
04:18:45,000 --> 04:18:58,500
But my personal experience knowing where the loon nests are on that part of the lake, I could see it happening out of the Lees Mill area.

2630
04:18:58,500 --> 04:19:01,500
And I did bring a handout.

2631
04:19:01,500 --> 04:19:14,500
I'd be glad to send a link to this of the aerial photo of the lake in Indiana showing the vegetative scarring from the wake boats.

2632
04:19:14,500 --> 04:19:18,500
Any other questions from members of the committee?

2633
04:19:18,500 --> 04:19:23,000
Seeing none, thank you very much for your testimony.

2634
04:19:23,000 --> 04:19:31,500
And if you have anything you want to send to the committee besides this, we appreciate it.

2635
04:19:31,500 --> 04:19:33,500
Thank you, Mr.

2636
04:19:33,500 --> 04:19:35,500
Chair.

2637
04:19:35,500 --> 04:19:39,000
Kim Bonifant, in opposition to the bill?

2638
04:19:39,000 --> 04:19:41,000
She's not here?

2639
04:19:41,000 --> 04:19:43,000
Oh, okay.

2640
04:19:43,000 --> 04:19:45,000
That's fine.

2641
04:19:45,000 --> 04:19:47,000
Still on the...

2642
04:19:47,000 --> 04:19:52,500
I'll go for another person who's in opposition to the bill.

2643
04:19:52,500 --> 04:19:54,500
Scott Fitzgerald.

2644
04:19:54,500 --> 04:19:56,500
Good afternoon, everybody.

2645
04:19:56,500 --> 04:19:58,500
I appreciate your time.

2646
04:19:58,500 --> 04:20:01,000
My name is Scott Fitzgerald.

2647
04:20:01,000 --> 04:20:04,000
I'm a resident of New London.

2648
04:20:04,000 --> 04:20:06,000
Good afternoon, everybody.

2649
04:20:06,000 --> 04:20:08,000
I appreciate your time.

2650
04:20:08,000 --> 04:20:10,500
My name is Scott Fitzgerald.

2651
04:20:10,500 --> 04:20:14,500
I'm a resident of New London, New Hampshire.

2652
04:20:14,500 --> 04:20:21,000
Like a few others here, I actually rent a slip on Lake Sunapee.

2653
04:20:21,000 --> 04:20:28,000
That's the main where we have a wake surf boat in opposition to this.

2654
04:20:28,000 --> 04:20:30,000
I say in opposition.

2655
04:20:30,000 --> 04:21:05,000
I am in appreciation of the bill of the dialogue of the attempt to collaborate in a way to try and share the lakes I Would just add I'm not going to belabor the points that have already been made as time sensitive here I think a couple of points to make to add on In terms of the depth that wake surfers use, wake surfers actually avoid shallow water.

2656
04:21:05,000 --> 04:21:28,000
If you're going in 20 feet of water and all of a sudden you dip to 8 feet of water, your wave becomes basically unsurfable because of the ability of the boat to propel the water at a depth that would create a wave that size.

2657
04:21:28,000 --> 04:21:44,000
So that doesn't mean everybody, but I would say the vast majority of wake surfers will avoid shallow areas because it's actually antithetical to what they're trying to do, which is surf.

2658
04:21:44,000 --> 04:22:36,000
I would say as an educator, I guess I made a choice to become an educator, but there's an economic impact that probably will inhibit my ability to ever have a house on a lake and I know that is a choice but I think this dialogue has to be sensitive to the ability to share the waterways for people who have the ability to purchase a home on the lake and those who don't whether that's by choice or not by choice and that's how do we share I guess I go default to the educator's mindset on how do we properly share.

2659
04:22:36,000 --> 04:22:56,500
If I'm a member of a rowing committee, a rowing club, a wake surf boat is kryptonite basically to my existence so I can understand the emotional response to that as they're trying to enjoy the lake just as we are.

2660
04:22:56,500 --> 04:23:06,500
I think there's other ways to do that, because regulation will then inhibit some people's abilities to access these lakes.

2661
04:23:06,500 --> 04:23:10,500
And I don't think that's a good thing.

2662
04:23:10,500 --> 04:23:14,500
I think we can find ways to educate.

2663
04:23:14,500 --> 04:23:17,500
We can find ways to share.

2664
04:23:17,500 --> 04:23:19,500
We can use time.

2665
04:23:19,500 --> 04:23:22,500
We often wake surf for sunrise.

2666
04:23:22,500 --> 04:24:33,500
And I can tell you, at 530 in the morning in the summer, there's not a lot of people there and we have open waters we stay in the middle we try to not pass over houses but I do understand that my coincidentally my slip is in a no-wake zone and I'll probably never rent one outside of a no wake zone so I am very sensitive to all types of craft that sit on a dock or on on and waves have a significant impact on that how they're tied one big wave can cause extensive damage to a boat and I'm very sensitive to that so again how do we cooperate rather than I think over regulation will limit use and I think that's what I grew up in New Hampshire and chose to come back to New Hampshire.

2667
04:24:33,500 --> 04:24:40,500
One of my favorite things about New Hampshire is the ability to have dialogue.

2668
04:24:40,500 --> 04:24:58,000
I'm an athletic director at a high school, so I kind of swim, pun intended, in emotion and dialogue and how do you approach things and how do you regulate versus how do you cooperate.

2669
04:24:58,000 --> 04:25:34,500
I think we also need to understand that many of us and many boaters choose there is 150 but we choose you have the ability to go more and many do choose that we try in schools and I think as lawmakers you try to do the same you don't try to regulate based on anomalies there are anomalies that tourists and residents alike that will abuse their privilege to use the water.

2670
04:25:34,500 --> 04:25:38,000
They will have zero consideration of others.

2671
04:25:38,000 --> 04:25:45,500
And I'd be naive to say I have the silver bullet answer to address that.

2672
04:25:45,500 --> 04:25:50,500
But I just would say I'm sensitive to the issue.

2673
04:25:50,500 --> 04:25:53,000
I'm sensitive to both sides.

2674
04:25:53,000 --> 04:26:00,500
but I don't think overregulation in this instance is the way because it limits access.

2675
04:26:00,500 --> 04:26:04,500
It limits people's ability to share the water.

2676
04:26:04,500 --> 04:26:14,000
How do we work as a team to go about enjoying these waterways collectively and together as a state?

2677
04:26:14,000 --> 04:26:16,000
Thank you.

2678
04:26:16,000 --> 04:26:21,500
Is there any member of the committee who has a question?

2679
04:26:21,500 --> 04:26:23,500
Seeing representative folks.

2680
04:26:23,500 --> 04:26:25,500
Thank you, Mr.

2681
04:26:25,500 --> 04:26:30,000
Chair, and thank you for coming to testify today.

2682
04:26:30,000 --> 04:26:37,500
You said you have a wakeboat or a boat that you use for wake surfing.

2683
04:26:37,500 --> 04:26:39,500
Yes.

2684
04:26:39,500 --> 04:26:46,500
And I wondered, the past speaker was talking about the water in the ballast.

2685
04:26:46,500 --> 04:26:52,000
Can you tell me about what you do with that water?

2686
04:26:52,000 --> 04:27:01,000
And a gentleman, I believe it was John, referenced it earlier in terms of how you fill it.

2687
04:27:01,000 --> 04:27:05,500
And that's, again, like a bass boat as well.

2688
04:27:05,500 --> 04:27:08,500
You're going to fill your tanks.

2689
04:27:08,500 --> 04:27:16,000
And so most wake surfers will begin the process of going out to the middle.

2690
04:27:16,000 --> 04:27:20,500
And while you're in that process, you fill up.

2691
04:27:20,500 --> 04:27:28,000
So you are away from shore traveling to an area where you can start surfing.

2692
04:27:28,000 --> 04:27:32,500
Basically, you travel to where you can begin surfing.

2693
04:27:32,500 --> 04:27:35,000
So you're not riding shore.

2694
04:27:35,000 --> 04:27:37,000
You're not going shallow.

2695
04:27:37,000 --> 04:27:42,000
Again, we don't want any of the areas churned up.

2696
04:27:42,000 --> 04:27:50,000
I have that dock that we rent, and we want to sustain that area as well.

2697
04:27:50,000 --> 04:27:57,000
So we go out to the middle where there's enough water to do that.

2698
04:27:57,000 --> 04:27:59,000
Second?

2699
04:27:59,000 --> 04:28:01,000
For an additional question.

2700
04:28:01,000 --> 04:28:03,000
Thank you.

2701
04:28:03,000 --> 04:28:05,000
Whoops, sorry.

2702
04:28:05,000 --> 04:28:18,500
So generally when you're going back to shore or going back to your dock, you allow the water to go out slowly as you're coming into shore.

2703
04:28:18,500 --> 04:28:21,000
Is that how that works?

2704
04:28:21,000 --> 04:28:23,000
We do, yeah.

2705
04:28:23,000 --> 04:28:40,000
Actually, we get somewhat near the no-wake zone, which I see many do, because, again, with all that weight, you're not going to want to maintain that weight as you're pulling in your dock.

2706
04:28:40,000 --> 04:28:49,000
The vast majority of docks are not deep-water docks, so you're coming in to 6, 8, 10 feet.

2707
04:28:49,000 --> 04:28:58,500
So you're not going to want that boat to sink in the water as you're pulling in the dock.

2708
04:28:58,500 --> 04:29:34,000
So we make sure we empty it out well advance because not only do we want that water away from shore but we also don't want to increase the ability for our boat to be damaged because it's weighed down as we get close to shore I was gonna ask you do you ever take your boat out to another lake, or do you primarily ski on the lake you're at?

2709
04:29:34,000 --> 04:29:36,000
I do not.

2710
04:29:36,000 --> 04:29:42,000
That boat that I have, the total weight is about 6,500 pounds.

2711
04:29:42,000 --> 04:29:46,000
I am quite nervous to move that thing.

2712
04:29:46,000 --> 04:29:55,500
I take it from the marina once a year, put it in the water, and then take it back.

2713
04:29:55,500 --> 04:30:35,000
And I think the mere size of the boat really kind of prohibits many from doing that I think people try to categorize it in the same way they do a bass fishing boat where you're going to the tournament and I had one of those you're constantly pulling that in and out and that's where invasive species come in exponentially and exponentially higher rate but the they're so big that they're not necessarily going to be pulled out.

2714
04:30:35,000 --> 04:30:37,000
Thank you very much.

2715
04:30:37,000 --> 04:30:41,000
Any other questions from members of the committee?

2716
04:30:41,000 --> 04:30:43,000
Seeing none.

2717
04:30:43,000 --> 04:30:45,000
Thank you very much.

2718
04:30:45,000 --> 04:30:47,500
Thank you for your time.

2719
04:30:47,500 --> 04:30:49,500
Thank you.

2720
04:30:49,500 --> 04:30:54,500
Now from someone in support of the bill, Dan McCaffrey.

2721
04:30:54,500 --> 04:30:56,500
Thank you.

2722
04:30:56,500 --> 04:31:03,000
Now from someone in support of the bill, Dan McCaffrey, Spindle Point Association.

2723
04:31:03,000 --> 04:31:05,000
Thank you, Mr.

2724
04:31:05,000 --> 04:31:07,000
Chairman, committee.

2725
04:31:07,000 --> 04:31:09,500
My name is Dan McCaffrey.

2726
04:31:09,500 --> 04:31:14,000
I've been living in Meredith for 22 years now.

2727
04:31:14,000 --> 04:31:22,500
I'd also like to let you know that I am the president of the Spindle Point Association.

2728
04:31:22,500 --> 04:31:39,500
Spindle Point is located on the peninsula that forms the eastern side of the mouth to Meredith Bay and it separates Meredith Bay from Cummings Cove, just to give you a little geographical reference.

2729
04:31:39,500 --> 04:31:43,000
I'm an average boater, including water sports.

2730
04:31:43,000 --> 04:31:46,500
I'm here in support of the bill.

2731
04:31:46,500 --> 04:32:01,000
I'm hoping that this bill is the start of a process that becomes a compromise between wake boaters, paddlers, sailboat folks, as well as just recreational boaters and fishermen.

2732
04:32:01,000 --> 04:32:07,000
A little bit about the science that's been mentioned here to date.

2733
04:32:07,000 --> 04:32:16,500
We talked about amplitude and low-frequency waves, But I, it bears mentioning how the lake bed affects the waves.

2734
04:32:16,500 --> 04:32:26,500
When you have a, like any wave, you go to the ocean, you see the waves crashing on the beach.

2735
04:32:26,500 --> 04:32:31,500
If it's a gradual seafloor, the waves will break gradually.

2736
04:32:31,500 --> 04:32:46,500
if the seafloor rises up sharply like it does in a lot of glacier lakes, which is Lake Winnipesaukee and many other lakes in New Hampshire, the wave crashes dramatically.

2737
04:32:46,500 --> 04:32:59,000
So what's happened over the last few years with the popularity of wake boats, especially in my neighborhood, which represents 110 waterfront homes in Merida.

2738
04:32:59,000 --> 04:33:12,000
Depending upon the geography of the lot, these waves from boats crash directly on the shoreline, which is oftentimes rocky, or even premature to the shoreline.

2739
04:33:12,000 --> 04:33:19,500
So it's crashing in like one or two feet before it gets to the shore.

2740
04:33:19,500 --> 04:33:23,000
So what are the results of that?

2741
04:33:23,000 --> 04:33:37,000
From a habitat standpoint, over the 22 years that I've been here in Meredith, we have traditionally had in the late spring between 15 and 18 fish nests.

2742
04:33:37,000 --> 04:33:39,000
Seen fish nests before?

2743
04:33:39,000 --> 04:33:45,000
The fish make a small circle in the sand, lay their eggs?

2744
04:33:45,000 --> 04:34:00,500
Well, this year, due to the wave action, the typical 15 to 18 fish nests that you can see while standing on my dock were gone by the end of June.

2745
04:34:00,500 --> 04:34:02,500
All gone.

2746
04:34:02,500 --> 04:34:04,500
One survived.

2747
04:34:04,500 --> 04:34:33,000
Now, I'm not a biologist like one of the gentlemen from DES who testified, but I don't know what the impact is or is going to be for the, say, 15 fish nests that are gone and what those small fish mean to the trout they were going to eat them or the bass or the salmon.

2748
04:34:33,000 --> 04:34:46,000
The other effect of the wave action that we have specifically in Winnipesaukee and in Cummings Cove is the inability for others to enjoy the lake.

2749
04:34:46,000 --> 04:34:52,000
Mentioned earlier, we have wakeboarders, we have recreational boaters, fishermen, paddlers, sailors.

2750
04:34:52,000 --> 04:35:03,000
My wife specifically will not go out kayaking if she can't go out in the morning and be back by 7 a.m.

2751
04:35:03,000 --> 04:35:05,500
due to the wave action.

2752
04:35:05,500 --> 04:35:10,500
A bit on a little more on the erosion effect.

2753
04:35:10,500 --> 04:35:16,500
It's been mentioned here that it's not just waves that create erosion.

2754
04:35:16,500 --> 04:35:25,500
Again, not a scientist, and I can absolutely agree that ice and rock movement can have an effect.

2755
04:35:25,500 --> 04:35:43,000
But you really have to look back at the history and realize in the 90s when it was codified for distance from the shore, it was recognized that waves do have a cause and effect.

2756
04:35:43,000 --> 04:35:49,500
Voluntarily, the marine industry here has suggested to people, let's go to 200.

2757
04:35:49,500 --> 04:35:52,500
Voluntarily, the law codified at 150.

2758
04:35:52,500 --> 04:35:55,500
This bill is asking for 250.

2759
04:35:55,500 --> 04:36:03,000
There were many that could argue that it should be much farther off from shore.

2760
04:36:03,000 --> 04:36:08,500
At least the passing of this bill will start that process.

2761
04:36:08,500 --> 04:36:16,000
There are many that could argue that it should be much farther off, I'm sure.

2762
04:36:16,000 --> 04:36:21,500
At least the passing of this bill will start that process.

2763
04:36:21,500 --> 04:36:26,500
You can stand on my dock and watch the erosion.

2764
04:36:26,500 --> 04:36:33,000
When the waves come in, they destroy the fishnests because of the amplitude.

2765
04:36:33,000 --> 04:36:40,500
The waves crash and fall on top of themselves as they come into the shore.

2766
04:36:40,500 --> 04:36:47,000
I have irreparable erosion on my property and in many of my neighbors.

2767
04:36:47,000 --> 04:36:50,000
So what is the irony here?

2768
04:36:50,000 --> 04:37:09,500
We have a state law, Shore Land Protection Act, very well codified, that sets out all types of rules and regulations for what I need to do to protect the natural shoreline, the vegetation, the trees, the blueberry bushes.

2769
04:37:09,500 --> 04:37:11,500
Right?

2770
04:37:11,500 --> 04:37:16,500
However, the shoreline is being destroyed from the other side.

2771
04:37:16,500 --> 04:37:19,000
And I can watch it.

2772
04:37:19,000 --> 04:37:22,500
And we all know cause and effect.

2773
04:37:22,500 --> 04:37:24,500
Big waves cause erosion.

2774
04:37:24,500 --> 04:37:26,500
Look at the news.

2775
04:37:26,500 --> 04:37:30,000
Ask anyone who lives on Cape Cod.

2776
04:37:30,000 --> 04:37:34,500
The New Jersey hurricane, houses falling into the ocean.

2777
04:37:34,500 --> 04:37:36,500
Waves cause damage.

2778
04:37:36,500 --> 04:37:39,000
We have to mitigate that.

2779
04:37:39,000 --> 04:37:45,500
So I encourage you to pass this as a part of a process.

2780
04:37:45,500 --> 04:37:57,500
Let's move forward to getting a good community of people that can enjoy the lake, all people of all different boating types and personalities.

2781
04:37:57,500 --> 04:38:01,000
Thank you very much for your testimony.

2782
04:38:01,000 --> 04:38:04,500
Any questions by members of the committee?

2783
04:38:04,500 --> 04:38:07,500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2784
04:38:07,500 --> 04:38:09,500
Thank you, Mr.

2785
04:38:09,500 --> 04:38:11,500
Chairman.

2786
04:38:11,500 --> 04:38:15,500
In opposition to the bill is Evan Goldner.

2787
04:38:15,500 --> 04:38:25,500
I am the owner and operator of a small water sports summer camp called Water Monkey in the Lakes region.

2788
04:38:25,500 --> 04:38:33,500
My primary business is teaching kids at the summer camp wakeboarding, water skiing, and wake surfing.

2789
04:38:33,500 --> 04:38:47,500
I also offer private lessons on my lake, on other people's boats, on my boats, in all those sports, plus more and more on boat driving as well.

2790
04:38:47,500 --> 04:38:53,000
People will call and say, you know, we have this boat.

2791
04:38:53,000 --> 04:39:08,000
We don't know how to drive it, how to trailer it, how to do this, and I'll spend as long as they want working with them on driving the boat.

2792
04:39:08,000 --> 04:39:15,500
I'm here to oppose HB 1071 and the proposed 250-foot setback for wake surf boats.

2793
04:39:15,500 --> 04:39:27,000
I believe this new rule would limit where the wake surfing is possible in our state and would reduce access to this sport.

2794
04:39:27,000 --> 04:39:32,000
I never was lucky enough to have a lake house.

2795
04:39:32,000 --> 04:39:37,000
I always, always, always wanted to be on the water.

2796
04:39:37,000 --> 04:39:49,000
So when I finished college and I was freshly out, I was like, I need to be on the water back in New Hampshire.

2797
04:39:49,000 --> 04:39:59,000
I thought of this idea for this camp, and I started it, and I'm out there having fun every day.

2798
04:39:59,000 --> 04:40:13,500
And I'm really fortunate that in the scope of running this business, I've spent thousands of hours driving wakeboard boats, inboard, outboards, every kind of boat you can imagine.

2799
04:40:13,500 --> 04:40:22,000
People call me, they're like, I've got an aluminum fishing boat, my kids want to water ski.

2800
04:40:22,000 --> 04:40:26,000
I will be there helping them water ski.

2801
04:40:26,000 --> 04:40:31,000
So I'm super lucky to travel the state doing this.

2802
04:40:31,000 --> 04:40:39,500
I do this on my lake, as well as other lakes, ponds, and rivers around New Hampshire.

2803
04:40:39,500 --> 04:40:49,000
In this capacity, I have a unique perspective into the water sports pursuits of families, groups, individuals, and businesses.

2804
04:40:49,000 --> 04:41:05,500
Wake surfing has really revolutionized how people of all ages and abilities, I think that's really important, and I'll get to that, and demographics have fun on the water and enjoy the outdoors.

2805
04:41:05,500 --> 04:41:13,000
So briefly, the range of people I have introduced wake surfing to is really incredible.

2806
04:41:13,000 --> 04:41:19,500
I'll speak about three groups that I think really benefit from wake surfing.

2807
04:41:19,500 --> 04:41:25,000
First are men and women in their 60s, 70s, and 80s.

2808
04:41:25,000 --> 04:41:34,000
I get so many calls from people who were like, you know, I water skied my entire life.

2809
04:41:34,000 --> 04:41:42,500
Now, you know, shoulders, hips, knees can't handle the motion of getting up out of the water.

2810
04:41:42,500 --> 04:41:47,000
Whereas wake surfing, that's not a problem for them.

2811
04:41:47,000 --> 04:41:58,000
And it's really fun to see these people, you know, get behind the boat, get up, and just immediate joy and fun.

2812
04:41:58,000 --> 04:42:00,500
It's so awesome to see.

2813
04:42:00,500 --> 04:42:04,000
And they share that with their grandkids.

2814
04:42:04,000 --> 04:42:06,000
It's really fun.

2815
04:42:06,000 --> 04:42:08,500
Next group are little kids.

2816
04:42:08,500 --> 04:42:24,500
A lot of little kids, I'm talking like four, five, six, they're nervous to be behind the boat water skiing and wakeboarding and they don't really have that feeling with wake surfing.

2817
04:42:24,500 --> 04:42:26,500
We're going much slower.

2818
04:42:26,500 --> 04:42:35,000
We can be in the seat in the back of the boat talking them through every step.

2819
04:42:35,000 --> 04:42:48,000
And it's just so, again, amazing to see little kids just pop up and their parents are like, we never thought that would happen so quickly.

2820
04:42:48,000 --> 04:42:50,000
That's really fun.

2821
04:42:50,000 --> 04:42:59,500
The last group that I think is so important are kids and adults with physical, mental, and emotional disabilities.

2822
04:42:59,500 --> 04:43:15,000
I've worked with so many different people where way back on a water ski line, they might struggle, they might not have the strength or be missing part of a limb.

2823
04:43:15,000 --> 04:43:23,000
They cannot water ski or wakeboard, whereas wake surfing, we can adapt how we teach it.

2824
04:43:23,000 --> 04:43:26,500
There's different ways you can get up.

2825
04:43:26,500 --> 04:43:29,500
There's different ways to teach things.

2826
04:43:29,500 --> 04:43:32,000
You can overcome these limitations.

2827
04:43:32,000 --> 04:43:41,000
Wake surfing is also super interactive, easily demonstrated, so people who learn differently can pick it up quickly.

2828
04:43:41,000 --> 04:43:46,500
It's just such a unique sport in that aspect that aspect.

2829
04:43:46,500 --> 04:43:53,500
Lots of people I teach use their wake surf boats on smaller water bodies.

2830
04:43:53,500 --> 04:43:57,000
I do lessons on the Merrimack River.

2831
04:43:57,000 --> 04:44:07,000
If this bill were to pass with 250-foot setback, most of the Merrimack River you could not wake surf anymore.

2832
04:44:07,000 --> 04:44:09,000
It's narrow.

2833
04:44:09,000 --> 04:44:11,000
It's super long.

2834
04:44:11,000 --> 04:44:14,000
We always stay in the middle.

2835
04:44:14,000 --> 04:44:17,000
We go right down the middle.

2836
04:44:17,000 --> 04:44:21,500
But 250 feet on either side, that's cutting off.

2837
04:44:21,500 --> 04:44:29,000
Anyone that wants to boat on Merrimack would not be able to wake surf there.

2838
04:44:29,000 --> 04:44:34,500
And that would be a shame because people love these sports.

2839
04:44:34,500 --> 04:44:44,000
For over a decade, as wake surfing has exploded, I mean, I was there at the beginning doing this.

2840
04:44:44,000 --> 04:44:51,500
People would come up next to our boat and be like, what are you doing?

2841
04:44:51,500 --> 04:44:53,500
We're wake surfing.

2842
04:44:53,500 --> 04:44:55,500
This is awesome.

2843
04:44:55,500 --> 04:44:58,000
And we would educate people.

2844
04:44:58,000 --> 04:45:08,500
And that's what my career is all about, that teaching people about these sports, having fun, being safe on the water.

2845
04:45:08,500 --> 04:45:18,500
I've witnessed wake surf boats coexist with other motorized and non-motorized watercraft and swimmers and property owners and the wildlife.

2846
04:45:18,500 --> 04:45:40,500
And I really don't think it would be productive to pass a rule that just targets one activity I'm happy to take any questions you guys have about wake surfing boating summer camps anything you've got any any questions by members of the committee.

2847
04:45:40,500 --> 04:45:42,500
Representative.

2848
04:45:42,500 --> 04:45:45,500
Questions by members of the committee?

2849
04:45:45,500 --> 04:45:47,500
Representative Pouss, go ahead.

2850
04:45:47,500 --> 04:45:53,000
Do you have a camp schedule for the over 60 crowd?

2851
04:45:53,000 --> 04:45:55,000
We do.

2852
04:45:55,000 --> 04:45:58,000
We do it all the time.

2853
04:45:58,000 --> 04:46:00,500
Private lessons, it's super fun.

2854
04:46:00,500 --> 04:46:04,500
I have people out there all the time.

2855
04:46:04,500 --> 04:46:06,500
Representative Egan.

2856
04:46:06,500 --> 04:46:08,500
Thank you, Mr.

2857
04:46:08,500 --> 04:46:10,500
Chair.

2858
04:46:10,500 --> 04:46:14,000
Thank you, sir, for taking my question.

2859
04:46:14,000 --> 04:46:31,000
How do you schedule your training of students in the water knowing that you can't schedule when wake surfing boats will come by, especially working with younger children that are new to the water?

2860
04:46:31,000 --> 04:46:33,000
Great question.

2861
04:46:33,000 --> 04:46:37,000
It's not really a problem we've ever had.

2862
04:46:37,000 --> 04:46:44,500
I teach people from sunrise to sunset every day on every kind of water body.

2863
04:46:44,500 --> 04:46:51,000
I've never had to stop a lesson for a certain kind of boat.

2864
04:46:51,000 --> 04:47:00,500
I've had bad boaters come really close, really dangerous, and that's going to happen with any kind of boat.

2865
04:47:00,500 --> 04:47:02,500
Usually not wake boats.

2866
04:47:02,500 --> 04:47:05,000
Wake boats are pretty expensive.

2867
04:47:05,000 --> 04:47:07,500
People want to drive better.

2868
04:47:07,500 --> 04:47:20,000
When I work with new families that buy boats, they're so receptive to my critiques, my input, and how they drive, which is really cool.

2869
04:47:20,000 --> 04:47:30,000
So I've never had to stop a lesson working with kids, adults, for any kind of boat traffic or anything.

2870
04:47:30,000 --> 04:47:32,000
Sure.

2871
04:47:32,000 --> 04:47:34,000
Anyone else?

2872
04:47:34,000 --> 04:47:37,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2873
04:47:37,000 --> 04:47:39,000
Thank you.

2874
04:47:39,000 --> 04:47:52,000
We have now a friend in support My name is Larry Briggs, and I'm lucky enough to have a home on Lake Sunapee in New Hampshire.

2875
04:47:52,000 --> 04:48:10,000
And as a homeowner, I've personally observed the oversized waves that come from wake surfing and the impact that those oversized waves have not only on the shorelines, structures such as docks, boats tied to docks.

2876
04:48:10,000 --> 04:48:14,500
I think you've heard that from others here today.

2877
04:48:14,500 --> 04:48:24,500
And more importantly, on the grandchildren, my grandchildren, I'm lucky to have four, that oftentimes will play in the shallows.

2878
04:48:24,500 --> 04:48:28,000
These waves will knock you right over.

2879
04:48:28,000 --> 04:48:34,500
As a trained engineer, I strive to follow the data and the science.

2880
04:48:34,500 --> 04:48:45,500
I personally have found the University of Minnesota study to be comprehensive and note that it was peer-reviewed by subject matter experts.

2881
04:48:45,500 --> 04:48:53,500
And I urge the committee to support HB 1071 and also to amend the standoff distance.

2882
04:48:53,500 --> 04:48:58,500
I'm all in favor of increasing it to 500 feet.

2883
04:48:58,500 --> 04:49:00,500
There's room for all.

2884
04:49:00,500 --> 04:49:04,000
I'll be happy to answer any questions.

2885
04:49:04,000 --> 04:49:07,500
Any questions by members of the committee?

2886
04:49:07,500 --> 04:49:10,500
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2887
04:49:10,500 --> 04:49:14,500
In opposition to the bill is Tanya Knightley.

2888
04:49:14,500 --> 04:49:20,500
I have lived on Pleasant Lake in Northwood for over 20 years.

2889
04:49:20,500 --> 04:49:25,000
I care deeply about the health of the lake.

2890
04:49:25,000 --> 04:49:30,000
My husband is on the Lake Association Board of Directors.

2891
04:49:30,000 --> 04:49:42,000
My sons grew up on the lake, and I hope someday I'll have grandchildren who will enjoy the sport on the lake as well.

2892
04:49:42,000 --> 04:49:55,000
Wake surfing is one of many activities we enjoy on Pleasant Lake, and it is by far the most engaging for my sons and their friends.

2893
04:49:55,000 --> 04:50:03,000
It is one of the few activities that can pull them away from a computer screen.

2894
04:50:03,000 --> 04:50:12,500
But I did not come here today merely as a mom trying to keep a sport her children love.

2895
04:50:12,500 --> 04:50:23,500
I am also a volunteer adaptive sports instructor with a non-profit group affiliated with the University of New Hampshire called Northeast Passage.

2896
04:50:23,500 --> 04:50:35,500
I teach people with disabilities how to adapt water sports so they can enjoy some of the same pastimes that we take for granted.

2897
04:50:35,500 --> 04:50:42,500
It is more than just having fun on the water for people with disabilities.

2898
04:50:42,500 --> 04:50:52,000
It is also about overcoming challenges and having a sense of accomplishment when their world is filled with obstacles.

2899
04:50:52,000 --> 04:51:06,500
In my 16 years as an instructor, I have had many tearful moms express their gratitude for making it possible for their child to be just like other kids.

2900
04:51:06,500 --> 04:51:16,000
One young lady told me how when she woke up in the hospital after her accident, she was devastated.

2901
04:51:16,000 --> 04:51:23,500
She made a list of all the things she would never be able to do.

2902
04:51:23,500 --> 04:51:34,500
But after seeing what she was capable of doing behind a boat, she planned to cross all those items off her list.

2903
04:51:34,500 --> 04:51:46,500
Most of the boats we use at Northeast Passage are wakeboats, because they are versatile and work well at different speeds and wake sizes.

2904
04:51:46,500 --> 04:51:59,000
The configuration allows family and friends to be part of the experience without getting in the way of safety personnel and equipment on the boat.

2905
04:51:59,000 --> 04:52:08,500
There are people today proposing restrictions to wakeboats that will severely impact our ability to work with disabled athletes.

2906
04:52:08,500 --> 04:52:53,500
Mobility issues can make it hard to transfer people from water to boat so often we start and end close to shore to allow for an assisted swim to shore deep water instruction and starts are harder to perform and less safe for both our instructors and our students the increased distance we would need to maintain from our support vehicles would create issues with communication, increase the time to get to a disabled participant, and increase anxiety for some of our participants, especially those with visual and hearing impairments.

2907
04:52:53,500 --> 04:53:01,500
These restrictions could make it impossible for us to teach some of our most vulnerable participants.

2908
04:53:01,500 --> 04:53:33,500
And for this reason, I you please don't pass this bill because I am on the lake all the time I see the good the bad and the ugly inconsiderate and dangerous operators are not limited to one kind of boat or water sport I've seen a bay liner run at top speed through three clearly marked buoys and end up on the rocks.

2909
04:53:33,500 --> 04:53:48,500
I've watched boats filled with people towing multiple children on one tube, circling round and round, creating huge waves to the detriment of others until heads collide and children fly.

2910
04:53:48,500 --> 04:53:54,000
It would be harmful to single out and punish one group.

2911
04:53:54,000 --> 04:54:03,500
A huge effort was made last year to educate wakeboat operators on best practices when pulling a wake surfer.

2912
04:54:03,500 --> 04:54:09,000
And last summer, I could see the difference on our lake.

2913
04:54:09,000 --> 04:54:20,000
Let's continue down the road of education instead of setting restrictions aimed at destroying the sport and the industry that serves it.

2914
04:54:20,000 --> 04:54:23,500
Thank you very much for your time.

2915
04:54:23,500 --> 04:54:27,000
Any questions by members of the committee?

2916
04:54:27,000 --> 04:54:30,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2917
04:54:30,000 --> 04:54:33,500
In support of the bill, Gary York.

2918
04:54:33,500 --> 04:54:35,500
Gary York.

2919
04:54:35,500 --> 04:54:37,500
Let's see.

2920
04:54:37,500 --> 04:54:39,500
Not here.

2921
04:54:39,500 --> 04:54:45,500
Then, for someone else in support of the bill, Carl Lair, Luger.

2922
04:54:45,500 --> 04:54:49,000
If that's the way you say it.

2923
04:54:49,000 --> 04:54:56,000
Nobody other, no other Carl stood up, so I guess it's you from Holderness.

2924
04:54:56,000 --> 04:54:58,000
Okay.

2925
04:54:58,000 --> 04:55:01,500
Turn on your – there you are.

2926
04:55:01,500 --> 04:55:04,000
Turn on the red light.

2927
04:55:04,000 --> 04:55:11,000
Chair, members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you today.

2928
04:55:11,000 --> 04:55:29,000
I've had the good fortune to have been living on Squam Lake for 15 years now, and we have a place on the lake that is on a cove that is well appreciated by water skiers.

2929
04:55:29,000 --> 04:55:36,000
And I have seen many water skiers come back and forth through the area.

2930
04:55:36,000 --> 04:55:44,500
But in the last couple of years, we've seen a lot of these wave, wake surfing boats.

2931
04:55:44,500 --> 04:55:49,000
And that has changed our market, our waterfront significantly.

2932
04:55:49,000 --> 04:55:55,500
We have a floating dock because we have many, many canoes and kayaks.

2933
04:55:55,500 --> 04:56:05,000
I think at last count there's three canoes, six or seven whitewater kayaks, and about maybe nine flatwater kayaks.

2934
04:56:05,000 --> 04:56:07,000
But no more boats.

2935
04:56:07,000 --> 04:56:09,500
I hate internal combustion engines.

2936
04:56:09,500 --> 04:56:18,000
But having a floating dock makes it much easier to get in and out of those boats.

2937
04:56:18,000 --> 04:56:22,500
But the wake boats have really changed the equation.

2938
04:56:22,500 --> 04:56:40,500
and I am no longer able to walk on my dock when there are wakeboats going around our cove because it bounces the dock around so much that I can no longer stand up straight safely.

2939
04:56:40,500 --> 04:56:43,500
And that's very frustrating for me.

2940
04:56:43,500 --> 04:56:48,000
I thought I'd just make a few other comments.

2941
04:56:48,000 --> 04:56:53,000
What effect might wake boats have on other lake users?

2942
04:56:53,000 --> 04:56:59,500
The most obvious is the generation of large waves, which they do well.

2943
04:56:59,500 --> 04:57:05,500
It's something that these boats were created for in the first place.

2944
04:57:05,500 --> 04:57:12,000
These large waves, however, are created where there are no such natural waves.

2945
04:57:12,000 --> 04:57:21,500
The unexpected waves can surprise or even capsize boaters, especially those in small boats such as kayaks and canoes.

2946
04:57:21,500 --> 04:57:32,000
And as I said, it can even surprise people on floating docks when they find their dock is no longer stable.

2947
04:57:32,000 --> 04:57:44,500
The waves resulting from wake boats passing through an area are unusual because they have a shorter wavelength, which means they may come closer together.

2948
04:57:44,500 --> 04:57:52,000
They are steeper, which means they hit the shore, docks, swimmers, and other things harder.

2949
04:57:52,000 --> 04:57:56,500
They come from different directions from normal wind-created waves.

2950
04:57:56,500 --> 04:58:07,500
As a result, people can be surprised because the waves are not the way a normal wind-driven wave would be to them.

2951
04:58:07,500 --> 04:58:27,000
And I've tried to get into kayaks and canoes sometimes when I misjudged when a wave was going to come to us, and it would come close to capsizing at my dock, which is something I'd rather not do.

2952
04:58:27,000 --> 04:58:34,500
The thing about wake boats is that they cannot legislate away from having big waves.

2953
04:58:34,500 --> 04:58:38,000
That's the whole purpose behind those boats.

2954
04:58:38,000 --> 04:58:52,500
Although I have learned just in the last few days that they can have some influence about where those waves are directed, and I'm delighted to see that happen.

2955
04:58:52,500 --> 04:59:22,000
The last thing that concerns me is that the wake boats will stir up the water and thus the sediment and have the possibility of freeing up nutrients that is currently within the sediments and giving more food for cyanobacteria blooms, which is something I'm sure most everyone in this room knows and would like to avoid very assiduously.

2956
04:59:22,000 --> 04:59:28,500
And so I'm just cautious about anything that would give cyanobacteria a foothold.

2957
04:59:28,500 --> 04:59:34,000
So I would request that you vote for the HB 1071.

2958
04:59:34,000 --> 04:59:42,000
I think it would give all boat users a chance at using the state's lake assets.

2959
04:59:42,000 --> 05:00:07,500
but because in many places canoes and kayaks are simply not feasible to be used when you're in close proximity to a wakeboat, I think that we have to allow some places where wakeboats are not allowed so that the canoes and kayaks have some safe places to play as well.

2960
05:00:07,500 --> 05:00:09,500
Thank you.

2961
05:00:09,500 --> 05:00:13,000
I'll be happy to play as well.

2962
05:00:13,000 --> 05:00:15,000
Thank you.

2963
05:00:15,000 --> 05:00:20,500
I'd be happy to answer any questions that anyone may have.

2964
05:00:20,500 --> 05:00:26,000
Is there any member of the committee who has a question?

2965
05:00:26,000 --> 05:00:29,000
Seeing none, thank you very much.

2966
05:00:29,000 --> 05:00:34,500
Ryan Laliberti, or Laliberti, if you have a name like mine.

2967
05:00:34,500 --> 05:00:36,500
Is there a Ryan?

2968
05:00:36,500 --> 05:00:39,000
And which pronunciation is it?

2969
05:00:39,000 --> 05:00:41,000
Laliberti.

2970
05:00:41,000 --> 05:00:43,000
Laliberti?

2971
05:00:43,000 --> 05:00:45,000
Okay.

2972
05:00:45,000 --> 05:00:48,500
Hi, my name is Ryan La Liberty.

2973
05:00:48,500 --> 05:00:55,500
I'm 11 years old and I learned how to wake surf four years ago.

2974
05:00:55,500 --> 05:01:01,000
I oppose House Bill 1071 and these are the reasons why.

2975
05:01:01,000 --> 05:01:06,500
Wake surfing is my favorite thing to do in the summer.

2976
05:01:06,500 --> 05:01:12,500
My whole family does it and we spend time together wake surfing.

2977
05:01:12,500 --> 05:01:14,500
Thank you.

2978
05:01:14,500 --> 05:01:17,500
and these are the reasons why.

2979
05:01:17,500 --> 05:01:23,000
Wake surfing is my favorite thing to do in the summer.

2980
05:01:23,000 --> 05:01:29,000
My whole family does it, and we spend time together wake surfing.

2981
05:01:29,000 --> 05:01:39,500
And my 7-year-old little brother just learned how to wake surf, and now he wants to do it all the time.

2982
05:01:39,500 --> 05:01:48,000
Before he learned, he spent too much time on his iPad or watching TV and not outside.

2983
05:01:48,000 --> 05:02:03,500
I get to spend time with my family wake surfing on weekends in the summer and we can even go to the lake after school and work for a few hours.

2984
05:02:03,500 --> 05:02:09,500
I went to water monkey camp last year and I loved it.

2985
05:02:09,500 --> 05:02:13,000
I want to go again this summer.

2986
05:02:13,000 --> 05:02:19,500
My little brother says he wants to do it when he's old enough.

2987
05:02:19,500 --> 05:02:24,500
House bill 1071 would limit where I can wake surf.

2988
05:02:24,500 --> 05:02:27,000
Please don't pass this bill.

2989
05:02:27,000 --> 05:02:31,000
Everyone should try wake surfing at least once.

2990
05:02:31,000 --> 05:02:33,000
Thank you.

2991
05:02:33,000 --> 05:02:35,000
Thank you very much.

2992
05:02:35,000 --> 05:02:39,500
Is there any questions from members of the committee?

2993
05:02:39,500 --> 05:02:41,500
Of course.

2994
05:02:41,500 --> 05:02:43,500
Of course.

2995
05:02:43,500 --> 05:02:45,500
Thank you, Mr.

2996
05:02:45,500 --> 05:02:50,000
Chair, and thank you, Ryan, for taking my question.

2997
05:02:50,000 --> 05:02:52,000
Thank you for coming.

2998
05:02:52,000 --> 05:02:55,500
You are the future of New Hampshire.

2999
05:02:55,500 --> 05:03:04,500
What do you think would be a great way to educate people on the proper use of wakeboats?

3000
05:03:04,500 --> 05:03:06,500
I don't really know.

3001
05:03:06,500 --> 05:03:18,000
What have you learned about the proper use of wakeboats that you could share with the committee so we know how you're learning?

3002
05:03:18,000 --> 05:03:25,000
I have a lot of family members that have taught me how to wakesurf.

3003
05:03:25,000 --> 05:03:33,000
And we go, we visit a lot of places where they teach us how to wakesurf.

3004
05:03:33,000 --> 05:03:40,000
And also on the boat, you learn about the boat and the proper techniques.

3005
05:03:40,000 --> 05:03:42,000
Thank you, Mr.

3006
05:03:42,000 --> 05:03:44,000
Chair.

3007
05:03:44,000 --> 05:03:59,500
Again, I really appreciate you and your wife bringing your child here to testify, and I can't thank you guys enough for understanding the process and getting them involved in it.

3008
05:03:59,500 --> 05:04:12,000
It's really, like Representative Maybill said, you are the future of our state, and we appreciate you being here, and you, the lady, as well.

3009
05:04:12,000 --> 05:04:14,000
Thank you.

3010
05:04:14,000 --> 05:04:16,000
Anyone else?

3011
05:04:16,000 --> 05:04:18,000
Thank you very much.

3012
05:04:18,000 --> 05:04:21,500
Thank you for appearing before the committee.

3013
05:04:21,500 --> 05:04:25,000
Now you've got to clean that off.

3014
05:04:25,000 --> 05:04:27,000
Brett Nigro.

3015
05:04:27,000 --> 05:04:29,000
Thank you.

3016
05:04:29,000 --> 05:04:31,500
My name is Brett Nigro.

3017
05:04:31,500 --> 05:04:38,000
I live year-round on Coppets Pond in Wyndham, New Hampshire, in Rockingham County.

3018
05:04:38,000 --> 05:04:41,000
Thank you for your time today.

3019
05:04:41,000 --> 05:04:55,000
There's been a lot of testimony, so most of my script is out the window, and I'm just going to give you the cliff notes for everyone's benefit.

3020
05:04:55,000 --> 05:05:08,000
Over the past 12 years, I've served as a board of directors member on my lake association, and two of which I served as our president.

3021
05:05:08,000 --> 05:05:19,500
I am here today speaking for myself, but I do bring many of you from residents on my lake to the table today.

3022
05:05:19,500 --> 05:05:24,500
I guess I represent the little guys, the little lakes.

3023
05:05:24,500 --> 05:05:39,000
We are 345 acres in a figure eight configuration, long and narrow, if you will, with a no-wake zone in the middle and two small ponds on either side.

3024
05:05:39,000 --> 05:05:51,000
As a result, this bill, if passed as constituted, would be detrimental to the wake surfing sport on Cobbett's Pond, which is quite robust.

3025
05:05:51,000 --> 05:06:11,000
There are more than 20 wake surf boats on our lake today, all of which owned by family members, and it is the quintessential family sport, as many here have talked about today, so I won't get into those details.

3026
05:06:11,000 --> 05:06:50,000
What I would like to say is that the sport is relatively young, and with anything new, you're going to have your hiccups and speed bumps, and there's a learning curve associated with it, and I think the Wake Responsibility Program is a great step forward in the education of people on how to more responsibly use these powerful boats for the betterment of everyone and the enjoyment of the users, but also in respect for our neighbors.

3027
05:06:50,000 --> 05:07:05,500
And the common theme here that I've heard is usually in support of people that reside in these large bodies of water, where it seems maybe it's a no-brainer to extend.

3028
05:07:05,500 --> 05:07:07,500
What's 100 feet?

3029
05:07:07,500 --> 05:07:11,500
Well, in a lake like mine, it's detrimental.

3030
05:07:11,500 --> 05:07:13,500
It's punitive.

3031
05:07:13,500 --> 05:07:18,500
It pretty much will suffocate the ability to do so.

3032
05:07:18,500 --> 05:07:33,000
And frankly, I think it's premature for a bill at this time to be passed based on a University of Minnesota study, which frankly is inconclusive in my mind.

3033
05:07:33,000 --> 05:07:42,500
If you read the details, it's four boats, two surf boats, a recreational boat, and a competition ski boat.

3034
05:07:42,500 --> 05:08:00,000
A competition ski boat is designed specifically to skim across the top of the water and make no wave behind it whatsoever so that skiers at high speed can ski without any sort of obstruction.

3035
05:08:00,000 --> 05:08:17,500
When you amortize the data in a way that they did, it fits a certain narrative, and certain narrative is the reason that this bill is put in 40 today with an arbitrary 250 feet.

3036
05:08:17,500 --> 05:08:25,000
This at its core is an education issue, not a legislation issue in my opinion.

3037
05:08:25,000 --> 05:09:19,500
On our lake, we consistently preach situational awareness courtesy being alert as a driver understanding the cause of your actions when voting being short just being a good neighbor and I think that we as New Hampshire residents are more than capable of handling this issue with better education and if the state wants to get involved my suggestion is why don't we have a little more attention thrown towards the New Hampshire boater licensing process in that educational scenario in which we gloss over the good boating practices and focus way too much on ocean-going vessels for which a very small percentage of New Hampshire boats are registered.

3038
05:09:19,500 --> 05:09:24,500
The majority of New Hampshire boats are registered on lakes.

3039
05:09:24,500 --> 05:09:28,500
So why isn't there more focus on lakes?

3040
05:09:28,500 --> 05:10:09,000
Now that this sport has exploded and created a tremendous amount of demand to get into the sport, which frankly has also created real estate demand on lakefronts, which drove up property prices, which drove up tax income, revenue, and things along those lines, it's an important issue, and I know it's got the ear of some people, or the ire, I should say, of some people that kind of view it as an easy thing to point at as problems.

3041
05:10:09,000 --> 05:10:16,000
But in my opinion, if we segregate this sport at this point, it's premature.

3042
05:10:16,000 --> 05:10:29,500
There's not enough data to support it, and I think the community as a whole has rallied behind wanting to make it a safer and better place.

3043
05:10:29,500 --> 05:10:33,000
The 150-foot setback is just a guide.

3044
05:10:33,000 --> 05:10:45,500
Most folks, as has been testified here today, they seek the largest area of water possible and try to do so in a respectful way.

3045
05:10:45,500 --> 05:10:49,500
These boats aren't typically operated by young kids.

3046
05:10:49,500 --> 05:10:52,000
It's typically fathers like myself.

3047
05:10:52,000 --> 05:10:59,000
I'm super jealous of the families that brought their daughters with them here today.

3048
05:10:59,000 --> 05:11:25,000
My 14-year-old Bella was going to join me, an avid wake surfer, but she's currently at her middle school basketball playoff game, for which I'm missing to be here today, because I do feel it's that important for you guys to hear the perspective of a small lake property owner like myself.

3049
05:11:25,000 --> 05:11:38,000
In terms of education, if we could do something greater than what we're doing in the Wake Responsibility Program, I think we will be doing that.

3050
05:11:38,000 --> 05:11:52,500
Talk to folks with better knowledge of what's in store for that program and work on the boater education before people even get behind the wheel of the boat.

3051
05:11:52,500 --> 05:12:02,000
I think that's going to go a long way versus a premature segregation of the activity as a whole.

3052
05:12:02,000 --> 05:12:13,500
30 calls to Marine Patrol hardly warrants, in my opinion, a call to action to put legislation pieces in place at this time.

3053
05:12:13,500 --> 05:12:23,500
So I do appreciate you guys letting me speak here today, and I'm happy to answer any and all questions.

3054
05:12:23,500 --> 05:12:28,000
Actually, one last thing I would like to mention.

3055
05:12:28,000 --> 05:12:45,500
Two years back, we did host Senator Regina Birdsell on our wakeboats and gave her a thorough demonstration of how they operate and the waves themselves and spent a lot of time answering her questions.

3056
05:12:45,500 --> 05:13:10,000
And I'd open that up to anyone here on the committee or anyone on the opposition side as well if they'd like a firsthand view of how wakeboats work, how the actual sport works, how we can control waves, and best practices that we employ as an emerging sport.

3057
05:13:10,000 --> 05:13:14,500
So with that, I'm happy to answer any questions.

3058
05:13:14,500 --> 05:13:18,000
Any questions from members of the committee?

3059
05:13:18,000 --> 05:13:20,000
Representative Post.

3060
05:13:20,000 --> 05:13:22,000
Thank you, Mr.

3061
05:13:22,000 --> 05:13:35,500
Chair, and thank you for your unique perspective on licensing being a way to reach out to people to better educate them on their boating in lakes.

3062
05:13:35,500 --> 05:13:48,000
Since you are on a small lake with a very large population of wake boats, have you seen a lot of damage on your shoreline?

3063
05:13:48,000 --> 05:13:52,500
And if so, what type of damage is it?

3064
05:13:52,500 --> 05:14:00,000
So, you know, sitting on our lake committee, I'm privy to a lot of information.

3065
05:14:00,000 --> 05:14:03,000
We work hand-in-hand with the DES.

3066
05:14:03,000 --> 05:14:15,500
We work tirelessly with developers in our community, making sure that, you know, all the local legislation is upheld in terms of the development process.

3067
05:14:15,500 --> 05:14:22,500
With the 93 expansion, we experienced a ton of issues within our lake environment.

3068
05:14:22,500 --> 05:14:28,000
So I'm fairly well versed on the goings-on in that capacity.

3069
05:14:28,000 --> 05:14:38,500
And I can tell you that the waves generated from a specific type of activity is the least of our problems.

3070
05:14:38,500 --> 05:14:44,000
The freeze-thaw, as another gentleman mentioned, is a far bigger issue.

3071
05:14:44,000 --> 05:15:08,500
Just the general waves that are generated during a winter storm or a fall storm or any storm, winter, summer, whatever the season may be, that smashes repeatedly for three, four hours into a shoreline absolutely has bigger impacts than occasional rollers that come in from a wake circle.

3072
05:15:08,500 --> 05:15:12,500
I'm not saying it doesn't have an impact.

3073
05:15:12,500 --> 05:15:16,000
I'm sure it does in some capacity.

3074
05:15:16,000 --> 05:15:19,500
To what degree, I don't really know.

3075
05:15:19,500 --> 05:15:25,500
But I can tell you that we're all painfully aware of it.

3076
05:15:25,500 --> 05:15:34,000
We love what we do, but not at the detriment of our neighbors and our own property.

3077
05:15:34,000 --> 05:15:41,000
We're highly invested in the areas that we live, and everyone is very responsible.

3078
05:15:41,000 --> 05:15:55,000
Those that aren't, we do go out there and help self-police and say, hey, you were out of line, you drove improperly or whatever the case may be.

3079
05:15:55,000 --> 05:15:58,000
People are incredibly respectful of criticism.

3080
05:15:58,000 --> 05:16:02,500
You've got to remember, this is people's leisure time.

3081
05:16:02,500 --> 05:16:05,500
They're not out there for work.

3082
05:16:05,500 --> 05:16:09,000
They're out there to blow off steam.

3083
05:16:09,000 --> 05:16:16,000
We're all under a lot of stress and they're out there with their families.

3084
05:16:16,000 --> 05:16:27,500
No one's intentionally trying to be a bad driver, but driving up here in 93, I saw a bunch of bad drivers too.

3085
05:16:27,500 --> 05:16:30,000
Speed limit's 65 for everyone.

3086
05:16:30,000 --> 05:16:48,000
So I just think to take our little sport that's growing and bring a lot of joy to families and people in general and put it in a box at this early stage is not right.

3087
05:16:48,000 --> 05:16:50,000
A follow-up?

3088
05:16:50,000 --> 05:16:52,000
For a follow-up.

3089
05:16:52,000 --> 05:16:54,000
Thank you.

3090
05:16:54,000 --> 05:17:03,000
You're telling me that you haven't seen any noticeable deterioration of the shoreline since the increase in wakeboats?

3091
05:17:03,000 --> 05:17:06,000
Nothing I could measure for you.

3092
05:17:06,000 --> 05:17:12,500
I certainly have heard different people have spoken here today that make accusations.

3093
05:17:12,500 --> 05:17:30,500
But in my direct property, I can absolutely say with certainty that, yes, waves have come in, but I'm not complaining or thinking that that's the reason that whatever erosion we have is the primary cause.

3094
05:17:30,500 --> 05:17:39,500
Mother Nature by far has been more impactful to my property than any wave generated from a boat.

3095
05:17:39,500 --> 05:17:50,000
And I will say that some of the most egregious waves and disruptances on our lake aren't even from wake boats.

3096
05:17:50,000 --> 05:17:55,000
They're from tubers and people in other types of boats.

3097
05:17:55,000 --> 05:18:07,000
There's a gentleman with a hybrid boat that's a pontoon on top and has a traditional V-hole on the bottom and a powerful motor.

3098
05:18:07,000 --> 05:18:10,000
It's kind of a hybrid boat.

3099
05:18:10,000 --> 05:18:33,500
It's incredibly heavy, and it throws a tremendous amount of water at the shoreline, and he zips all over the place with a 45-foot line with his kids whipping back and forth, and no one's calling that type of boat out for a specific subset of rules.

3100
05:18:33,500 --> 05:18:48,500
So I really do think, taking a macro look at this, that if we can teach people to be good responsible boat drivers, all this other stuff is not necessary.

3101
05:18:48,500 --> 05:19:00,500
Let New Hampshire people do what New Hampshire people have always done and that's govern thyselves without the need for legislative impairment or impact.

3102
05:19:00,500 --> 05:19:04,500
Any other questions by members of the committee?

3103
05:19:04,500 --> 05:19:08,000
Well, seeing none, thank you very much.

3104
05:19:08,000 --> 05:19:13,500
This is, that was the last pink card before we go.

3105
05:19:13,500 --> 05:19:16,500
I'd like to thank the audience.

3106
05:19:16,500 --> 05:19:19,500
I'd like to thank everyone here.

3107
05:19:19,500 --> 05:19:22,500
It was a very good hearing.

3108
05:19:22,500 --> 05:19:29,000
And I especially would like to thank the parents who brought their children.

3109
05:19:29,000 --> 05:19:33,500
This is democracy, and you're showing it to them.

3110
05:19:33,500 --> 05:19:39,500
And by the way, we do have a tour of this place.

3111
05:19:39,500 --> 05:19:43,000
please take a look of this place.

3112
05:19:43,000 --> 05:19:45,000
Please take them.

3113

05:19:51,500 --> 05:19:55,000
And you ought to take the tour.

And let your representative, state representative, know.

05:19:58,500 --> 05:20:16,000
And probably that person will come and give you the tour themselves because we do have a thing when they bring the fourth graders in, and that's the best thing that any rep can do.
