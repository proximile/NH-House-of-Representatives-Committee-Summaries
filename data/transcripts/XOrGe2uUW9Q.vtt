00:11:32.870 --> 00:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
eight bills which are bills due out on
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
March 20th But before we get into I'd
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
like to welcome Representative Lee and
 
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:40.240 align:start position:0%
Representative Matson who are subbing in
 
00:11:42.949 --> 00:11:42.959 align:start position:0%
for folks that are unable to be here uh
 
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
today I don't believe you have any subs
 
00:11:48.310 --> 00:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
on your side Do you represent non Yeah
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yep So welcome to
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
education funding Um we had these eight
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
bills today and I just met and
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
Representative Spilzer and I ran met
 
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
with Representative Luno and
 
00:12:04.389 --> 00:12:04.399 align:start position:0%
Representative Damon Surprisingly I
 
00:12:05.829 --> 00:12:05.839 align:start position:0%
think we're on the same page in all
 
00:12:09.750 --> 00:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
these bills except one except one And
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
you can probably guess which one that is
 
00:12:15.350 --> 00:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
But so with that we're hoping to try to
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
expedite things by keeping all the
 
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
discussion you know minimizing it today
 
00:12:23.350 --> 00:12:23.360 align:start position:0%
maybe one person from each side and and
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh and uh moving on through these bills
 
00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
What I am going to do first though I'm
 
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
going to jump on our list of bills here
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
and not go in numerical order but take
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
HB443 seeing we do have uh Steve uh
 
00:12:39.030 --> 00:12:39.040 align:start position:0%
Steve Applebee here from the Department
 
00:12:41.629 --> 00:12:41.639 align:start position:0%
of Education and he met with some folks
 
00:12:45.190 --> 00:12:45.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday regarding that bill and I've
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
asked that he come here today and
 
00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
explain to us what he is what kind of
 
00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:51.680 align:start position:0%
message he's got from that group and
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
perhaps why this bill is seen as as as
 
00:12:59.870 --> 00:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
needed So represent Applebee
 
00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.509 --> 00:13:09.519 align:start position:0%
gradu and and I think fourth or fifth
 
00:13:12.310 --> 00:13:12.320 align:start position:0%
generation UNH grad So my grandfather's
 
00:13:15.670 --> 00:13:15.680 align:start position:0%
pictures in the fieldhouse uh 1926
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
varsity football team
 
00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
and I want to add on to that So when he
 
00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:21.680 align:start position:0%
was looking for colleges for his
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
daughter where did he take her Up to
 
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:27.430 align:start position:0%
daughter where did he take her Up to
Orno

00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:29.269 --> 00:13:29.279 align:start position:0%
Yeah thank you Representative Vlad That
 
00:13:31.269 --> 00:13:31.279 align:start position:0%
is absolutely true
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh took two of my children to Orino to
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
tour and my wife and I both marveled
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
because Orino looked like college that
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
we remembered when we both went to UNH
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
many years ago Um we have a very simple
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
rule in our house We will not send our
 
00:13:47.590 --> 00:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
kids to a college that has dorms nicer
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
than our house It's it's a very simple
 
00:13:54.150 --> 00:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
rule So um good thought Yeah Thank you
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
Um for the record Steve Applebee
 
00:13:57.990 --> 00:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
director Department of Education Uh
 
00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:01.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for having me this morning
 
00:14:04.629 --> 00:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
Um so yesterday as it happened there was
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
a regularly scheduled meeting of the
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
higher education commission and we
 
00:14:10.310 --> 00:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
discussed this bill at the commission
 
00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
meeting as well as some of the the
 
00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:15.800 align:start position:0%
questions that I received um during the
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
hearing some number of weeks back and um
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
the commission which includes the
 
00:14:24.389 --> 00:14:24.399 align:start position:0%
chancellors of our public systems a
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
number of college presidents and several
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
lay members um all believe that the that
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
the current bill um as is they support
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
it with this language change to fix this
 
00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
little tweak that that stray and that's
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
in the in the statute Uh with regard to
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
whether or not the commission should
 
00:14:44.150 --> 00:14:44.160 align:start position:0%
continue uh there was a concern raised
 
00:14:46.150 --> 00:14:46.160 align:start position:0%
by we we employ a consultant to the
 
00:14:48.310 --> 00:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
higher education commission uh Dr Dick
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
Gustoson Some of you may know Dick He
 
00:14:52.629 --> 00:14:52.639 align:start position:0%
was chancellor of our two-year system He
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
held my position a number of years ago
 
00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:56.320 align:start position:0%
He was president of Southern New
 
00:14:59.509 --> 00:14:59.519 align:start position:0%
Hampshire University many years ago Um
 
00:15:01.670 --> 00:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
and Dr Gustoson reminded the commission
 
00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
that we should uh with regard to their
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
existence we should check federal law
 
00:15:08.069 --> 00:15:08.079 align:start position:0%
because there was a requirement at one
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
time in the federal higher ed act that
 
00:15:13.110 --> 00:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
states have these commissions So we'd
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
like to do some research on that Um I
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
know uh and and the commission was not
 
00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
opposed to having a discussion You know
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
they were not opposed to maybe they
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
don't need to exist anymore So uh we're
 
00:15:26.069 --> 00:15:26.079 align:start position:0%
just concerned that there may be a
 
00:15:27.750 --> 00:15:27.760 align:start position:0%
federal requirement and we don't want to
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
accidentally trip over that So um that
 
00:15:35.949 --> 00:15:35.959 align:start position:0%
was the result of yesterday's meeting
 
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:39.600 align:start position:0%
Um that's my input So Representative if
 
00:15:42.790 --> 00:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
you have a a look
 
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:45.160 align:start position:0%
Okay Are there any questions for
 
00:15:48.470 --> 00:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
represent represent Steve Applebee Yes
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
Since you're calling me out so what is
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
your recommendation So the bill as is
 
00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then we could take up maybe over the
 
00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
summer um whether or not the commission
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
should even exist
 
00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:02.560 align:start position:0%
Okay I think the bill as is doesn't make
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
sense either I don't think it's I don't
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
think it solves the problem you're
 
00:16:06.829 --> 00:16:06.839 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
solve This leaves somebody in if I
 
00:16:10.949 --> 00:16:10.959 align:start position:0%
understand correctly if I read the way I
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
read it in English this somebody two
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
years into their term stops coming and
 
00:16:17.670 --> 00:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
you leave them on there for the last
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.230 --> 00:16:24.240 align:start position:0%
That that is an accurate understanding
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
Th this this was the this was the
 
00:16:27.670 --> 00:16:27.680 align:start position:0%
language that was given to me by the
 
00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:30.000 align:start position:0%
attorney at the time As I as I mentioned
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that attorney is at the
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
governor's office any longer but
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
um the the problem we're trying to solve
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
for was a a college president who no
 
00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:42.079 align:start position:0%
longer represents their college They
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
have left that the employment of that
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
college but they have not formally
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
resigned from the commission and their
 
00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:51.279 align:start position:0%
term ends Hang on The question I'm not
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
talking about the term ending So they're
 
00:16:54.629 --> 00:16:54.639 align:start position:0%
in the middle of their term and they
 
00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:55.389 align:start position:0%
in the middle of their term and they
stop

00:16:55.389 --> 00:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
stop
 
00:16:58.629 --> 00:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
coming They still cannot be removed If
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
I'm if I'm understanding correctly the
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
way this is work worded they will remain
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
on there until their term ends at which
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
point they will not be extended Is that
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
an accurate understanding of what the
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
change does and doesn't do Is that your
 
00:17:10.079 --> 00:17:11.470 align:start position:0%
change does and doesn't do Is that your
issue

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:11.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
I I I I believe so I Okay Thank you
 
00:17:19.270 --> 00:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
Okay Any further discussion Represent
 
00:17:22.069 --> 00:17:22.079 align:start position:0%
Luno Thanks very much Mr Chair And I'm
 
00:17:23.829 --> 00:17:23.839 align:start position:0%
sorry to miss the uh the first part of
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
your uh your statement Um Dr Applebee
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
but but um who appoints the members of
 
00:17:31.110 --> 00:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
the commission The executive council The
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
executive counsel So all right Thank you
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
very much Representative Billsbury Yeah
 
00:17:38.070 --> 00:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
I I do think that the language of the
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
bill as written solves the holdover
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
problem but it does not address the
 
00:17:45.190 --> 00:17:45.200 align:start position:0%
inactive member problem So if we were to
 
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
retain and work on it that would also
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
allow for you to go through the process
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
you were talking about this summer
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
Certainly would Thank you
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
Further disc represent fellows Yes I'm
 
00:17:57.950 --> 00:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering if you can tell us like
 
00:18:01.909 --> 00:18:01.919 align:start position:0%
who are who are the people who are the
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
categories that are appointed to this
 
00:18:06.789 --> 00:18:06.799 align:start position:0%
commission Well yes Uh thank you for the
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
question Yes So um per statute we have a
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
number of statutory appointments So both
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
of our chancellors several of our public
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
college presidents for example all of

Represent Luno The motion is to ITL uh
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
HB1 137 Representative Magguire do you
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
have any any further discussion Uh just
 
00:21:18.230 --> 00:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
that this bill goes kind of the other
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
way of a bill that we passed and is on
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
the calendar for tomorrow Is it 7:39
 
00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
7:30 Yeah That
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so which had a strong recommendation
 
00:21:32.070 --> 00:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
from this committee So this is kind of
 
00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
the opposite So therefore it repres
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
nothing more to add Any further
 
00:21:39.110 --> 00:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst the committee members
 
00:21:41.190 --> 00:21:41.200 align:start position:0%
Represent Fellows Um yes I'm just going
 
00:21:44.950 --> 00:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
to say that that I will vote against
 
00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:48.320 align:start position:0%
ITLing this bill because I think the
 
00:21:52.149 --> 00:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
state using a property tax to reduce its
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
obligation to fund um public schools is
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
a slippery slope And if we do it at all
 
00:22:02.870 --> 00:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
then if if we use the statewide property
 
00:22:05.590 --> 00:22:05.600 align:start position:0%
tax at all then it opens the door to
 
00:22:08.470 --> 00:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
making the statewide property tax higher
 
00:22:11.190 --> 00:22:11.200 align:start position:0%
and that just um can shift more money
 
00:22:14.310 --> 00:22:14.320 align:start position:0%
onto the property taxpayers
 
00:22:17.590 --> 00:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
Further discussion Not seeing any Madame
 
00:22:19.830 --> 00:22:19.840 align:start position:0%

Yes I would like to make a motion of ITL
 
00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
We'll second that Okay Moved by
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
Representative L seconded by
 
00:24:34.390 --> 00:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
Representative Luno Would you like to
 
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
speak to the motion Yes Very briefly um
 
00:24:39.830 --> 00:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
in the past year we had a similar bill
 
00:24:41.430 --> 00:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
come before the committee and when we
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
did the research and looked into it
 
00:24:46.070 --> 00:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
federal law does provide that monies
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
that are coming through IDA special
 
00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
education monies may be used to assist
 
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
those students which are remedial and to
 
00:24:55.510 --> 00:24:55.520 align:start position:0%
prevent them from having to go the route
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
of the IEP process They may also be used
 
00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
for after-school activities which
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
involve those students with uh uh this
 
00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
type of uh handicapping condition So the
 
00:25:09.909 --> 00:25:09.919 align:start position:0%
federal law does provide limits in and
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
in in and how these funds shall be used
 
00:25:17.630 --> 00:25:17.640 align:start position:0%
Uh so this bill is contrary to that
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
federala law or act Thank you Thank you
 
00:25:23.350 --> 00:25:23.360 align:start position:0%

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
completely agree with with that But also
 
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know how a state particularly how
 
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire calculates its cost of
 
00:25:34.710 --> 00:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
inadequate education you know applies to
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
for a school district to educate all of
 
00:25:40.310 --> 00:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
its um uh students And um and obviously
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
these differentiated aid factors uh are
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
used in uh in New Hampshire as they are
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
in other states to um to um um uh to
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
make that determination So thank you
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%

schools who have children with
 
00:26:26.430 --> 00:26:26.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities which I I translated to
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
mean that they are coded as special ed
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and that school is unable to give them
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
any special ed services but it sounds
 
00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:42.240 align:start position:0%
like there's a possibility that they are
 
00:26:46.029 --> 00:26:46.039 align:start position:0%
getting the money the differentiate
 
00:26:50.390 --> 00:26:50.400 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for those students So
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
that just I just want to identify that
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
as um something related to this issue
 
00:26:59.430 --> 00:26:59.440 align:start position:0%
that we should think about
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
Representative Lad Yeah I'd like to tag
 
00:27:03.669 --> 00:27:03.679 align:start position:0%
in what Representative Luno has
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
indicated regarding the different
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid This money is not
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
targeted money on the left hand side of
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
the formula We must remember that
 
00:27:14.950 --> 00:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's ELLL differentiated aid for
 
00:27:17.269 --> 00:27:17.279 align:start position:0%
special education or free and reduced
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
monies those monies go down due to the
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
Claremont decisions and all for the
 
00:27:27.269 --> 00:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
benefit of all students in in in that
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
school district Secondly in talking
 
00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
about the EFA program they do not
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
receive this portion of differentiated
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
aid They do not receive funding for
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
special education IEP
 
00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
in the differentiated They do I thought
 
00:27:45.669 --> 00:27:45.679 align:start position:0%
they did not
 
00:27:47.350 --> 00:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
They do
 
00:27:50.390 --> 00:27:50.400 align:start position:0%
They receive differentiated aid Yes
 
00:27:53.510 --> 00:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
Representative Ames
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
Thank you
 
00:27:58.909 --> 00:27:58.919 align:start position:0%
the um allocation
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
to an EFA account for a student who goes
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
to a private school may or may not
 
00:28:08.789 --> 00:28:08.799 align:start position:0%
include differentiated aid just as in
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
the public school side based on uh elig
 
00:28:16.070 --> 00:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
eligibility or identifying factors that
 
00:28:18.310 --> 00:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh identify that person as eligible for
 
00:28:22.549 --> 00:28:22.559 align:start position:0%
free or reduced or special ed aid that
 
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
has to be renewed each year In the
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
private setting it's a different process
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
It's not an IEP determination because
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
there's no such process as I understand
 
00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
it It's a determination by a one in a
 
00:28:40.750 --> 00:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
category maybe of three different
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh professionals or maybe even lay
 
00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
people who have status um to make
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
determinations about uh the disability
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
of an individual is not so much as a
 
00:28:57.909 --> 00:28:57.919 align:start position:0%
special ed determination So with that
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
with that additional
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
um characteristic applied to that
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
student then that triggers additional
 
00:29:09.269 --> 00:29:09.279 align:start position:0%
money for the school and again it's not
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
targeted money just as has been said
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding of it you see
 
00:29:15.830 --> 00:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
and I was looking at the charter schools
 
00:29:17.510 --> 00:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
the way the money remains for the
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
sending district it doesn't go to the
 
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
charter school and services are provided
 
00:29:24.389 --> 00:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
those students at the charter school via
 
00:29:27.029 --> 00:29:27.039 align:start position:0%
that methodology as one of the ways to
 
00:29:29.909 --> 00:29:29.919 align:start position:0%
deliver the services I was also under
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
the impression that the same was
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
occurring on this I may be wrong I I'd
 
00:29:35.549 --> 00:29:35.559 align:start position:0%
have to look at that and I appreciate
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
Representative Damon did you want to say
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
anything Yes thank you I just wanted to
 
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.190 align:start position:0%
anything Yes thank you I just wanted to
note

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
note
 
00:29:49.510 --> 00:29:49.520 align:start position:0%
that per federal law the preferred
 
00:29:51.549 --> 00:29:51.559 align:start position:0%
approach to special education is
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
inclusion And so in addition to the
 
00:29:56.710 --> 00:29:56.720 align:start position:0%
reality that the differentiated aid is
 
00:29:59.350 --> 00:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
to fund the whole district for all the
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
kids or to help with that funding it
 
00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
simply isn't practical to separate out
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
exactly what might be a special ed cost
 
00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:10.640 align:start position:0%
or not It it just doesn't work to do
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
that And we heard very clearly from DOE
 
00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
that their statute and practices on this
 
00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
are already very clear I think this bill
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
is simply unnecessary
 
00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:22.960 align:start position:0%
Any further comment I would just add
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a useful analogy that when we
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
allocate a portion of the differentiated
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
aid based on free and reduced we're not
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
asking the money to be used to buy meals
 
00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:36.320 align:start position:0%
These are ways of determining what kind
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
of a burden a particular district
 
00:30:37.919 --> 00:30:39.789 align:start position:0%
of a burden a particular district
suffers

00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
suffers
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
under Okay If there are no further
 
00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:48.360 align:start position:0%
comments then we can move to the uh uh
 
00:30:52.830 --> 00:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
vote uh which is ITL motion on
 
00:30:57.909 --> 00:30:57.919 align:start position:0%
HB237 Madam clerk chairman Spilsbury yes
 
00:30:59.590 --> 00:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
Representative Magguire yes
 
00:31:02.630 --> 00:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
Representative Earth yes Representative
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
Lee yes Representative Kolk yes
 
00:31:08.630 --> 00:31:08.640 align:start position:0%
Representative Matson yes Representative
 
00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
Brown yes Representative Mahagan
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
yes Representative Peoples yes
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
Representative Luno yes Representative
 
00:31:23.149 --> 00:31:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
Yeah I mean it's okay
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
It's not going to change the outcome of
 
00:31:33.510 --> 00:31:33.520 align:start position:0%
the vote but I don't think without
 
00:31:35.110 --> 00:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
objection can we allow Representative
 
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
Burton to vote The motion was made He
 
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
was not in his chair medical treatment
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
Okay Then then he then he's cannot vote
 
00:31:46.310 --> 00:31:46.320 align:start position:0%
on this You're going to have to No
 
00:31:48.549 --> 00:31:48.559 align:start position:0%
objection I just I'm just getting the
 
00:31:51.909 --> 00:31:51.919 align:start position:0%
the school nurse That's that's okay But
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
if you weren't here when the motion was
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
We we've had we've had that before I I
 
00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:03.120 align:start position:0%
believe the motion was made 10 15
 
00:32:05.110 --> 00:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
minutes ago I have no objections and not
 
00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.310 align:start position:0%
minutes ago I have no objections and not
counting

00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
We we were both out getting medical
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
attention for Representative Burton so I
 
00:32:15.909 --> 00:32:15.919 align:start position:0%
won't be voting either Okay fair All
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
right Fair enough I don't think it makes
 
00:32:20.230 --> 00:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
much difference on this So we we we've
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
had votes over overturned
 
00:32:25.830 --> 00:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
Yes we have Okay So I I I think there's
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
a consensus and I don't see any
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
objection to allowing Representative
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
Burton and Bricky to sit out Um
 
00:32:34.789 --> 00:32:34.799 align:start position:0%

00:33:13.909 --> 00:33:13.919 align:start position:0%
well that's what the sheet has that's
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
marked but it's actually just not a vote
 
00:33:18.870 --> 00:33:18.880 align:start position:0%
It's not a no So the vote count is 16 to
 
00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.389 align:start position:0%
It's not a no So the vote count is 16 to
zero

00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
zero
 
00:33:23.590 --> 00:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
16 to zero Without objection Uh we can
 
00:33:26.230 --> 00:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
place that on consent Yes Okay Agreed on
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
consent Thank you very much Uh back to

354 354 is relative to alternative
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
certification pathways for career and
 
00:33:40.470 --> 00:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
technical education instructors And I'd
 
00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
like to ask Representative uh Peoples
 
00:33:49.909 --> 00:33:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:52.509 --> 00:33:52.519 align:start position:0%
Chair I would like to make a motion to
 
00:33:56.310 --> 00:33:56.320 align:start position:0%
OTP this bill Is there a second Second
 
00:33:57.990 --> 00:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
We have a motion made by represent
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
Peoples and second by represent Damon
 
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
The motion is OTP on HB 354 Represent
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
Peoples do you care to speak to your
 
00:34:10.230 --> 00:34:10.240 align:start position:0%
motion Yes Um I believe that this will
 
00:34:13.430 --> 00:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
give an opportunity for getting
 
00:34:15.510 --> 00:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
qualified people to teach trades into
 
00:34:18.869 --> 00:34:18.879 align:start position:0%
the classroom and a pathway to getting
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
getting them certified I think this is
 
00:34:23.669 --> 00:34:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh something that we really need to
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
address in the state and it would help
 
00:34:27.909 --> 00:34:27.919 align:start position:0%
us get the people we need in front of
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
the children to teach them Thank you

centers perhaps with retired folks who
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%

calendar Good Thank you Uh we're going
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
down to the next bill This is HB 491 We
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
jumped over 443 Remember we did that
 
00:35:55.109 --> 00:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
first 491 is establishing a committee to
 
00:35:56.710 --> 00:35:56.720 align:start position:0%
study alternative funding methods for
 
00:35:58.390 --> 00:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
public education and how to reduce the
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
reliance on local real estate property
 
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:03.280 align:start position:0%
taxes I look to represent Spielsbury for
 
00:36:05.829 --> 00:36:05.839 align:start position:0%
a motion Thank you Mr Chair I move
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
retain on HP491 We'll second that So we
 
00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:12.720 align:start position:0%
have a motion made on 491 to retain made
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
by represent Spillsbury and second by
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
represent Luno Representative Spilspbury
 
00:36:18.870 --> 00:36:18.880 align:start position:0%
do you want to speak to your motion Yes
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Uh the purpose of
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
this bill is to go beyond the
 
00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:24.400 align:start position:0%
discussions we've had so far as a
 
00:36:25.990 --> 00:36:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee in the last couple of months
 
00:36:27.910 --> 00:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
We've been focusing really on how the
 
00:36:30.109 --> 00:36:30.119 align:start position:0%
state will allocate funds to support
 
00:36:32.710 --> 00:36:32.720 align:start position:0%
districts And this gets to the question
 
00:36:35.190 --> 00:36:35.200 align:start position:0%
of where the funds come from It's an
 
00:36:37.750 --> 00:36:37.760 align:start position:0%
important discussion but uh I think we
 
00:36:39.510 --> 00:36:39.520 align:start position:0%
have a good understanding that this
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
committee can form a subcommittee to
 
00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:44.640 align:start position:0%
delve into this over the balance of this
 
00:36:46.950 --> 00:36:46.960 align:start position:0%
year And if we retain it then we can
 
00:36:48.710 --> 00:36:48.720 align:start position:0%
decide in October whether something like
 
00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:52.240 align:start position:0%
this would be useful in 26
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
Further discussion from represent Luno
 
00:36:56.710 --> 00:36:56.720 align:start position:0%
Yes thank you very much Mr Chair Um
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
completely agree with uh with what
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
Representative Spillsberry said Um look
 
00:37:04.630 --> 00:37:04.640 align:start position:0%
forward to um to these um subcommittees
 
00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
or ad hoc committees to get together and
 
00:37:09.990 --> 00:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
take a look at this And I would also um
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
direct people to uh to take a look at um
 
00:37:15.910 --> 00:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
the uh the 2020 commission to study
 
00:37:17.589 --> 00:37:17.599 align:start position:0%
school funding which did spend
 
00:37:19.109 --> 00:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
considerable amount of time and
 
00:37:22.870 --> 00:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
discussion reviewing revenue sources for
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
information purposes only and there's
 
00:37:27.990 --> 00:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
been a number of uh studies over the
 
00:37:30.470 --> 00:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
last um two decades in New Hampshire
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
looking at various revenue sources the
 
00:37:35.349 --> 00:37:35.359 align:start position:0%
impact working with um with with ways
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
and means uh representative as I think
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
introduced us to the Lincoln Institute
 
00:37:42.310 --> 00:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
and expertise um uh there particularly
 
00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
on revenue sources including property
 
00:37:47.109 --> 00:37:47.119 align:start position:0%
taxes but also including other ones too
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
and um and what the reliability is of
 
00:37:52.310 --> 00:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
different sources So hopefully um
 
00:37:54.390 --> 00:37:54.400 align:start position:0%
members of this ad hoc committee be able
 
00:37:56.710 --> 00:37:56.720 align:start position:0%
to harvest quite a bit of information um
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
and move forward with that and I look
 
00:38:00.550 --> 00:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
forward to participating in that effort
 
00:38:01.910 --> 00:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
Further discussion from the committee
 
00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
Representative Ames
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
just to underscore that uh this is
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
really important and I'm grateful to
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
Representative Spilsbury for putting
 
00:38:14.230 --> 00:38:14.240 align:start position:0%
this forward and that we all need to
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
roll up our sleeves It may be a subpart
 
00:38:19.510 --> 00:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
of this group I recognize that But all
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
of us need to roll up our sleeves and uh
 
00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:27.160 align:start position:0%
and step back a pace from the from the
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
day-to-day arguments that we engage in
 
00:38:32.069 --> 00:38:32.079 align:start position:0%
and see if we can't figure out a better
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
way to fund our public schools Um and
 
00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
and identify funding to do that Uh we're
 
00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
in too many uh there are too many dog
 
00:38:43.829 --> 00:38:43.839 align:start position:0%
fights going on around the state right
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
now that are hurting our public schools
 
00:38:49.750 --> 00:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
So let's see if we can't do better Thank
 
00:38:52.310 --> 00:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
you Any further discussion on the bill
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%

will be retained in
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
committee The next bill I'm going to
 
00:39:43.829 --> 00:39:43.839 align:start position:0%
jump over It's the one bill I don't
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
think we're all on the same page and I'm
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to do it last Uh the next billing
 
00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:50.680 align:start position:0%
we discussed is going to be
 
00:39:53.349 --> 00:39:53.359 align:start position:0%
656 relative to the authority of local
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
school districts to accept federal
 
00:39:59.069 --> 00:39:59.079 align:start position:0%
grants And I look to Representative
 
00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh Pam here
 
00:40:05.430 --> 00:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
to our clerk
 
00:40:07.589 --> 00:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
So I'd like to make a motion to retain
 
00:40:07.599 --> 00:40:10.390 align:start position:0%
So I'd like to make a motion to retain
656

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
656
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
There is a second So Representative
 
00:40:15.030 --> 00:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
Brown makes a motion to uh retain second
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
by Represent Luno Represent Brown would
 
00:40:21.630 --> 00:40:21.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
your Well just briefly the origins of
 
00:40:28.630 --> 00:40:28.640 align:start position:0%
this um bill um occurred because of the
 
00:40:30.310 --> 00:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
mission creep we've seen with our public
 
00:40:33.990 --> 00:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
schools taking on non-academic program
 
00:40:36.150 --> 00:40:36.160 align:start position:0%
um topics such as social emotional
 
00:40:38.069 --> 00:40:38.079 align:start position:0%
learning and that involves gathering
 
00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
non-academic data from minor children um
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
through surveys and requests for
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
information some of it tied to federal
 
00:40:48.310 --> 00:40:48.320 align:start position:0%
grant money So in order to have parents
 
00:40:50.870 --> 00:40:50.880 align:start position:0%
understand that grant money has strings
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
attached that was the origin of this
 
00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm happy that it's being
 
00:40:58.390 --> 00:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
retained for further work Thank you
 
00:41:00.390 --> 00:41:00.400 align:start position:0%
Would the second like to speak Sure
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
Thank you very much Uh I think the way
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm glad this bill is being retained
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
um uh but also but but also for
 
00:41:10.550 --> 00:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
additional reasons too and and you know
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
I think it's important should um should
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
school boards be in the uh in the direct
 
00:41:20.470 --> 00:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
line here that um that we understand
 
00:41:22.950 --> 00:41:22.960 align:start position:0%
what the what the what the effect that
 
00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
may have on programs in public schools
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not just talking about programs
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
that might be politically contentious
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
but um but programs in special education
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
support for our some of our need for
 
00:41:37.190 --> 00:41:37.200 align:start position:0%
some of our um kids with the with the
 
00:41:39.829 --> 00:41:39.839 align:start position:0%
greatest needs And um and when we take a
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
look at the schoolboard laws I believe
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
by statute they only have to meet once
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
every two months Um not that any school
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
board meets that infrequently but I
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see um uh you know not
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily conflict with with other
 
00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
statute but provisions with other
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
statutes um u be you know be you know
 
00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
introduce an untimely uh delay in um in
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
in making sure um kids are receiving the
 
00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
services they need That's all Thanks
 
00:42:12.230 --> 00:42:12.240 align:start position:0%
Further discussion Represent Spillsbury
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
Yes I of course support retain And I
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
just wanted to make the comment that
 
00:42:18.870 --> 00:42:18.880 align:start position:0%
even the prime sponsor recognized that
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
the bill needs some further work And
 
00:42:21.910 --> 00:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
there were a variety of questions that
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
came up about obligations whether they
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
were just fin uh monetary or also in
 
00:42:29.349 --> 00:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
kind and uh what about future
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
obligations What about private grants Uh
 
00:42:34.710 --> 00:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
you know what what about unanticipated
 
00:42:38.550 --> 00:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
So you know it's worth the work but we
 
00:42:42.390 --> 00:42:42.400 align:start position:0%
can do that later on Further discussion
 
00:42:44.790 --> 00:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
Representative Damon Thank you Mr Chair
 
00:42:47.030 --> 00:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
I just want to also weigh in supporting
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill while acknowledging
 
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
that transparency in how we use taxpayer
 
00:42:54.470 --> 00:42:54.480 align:start position:0%
dollars whether federal or state sourced
 
00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
is obviously extremely important and
 
00:42:58.950 --> 00:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
also we need it to be defined in statute
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
in a way that makes sense for the
 
00:43:03.589 --> 00:43:03.599 align:start position:0%
operating functions of the school
 
00:43:05.829 --> 00:43:05.839 align:start position:0%
district and a reasonable timeline
 
00:43:05.839 --> 00:43:07.230 align:start position:0%
district and a reasonable timeline
Further

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:07.240 align:start position:0%
Further
 
00:43:09.750 --> 00:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
discussion Not seeing any Madam clerk
 
00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
when you're ready we're ready This would
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
be on 656 relative to the authority of
 
00:43:16.870 --> 00:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
local school districts to accept federal
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
grants The motion is to retain Vice

So we will retain this bill in committee
 
00:44:05.230 --> 00:44:05.240 align:start position:0%
The next bill is
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
HB729 making an appropriation to the
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
Department of Education for an attorney
 
00:44:12.109 --> 00:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
to recotify education
 
00:44:14.950 --> 00:44:14.960 align:start position:0%
laws With that I look to Representative
 
00:44:17.670 --> 00:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
Spillsbury for a motion Thank you Mr
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
Chair I move that we retain HB729
 
00:44:23.349 --> 00:44:23.359 align:start position:0%
I'll second that So we have a motion on
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
the table for 729 to as the motion is to
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
retain This is a bill relative to uh
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
looking at our education laws and
 
00:44:33.589 --> 00:44:33.599 align:start position:0%
recodifying and having an attorney do
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
that Um uh Representative Spilsbury
 
00:44:38.790 --> 00:44:38.800 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your motion
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
Yes thank you I I think we all believe
 
00:44:42.870 --> 00:44:42.880 align:start position:0%
that it would be a marvelous outcome to
 
00:44:46.630 --> 00:44:46.640 align:start position:0%
have a recodified uh um volume of our
 
00:44:49.109 --> 00:44:49.119 align:start position:0%
education laws but the question of what
 
00:44:52.309 --> 00:44:52.319 align:start position:0%
this actually will entail uh is still up
 
00:44:54.790 --> 00:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
in the air And I think that uh Caitlyn
 
00:44:57.829 --> 00:44:57.839 align:start position:0%
Davis in in speaking before us suggested
 
00:45:00.309 --> 00:45:00.319 align:start position:0%
that maybe even an RFP could be prepared
 
00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:03.520 align:start position:0%
by the DOE to uh get a cost estimate
 
00:45:05.829 --> 00:45:05.839 align:start position:0%
before we're asked to act So I think
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's a good bill to hold on to Thank you
 
00:45:12.390 --> 00:45:12.400 align:start position:0%
And the second Thank you very much um Mr
 
00:45:15.750 --> 00:45:15.760 align:start position:0%
Chair And for all those reasons um and
 
00:45:18.710 --> 00:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
and you know making sure that that
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
whatever we do put into law for um for
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
um um rec to recotify the education laws
 
00:45:28.790 --> 00:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
you know follows a plan that uh that
 
00:45:31.589 --> 00:45:31.599 align:start position:0%
makes sense well thought out and um and
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
has a timeline that's uh that's
 
00:45:35.910 --> 00:45:35.920 align:start position:0%
realistic and um and I think having this
 
00:45:38.790 --> 00:45:38.800 align:start position:0%
committee work um on that along with the
 
00:45:41.589 --> 00:45:41.599 align:start position:0%
um the department as uh as as um
 
00:45:43.829 --> 00:45:43.839 align:start position:0%
director Davis has suggested uh I think
 
00:45:45.750 --> 00:45:45.760 align:start position:0%
will be really productive So um so
 
00:45:48.150 --> 00:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
that's why I support the um retaining
 
00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:51.109 align:start position:0%
that's why I support the um retaining
this

00:45:51.109 --> 00:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:53.829 --> 00:45:53.839 align:start position:0%
and I'd like just to put a a few parting
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
words on this Um I am one of the
 
00:45:58.870 --> 00:45:58.880 align:start position:0%
sponsors of this bill and it's come
 
00:46:01.349 --> 00:46:01.359 align:start position:0%
before us in the past the concept the
 
00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
idea that we need to look at these laws
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
for education and we know we've had
 
00:46:09.829 --> 00:46:09.839 align:start position:0%
conflicting law uh as we did with
 
00:46:11.510 --> 00:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney's bill dealing
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
with monies for school building aid and
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
one place in the law said you may do
 
00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
this another part of the law said you
 
00:46:22.390 --> 00:46:22.400 align:start position:0%
may not do this and in the same statutes
 
00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh and we have this conflict
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
of of of ter terminology or are they
 
00:46:29.109 --> 00:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
co-curricular sports are they
 
00:46:31.990 --> 00:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
extracurricular sports what are they Um
 
00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
and so we have language which is mixed
 
00:46:37.510 --> 00:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
and matched all over throughout and it
 
00:46:39.190 --> 00:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
just depends upon who's presenting the
 
00:46:40.550 --> 00:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
bill and who's writing that and what
 
00:46:43.109 --> 00:46:43.119 align:start position:0%
attorney over in in across the street is
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
writing it We do need to do something
 
00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
here And the idea has been to contract
 
00:46:52.309 --> 00:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
that service out And we've all talked
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
about in the past maybe we ought to do
 
00:46:55.270 --> 00:46:55.280 align:start position:0%
it with one of those attorneys that's
 
00:46:57.990 --> 00:46:58.000 align:start position:0%
very familiar with education law over
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
there a retired individual such as a
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
Jeff or an Anthony or somebody that's
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
going to be able to do this you know as
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
quickly as possible But it's a huge tax
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
A 100 grand isn't even going to touch it
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
Uh so we we need to really give if we
 
00:47:16.470 --> 00:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
pass a bill we have to have a little bit
 
00:47:18.470 --> 00:47:18.480 align:start position:0%
more specifics within it as far as what
 
00:47:20.870 --> 00:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
exactly we're looking at within this and
 
00:47:22.550 --> 00:47:22.560 align:start position:0%
how it might be done in the most
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
efficient way working with DOE So I
 
00:47:27.510 --> 00:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
agree I also support the motion to
 
00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:31.510 align:start position:0%
agree I also support the motion to
retain

00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.270 --> 00:47:33.280 align:start position:0%
represent fellows your hands Um yes I
 
00:47:35.190 --> 00:47:35.200 align:start position:0%
would just like to add to that that one
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
of my concerns is the when it's due that
 
00:47:41.109 --> 00:47:41.119 align:start position:0%
the work needs to be completed by
 
00:47:44.109 --> 00:47:44.119 align:start position:0%
September because as a retired state
 
00:47:47.190 --> 00:47:47.200 align:start position:0%
employee I know that there's a limit on
 
00:47:48.910 --> 00:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
00:47:54.069 --> 00:47:54.079 align:start position:0%
um time that you can work for the state
 
00:47:56.230 --> 00:47:56.240 align:start position:0%
and without jeopardizing your retirement
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
You're absolutely correct The time limit
 
00:48:00.309 --> 00:48:00.319 align:start position:0%
in this thing is impossible It's
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
impossible within a few months to get
 
00:48:04.790 --> 00:48:04.800 align:start position:0%
this thing done I've been told before it
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
might take three years to do it properly
 
00:48:10.550 --> 00:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
because you're going to be findings and
 
00:48:12.470 --> 00:48:12.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations come out of it Then you
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
have to go back and have it come back to
 
00:48:17.030 --> 00:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
the legislature for changes possibly
 
00:48:20.870 --> 00:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
It's a huge huge task Um so I concur
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
with what you just said Represent Damon
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr Chair I agree with all the
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
reasons that have been stated for
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
retaining it and I'd like to also add
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
that all of us or subcommittee whatever
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
looking at it that we
 
00:48:38.630 --> 00:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
consider once somehow it is recodified
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
and accurate and consistent What are the
 
00:48:46.309 --> 00:48:46.319 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to keep things up to date
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
Because otherwise in 10 years from then
 
00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:51.200 align:start position:0%
we'll be back in the same conflicting
 
00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.870 align:start position:0%
we'll be back in the same conflicting
situation

00:48:54.870 --> 00:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:58.030 --> 00:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
Any further discussion on HB
 
00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
729 The motion is to retain
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%

Led Yes 18 Yay Zero Nay
 
00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:46.240 align:start position:0%
So with that we will be retaining uh 729
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
The last bill on the docket In fact this
 
00:49:51.270 --> 00:49:51.280 align:start position:0%
is the last bill that this committee has
 
00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
that's a House
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
bill And so congratulations you know and
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
we are going to shovel it out of here Um
 
00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:02.800 align:start position:0%
and then we just await our our Senate
 
00:50:05.670 --> 00:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
bills coming up I do have before we get
 
00:50:07.990 --> 00:50:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the the end here just one notice for
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
the committee here I am going to be
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
working with the uh ranking uh uh
 
00:50:15.510 --> 00:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative here and my vice chair
 
00:50:16.990 --> 00:50:17.000 align:start position:0%
and we're going to be setting up some
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees Subcommittees are going to
 
00:50:22.069 --> 00:50:22.079 align:start position:0%
be set up in a number of areas uh that
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
we need to have to do some work We know
 
00:50:25.910 --> 00:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
we are going to be working on the
 
00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640 align:start position:0%
foundation formula one We know we've got
 
00:50:30.950 --> 00:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
to delve into special education how we
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
pay for special education how we account
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
for special education and and all the
 
00:50:38.230 --> 00:50:38.240 align:start position:0%
software packages that are need to make
 
00:50:39.910 --> 00:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
sure we're getting data that we need on
 
00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
special education So that's going to be
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
number two There's going to be a
 
00:50:44.710 --> 00:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
committee that's going to be looking at
 
00:50:46.790 --> 00:50:46.800 align:start position:0%
higher education in terms of the freedom
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
of speech and that and other pertinent
 
00:50:51.670 --> 00:50:51.680 align:start position:0%
issues which we've had addressed before
 
00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
this committee in higher education I
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
also have one other committee going
 
00:50:58.870 --> 00:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with school building aid We know
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
that due to the revenue picture this
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
year is highly likely that there may be
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
no and I'm just looking to our folks on
 
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
finance here It's highly likely that
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
funds will be approved for paying off
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
our tail our debt But going beyond that
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know it's questionable unless we can
 
00:51:17.109 --> 00:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
come find out you know a gold mine
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
somewhere or oil wells out back or
 
00:51:20.790 --> 00:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
something that's going to provide us
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
that revenue that's that's absolutely
 
00:51:25.589 --> 00:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
needed slot machine
 
00:51:25.599 --> 00:51:26.750 align:start position:0%
needed slot machine
represent

00:51:26.750 --> 00:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
Maguire that that is another way of
 
00:51:31.750 --> 00:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
doing it but uh but the school building
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
aid is very very important I oftenimes
 
00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
call that the fourth leg of the stool if
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
you don't have the brick and mortar I
 
00:51:41.589 --> 00:51:41.599 align:start position:0%
know we're got a lot of stuff going
 
00:51:43.270 --> 00:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
online and all that but if you don't
 
00:51:46.230 --> 00:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
have a facility that's able to contain
 
00:51:49.430 --> 00:51:49.440 align:start position:0%
and offer the proper sciences
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
uh chem labs and all that uh you can't
 
00:51:54.470 --> 00:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
do the job And we also need buildings
 
00:51:57.670 --> 00:51:57.680 align:start position:0%
which have a HVAC that have the lighting
 
00:51:59.430 --> 00:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
have the sound and we know there's a
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
really a deficit in buildings where that
 
00:52:03.510 --> 00:52:03.520 align:start position:0%
is not available to the tune of maybe 15
 
00:52:05.750 --> 00:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
percentage points on achievement testing
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
So those are four that I'm going to
 
00:52:09.109 --> 00:52:09.119 align:start position:0%
start I know there's other areas which
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
we have to look at We've just done some
 
00:52:12.549 --> 00:52:12.559 align:start position:0%
retaining of bills here and there are
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
going to be other subcommittees but
 
00:52:16.950 --> 00:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
those are ones that I'm going to try to
 
00:52:18.870 --> 00:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
get permission to move forward even
 
00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:21.200 align:start position:0%
before we've gotten those Senate bills
 
00:52:22.950 --> 00:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
Once we get seven bills often times
 
00:52:24.230 --> 00:52:24.240 align:start position:0%
you're told well you can't do
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
subcommittees until you unload those
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
bills Well we have some time here where
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
we can start looking and doing that
 
00:52:32.549 --> 00:52:32.559 align:start position:0%
research and working with the education
 
00:52:34.390 --> 00:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
commission of the states and other
 
00:52:37.349 --> 00:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
organizations to gather information and
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
to contact those states or looking in
 
00:52:42.390 --> 00:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
our own field here how we can best you
 
00:52:44.710 --> 00:52:44.720 align:start position:0%
know look at policy that's going to be
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the the funding concerns
 
00:52:48.950 --> 00:52:48.960 align:start position:0%
that we're we're encountering
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
Representative do you have a question I
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
I have a question Question So when do we
 
00:52:57.990 --> 00:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
have any idea I
 
00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:00.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar enough with the process
 
00:53:02.790 --> 00:53:02.800 align:start position:0%
So can you tell me about I'll briefly
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
explain that and then we want to get on
 
00:53:06.630 --> 00:53:06.640 align:start position:0%
to this last bill Thank you Um the
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
process is that I identify for example
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
we may have a subcommittee with maybe
 
00:53:13.109 --> 00:53:13.119 align:start position:0%
seven members or five members or
 
00:53:14.630 --> 00:53:14.640 align:start position:0%
whatever number of members or we may
 
00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:17.280 align:start position:0%
have a committee of the whole The
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee has the responsibility of
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
reporting back to the whole committee
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
when we gather next to take the
 
00:53:26.309 --> 00:53:26.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation and move forward with
 
00:53:28.230 --> 00:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
that recommendation after there's been
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
time in the retaining part here and
 
00:53:32.750 --> 00:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
we've retained right through to next
 
00:53:35.829 --> 00:53:35.839 align:start position:0%
fall and and during that time we're able
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
to try to do some research on these
 
00:53:39.589 --> 00:53:39.599 align:start position:0%
particular bills and come forth with
 
00:53:42.109 --> 00:53:42.119 align:start position:0%
either possible recommendations to move
 
00:53:46.470 --> 00:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
forward with that bill or if it's not
 
00:53:48.829 --> 00:53:48.839 align:start position:0%
worthy moving forward We recommend the
 
00:53:51.190 --> 00:53:51.200 align:start position:0%
opposite In some cases we have found
 
00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:53.119 align:start position:0%
that there's even more time needed and
 
00:53:55.829 --> 00:53:55.839 align:start position:0%
we look to the interim study process
 
00:53:57.670 --> 00:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
which would even take it another year of
 
00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
the last year of the bienium But this
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
process is a process where the first
 
00:54:05.990 --> 00:54:06.000 align:start position:0%
name person that I identify on that
 
00:54:07.910 --> 00:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is the chair of that
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee When you come back as we
 
00:54:12.309 --> 00:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
come back as a whole I will look to that
 
00:54:14.549 --> 00:54:14.559 align:start position:0%
chair to make a recommendation from the
 
00:54:16.870 --> 00:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to the committee This
 
00:54:18.390 --> 00:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
committee right here as it stands right
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
now it's a process that can work We've
 
00:54:22.870 --> 00:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
had a number of bills have gone through
 
00:54:25.670 --> 00:54:25.680 align:start position:0%
that process Uh concussion injury went
 
00:54:26.950 --> 00:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
through that and we came out with
 
00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
recommendations how to deal with that
 
00:54:30.150 --> 00:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
And even with the new research maybe
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
it's time to look at that Maybe a dark
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
room isn't the best place for a person
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's been concussed and new medical
 
00:54:37.829 --> 00:54:37.839 align:start position:0%
research is saying that and you get them
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
going as as as soon as you can So uh I I
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
I think this is a worthy process and one
 
00:54:45.190 --> 00:54:45.200 align:start position:0%
of which this committee has been
 
00:54:48.069 --> 00:54:48.079 align:start position:0%
designed to delve into these funding
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
issues and we have had a brief time to
 
00:54:53.270 --> 00:54:53.280 align:start position:0%
look at some of those right now and do
 
00:54:54.790 --> 00:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
through the variables which we have out
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
there we haven't been able to deal with
 
00:54:57.670 --> 00:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
I have not yet seen a spreadsheet
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
represent as on on and represent Luna on
 
00:55:02.710 --> 00:55:02.720 align:start position:0%
your foundation formula that's something
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
that has to come forward so we can get
 
00:55:06.950 --> 00:55:06.960 align:start position:0%
working on that Um the same thing with
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
special education So yes represent
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
spellsbury I I think this may have been
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
part of your question also Um all of the
 
00:55:15.870 --> 00:55:15.880 align:start position:0%
bills we
 
00:55:19.589 --> 00:55:19.599 align:start position:0%
retain we are due to make a report by
 
00:55:19.599 --> 00:55:20.829 align:start position:0%
retain we are due to make a report by
November

00:55:20.829 --> 00:55:20.839 align:start position:0%
November
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
1st OTP ITL or interim study and those
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
bills will all be acted on in the first
 
00:55:29.670 --> 00:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
session in January
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
Represent McGuire Yes Thank you Mr
 
00:55:34.230 --> 00:55:34.240 align:start position:0%
Chairman on behalf of Representative uh
 
00:55:37.990 --> 00:55:38.000 align:start position:0%
Papovich Mhler and myself I'd like to
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
request that this committee not meet
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
April Well we will be meeting for Senate
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
bills So so that blows that apart But
 
00:55:53.030 --> 00:55:53.040 align:start position:0%
the the other portion is I understand
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
the predicament that division 2 is you
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
know when I walked up here on Friday and
 
00:55:59.670 --> 00:55:59.680 align:start position:0%
where I didn't I was doing some other
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
work but I walk in and division 2 is
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
receiving reports from DOE uh and very
 
00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
much engaged they're already started
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
that long trip that they have and that's
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
not a long trip that's very short trip
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
they have they have to make some
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
powerful decisions here so then we get
 
00:56:16.710 --> 00:56:16.720 align:start position:0%
in the budget and so I understand that
 
00:56:19.270 --> 00:56:19.280 align:start position:0%
but the subcommittees you know I will
 
00:56:22.950 --> 00:56:22.960 align:start position:0%
try to get those going and just know
 
00:56:25.030 --> 00:56:25.040 align:start position:0%
that we have other people here that are
 
00:56:26.950 --> 00:56:26.960 align:start position:0%
not on division two that may want to
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
stand in and work on some of these
 
00:56:31.910 --> 00:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittees So and in the past they we
 
00:56:34.309 --> 00:56:34.319 align:start position:0%
even had a special committee which some
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
here sat on that what was a couple years
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
ago We had four bills We recognized that
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
we didn't have all the horsepower on
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
education policy at the time to do that
 
00:56:47.270 --> 00:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
So we we borrowed two people from from
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
ways and means which repres you are one
 
00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:53.119 align:start position:0%
of them and and represent Spillsbury and
 
00:56:55.109 --> 00:56:55.119 align:start position:0%
then we borrowed two people from finance
 
00:56:57.589 --> 00:56:57.599 align:start position:0%
as well In fact the chair of finance at
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
that time division 2 representative Emer
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
came on and participated in that and
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
through that we had a healthy discussion
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
Uh we just needed a few more weeks and I
 
00:57:09.990 --> 00:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
think we were getting close to that LBA
 
00:57:12.069 --> 00:57:12.079 align:start position:0%
has to keep up with us and unfortunately
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
they can't keep up with all these
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
spreadsheets So that's where we are So
 
00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah we will be starting that
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
subcommittee I'll start that as soon as
 
00:57:20.950 --> 00:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
I can I don't want to spin our wheels
 
00:57:24.390 --> 00:57:24.400 align:start position:0%
here Represent Luno Thank you Mr Chair
 
00:57:27.910 --> 00:57:27.920 align:start position:0%
And I I um um agree with you on the uh
 
00:57:29.430 --> 00:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees I think this is a good
 
00:57:30.870 --> 00:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
direction I think the the four that
 
00:57:33.109 --> 00:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
you've listed off are good places to
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
start for this uh for this committee too
 
00:57:37.670 --> 00:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
But uh obviously you know what's going
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
on at the federal level raises a lot of
 
00:57:43.030 --> 00:57:43.040 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of unknowns going forward
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
and um and this committee may need to
 
00:57:49.109 --> 00:57:49.119 align:start position:0%
meet um additional times to consider how
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
the state responds to uh to any changes
 
00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:54.480 align:start position:0%
that may be um coming at the federal
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
level So uh so I hope the the um the
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
committee will remain agile enough to be
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
able to um to you know accommodate you
 
00:58:07.349 --> 00:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
know game day sort of uh sort of changes
 
00:58:10.789 --> 00:58:10.799 align:start position:0%
as um as things come up
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
Well as the as the goals on the field
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
move move uh it's harder to do that you
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
know that that score but yeah we will
 
00:58:21.349 --> 00:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
stay engaged So what I'd like to do now
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
is return back because we do have folks
 
00:58:25.030 --> 00:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
that are already saying they have to get
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
out and get ready for activities going
 
00:58:29.990 --> 00:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
this afternoon The division our finance
 
00:58:31.750 --> 00:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
people which we appreciate there being
 
00:58:33.309 --> 00:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
on our
 
00:58:33.319 --> 00:58:35.069 align:start position:0%
on our
committee

00:58:35.069 --> 00:58:35.079 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:58:37.670 --> 00:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
HB549 relative to use of education
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
freedom account funds and religious
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
schools and institutions of higher
 
00:58:43.430 --> 00:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
education I'll pass the gavl off to
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
Representative Spillsbury Thank you Mr
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
Chair I recognize Representative Lad to
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
make a motion Yes I'd like to make a
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
motion on 549 of ITL ITL is the motion A
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
second Second Second by Representative
 
00:58:59.829 --> 00:58:59.839 align:start position:0%
Magcguire And Representative Lad please
 
00:59:01.829 --> 00:59:01.839 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion I I would be glad
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
to speak from the motion but I'm not
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
going to speak long at all I mean we
 
00:59:07.670 --> 00:59:07.680 align:start position:0%
we've talked about this issue on the
 
00:59:10.109 --> 00:59:10.119 align:start position:0%
education policy committee for many many
 
00:59:12.549 --> 00:59:12.559 align:start position:0%
years and we've gone through all the
 
00:59:16.309 --> 00:59:16.319 align:start position:0%
court cases with Espinosa and going down
 
00:59:18.470 --> 00:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
all those cases which are relevant to
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
this topic It's my belief that the
 
00:59:24.789 --> 00:59:24.799 align:start position:0%
monies which are appropriated publicly
 
00:59:26.870 --> 00:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh if we don't use them for the private
 
00:59:28.789 --> 00:59:28.799 align:start position:0%
or the private rel religious schools we
 
00:59:28.799 --> 00:59:29.470 align:start position:0%
or the private rel religious schools we
are

00:59:29.470 --> 00:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
discriminating and there's
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues associated with
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
all this and so I I I feel that the best
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
way to do it is do as we've done in
 
00:59:41.670 --> 00:59:41.680 align:start position:0%
previous years and that's it ITL the
 
00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.270 align:start position:0%
previous years and that's it ITL the
bill

00:59:43.270 --> 00:59:43.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:59:46.870 --> 00:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
Thank you Representative Damon
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr Chair I will be opposing
 
00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
the ITL I actually think this is a
 
00:59:53.069 --> 00:59:53.079 align:start position:0%
really important
 
00:59:56.549 --> 00:59:56.559 align:start position:0%
bill from a constitutional separation of
 
00:59:58.109 --> 00:59:58.119 align:start position:0%
church and state point of
 
01:00:01.670 --> 01:00:01.680 align:start position:0%
view This is not about opposing any
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
faith or any religion or the practice
 
01:00:07.109 --> 01:00:07.119 align:start position:0%
thereof This in fact is about
 
01:00:09.589 --> 01:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing people of whatever belief
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
system they have the opportunity to
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
practice those beliefs independent of
 
01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
government constraints
 
01:00:19.829 --> 01:00:19.839 align:start position:0%
Article 83 of New Hampshire's state
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
constitution clearly states quote "No
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
money raised by taxation shall ever be
 
01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
granted or applied for the use of
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
schools of institutions of any religious
 
01:00:30.589 --> 01:00:30.599 align:start position:0%
sector or
 
01:00:34.630 --> 01:00:34.640 align:start position:0%
denomination." When we provide education
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
freedom about account funds to families
 
01:00:41.109 --> 01:00:41.119 align:start position:0%
and they go to religious institutions
 
01:00:43.109 --> 01:00:43.119 align:start position:0%
those are taxpayer dollars going to
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
those religious schools and I think that
 
01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
is constitutionally wrong Thank you
 
01:00:51.630 --> 01:00:51.640 align:start position:0%
Thank you Representative Damon Further
 
01:00:55.910 --> 01:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
comment Okay Representative Ames
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
Uh just to concur um I think that uh
 
01:01:02.870 --> 01:01:02.880 align:start position:0%
there certainly have been we all know
 
01:01:05.150 --> 01:01:05.160 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
um decisions um all the way up to the
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court that uh
 
01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
deal directly or indirectly with this
 
01:01:18.470 --> 01:01:18.480 align:start position:0%
issue But uh it needs to be quickly said
 
01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
they've never dealt with the New
 
01:01:23.829 --> 01:01:23.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution which uh is as
 
01:01:28.990 --> 01:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
explicit as uh you one could uh ever
 
01:01:33.510 --> 01:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
make a rule explicit on this question of
 
01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh taxpayer support for religious
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
schools It's just categorically
 
01:01:43.190 --> 01:01:43.200 align:start position:0%
prohibited the on the on the other on
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
the um sort of the uh national front
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
It's not true that the issue is done and
 
01:01:54.950 --> 01:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
dealt with uh in a final way by the
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court There's another case
 
01:02:00.069 --> 01:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
coming right out of our neighbor Maine
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
that um has uh uh received a favorable
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
decision favorable to the state and the
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
state's position is that uh um that uh
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
limitations prohibitions on funding to
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
religious schools um is necessary Um and
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
so uh decisions favorable to that by the
 
01:02:27.990 --> 01:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
US District Court for the state of Maine
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
and by the second you know the second
 
01:02:33.190 --> 01:02:33.200 align:start position:0%
circuit is in the second circuit So uh
 
01:02:35.670 --> 01:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's under review So it's not done and
 
01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
over with and it's a complicated issue
 
01:02:42.390 --> 01:02:42.400 align:start position:0%
and like most constitutional issues um
 
01:02:44.390 --> 01:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
it probably will never be done and over
 
01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
with uh life goes on and uh justices
 
01:02:53.190 --> 01:02:53.200 align:start position:0%
change and uh opinions change So um I
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
think that on the merits uh the our New
 
01:02:59.349 --> 01:02:59.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution is absolutely
 
01:03:02.549 --> 01:03:02.559 align:start position:0%
correct that uh taxpayers should not be
 
01:03:07.230 --> 01:03:07.240 align:start position:0%
supporting um religious education and uh
 
01:03:10.390 --> 01:03:10.400 align:start position:0%
discrimination in in whatever way that
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
tends to favor those who uh and provide
 
01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
funding to those who want a religious
 
01:03:20.390 --> 01:03:20.400 align:start position:0%
educ education The uh fact of the matter
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
about our EFAs is that a great deal of
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
money is going to support religious
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
education and that religious education
 
01:03:34.390 --> 01:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh flies in the face of some of our um
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
our standards for uh adequate education
 
01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:39.559 align:start position:0%
Um the
 
01:03:44.230 --> 01:03:44.240 align:start position:0%
um uh an example of that is uh is the
 
01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
theory of evolution the scientific
 
01:03:49.190 --> 01:03:49.200 align:start position:0%
method and so forth It is very much
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
embedded in our uh our standards and uh
 
01:03:57.029 --> 01:03:57.039 align:start position:0%
and there are religious schools who uh
 
01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:00.720 align:start position:0%
make it very clear that the uh teaching
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
that is provided in their school system
 
01:04:05.430 --> 01:04:05.440 align:start position:0%
is from the text of the Bible and
 
01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
particularly from Genesis and uh it's uh
 
01:04:13.270 --> 01:04:13.280 align:start position:0%
literal and they embrace the literal not
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
the figurative the literal uh statements
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
in Genesis that essentially reject um
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
the evolutionary
 
01:04:27.270 --> 01:04:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh truths that science has revealed So
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
um for all those reasons I think uh that
 
01:04:36.270 --> 01:04:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh endorsing a a statute that
 
01:04:42.190 --> 01:04:42.200 align:start position:0%
uh that simply endorses and implements a
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
underlying New Hampshire constitutional
 
01:04:47.670 --> 01:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
provision is uh appropriate and I will
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
be voting for it
 
01:04:52.870 --> 01:04:52.880 align:start position:0%
