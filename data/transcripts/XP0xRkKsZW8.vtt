00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:50.070 align:start position:0%
worth of
um

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:50.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:52.000 align:start position:0%
condominium fees
 
00:06:53.670 --> 00:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry it's a bit of this piece of
 
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.590 align:start position:0%
sorry sorry it's a bit of this piece of
legislation

00:06:55.590 --> 00:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:06:58.550 --> 00:06:58.560 align:start position:0%
it will would you just hold on a second
 
00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
i'm not able to make out they could file
 
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
for bankruptcy and all of that he might
 
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to turn off his video and his audio
 
00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
will be better i think that's a great

four minutes here so i'm going to go
quick

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
quick
 
00:07:48.870 --> 00:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
years ago submitted a piece of
 
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:50.960 align:start position:0%
legislation that allowed condominium
 
00:07:53.029 --> 00:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
associations place a six-month priority
 
00:07:53.039 --> 00:07:53.909 align:start position:0%
associations place a six-month priority
lien

00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%
lien
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
on a unit owner's unit for past due
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
condo fees
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
it was done uh so because people would
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
not pay the condo fee association would
 
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:03.909 align:start position:0%
not pay the condo fee association would
struggle

00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
struggle
 
00:08:03.919 --> 00:08:05.029 align:start position:0%
struggle
um

00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:06.869 --> 00:08:06.879 align:start position:0%
financially and then in the event of a
 
00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy or such the
 
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:10.720 align:start position:0%
condo fees would just go away they would
 
00:08:13.110 --> 00:08:13.120 align:start position:0%
not be paid so we submitted this piece
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
of legislation which would make six
 
00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
months worth of condo fees be priority
 
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
to the lien uh and uh first the bankers
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
association had a problem with it and um
 
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:24.160 align:start position:0%
didn't want anything to do with it
 
00:08:25.909 --> 00:08:25.919 align:start position:0%
thought it would be detrimental to
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
people getting loans in new hampshire
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
they realized after a while that a
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
strong association where association had
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
enough money to pay their maintenance
 
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:36.149 align:start position:0%
enough money to pay their maintenance
upkeep

00:08:36.149 --> 00:08:36.159 align:start position:0%
upkeep
 
00:08:38.389 --> 00:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
capital improvements was good
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
for everyone and they agreed to uh go
 
00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
along with the bill that's my knowledge
 
00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
there have been no issues
 
00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
over the last number of years since this
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
has been um
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
law one of the things that did come up
 
00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
prior to this passing was that whether
 
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
or not this was constitutional can you
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
interrupt a contract place a piece of
 
00:08:56.959 --> 00:08:58.230 align:start position:0%
interrupt a contract place a piece of
legislation

00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:58.240 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:09:00.070 --> 00:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
uh in in the middle of what was already
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
a contract opportunity a mortgagee
 
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
a lender and a borrower
 
00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:06.640 align:start position:0%
and we agreed that that was correct it
 
00:09:08.389 --> 00:09:08.399 align:start position:0%
can't be done so the law that was passed
 
00:09:11.110 --> 00:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
was only for bill only for mortgages
 
00:09:13.030 --> 00:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.550 align:start position:0%
that um
were

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
taken out after the law was passed so
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
that is what is in place and that's what
 
00:09:20.470 --> 00:09:20.480 align:start position:0%
happened a number of years ago
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
this bill well may read the same is
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
significantly different and i want to be
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
clear as to what it's about
 
00:09:30.150 --> 00:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
it allows a condo association to be able
 
00:09:32.949 --> 00:09:32.959 align:start position:0%
to get a priority lean
 
00:09:34.949 --> 00:09:34.959 align:start position:0%
and then foreclose
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
on the unit
 
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:38.720 align:start position:0%
why is this being requested well when
 
00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:40.640 align:start position:0%
things were very bad a number of years
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
ago mortgage companies would let
 
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
mortgage go for three or four years
 
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
and not do anything
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
they would not foreclose they wouldn't
 
00:09:50.070 --> 00:09:50.080 align:start position:0%
do anything because they didn't want to
 
00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:52.640 align:start position:0%
have a bad loan on their books
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
more often not the owners had vacated
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
the property so the associations had to
 
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
winterize it but still heat it for
 
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.590 align:start position:0%
winterize it but still heat it for
adjacent

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
adjacent
 
00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:02.630 align:start position:0%
adjacent
units

00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
units
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
and nothing would happen they would stay
 
00:10:05.670 --> 00:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
there and that was not good for the
 
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.949 align:start position:0%
there and that was not good for the
association

00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
association
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
so this mechanism would allow
 
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:12.160 align:start position:0%
a congress association to go forward the
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
lien and then process a foreclosure
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
now the unit owner still has all the
 
00:10:20.230 --> 00:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
remedies available to themselves um such
 
00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:21.030 align:start position:0%
remedies available to themselves um such
as

00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
um to make good on it make payments of
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy all those different things
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
the association just had the ability to
 
00:10:30.790 --> 00:10:30.800 align:start position:0%
do that now when they if they would
 
00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
foreclose they would only be entitled to
 
00:10:34.230 --> 00:10:34.240 align:start position:0%
their condo fees
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
any fees for illegal to process a
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
foreclosure but they wouldn't be resp
 
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't take the rest of the money
 
00:10:43.509 --> 00:10:43.519 align:start position:0%
that would go for the mortgage holder
 
00:10:45.670 --> 00:10:45.680 align:start position:0%
again this would be a situation where
 
00:10:47.190 --> 00:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
this would only be
 
00:10:49.829 --> 00:10:49.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is enacted at 1-122 this would
 
00:10:51.990 --> 00:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
only be for mortgages that are put in
 
00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
place after that
 
00:10:55.430 --> 00:10:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh i am an insurance agent i'm not a
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
lawyer or a banker and there are people
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
step behind me that are lawyers and
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
bankers to speak about this
 
00:11:03.509 --> 00:11:03.519 align:start position:0%
but really all came down to the fact
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
that this concept of a zombie mortgage
 
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:07.760 align:start position:0%
where the mortgage companies wouldn't do
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
anything and units would just sit idle
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
i want to be brief mr chairman so i will
 
00:11:18.550 --> 00:11:18.560 align:start position:0%
accept questions but again if you have
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
if it is of a
 
00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh legal nature or bankers anchor nature
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to hold those questions
 
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.710 align:start position:0%
i would ask you to hold those questions
until

00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%

so um i have a couple of questions
 
00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
though is this is an actual for coat
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
foreclosure in other words there will be
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
other liens that are subordinate or that
 
00:12:22.959 --> 00:12:23.670 align:start position:0%
other liens that are subordinate or that
are

00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:23.680 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:12:26.069 --> 00:12:26.079 align:start position:0%
take priority over this for instance if
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
i'm foreclosed today
 
00:12:30.389 --> 00:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
um would my real estate taxes be the top
 
00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:31.910 align:start position:0%
um would my real estate taxes be the top
lien

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
lien
 
00:12:36.550 --> 00:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh you're there well
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
i don't have the answer to that question
 
00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh i know i
 
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:43.190 align:start position:0%
uh i know i
my

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.389 align:start position:0%
my
my

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
it would only be my belief that property
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
taxes would be primary the condo fee
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
secondary and the fees and then the
 
00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:54.949 align:start position:0%
secondary and the fees and then the
mortgage

00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah i have gary lined up to be the next
 
00:12:59.430 --> 00:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
speaker so he can answer that question
 
00:13:02.870 --> 00:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
is there anybody else any other yes
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
follow up please yeah
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
so this would be an actual foreclosure
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
and if i were to foreclose this would be
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
on my on my record as as far as credit
 
00:13:18.150 --> 00:13:18.160 align:start position:0%
going forward is that correct
 
00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:20.320 align:start position:0%
yes that is correct but it's like any
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
other foreclosure notice that is
 
00:13:24.389 --> 00:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
received the individual has the ability
 
00:13:27.350 --> 00:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
to um rectify the payments make a some
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of uh
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
plan with the association whatever it's
 
00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
not a beta complete um
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
the same way it wouldn't be if your
 
00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:38.720 align:start position:0%
mortgage company
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
would initiate a foreclosure
 
00:13:42.629 --> 00:13:42.639 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up please if i may
 
00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.750 align:start position:0%
and one more follow-up please if i may
miss

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
miss
 
00:13:46.470 --> 00:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
a question of inquiry
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you and so would this trigger like
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
an auction or a a
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
mortgagee sale or something of that sort
 
00:13:55.430 --> 00:13:55.440 align:start position:0%
is that would that be the next step
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
should this actually go to foreclosure
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
it could representative but i think the
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
lawyer and the banker that
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
will speak after me will explain to you
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
what has happened in in reality
 
00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
is that if people have abandoned the
 
00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
properties yes they would go to a
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
foreclosure if not usually the mortgage
 
00:14:15.269 --> 00:14:15.279 align:start position:0%
company will step in and rectify the
 
00:14:15.279 --> 00:14:16.629 align:start position:0%
company will step in and rectify the
situation

00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
and uh refinance somehow to
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
with the uh unit owner
 
00:14:24.069 --> 00:14:24.079 align:start position:0%
so payments are made and and the issue
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
goes away
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you well i appreciate that
 
00:14:30.069 --> 00:14:30.079 align:start position:0%
thank you representative okay any other
 
00:14:32.710 --> 00:14:32.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:41.829 --> 00:14:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.829 --> 00:14:43.839 align:start position:0%
hi good morning i would also note that
 
00:14:49.030 --> 00:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:50.560 align:start position:0%
make a note
 
00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
good thank you go ahead gary
 
00:14:54.949 --> 00:14:54.959 align:start position:0%
hi good morning everyone and uh thank
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
you for your time in hearing me on this
 
00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:58.870 align:start position:0%
you for your time in hearing me on this
bill

00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:01.189 --> 00:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
you've seen versions of this bill before
 
00:15:04.870 --> 00:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
so in the interest of time um i won't
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
give a long explanation of why this is
 
00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
needed but the short answer is that
 
00:15:11.509 --> 00:15:11.519 align:start position:0%
associations run only on the money that
 
00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
they collect by assessments and so when
 
00:15:16.710 --> 00:15:16.720 align:start position:0%
they run into long-term delinquency
 
00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:19.279 align:start position:0%
units they really struggle in terms of
 
00:15:21.030 --> 00:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
providing the proper maintenance for the
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
property the proper insurance for the
 
00:15:25.269 --> 00:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
property because without the unit owner
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
money coming in they're unable to pay
 
00:15:29.910 --> 00:15:29.920 align:start position:0%
their bills so it has become really
 
00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:32.800 align:start position:0%
important uh the problem is that even
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
with all the law that we have including
 
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:38.720 align:start position:0%
um as will just mentioned the priority
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
lean law
 
00:15:42.550 --> 00:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
after we perfect a priority lien after
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
we go to court after the court issues a
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
judgment in a case
 
00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:48.959 align:start position:0%
to the extent that the judgment isn't
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
paid right now in new hampshire we're
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
sort of left in limbo where the
 
00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:55.600 align:start position:0%
delinquency continues but the
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
association has no further moves to make
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
with the exception of a sheriff's sale
 
00:16:02.470 --> 00:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
i've done sheriff's sales
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
they tend to not move the situation
 
00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:06.160 align:start position:0%
forward because
 
00:16:08.310 --> 00:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
if any bidders actually show up and
 
00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:10.639 align:start position:0%
usually they don't if they show up what
 
00:16:12.870 --> 00:16:12.880 align:start position:0%
they find out is that the unit owner
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
under a sharp sale procedure has a one
 
00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
year right of redemption
 
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
um they are also taking subject to the
 
00:16:21.269 --> 00:16:21.279 align:start position:0%
mortgage and when you add you know both
 
00:16:23.509 --> 00:16:23.519 align:start position:0%
of those conditions people don't feel
 
00:16:25.509 --> 00:16:25.519 align:start position:0%
comfortable trying to buy this as an
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
investment property
 
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
of the some
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
17 states
 
00:16:33.350 --> 00:16:33.360 align:start position:0%
in the country that have priority liens
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
for condo associations new hampshire is
 
00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079 align:start position:0%
at present the only one that can't
 
00:16:39.509 --> 00:16:39.519 align:start position:0%
foreclose on
 
00:16:41.749 --> 00:16:41.759 align:start position:0%
so really what we're asking for is just
 
00:16:43.269 --> 00:16:43.279 align:start position:0%
the ability
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
as we do elsewhere
 
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:47.120 align:start position:0%
to be able to bring a long-term
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
condominium unit delinquency to a
 
00:16:53.030 --> 00:16:53.040 align:start position:0%
resolution if the case pushes that far
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
um now to
 
00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:56.639 align:start position:0%
fill in the gaps a little bit with what
 
00:16:59.189 --> 00:16:59.199 align:start position:0%
will mention i can tell you as a as a
 
00:17:01.269 --> 00:17:01.279 align:start position:0%
condominium practitioner who's done
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
nothing but this type of law for the
 
00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
past 18 years
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
um in states where there is a
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
foreclosure remedy for the association
 
00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
and i practice in in one of those um
 
00:17:17.029 --> 00:17:17.039 align:start position:0%
more than 97
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
of my cases
 
00:17:21.350 --> 00:17:21.360 align:start position:0%
were resolved short of foreclosure
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
and so in reality what i can tell you is
 
00:17:25.829 --> 00:17:25.839 align:start position:0%
that what happens is that the
 
00:17:28.950 --> 00:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
possibility of the foreclosure the fact
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
that that event could happen
 
00:17:34.230 --> 00:17:34.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't make that event happen
 
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
what it what it makes happen in reality
 
00:17:38.789 --> 00:17:38.799 align:start position:0%
is for people to resolve the issue one
 
00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
way or the other if the unit owner is at
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
the unit then they tend to resolve it
 
00:17:45.510 --> 00:17:45.520 align:start position:0%
because they want to resolve it before
 
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
they lose the unit if it's one of the
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
many cases that will mentioned where the
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
unit already has vacated the premises
 
00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:54.320 align:start position:0%
because for whatever reason they can't
 
00:17:55.990 --> 00:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
afford to live there anymore and they're
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
on their way and now the association is
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
stuck with a vacant unit in those cases
 
00:18:03.669 --> 00:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
the bank will make a business decision
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
under the existing process and that
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
wouldn't change if this bill passes
 
00:18:11.110 --> 00:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
the first mortgage holder gets notices
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
two of them prior to the filing of suit
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then they are kept abreast of what
 
00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
happens in the suit that's in court
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
because they're named as a party in
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
interest not a defendant
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
but a party in interest so they can
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
remain on top of the situation as it
 
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:30.880 align:start position:0%
moves through the court and then finally
 
00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
if the judgment issues and isn't paid
 
00:18:35.590 --> 00:18:35.600 align:start position:0%
then they also would get notice of the
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
foreclosure so there's no surprise
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
foreclosure from the standpoint of the
 
00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
first mortgage holder
 
00:18:45.669 --> 00:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
and so what happens is in those cases
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
those rare cases less than three percent
 
00:18:51.510 --> 00:18:51.520 align:start position:0%
um where foreclosure is an option
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
but the situation is not otherwise
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
resolved then the bank will make a
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
business decision
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
and if they feel it's in their best
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
interest to retain the property then
 
00:19:02.470 --> 00:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
they will simply contact us the way they
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
otherwise might and say we're going to
 
00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:06.640 align:start position:0%
pay these condo fees because we don't
 
00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
want to see this unit go to foreclosure
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
and that's really all the association
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
needs so when that happens we make that
 
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:14.549 align:start position:0%
needs so when that happens we make that
agreement

00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:14.559 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
and everybody proceeds
 
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
in cases where the bank's business
 
00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
decision is that it would actually be
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
better for this property to get
 
00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
foreclosed and move on with a new owner
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
then sometimes they won't respond at all
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
but uh oftentimes to be perfectly honest
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
with you
 
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
i will be contacted by first mortgage
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
holders who say i see what's going on i
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
see what you're doing and um you know go
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
ahead just make sure after the
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
foreclosure you send us our check for
 
00:19:43.029 --> 00:19:43.039 align:start position:0%
everything that you're not entitled to
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
keep and as will mention all the
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
associations keeping is priority lien
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
related money so when this piece of real
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
estate sells the lion's share of those
 
00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
proceeds are still going to the mortgage
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
holder anyway
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
oh and i should mention with respect to
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
the questions that came up
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
this does not affect
 
00:20:06.150 --> 00:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
tax liens on the property those would
 
00:20:09.190 --> 00:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
still be above that of the association
 
00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:11.360 align:start position:0%
so we're not tipping the apple car in
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
that sense
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
that would remain the same also
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
i know of no condominium law
 
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
practitioners that engage in credit
 
00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
reporting relative to these unit owners
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
so i know you know with public notice
 
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
and such a foreclosure the information's
 
00:20:29.669 --> 00:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
kind of out there but for what it's
 
00:20:32.549 --> 00:20:32.559 align:start position:0%
worth i know our firm doesn't and all of
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
the other firms that i know of that
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
focus uh in condominium law i don't know
 
00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
of anyone
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
who's making reports to the credit
 
00:20:42.149 --> 00:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
reporting agencies over the uh
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative van houden does
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
actually thank you you you have more
 
00:20:54.390 --> 00:20:54.400 align:start position:0%
directly addressed what i was going for
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
i really wanted to know about the
 
00:20:57.990 --> 00:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
finality of this if it really did
 
00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:00.640 align:start position:0%
parallel foreclosure on a uh on a
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
separate home uh and just another quick
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
question i believe you're with cai if i
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
remember the initials correctly would
 
00:21:08.549 --> 00:21:08.559 align:start position:0%
you clarify the group that you're
 
00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:10.880 align:start position:0%
representing for us please certainly so
 
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
the community associations institute is
 
00:21:17.510 --> 00:21:17.520 align:start position:0%
a nationwide non-profit whose only goal
 
00:21:19.990 --> 00:21:20.000 align:start position:0%
is to make association living
 
00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
better and more desirable
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
they have regional chapters under their
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
national umbrella
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:21:30.070 --> 00:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
not surprisingly falls into the new
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
england chapter
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then in each state they have a
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
legislative action committee which is a
 
00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:38.720 align:start position:0%
group of volunteers that monitors
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
legislation impacting um you know
 
00:21:43.830 --> 00:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
condominium and association living and
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
for the state of new hampshire i am
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
currently chairing that committee
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representative mccleary
 
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:54.549 align:start position:0%
okay uh uh representative mccleary
mcleary

00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
mcleary
 
00:21:55.830 --> 00:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
would this
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
include not only condos but like
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision associations or all those
 
00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
types of associations
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
in uh doesn't necessarily have to be a
 
00:22:09.190 --> 00:22:09.200 align:start position:0%
condo would that be correct
 
00:22:12.149 --> 00:22:12.159 align:start position:0%
uh so this bill actually speaks to
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
condominiums at present it would be part
 
00:22:16.070 --> 00:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
of 356b
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh rsa 356b which governs condominiums
 
00:22:21.909 --> 00:22:21.919 align:start position:0%
uh it is my understanding that as yet
 
00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
homeowner associations do not have their
 
00:22:25.510 --> 00:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
own statute
 
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
we have seen a draft of one and uh i
 
00:22:31.190 --> 00:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
believe it will be proposed again and
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
i'm pretty sure that at some point in
 
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:35.200 align:start position:0%
the future homeowner associations will
 
00:22:37.190 --> 00:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
have their own statute the way
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
condominiums do and cooperatives do but
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
at present this would be part of 356b
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:50.710 --> 00:22:50.720 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%

i've been an active member of cai
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%

i'm a member of the massachusetts
 
00:23:47.430 --> 00:23:47.440 align:start position:0%

and
 
00:23:51.990 --> 00:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
gary asked me if i would uh add a little
 
00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
bit of color to the experience that
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
my bank has had over the years with
 
00:24:01.110 --> 00:24:01.120 align:start position:0%
regards to the priority lien we have in
 
00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:03.029 align:start position:0%
regards to the priority lien we have in
massachusetts

00:24:03.029 --> 00:24:03.039 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
i can go back i've been with the bank
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
for almost 30 years uh i started our
 
00:24:12.149 --> 00:24:12.159 align:start position:0%
we i started our lending program to
 
00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:14.720 align:start position:0%
condominium associations making loans to
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
them for capital improvements um at the
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
same time i've also run our residential
 
00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
lending program at the bank uh up until
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
about five years ago
 
00:24:27.029 --> 00:24:27.039 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:24:27.039 --> 00:24:27.750 align:start position:0%
and um
so

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:27.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
i have i think probably a fairly unique
 
00:24:33.909 --> 00:24:33.919 align:start position:0%
uh view of the priority lien
 
00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:35.590 align:start position:0%
uh view of the priority lien
situation

00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that when the
 
00:24:40.549 --> 00:24:40.559 align:start position:0%
massachusetts priority lien was proposed
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
myself as well as just about every
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
banker in massachusetts said this is
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
terrible it's going to create havoc in
 
00:24:48.149 --> 00:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
the industry and and
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
this is not a good thing
 
00:24:52.149 --> 00:24:52.159 align:start position:0%
turned out to be quite the opposite
 
00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
frankly i can tell you that in our in
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
all the years that i ran our residential
 
00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:59.510 align:start position:0%
all the years that i ran our residential
side

00:24:59.510 --> 00:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
we never lost a unit because of a
 
00:25:03.430 --> 00:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
priority lien
 
00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.630 align:start position:0%
priority lien
um

00:25:04.630 --> 00:25:04.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
the key is that we were always notified
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
it gave us a chance to look at our
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
situation sometimes as gary had said we
 
00:25:14.390 --> 00:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
we would we would uh go back to the
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
association council and say just keep us
 
00:25:19.269 --> 00:25:19.279 align:start position:0%
informed and we'll be at the at the
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
foreclosure to bid and protect our
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
interests um other times we've said to
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
we've said to council look
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
send us the bill we'll pay it we'll keep
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
it current and we'll deal with our
 
00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:31.830 align:start position:0%
it current and we'll deal with our
borrower

00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
borrower
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
that's been very successful for us over
 
00:25:36.630 --> 00:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
the years and i think that
 
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:37.549 align:start position:0%
the years and i think that
about

00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:25:39.990 --> 00:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
25 years ago
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
we actually started making loans as i
 
00:25:44.070 --> 00:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned two associations and one of
 
00:25:45.750 --> 00:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
the things that really allowed us to do
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
that was that we had the confidence that
 
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:50.480 align:start position:0%
associations were going to be able to
 
00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
take action and collect their fees and
 
00:25:56.870 --> 00:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's those fees that make my
 
00:25:59.029 --> 00:25:59.039 align:start position:0%
loan program for associations work
 
00:26:01.269 --> 00:26:01.279 align:start position:0%
because my collateral in that side of
 
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:04.880 align:start position:0%
things is not the um
 
00:26:07.110 --> 00:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
real estate it's the cash flow of the
 
00:26:11.430 --> 00:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
association and so clearly my concern is
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
how strong is that is that that that
 
00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
cash flow with the ability to actually
 
00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:18.880 align:start position:0%
foreclose you know it's one thing to to
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
to give an association the um
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
right to do and attach a unit but if you
 
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
don't give them the teeth to actually
 
00:26:30.470 --> 00:26:30.480 align:start position:0%
take action just as gary said
 
00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
a problem can sit there for years and
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
that that's a drain on the cash flow and
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
and the financial resources of the
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
association not to mention that um
 
00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
it can also be damaging to the physical
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
plant of the association somebody
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
abandons their unit
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
the lender doesn't step up and the next
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
thing you know the temperature drops
 
00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
below freezing the pipes freeze they
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
burst now you've got a real problem in
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
the association things like that have
 
00:27:00.549 --> 00:27:00.559 align:start position:0%
happened uh
 
00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
all over the northeast and i can tell
 
00:27:05.110 --> 00:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
the best way to prevent that is to make
 
00:27:08.070 --> 00:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
sure that the cash flow of the
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
association is strong and i think i
 
00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:14.320 align:start position:0%
would i would urge you to to
 
00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
to to uh pass this so that associations
 
00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
have the the teeth to be able to act uh
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
and um protect themselves and to protect
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:31.990 --> 00:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh any questions from
 
00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:32.830 align:start position:0%

my name is ryan hale i'm vice president
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
government relations for the new
 
00:28:22.389 --> 00:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
hampshire bankers association
 
00:28:24.310 --> 00:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire bankers represents 38
 
00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
member banks
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
which employ nearly six thousand
 
00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.190 align:start position:0%
which employ nearly six thousand
employees

00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
employees
 
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:31.440 align:start position:0%
i come before the committee today to
 
00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
provide testimony and opposition to
 
00:28:36.630 --> 00:28:36.640 align:start position:0%
house bill 462
 
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
for the following reasons uh as
 
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.549 align:start position:0%
for the following reasons uh as
introduced

00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
and as the sponsor has indicated hb 462
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
would increase the condominiums
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
associations party lien rights by giving
 
00:28:50.310 --> 00:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer boards
 
00:28:52.870 --> 00:28:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the right to foreclose upon and evict
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
a condo unit uh owner for unpaid
 
00:28:58.149 --> 00:28:58.159 align:start position:0%
assessment fees regardless of the amount
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
owed um either as it as current law
 
00:29:02.880 --> 00:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
owed um either as it as current law
says

00:29:03.830 --> 00:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200 align:start position:0%
it can be up to six months of
 
00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
unpaid fees uh so this proposal does go
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
beyond that 2010 compromise the sponsor
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
pointed to
 
00:29:16.389 --> 00:29:16.399 align:start position:0%
um which did create the existing
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
statutory pri uh priority lien rights
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
for the unpaid assessment fees
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
and allowed the uh condominium
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
associations to require owners to escrow
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
um six months of fees uh
 
00:29:31.669 --> 00:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
as the sponsor pointed out this isn't
 
00:29:34.950 --> 00:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
the first time uh most recently hb
 
00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.830 align:start position:0%
the first time uh most recently hb
uh

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:38.640 align:start position:0%
uh 436 which this committee heard back
 
00:29:40.870 --> 00:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
in i believe it was 2019
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
was voted on 19 nothing in expedient to
 
00:29:43.919 --> 00:29:45.269 align:start position:0%
was voted on 19 nothing in expedient to
legislate

00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
00:29:45.279 --> 00:29:46.230 align:start position:0%
legislate
uh

00:29:46.230 --> 00:29:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
the condominium associations i think
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
it's important to point out already have
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
less drastic options at their disposal
 
00:29:54.789 --> 00:29:54.799 align:start position:0%
again part of that compromise back in
 
00:29:57.669 --> 00:29:57.679 align:start position:0%
2010 was um giving them ability to
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
require escrowing about uh of up to six
 
00:30:04.070 --> 00:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
months of unpaid uh
 
00:30:06.950 --> 00:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
assessment fees um
 
00:30:09.029 --> 00:30:09.039 align:start position:0%
additionally they can limit uh or
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
eliminate access to common areas such as
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
jim's pools and parking to encourage a
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
unit order to pay their fair share
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
um if it acted uh we see some unattended
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
consequences occurring
 
00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:23.590 align:start position:0%
consequences occurring
specifically

00:30:23.590 --> 00:30:23.600 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
giving the condo board
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
the right to foreclose upon a unit
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
could potentially could increase or will
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
increase a lender's risk
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
associated with condominium lending
 
00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
this could result in a borrow and
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
borrowers paying higher interest rates
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
to account for the added risk um or
 
00:30:45.430 --> 00:30:45.440 align:start position:0%
limit access lending more generally
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
we we see these consequences could have
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
an impact that extends again beyond
 
00:30:51.430 --> 00:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
banking industry
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
and could make condominiums the less
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
attractive options uh for first-time
 
00:30:58.149 --> 00:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
home buyers which condominiums are
 
00:30:59.909 --> 00:30:59.919 align:start position:0%
generally viewed as affordable workforce
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
housing for and sometimes first-time
 
00:31:03.279 --> 00:31:05.190 align:start position:0%
housing for and sometimes first-time
homeowners

00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
entry into the market
 
00:31:10.470 --> 00:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
and ultimately this could reduce values
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
of condos and potentially could apparent
 
00:31:14.870 --> 00:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
already anemic housing market so we all
 
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
know big issue and remains here in new
 
00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:18.630 align:start position:0%
know big issue and remains here in new
hampshire

00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:18.640 align:start position:0%

00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
the low occupancy rate
 
00:31:24.310 --> 00:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
um additionally the timing of this
 
00:31:26.710 --> 00:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
legislation runs counter to current
 
00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
efforts to keep individuals in their
 
00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:30.149 align:start position:0%
efforts to keep individuals in their
homes

00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
homes
 
00:31:32.310 --> 00:31:32.320 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic i i always like to
 
00:31:34.230 --> 00:31:34.240 align:start position:0%
point out the great work that banks have
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
done to help keep uh homeowners in their
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
homes uh providing uh forbearance and
 
00:31:42.789 --> 00:31:42.799 align:start position:0%
payment deferrals um
 
00:31:47.029 --> 00:31:47.039 align:start position:0%
those can go up to 18 months um
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
the response you know
 
00:31:51.430 --> 00:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
our our members response bank's response
 
00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
our our members response bank's response
um

00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know has been immediate um
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
and uh you know we see uh the good work
 
00:32:00.549 --> 00:32:00.559 align:start position:0%
that they're doing um
 
00:32:04.149 --> 00:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
however hb 462 we see round encounter to
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
this um by giving the effort of
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
associate or giving association's
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
ability to foreclose on you know we're
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
sending homeowners kind of mixed
 
00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.430 align:start position:0%
sending homeowners kind of mixed
messages

00:32:13.430 --> 00:32:13.440 align:start position:0%
messages
 
00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
we understand
 
00:32:17.509 --> 00:32:17.519 align:start position:0%
uh the difficulties uh unpaid assessment
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
fees do create
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
but this change is not the answer
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
especially when they do have other
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
options currently at their disposal as i
 
00:32:26.720 --> 00:32:27.830 align:start position:0%
options currently at their disposal as i
mentioned

00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh requiring that unit owners uh
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
um escrow up to the six months um to
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
provide that cushion to provide that
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
security um
 
00:32:39.509 --> 00:32:39.519 align:start position:0%
one one um point i also would like to
 
00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:41.440 align:start position:0%
make it and the sponsor had mentioned
 
00:32:44.950 --> 00:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
that um this is only would be only for
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
contracts moving forward um i looked
 
00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:50.000 align:start position:0%
through the legislation and i did check
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
with legal and i in the build i couldn't
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
see anywhere where it does
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
would point to just future contracts not
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
going back in time
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
so i think there is a concern there um
 
00:33:05.669 --> 00:33:05.679 align:start position:0%
and i do it legal uh um we do have an
 
00:33:07.990 --> 00:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
attorney on the call today
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
to answer any legal questions that i may
 
00:33:12.470 --> 00:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
be uh unable to answer so
 
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:15.200 align:start position:0%
in closing um as we had in the past we
 
00:33:17.269 --> 00:33:17.279 align:start position:0%
would urge the committee to vote against
 
00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:20.320 align:start position:0%
uh 462 and move to inexpedia to
 
00:33:22.149 --> 00:33:22.159 align:start position:0%
legislate as the committee has done to
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
some of the legislation in the past
 
00:33:25.990 --> 00:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration and i'd
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
be happy to take any questions at this
 
00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
time uh we do have questions
 
00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
see some hands okay representative
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
bartlett is first
 
00:33:38.230 --> 00:33:38.240 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for coming
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
before us mr hale
 
00:33:43.029 --> 00:33:43.039 align:start position:0%
um question i've got is
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
how often do condominium associations
 
00:33:49.110 --> 00:33:49.120 align:start position:0%
actually require six months in escrow
 
00:33:50.310 --> 00:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
which would be
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
quite a lot of money to be able to get
 
00:33:55.110 --> 00:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
up front when they purchase in addition
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
to a down payment when they purchase
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
a condominium
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and
 
00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:04.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately uh representative bartlett
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have the answer i mean i think
 
00:34:07.750 --> 00:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a decision of each
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
individual association but um given the
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
fact that they do have that ability to
 
00:34:14.550 --> 00:34:14.560 align:start position:0%
to request it it does create a you know
 
00:34:17.669 --> 00:34:17.679 align:start position:0%
i think less drastic option um than
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
allowing a condo association to initiate
 
00:34:23.589 --> 00:34:23.599 align:start position:0%
the foreclosure um
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:34:26.470 --> 00:34:26.480 align:start position:0%
i think one of the big concerns we have
 
00:34:27.750 --> 00:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
with it is
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
00:34:31.669 --> 00:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
the the unpaid assessment fees could be
 
00:34:34.069 --> 00:34:34.079 align:start position:0%
a matter of a few hundred bucks with a
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
few thousand bucks compared to the rest
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
of the bank holds which you know could
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
be several hundred thousand dollars um
 
00:34:43.829 --> 00:34:43.839 align:start position:0%
and yet the this bill would allow the
 
00:34:46.069 --> 00:34:46.079 align:start position:0%
um the association to foreclose on it
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
again i apologize i don't have the
 
00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:49.119 align:start position:0%
answer to that i think that might be an
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
answer but um i think the condo
 
00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
associations would have the answer to
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
that question
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
but it is at their disposal it is an
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
option they do have
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
um mr chair could we
 
00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.710 align:start position:0%
um mr chair could we
ask

00:35:02.710 --> 00:35:02.720 align:start position:0%
ask
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
could we maybe ask somebody we do have
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
another person uh speak coming up to
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
speak uh so dean dean you'll make sure
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
you answer that question for them thank
 
00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:14.480 align:start position:0%
you dean okay so uh you all set then
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
christy okay yes all right uh so uh next
 
00:35:20.069 --> 00:35:20.079 align:start position:0%
question is from john patusek
 
00:35:22.550 --> 00:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:25.280 align:start position:0%
ryan for coming before us and thank you
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
for the uh
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
the thing want to tie my
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
my question is basically does this
 
00:35:34.630 --> 00:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
differ does this build differ virtually
 
00:35:37.829 --> 00:35:37.839 align:start position:0%
in any way from the one we itl two years
 
00:35:37.839 --> 00:35:39.270 align:start position:0%
in any way from the one we itl two years
ago

00:35:39.270 --> 00:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
um a little bit in the sense that i
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
believe the one um a couple years ago
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
increased the amount of fees that they
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
could uh to add i believe that one
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
allowed auctioneer fees to be added to
 
00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:54.320 align:start position:0%
the lien um the way we read this one is
 
00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:56.560 align:start position:0%
it it does that additional legal fees
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
but um quite simply
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
does allow
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
for initiating of the foreclosure which
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
436 also had the initiation of the
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
foreclosure aspect to the legislation
 
00:36:09.990 --> 00:36:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome okay uh representative
 
00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.069 align:start position:0%
thank you welcome okay uh representative
mccleary

00:36:14.069 --> 00:36:14.079 align:start position:0%
mccleary
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh mr chairman um
 
00:36:20.550 --> 00:36:20.560 align:start position:0%
the small amount of of money that
 
00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
could be involved here is is there any
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
way that you could see that a
 
00:36:26.870 --> 00:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
committee condo committee could could be
 
00:36:29.349 --> 00:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
vindictive in using this to uh
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
discriminate uh in any way
 
00:36:34.310 --> 00:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh you know just uh give you know hassle
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
people that they might not like is that
 
00:36:38.790 --> 00:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
a possibility here
 
00:36:41.589 --> 00:36:41.599 align:start position:0%
i you know you know i think
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
i think it does open the door for that
 
00:36:45.829 --> 00:36:45.839 align:start position:0%
you know there there is potential for
 
00:36:47.829 --> 00:36:47.839 align:start position:0%
abuse we do see there that there is that
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
potential again um you know i think
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
there's different dynamics with the
 
00:36:54.630 --> 00:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
different condo boards but i think
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
it does open that up as i think
 
00:36:57.910 --> 00:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately it does open that up as a
 
00:36:57.920 --> 00:37:00.069 align:start position:0%
ultimately it does open that up as a
possibility

00:37:00.069 --> 00:37:00.079 align:start position:0%
possibility
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
you know someone that you know i think
 
00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:04.000 align:start position:0%
there it could create a scenario where
 
00:37:05.910 --> 00:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
someone that misses the fee misses some
 
00:37:08.069 --> 00:37:08.079 align:start position:0%
fees here and there pays them misses
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
some fees here and there then pays them
 
00:37:12.470 --> 00:37:12.480 align:start position:0%
ultimately this would allow the condo
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
association to at some point put their
 
00:37:16.230 --> 00:37:16.240 align:start position:0%
foot down and just
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
go to the board and initiate the
 
00:37:21.430 --> 00:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:37:31.349 --> 00:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
um during uh maybe you covered this
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
earlier but during a condo foreclosure
 
00:37:36.230 --> 00:37:36.240 align:start position:0%
is the bank paying the condo fees while
 
00:37:37.829 --> 00:37:37.839 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
before the auction occurs
 
00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:41.910 align:start position:0%
before the auction occurs
um

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
i i have an attorney on the line that
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
may be able to answer that but to my
 
00:37:50.950 --> 00:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
understanding no i think it would rely
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
on the
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
um the condo owner i think the only way
 
00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
likely and and i may
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
i think again
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
attorney beatle our legal is on the on
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
this call may be able to answer this
 
00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
better but my understanding that would
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
result if those that if the fees were
 
00:38:09.589 --> 00:38:09.599 align:start position:0%
escrowed the bank could then uh pay
 
00:38:11.510 --> 00:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
those fees
 
00:38:13.589 --> 00:38:13.599 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up for the question may
 
00:38:13.599 --> 00:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
and uh follow up for the question may
inquire

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
the arrearages in other words the condo
 
00:38:19.910 --> 00:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
fees that might have accumulated before
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
the uh people walked away from it said
 
00:38:23.670 --> 00:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
i would believe so but i can i can
 
00:38:28.069 --> 00:38:28.079 align:start position:0%
follow up with uh the committee uh with
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
answers to that all right sure thing
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question okay
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for um taking
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
my question um
 
00:38:41.349 --> 00:38:41.359 align:start position:0%
mr house wondering would the bill be
 
00:38:43.349 --> 00:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
more palatable to the to the banking
 
00:38:45.670 --> 00:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
industry if there is a minimum amount of
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
money owed by the uh condo owners um
 
00:38:50.310 --> 00:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
because we said their possibility of
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
foreclosure with just a couple of
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars it would if just for
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
example we said the minimum would be
 
00:38:58.390 --> 00:38:58.400 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars
 
00:39:01.510 --> 00:39:01.520 align:start position:0%
um again i you know i i would have to go
 
00:39:04.630 --> 00:39:04.640 align:start position:0%
back to uh our folks but i do feel that
 
00:39:06.870 --> 00:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
um i think just a simple fact of
 
00:39:09.349 --> 00:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
allowing a condo association to
 
00:39:11.109 --> 00:39:11.119 align:start position:0%
foreclose on
 
00:39:13.349 --> 00:39:13.359 align:start position:0%
you know whatever that six month let's
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
say that maximum or six months you know
 
00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
um what the bank
 
00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
risk far outweighs that small six months
 
00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:22.790 align:start position:0%
risk far outweighs that small six months
of

00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
fees let's say
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
um it's a thousand dollars so that's six
 
00:39:28.069 --> 00:39:28.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in comparison you know
 
00:39:31.510 --> 00:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
that bank holds you know 100 potentially
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
a couple hundred thousand dollar
 
00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
mortgage on that so i think that's a
 
00:39:37.030 --> 00:39:37.040 align:start position:0%
real concern and you know through the
 
00:39:39.430 --> 00:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
foreclosure sale what what is the return
 
00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:41.200 align:start position:0%
you know so the condo association
 
00:39:42.390 --> 00:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
because they have the priority lien
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
would be um
 
00:39:46.710 --> 00:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
would be um paid first
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
you know what what is left goes to the
 
00:39:51.829 --> 00:39:51.839 align:start position:0%
other elite you know the bank um but you
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
know through condo associations the last
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
number i heard was in foreclosures
 
00:39:58.390 --> 00:39:58.400 align:start position:0%
this was a few years ago but i believe
 
00:40:00.950 --> 00:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
it was a 60 cents on the dollar so there
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
would be there could be a loss
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
so i think that really is the risk that
 
00:40:06.870 --> 00:40:06.880 align:start position:0%
we're concerned with so thank you for
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
your question thank you
 
00:40:12.870 --> 00:40:12.880 align:start position:0%
okay see no more questions uh you're all
 
00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:16.400 align:start position:0%
set and um i'll now invite dean lemon to
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
uh to testify
 
00:40:20.230 --> 00:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hunt and
 
00:40:21.990 --> 00:40:22.000 align:start position:0%
committee members uh i appreciate the
 
00:40:24.310 --> 00:40:24.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity i am also with uh cai new
 
00:40:26.550 --> 00:40:26.560 align:start position:0%
england like gary dario
 
00:40:28.790 --> 00:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
so on its face this bill uh is the
 
00:40:31.589 --> 00:40:31.599 align:start position:0%
ability to foreclose a priority lien but
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
i think the way we need to think about
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
this bill is one to preserve and protect
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
the financial integrity of condos and
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
this is because the existing priority
 
00:40:44.390 --> 00:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
lean law doesn't go far enough as gary
 
00:40:45.910 --> 00:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
stated all the other states with
 
00:40:47.829 --> 00:40:47.839 align:start position:0%
priority liens have the ability to
 
00:40:49.750 --> 00:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
foreclose on those liens
 
00:40:51.510 --> 00:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that's important because it gives
 
00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:52.710 align:start position:0%
and that's important because it gives
condos

00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
condos
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
some leverage
 
00:40:56.630 --> 00:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
to get a payment out of an owner
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
or if an owner can't do that
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
to force their mortgage company
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
to do it for them
 
00:41:04.710 --> 00:41:04.720 align:start position:0%
with the idea being the the mortgage
 
00:41:06.870 --> 00:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
company can add that on to the the
 
00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:09.599 align:start position:0%
principal balance and get repaid in time
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
and of course banks have a greater
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
financial wherewithal than non-profit
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
condominium associations
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
now the ability to foreclose or excuse
 
00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
me that actually foreclosing on an owner
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
is going to be exceedingly rare i would
 
00:41:24.790 --> 00:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
put it at well under one percent of all
 
00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.990 align:start position:0%
put it at well under one percent of all
cases

00:41:25.990 --> 00:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
cases
 
00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
and it's important to know
 
00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:28.790 align:start position:0%
and it's important to know
that

00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
a foreclosure is only going to happen if
 
00:41:33.109 --> 00:41:33.119 align:start position:0%
the if the mortgage company if the bank
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
wants it to happen
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
this idea that a condo will foreclose
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
over three hundred dollars or a thousand
 
00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:40.470 align:start position:0%
over three hundred dollars or a thousand
dollars

00:41:40.470 --> 00:41:40.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
is a red herring that is i have never in
 
00:41:45.270 --> 00:41:45.280 align:start position:0%
my life over
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
12 years foreclosed on an amount so low
 
00:41:50.230 --> 00:41:50.240 align:start position:0%
and it's simply not going to happen
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the exceedingly rare
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
situation where
 
00:41:56.950 --> 00:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
an owner cannot has abandoned the unit
 
00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.150 align:start position:0%
an owner cannot has abandoned the unit
has

00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
no ability to pay
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
and the bank for whatever reason will
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
not respond to our notices these are the
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
situations we're talking about
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
i have a case right now where the the in
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
um in nashua where the bank finally
 
00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
foreclosed after years
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
of the owner after the owner vacated
 
00:42:20.150 --> 00:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
the owner
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
was gone was not paying every month
 
00:42:25.349 --> 00:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
unpaid fees unpaid fees unpaid fees and
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
finally after over two years the bank
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
finally foreclosed and my client could
 
00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
do nothing
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
the termination of services ability that
 
00:42:36.309 --> 00:42:36.319 align:start position:0%
um mr hale referenced that's that's some
 
00:42:38.390 --> 00:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
leverage but when the owner is not there
 
00:42:40.870 --> 00:42:40.880 align:start position:0%
it is no leverage whatsoever
 
00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:42.550 align:start position:0%
it is no leverage whatsoever
so

00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:42:44.230 --> 00:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
in this when you're dealing with condos
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
they need every dollar to be paid out of
 
00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:47.280 align:start position:0%
their budget
 
00:42:49.430 --> 00:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
they need something like uh the ability
 
00:42:53.030 --> 00:42:53.040 align:start position:0%
to foreclose in these rare circumstances
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
um and in the the everyday circumstances
 
00:42:57.190 --> 00:42:57.200 align:start position:0%
you just need some leverage to make
 
00:42:58.390 --> 00:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
banks pay you
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
when owners cannot
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
and again the banks put that right onto
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
the principal they usually make owners
 
00:43:06.069 --> 00:43:06.079 align:start position:0%
pay it out of escrow payments like they
 
00:43:08.550 --> 00:43:08.560 align:start position:0%
do for property taxes and in time they
 
00:43:10.829 --> 00:43:10.839 align:start position:0%
will get paid
 
00:43:10.839 --> 00:43:12.630 align:start position:0%
will get paid
um

00:43:12.630 --> 00:43:12.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:14.870 --> 00:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
and and just to address some of the the
 
00:43:18.150 --> 00:43:18.160 align:start position:0%
general allegations made by uh mr hale
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh regarding higher interest rates
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh reduced property values i would ask
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
the banking lobby to show us the proof
 
00:43:27.030 --> 00:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
of that it certainly has not happened in
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and i'm not aware of it
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
happening in all the other states with
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
priority lean foreclosure laws as mr
 
00:43:36.150 --> 00:43:36.160 align:start position:0%
blair said it really enhances property
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
values because you know
 
00:43:40.630 --> 00:43:40.640 align:start position:0%
the condo has the financial wherewithal
 
00:43:42.309 --> 00:43:42.319 align:start position:0%
to keep up the buildings to replace
 
00:43:45.030 --> 00:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
roofs to replace siding so this like i
 
00:43:46.309 --> 00:43:46.319 align:start position:0%
said at the outset this is not a
 
00:43:49.109 --> 00:43:49.119 align:start position:0%
foreclosure bill alone this is about
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
protecting condominium finances and i
 
00:43:53.910 --> 00:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time i know uh
 
00:43:55.430 --> 00:43:55.440 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett had a question
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
for mr hale that was not answered if you
 
00:43:58.470 --> 00:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
could just refresh my memory on that
 
00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:00.309 align:start position:0%
could just refresh my memory on that
please

00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:44:02.790 --> 00:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative
 
00:44:05.109 --> 00:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
thank you for remembering um
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering how often it is i mean one
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
of the arguments that the bankers are
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
saying is that the condominiums um
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
associations have the ability to
 
00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
escrow up to six months of condo fees
 
00:44:22.550 --> 00:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
when somebody purchases a unit do you
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
have any idea how often that requirement
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
is actually um
 
00:44:29.349 --> 00:44:29.359 align:start position:0%
in place
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
i don't have a figure on that but i can
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
tell you with 100 confidence i've never
 
00:44:35.990 --> 00:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
seen it happen i've never seen a bank
 
00:44:37.270 --> 00:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
say well
 
00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
good thing we we escrow these funds
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
here's a check for six months i've just
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
never seen it ever
 
00:44:46.069 --> 00:44:46.079 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
and and just one final note i'm sorry if
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
i'm overstepping my bounds here but a
 
00:44:51.510 --> 00:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
foreclosure is only going to happen if
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the mortgage company allows it to happen
 
00:44:54.390 --> 00:44:54.400 align:start position:0%
and that's because they're getting all
 
00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
these notices and they're making a
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
business decision this is not something
 
00:45:00.390 --> 00:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
that happens in secret or behind closed
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
doors this is something the bank knows
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
about from before suit during suit and
 
00:45:06.630 --> 00:45:06.640 align:start position:0%
after suit and it doesn't happen
 
00:45:08.470 --> 00:45:08.480 align:start position:0%
overnight it's going to be a six month
 
00:45:10.470 --> 00:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
or more process
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative van houghton you have
 
00:45:14.710 --> 00:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:16.870 --> 00:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you for taking
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%
my question um i'm looking at both the
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
condominium act as well as the bill and
 
00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:24.800 align:start position:0%
between the two i'm having some
 
00:45:24.800 --> 00:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
between the two i'm having some
questions

00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:45:28.309 --> 00:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
um one is
 
00:45:30.870 --> 00:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
a foreclosure can happen for six months
 
00:45:33.510 --> 00:45:33.520 align:start position:0%
of rare ages even if some of the past
 
00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:34.550 align:start position:0%
of rare ages even if some of the past
due

00:45:34.550 --> 00:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
due
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
bills are already caught up i heard that
 
00:45:38.470 --> 00:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier and i'm not sure if i
 
00:45:40.230 --> 00:45:40.240 align:start position:0%
got that correct
 
00:45:42.150 --> 00:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that is correct
 
00:45:43.589 --> 00:45:43.599 align:start position:0%
if a suit's going to be filed it's
 
00:45:45.430 --> 00:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
typically going to be when the owner
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
owes the six months of fees or maybe a
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
few months thereafter probably a few
 
00:45:51.510 --> 00:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
months there after because you're going
 
00:45:53.190 --> 00:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
to record a lien
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
and let the owner know um and if if you
 
00:45:57.750 --> 00:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
are foreclosing it could be any amount
 
00:46:00.309 --> 00:46:00.319 align:start position:0%
by that time you know perhaps by the
 
00:46:01.670 --> 00:46:01.680 align:start position:0%
time you get a judgment against them
 
00:46:03.190 --> 00:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
it's ballooned to 12 months but you're
 
00:46:05.109 --> 00:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
still only the priority lien is still
 
00:46:07.829 --> 00:46:07.839 align:start position:0%
only going to be the six months
 
00:46:10.150 --> 00:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
if for some reason the owner had paid it
 
00:46:12.309 --> 00:46:12.319 align:start position:0%
down to one or two months i don't see
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
foreclosure as an option at that point
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
because there's no reason to you know
 
00:46:19.030 --> 00:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
the arrearage has been paid down
 
00:46:20.870 --> 00:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
um follow-up please the question may
 
00:46:20.880 --> 00:46:21.829 align:start position:0%
um follow-up please the question may
inquire

00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
inquire
 
00:46:24.309 --> 00:46:24.319 align:start position:0%
um another representative earlier asked
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
about the idea of having say a five
 
00:46:28.470 --> 00:46:28.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar uh minimum what are your
 
00:46:30.950 --> 00:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
thoughts on something of that sort
 
00:46:33.990 --> 00:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
well it's hard to set a a hard minimum
 
00:46:35.670 --> 00:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
because some some
 
00:46:37.109 --> 00:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
condo fees are a hundred dollars per
 
00:46:39.030 --> 00:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
month others are five or six hundred
 
00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:39.990 align:start position:0%
month others are five or six hundred
dollars

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:46:41.190 --> 00:46:41.200 align:start position:0%
per month
 
00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:44.160 align:start position:0%
so you know to me six months you want to
 
00:46:45.750 --> 00:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
think about it in months as opposed to
 
00:46:45.760 --> 00:46:46.950 align:start position:0%
think about it in months as opposed to
dollars

00:46:46.950 --> 00:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:46:49.910 --> 00:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so i guess i could foresee a bill
 
00:46:51.829 --> 00:46:51.839 align:start position:0%
that that required at least six months
 
00:46:54.710 --> 00:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
or or some other amount to be owed
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
in order to foreclose but to set it at a
 
00:46:59.109 --> 00:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
dollar value i think is is difficult
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
just because fees can vary so widely
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:06.870 --> 00:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh same question
 
00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:11.920 align:start position:0%
as before does the uh during the process
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
of condo foreclosure is the bank paying
 
00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
either the condo fees or the arrearages
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's rather rare once in
 
00:47:21.829 --> 00:47:21.839 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts anyway you'll sometimes
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
see a bank pay the priority lien
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then start paying monthly until they
 
00:47:28.390 --> 00:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
foreclose because they don't want us to
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
keep on
 
00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
restarting the process to foreclose so
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
they actually save money by saving the
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
legal fees so
 
00:47:35.839 --> 00:47:36.870 align:start position:0%
legal fees so
in

00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it's rather rare at this
 
00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
point in time to ever see uh uh
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
the bank
 
00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:44.000 align:start position:0%
pay monthly until they foreclose and and
 
00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
the reason is because they don't have to
 
00:47:48.150 --> 00:47:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh we're limited to one priority lean at
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
a time and they know we can't foreclose
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
on it so that the banks can drag their
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
feet as long as they're so inclined to
 
00:47:53.839 --> 00:47:54.550 align:start position:0%
feet as long as they're so inclined to
do

00:47:54.550 --> 00:47:54.560 align:start position:0%
do
 
00:47:56.950 --> 00:47:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh and the association is left holding
 
00:47:59.750 --> 00:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
the bag and suffering
 
00:48:01.510 --> 00:48:01.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:02.390 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
okay

00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:05.349 --> 00:48:05.359 align:start position:0%
um seeing no more hands so we can move
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%

prasal representing
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
the mortgage bankers brokers association
 
00:48:25.430 --> 00:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
i had not signed up to speak however i
 
00:48:30.950 --> 00:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
did want to i think ryan did a great job
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
outlining our opposition to the bill
 
00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:34.390 align:start position:0%
outlining our opposition to the bill
so

00:48:34.390 --> 00:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
with that i do have a 10 o'clock hearing
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
to go to um and i think ryan did a fine
 
00:48:41.030 --> 00:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
job okay okay
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh dave i i promoted you but now i see
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
you didn't actually uh want to speak
 
00:48:47.990 --> 00:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
because do you you have anything you
 
00:48:54.230 --> 00:48:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:56.230 --> 00:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
actually um yeah i'm going to ask you to
 
00:48:56.240 --> 00:49:02.069 align:start position:0%
actually um yeah i'm going to ask you to
unmute

00:49:02.069 --> 00:49:02.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:03.589 --> 00:49:03.599 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman members of the committee
 
00:49:05.270 --> 00:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
dave collins on behalf of new hampshire
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
credit unions
 
00:49:08.549 --> 00:49:08.559 align:start position:0%
again not intended to speak i think ryan
 
00:49:09.670 --> 00:49:09.680 align:start position:0%
covered it
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
but i would point out that there was a
 
00:49:12.790 --> 00:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
statement made by the advocates of the
 
00:49:14.230 --> 00:49:14.240 align:start position:0%
bill that i found
 
00:49:15.750 --> 00:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat interesting and that is that
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
this is this bill is a measure
 
00:49:21.190 --> 00:49:21.200 align:start position:0%
um to provide leverage to make the banks
 
00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:22.309 align:start position:0%
um to provide leverage to make the banks
pay

00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
pay
 
00:49:24.390 --> 00:49:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh when the dollars are not forthcoming
 
00:49:26.950 --> 00:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
from the condo owner
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
and i think that's clearly just a
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
shifting of the responsibility
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
and perhaps is not uh appropriate
 
00:49:36.309 --> 00:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
given the fact that for the in this case
 
00:49:38.470 --> 00:49:38.480 align:start position:0%
the bank the financial institution has
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
the financial wherewithal it's a
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
shifting of responsibilities i would
 
00:49:43.349 --> 00:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
suggest that the problem needs to be
 
00:49:45.270 --> 00:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
addressed at its source
 
00:49:47.430 --> 00:49:47.440 align:start position:0%
thank you fair enough representative
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:57.589 --> 00:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
i have a question i guess
 
00:50:02.390 --> 00:50:02.400 align:start position:0%
and in terms i i think i heard the word
 
00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.230 align:start position:0%
and in terms i i think i heard the word
forbearance

00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
forbearance
 
00:50:06.710 --> 00:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
in in the sense that uh somebody was
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:50:10.150 --> 00:50:10.160 align:start position:0%
uh not not
 
00:50:13.190 --> 00:50:13.200 align:start position:0%
will be uh carry the charges
 
00:50:15.190 --> 00:50:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh until
 
00:50:17.829 --> 00:50:17.839 align:start position:0%
you know some sort of resolution is
 
00:50:19.270 --> 00:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
is made
 
00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh and the way i i see it it looks as
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
though the forbearance is gonna have to
 
00:50:26.950 --> 00:50:26.960 align:start position:0%
be made by
 
00:50:29.829 --> 00:50:29.839 align:start position:0%
the condo association not the bank
 
00:50:32.309 --> 00:50:32.319 align:start position:0%
and the bank is the lender
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
so i i would think that the
 
00:50:36.319 --> 00:50:37.030 align:start position:0%
so i i would think that the
the

00:50:37.030 --> 00:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.829 align:start position:0%
the
responsibility

00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
responsibility
 
00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
goes back to the lender
 
00:50:46.549 --> 00:50:46.559 align:start position:0%
and to make the association
 
00:50:48.230 --> 00:50:48.240 align:start position:0%
eat the uh
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
uh the money
 
00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:50.950 align:start position:0%
uh the money
it

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:50:53.589 --> 00:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
to me sounds a little uh backwards
 
00:50:53.599 --> 00:50:54.390 align:start position:0%
to me sounds a little uh backwards
so

00:50:54.390 --> 00:50:54.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:55.750 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:59.109 --> 00:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
there are risks of course being a bank
 
00:51:01.190 --> 00:51:01.200 align:start position:0%
and making the loan
 
00:51:03.829 --> 00:51:03.839 align:start position:0%
based on whatever collateral they think
 
00:51:06.309 --> 00:51:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh that condo
 
00:51:06.319 --> 00:51:07.589 align:start position:0%
uh that condo
represents

00:51:07.589 --> 00:51:07.599 align:start position:0%
represents
 
00:51:10.390 --> 00:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
so that was entirely their decision
 
00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
and it's not the association's decision
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
so i think uh i think in in this case
 
00:51:19.270 --> 00:51:19.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the responsibility uh especially
 
00:51:20.549 --> 00:51:20.559 align:start position:0%
when you
 
00:51:23.109 --> 00:51:23.119 align:start position:0%
throw in the word forbearance
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
uh should fall upon uh the the person or
 
00:51:29.990 --> 00:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
entity that uh uh made the loan on the
 
00:51:31.349 --> 00:51:31.359 align:start position:0%
collateral so
 
00:51:33.910 --> 00:51:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's that's just an observation and i
 
00:51:36.549 --> 00:51:36.559 align:start position:0%
and i think that
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe yes uh-huh the condo
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
association did not make the loan okay
 
00:51:44.309 --> 00:51:44.319 align:start position:0%
and so we're running out of time here so
 
00:51:46.790 --> 00:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much and thank you
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
dave and i'm going to close the public
 
00:51:51.109 --> 00:51:51.119 align:start position:0%

rockingham 17 new market new fields um
 
00:52:50.230 --> 00:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
is actually a reintroduction
 
00:52:54.790 --> 00:52:54.800 align:start position:0%
introduction of a bill that i had put in
 
00:52:56.790 --> 00:52:56.800 align:start position:0%
last year which
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
with an amendment
 
00:52:59.829 --> 00:52:59.839 align:start position:0%
passed this committee i i think
 
00:53:01.589 --> 00:53:01.599 align:start position:0%
unanimously was on the consent calendar
 
00:53:03.109 --> 00:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
past the consent calendar and it was one
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:53:07.270 --> 00:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
many uh casualties over in the senate of
 
00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:08.309 align:start position:0%
many uh casualties over in the senate of
covid

00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
covid
 
00:53:08.319 --> 00:53:09.670 align:start position:0%
covid
um

00:53:09.670 --> 00:53:09.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:09.680 --> 00:53:10.470 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:53:12.950 --> 00:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
the way i put this bill in this way is
 
00:53:15.430 --> 00:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
as it was amended out of this committee
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
um it was not the way i
 
00:53:19.750 --> 00:53:19.760 align:start position:0%
personally preferred but i thought it
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
would be the way that you all would be
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
the most amenable so what this bill says
 
00:53:26.230 --> 00:53:26.240 align:start position:0%
in its current amended form
 
00:53:28.630 --> 00:53:28.640 align:start position:0%
amended according to last year
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
is simply that a um a unit owner who can
 
00:53:35.589 --> 00:53:35.599 align:start position:0%
vote a board member who can vote on
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
contracts if that unit owner has
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
um some sort of business that the
 
00:53:45.109 --> 00:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
the association might contract out to
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
that that person must recuse themselves
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
from voting on
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
awarding that contract to their own
 
00:53:53.430 --> 00:53:53.440 align:start position:0%
business i think that is a pretty
 
00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.710 align:start position:0%
business i think that is a pretty
standard

00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
standard
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh procedure in in in terms of dealing
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
with conflict of interest for most
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
situations for whatever reason um
 
00:54:05.829 --> 00:54:05.839 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire law we never specified
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
that that had to be the case
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
and so the reason that i originally put
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
this bill in is because it does have and
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
has had real world significant real
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
world impacts so i originally put this
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
in for a constituent
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
um and i have since learned even more
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
about the situation
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
um in newmarket there is a condo
 
00:54:26.790 --> 00:54:26.800 align:start position:0%
association a condo
 
00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.990 align:start position:0%
association a condo
complex

00:54:27.990 --> 00:54:28.000 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
um where the person who owns the
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
majority of the units also owns a large
 
00:54:35.670 --> 00:54:35.680 align:start position:0%
property management company
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
and as i've talked to quite a few of the
 
00:54:41.670 --> 00:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
uh renters in that association i've come
 
00:54:43.349 --> 00:54:43.359 align:start position:0%
to find out that
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
not only is that property management
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
company the one that's contracted out
 
00:54:48.549 --> 00:54:48.559 align:start position:0%
too but that they
 
00:54:51.270 --> 00:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
they haven't done anything really in the
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
sense of assisting their their tenants
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
but they have
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
um repeatedly done had lots of contracts
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
awarded to them for
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
what has been viewed as mostly
 
00:55:04.150 --> 00:55:04.160 align:start position:0%
unnecessary work ripping out trees
 
00:55:05.750 --> 00:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
putting new trees in ripping those out
 
00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480 align:start position:0%
putting them in again and meanwhile the
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
the issues that the tenants have within
 
00:55:11.589 --> 00:55:11.599 align:start position:0%
their own units
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
goes largely unaddressed uh and while
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
that has happened so this this unit
 
00:55:19.270 --> 00:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
owner who has this property management
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
company and then votes on the board to
 
00:55:23.589 --> 00:55:23.599 align:start position:0%
award the contract for property
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
management to his own company
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
while that has happened and all of these
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
jobs unneces largely unnecessary jobs as
 
00:55:32.790 --> 00:55:32.800 align:start position:0%
i understand them are being done
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
the housing um the hoa feed that the
 
00:55:37.510 --> 00:55:37.520 align:start position:0%
tenants are having to pay through their
 
00:55:40.870 --> 00:55:40.880 align:start position:0%
rent um has incrementally gone up over
 
00:55:42.790 --> 00:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
the years as well
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and it come to find out that in this
 
00:55:49.030 --> 00:55:49.040 align:start position:0%
particular situation this person doesn't
 
00:55:51.270 --> 00:55:51.280 align:start position:0%
only do it with this particular
 
00:55:54.789 --> 00:55:54.799 align:start position:0%
condo complex but actually is involved
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
in owns either some or majority of some
 
00:56:01.190 --> 00:56:01.200 align:start position:0%
12 other complexes who also contract out
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
through his property management company
 
00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:04.480 align:start position:0%
so it's become something of a business
 
00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:05.750 align:start position:0%
so it's become something of a business
model

00:56:05.750 --> 00:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:56:08.069 --> 00:56:08.079 align:start position:0%
because of this loophole we have
 
00:56:11.109 --> 00:56:11.119 align:start position:0%
so my understanding is that well
 
00:56:12.470 --> 00:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
i can say from remembering from the
 
00:56:14.870 --> 00:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
hearing last year
 
00:56:17.349 --> 00:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
i believe everybody on this committee as
 
00:56:18.789 --> 00:56:18.799 align:start position:0%
it was uh
 
00:56:20.230 --> 00:56:20.240 align:start position:0%
created last year
 
00:56:21.990 --> 00:56:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh agreed with the
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
principle or the intent of
 
00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.079 align:start position:0%
making sure we didn't have this conflict
 
00:56:27.990 --> 00:56:28.000 align:start position:0%
of interest problem
 
00:56:31.510 --> 00:56:31.520 align:start position:0%
the only real concern that had come up
 
00:56:33.030 --> 00:56:33.040 align:start position:0%
and which is why it was amended to the
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
current version you have before you
 
00:56:38.549 --> 00:56:38.559 align:start position:0%
was the potential for say a single unit
 
00:56:38.559 --> 00:56:39.349 align:start position:0%
was the potential for say a single unit
owner

00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
owner
 
00:56:40.950 --> 00:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
um or even someone who owns several
 
00:56:44.309 --> 00:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
units who maybe has a plow or has a
 
00:56:46.470 --> 00:56:46.480 align:start position:0%
small business and if that person is
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
willing to do superior work for the the
 
00:56:51.109 --> 00:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
lowest price available why shouldn't
 
00:56:52.470 --> 00:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
they be able to
 
00:56:54.710 --> 00:56:54.720 align:start position:0%
go ahead and do that which was a
 
00:56:58.470 --> 00:56:58.480 align:start position:0%
sensible uh argument um so the
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
the amendment last year which is now the
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
bill this year simply requires the
 
00:57:05.109 --> 00:57:05.119 align:start position:0%
person to recuse themselves i personally
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
would prefer to just have a dollar limit
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
on the contracts available rather than
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
say just recusal
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
or possibly both because
 
00:57:17.910 --> 00:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
my fear is especially in the case of the
 
00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:20.480 align:start position:0%
person who apparently i'm dealing with
 
00:57:24.150 --> 00:57:24.160 align:start position:0%
in newmarket and in other areas here
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
if someone is powerful enough to own the
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
majority of units uh in an association
 
00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.950 align:start position:0%
majority of units uh in an association
and

00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
and otherwise have a big property
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
management company i fear that just them
 
00:57:38.630 --> 00:57:38.640 align:start position:0%
recusing themselves may not necessarily
 
00:57:40.870 --> 00:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
lead to just the best decisions because
 
00:57:42.549 --> 00:57:42.559 align:start position:0%
that person also likely has a lot of
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
connections on the board
 
00:57:46.470 --> 00:57:46.480 align:start position:0%
um and through just personal
 
00:57:48.950 --> 00:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
relationships may be able to get the
 
00:57:52.630 --> 00:57:52.640 align:start position:0%
contract anyway so um that's
 
00:57:53.910 --> 00:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
personally i would like to see in
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
addition to the recusal just some like
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
max dollar amount
 
00:58:00.309 --> 00:58:00.319 align:start position:0%
um which would help protect say the the
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
individual guy who just happens to have
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
a plow on his truck and is willing to to
 
00:58:05.829 --> 00:58:05.839 align:start position:0%
plow for the association
 
00:58:07.430 --> 00:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
versus um
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
versus the kind of situation i'm dealing
 
00:58:11.910 --> 00:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
with here with my constituents but
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's essentially it i either in
 
00:58:16.470 --> 00:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
either case whether it's this version or
 
00:58:19.109 --> 00:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
some other amendment um to be added to
 
00:58:21.270 --> 00:58:21.280 align:start position:0%
it i would just highly
 
00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh ask that this committee understand
 
00:58:25.910 --> 00:58:25.920 align:start position:0%
the importance of this conflict of
 
00:58:25.920 --> 00:58:26.870 align:start position:0%
the importance of this conflict of
interest

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
issue and uh pass some sort of
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
measure to deal with the conflict of
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
interest and and i'm open for any
 
00:58:33.440 --> 00:58:35.829 align:start position:0%
interest and and i'm open for any
questions

00:58:35.829 --> 00:58:35.839 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:58:37.829 --> 00:58:37.839 align:start position:0%
so we do have a couple uh representative
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
bartlett here up first
 
00:58:41.589 --> 00:58:41.599 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thanks for coming to
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
see us again um representative reed
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
if if i recall this
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
last year
 
00:58:52.870 --> 00:58:52.880 align:start position:0%
the concern we had was the really small
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
uh condo associations is that correct
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
um i don't i i have to admit my
 
00:59:00.870 --> 00:59:00.880 align:start position:0%
ignorance in what constitutes a small
 
00:59:03.750 --> 00:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
condo association versus a large one the
 
00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
one that is in new market that i am
 
00:59:07.589 --> 00:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
dealing with as you know a matter of
 
00:59:08.950 --> 00:59:08.960 align:start position:0%
dealing with my constituents in this
 
00:59:11.589 --> 00:59:11.599 align:start position:0%
issue has maybe i would guess a hundred
 
00:59:13.670 --> 00:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
ish uh units
 
00:59:14.710 --> 00:59:14.720 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:59:18.069 --> 00:59:18.079 align:start position:0%
okay all right follow up continue yes so
 
00:59:18.079 --> 00:59:18.870 align:start position:0%
okay all right follow up continue yes so
um

00:59:18.870 --> 00:59:18.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
so i think that
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
that our the reason that we wanted the
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
amendment in there was for the you know
 
00:59:25.910 --> 00:59:25.920 align:start position:0%
like the four units
 
00:59:28.230 --> 00:59:28.240 align:start position:0%
kind of condo association where if one
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
of them like you say has a plow on and
 
00:59:31.750 --> 00:59:31.760 align:start position:0%
that was why
 
00:59:34.069 --> 00:59:34.079 align:start position:0%
we wanted it to be amended to just allow
 
00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
them to recuse because i think
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
we were concerned
 
00:59:41.430 --> 00:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
with the kind of issue that you've
 
00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:43.200 align:start position:0%
brought up
 
00:59:45.430 --> 00:59:45.440 align:start position:0%
and i just wanted to to clarify why we
 
00:59:46.390 --> 00:59:46.400 align:start position:0%
had asked
 
00:59:49.670 --> 00:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
regarding the um recusal because we just
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
felt it was un
 
00:59:53.190 --> 00:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
as i recall we thought it was
 
00:59:53.200 --> 00:59:54.710 align:start position:0%
as i recall we thought it was
unrealistic

00:59:54.710 --> 00:59:54.720 align:start position:0%
unrealistic
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
in a very small association where
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:00:01.109 --> 01:00:01.119 align:start position:0%
there's only two or three on the board
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
and one of them happens
 
01:00:05.430 --> 01:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
to plow the the driveway that
 
01:00:07.510 --> 01:00:07.520 align:start position:0%
that that could affect the management of
 
01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:08.309 align:start position:0%
that that could affect the management of
the

01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
of the association
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
um if i recall you're you're correct
 
01:00:15.750 --> 01:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett um i didn't
 
01:00:17.270 --> 01:00:17.280 align:start position:0%
remember specifically the size of the
 
01:00:19.750 --> 01:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
association being um the main issue was
 
01:00:22.230 --> 01:00:22.240 align:start position:0%
more about well what's the harm of if
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
you have a unit owner that just has a
 
01:00:26.069 --> 01:00:26.079 align:start position:0%
small business or a plow and they they
 
01:00:27.510 --> 01:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
are providing the best service at the
 
01:00:28.390 --> 01:00:28.400 align:start position:0%
best price
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
why shouldn't they be able to go ahead
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
and do that and i don't find any issue
 
01:00:35.109 --> 01:00:35.119 align:start position:0%
with that at all so i i was happy that
 
01:00:36.870 --> 01:00:36.880 align:start position:0%
the committee moved forward on the bill
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
in any form and and i had only mentioned
 
01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:41.589 align:start position:0%
in any form and and i had only mentioned
that

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:00:43.670 --> 01:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
that perhaps recusal in a big situation
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
like this might not be enough um and if
 
01:00:49.270 --> 01:00:49.280 align:start position:0%
the committee was amenable to it i would
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
personally like to see an additional
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
piece added and it may include something
 
01:00:55.750 --> 01:00:55.760 align:start position:0%
along the lines of the size of the
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
association like you mentioned or it may
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
just be a dollar limit let's say a 5 000
 
01:01:02.390 --> 01:01:02.400 align:start position:0%
or 10 000 limit they cannot contract
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
with the unit owner
 
01:01:06.549 --> 01:01:06.559 align:start position:0%
for more than 10 000 in a year which i
 
01:01:08.630 --> 01:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
think is a low enough amount to prevent
 
01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:09.349 align:start position:0%
think is a low enough amount to prevent
the

01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:09.359 --> 01:01:11.270 align:start position:0%
the
um

01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
to prevent uh
 
01:01:13.319 --> 01:01:15.030 align:start position:0%
to prevent uh
incentivizing

01:01:15.030 --> 01:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
incentivizing
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
this kind of behavior in a way that has
 
01:01:19.270 --> 01:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
led to the current situation where this
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
person owns a majority of units or
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
significant amount of units in 12
 
01:01:24.390 --> 01:01:24.400 align:start position:0%
different associations all of which are
 
01:01:27.589 --> 01:01:27.599 align:start position:0%
around the same size and owns this giant
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh property management company and is
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
just essentially making money hand over
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
fist and i happen to know what happens
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
to be well into the millions
 
01:01:38.789 --> 01:01:38.799 align:start position:0%
because um he has this kind of conflict
 
01:01:40.870 --> 01:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
of interest business model
 
01:01:43.030 --> 01:01:43.040 align:start position:0%
well would you believe that
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
for the question require i'm sorry thank
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
would you believe that the committee is
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
hesitant to put dollar amounts on into
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
law because they don't stand up over
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
long periods of time
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
i would believe it i'm only suggesting
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
um just as this committee was creative
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
enough to come up with an amendment that
 
01:02:03.990 --> 01:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
made everybody happy that perhaps
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
considering the fact
 
01:02:08.630 --> 01:02:08.640 align:start position:0%
that a person of that kind of power that
 
01:02:10.150 --> 01:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
i'm talking about might be able to
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
influence board members even if they
 
01:02:14.309 --> 01:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
themselves are recused might also be an
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
issue so perhaps like you first
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
suggested instead of a dollar amount
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
putting a size restriction
 
01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.309 align:start position:0%
putting a size restriction
um

01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:22.319 --> 01:02:23.670 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
if they're under that size restriction
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
having them recused if they're over that
 
01:02:28.950 --> 01:02:28.960 align:start position:0%
size restriction having it just they
 
01:02:31.270 --> 01:02:31.280 align:start position:0%
can't contract out
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
that would also be a totally fine
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment in my opinion
 
01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:36.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
representative burroughs has a question
 
01:02:41.510 --> 01:02:41.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
representative reed um how widespread is
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
this problem i know you're talking about
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
a constituent in a particular individual
 
01:02:51.030 --> 01:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
using this business model um does this
 
01:02:52.789 --> 01:02:52.799 align:start position:0%
extend beyond this individual do you
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
have information
 
01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't have any information to that
 
01:02:58.390 --> 01:02:58.400 align:start position:0%
this is all i've been able this was
 
01:02:59.910 --> 01:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
again brought to me by constituents
 
01:03:01.349 --> 01:03:01.359 align:start position:0%
something i was unaware of in my own
 
01:03:03.190 --> 01:03:03.200 align:start position:0%
town and
 
01:03:06.470 --> 01:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
because uh i'm engaging
 
01:03:08.710 --> 01:03:08.720 align:start position:0%
in this issue through this very specific
 
01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:10.720 align:start position:0%
problem i haven't i don't have any
 
01:03:13.430 --> 01:03:13.440 align:start position:0%
knowledge or even a way to know how to
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
gain the knowledge of it being a problem
 
01:03:18.390 --> 01:03:18.400 align:start position:0%
with other individuals um
 
01:03:19.910 --> 01:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
having said that it's just good conflict
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
of interest policy right this is a basic
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
thing that we believe in that you can't
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
vote on the
 
01:03:28.390 --> 01:03:28.400 align:start position:0%
board or entity that then awards the
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
contract for your own business that's
 
01:03:31.990 --> 01:03:32.000 align:start position:0%
just standard for us
 
01:03:33.910 --> 01:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up please for the question
 
01:03:36.630 --> 01:03:36.640 align:start position:0%
inquire yes thank you um
 
01:03:39.829 --> 01:03:39.839 align:start position:0%
might it not make sense for this issue
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
to be dealt with in the condominium's
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.870 --> 01:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:03:50.789 --> 01:03:50.799 align:start position:0%
it could be but i suppose the problem
 
01:03:51.910 --> 01:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
that you're running into is once
 
01:03:53.750 --> 01:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has that level of power you're
 
01:03:55.109 --> 01:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
running into the same conflict of
 
01:03:57.270 --> 01:03:57.280 align:start position:0%
interest problem how can you then amend
 
01:03:59.190 --> 01:03:59.200 align:start position:0%
the bylaws if the people who are voting
 
01:04:00.390 --> 01:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
for it are
 
01:04:02.549 --> 01:04:02.559 align:start position:0%
in majority the one so you were talking
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
about in this particular situation
 
01:04:05.589 --> 01:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
majority owner
 
01:04:07.990 --> 01:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
so if if they own the majority of units
 
01:04:09.990 --> 01:04:10.000 align:start position:0%
they have majority control in the vote
 
01:04:11.349 --> 01:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
and how can you possibly amend the
 
01:04:11.359 --> 01:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
and how can you possibly amend the
bylaws

01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
bylaws
 
01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:14.720 align:start position:0%
against that person's will
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for that
 
01:04:17.510 --> 01:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
big point
 
01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.589 align:start position:0%
big point
representative

01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:21.829 --> 01:04:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for uh
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:04:25.589 --> 01:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
uh so this bill was thoroughly reviewed
 
01:04:27.910 --> 01:04:27.920 align:start position:0%
by this committee it was a last term it
 
01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like correct
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
what analysis was done
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
as far as other states having similar
 
01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.029 align:start position:0%
as far as other states having similar
provisions

01:04:39.029 --> 01:04:39.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:41.270 --> 01:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
i personally didn't do any analysis if
 
01:04:44.069 --> 01:04:44.079 align:start position:0%
this committee did such an analysis uh
 
01:04:44.079 --> 01:04:44.950 align:start position:0%
this committee did such an analysis uh
then

01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:47.599 align:start position:0%
that would be a question for the
 
01:04:53.029 --> 01:04:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no more questions we
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:04:59.109 --> 01:04:59.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:59.119 --> 01:05:00.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

01:05:00.870 --> 01:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:03.029 --> 01:05:03.039 align:start position:0%
i know okay so i don't have anybody else
 
01:05:06.150 --> 01:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
in support so uh dean lennon i know i
 
01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
kept you up here so dean you want to
 
01:05:14.069 --> 01:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative hunt um
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
my primary concern with this bill is
 
01:05:22.950 --> 01:05:22.960 align:start position:0%
that unit owners are not um select or
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
not approving contractors that that's a
 
01:05:26.470 --> 01:05:26.480 align:start position:0%
job by the board
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
uh unit owners are voting on amendments
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
unit owners are electing people unit
 
01:05:32.069 --> 01:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
owners are
 
01:05:32.079 --> 01:05:34.789 align:start position:0%
owners are
um

01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
you know sometimes making improvement
 
01:05:38.950 --> 01:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
votes but they are not
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
picking the plowing contract or they're
 
01:05:43.349 --> 01:05:43.359 align:start position:0%
not picking the roofing contractor so
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
uh that that's concern number one does
 
01:05:48.150 --> 01:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
this law even do anything uh the second
 
01:05:51.270 --> 01:05:51.280 align:start position:0%
concern would be that the proposal is to
 
01:05:53.510 --> 01:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislate a very unique issue that's
 
01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.549 align:start position:0%
legislate a very unique issue that's
happening

01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
at one condo and i don't think laws
 
01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
should be made based on situations such
 
01:06:01.910 --> 01:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
as that uh assuming everything is true
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
about this condo and one owner having
 
01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
all the units does that mean the whole
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
state should have to abide by this
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
uh this law as a result
 
01:06:13.750 --> 01:06:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh and additionally when someone owns
 
01:06:15.430 --> 01:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
all these units it's like having a lot
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
of stock in a company
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
are we going to take away that person's
 
01:06:22.870 --> 01:06:22.880 align:start position:0%
uh voting power just because we're
 
01:06:24.470 --> 01:06:24.480 align:start position:0%
worried about what they're going to do
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
it's un-american for one thing and it's
 
01:06:28.390 --> 01:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
probably unconstitutional i think if
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
someone has all that voting interest
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
what can we really do about that
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
should someone who owns a majority
 
01:06:37.670 --> 01:06:37.680 align:start position:0%
interest be forced to
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
have the minority voting interest decide
 
01:06:42.309 --> 01:06:42.319 align:start position:0%
everything that happens at that condo uh
 
01:06:47.029 --> 01:06:47.039 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense to me from a
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
constitutional perspective or or
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
one of a property rights perspective and
 
01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
i'll limit my comments there thank you
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
we do have questions if you're willing
 
01:06:59.270 --> 01:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
to take something oh absolutely
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:09.990 --> 01:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
there okay um
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
yes uh technology sometimes slows us
 
01:07:16.390 --> 01:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
down here uh finding the right button uh
 
01:07:18.710 --> 01:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
mr lennon thank you for your uh your
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and uh i do have a question
 
01:07:24.470 --> 01:07:24.480 align:start position:0%
what kinds of protections against
 
01:07:27.910 --> 01:07:27.920 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest would you feel are
 
01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate for uh for condominium
 
01:07:30.720 --> 01:07:33.670 align:start position:0%
appropriate for uh for condominium
associations

01:07:33.670 --> 01:07:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
well certainly disclosure i think would
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
be the key you know if if again you know
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
you're talking about on a board level so
 
01:07:43.510 --> 01:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
if a board member
 
01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:45.280 align:start position:0%
is bidding on the plowing contract
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
everyone at that table five people three
 
01:07:50.309 --> 01:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
people should know you know that it's uh
 
01:07:53.589 --> 01:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
director jones's company so
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
even a disclosure law doesn't really
 
01:07:56.470 --> 01:07:56.480 align:start position:0%
seem necessary because you're just
 
01:07:57.829 --> 01:07:57.839 align:start position:0%
talking about a small group to the
 
01:07:59.270 --> 01:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
extent that owners are voting on
 
01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:01.190 align:start position:0%
extent that owners are voting on
something

01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
something
 
01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure to the to the whole makes
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
sense because they might not know abc
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
plowing is mr jones's company
 
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:08.789 align:start position:0%
plowing is mr jones's company
um

01:08:08.789 --> 01:08:08.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:11.430 --> 01:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
other than that uh
 
01:08:13.190 --> 01:08:13.200 align:start position:0%
to me it's up to the
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
the boards to inform the electorate and
 
01:08:17.110 --> 01:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's up to the electorate to inform
 
01:08:21.110 --> 01:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative herbert you have
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.749 --> 01:08:31.759 align:start position:0%
i can't see you chris i don't know
 
01:08:33.510 --> 01:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
whether you're hearing me okay no
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
i can hear you sir thank you
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
for uh letting me uh ask a question i
 
01:08:40.709 --> 01:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
seem to not ask questions very well
 
01:08:41.990 --> 01:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:08:43.990 --> 01:08:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh would you believe
 
01:08:46.870 --> 01:08:46.880 align:start position:0%
that that that business model uh
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
should be illegal
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
in my opinion i mean i understand what
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
you're saying but uh uh how do you a
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
disclosure a disclosure is a good idea
 
01:08:58.390 --> 01:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
to me
 
01:09:01.749 --> 01:09:01.759 align:start position:0%
uh but i that to me and when they're a
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
majority owner
 
01:09:05.590 --> 01:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
in the properties because this is not a
 
01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.390 align:start position:0%
in the properties because this is not a
small

01:09:06.390 --> 01:09:06.400 align:start position:0%
small
 
01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:07.510 align:start position:0%
small
situation

01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
as the uh representative pointed out
 
01:09:12.070 --> 01:09:12.080 align:start position:0%
there are several condominium
 
01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:14.960 align:start position:0%
associations that this particular
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
business person
 
01:09:18.829 --> 01:09:18.839 align:start position:0%
has majority uh
 
01:09:21.829 --> 01:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
ownership now disclosure would be good i
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
i think that's a good idea
 
01:09:26.149 --> 01:09:26.159 align:start position:0%
but uh if in fact
 
01:09:26.159 --> 01:09:27.030 align:start position:0%
but uh if in fact
uh

01:09:27.030 --> 01:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
there is a monopoly situation exists and
 
01:09:32.789 --> 01:09:32.799 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of that there
 
01:09:35.269 --> 01:09:35.279 align:start position:0%
there is a uh
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know conflict of interest and and
 
01:09:39.910 --> 01:09:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's quite lucrative i i just was
 
01:09:42.950 --> 01:09:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh i was wondering if as as an attorney
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
uh what you would do
 
01:09:46.630 --> 01:09:46.640 align:start position:0%
in order to protect the people who are
 
01:09:54.870 --> 01:09:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
well there's you know it's a difficult
 
01:09:57.750 --> 01:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
question because there's there's
 
01:09:59.830 --> 01:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
certainly the the power of the vote you
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
can vote in a board or board members
 
01:10:05.110 --> 01:10:05.120 align:start position:0%
to represent you know the minority
 
01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:07.520 align:start position:0%
interest but
 
01:10:09.830 --> 01:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know if you acquire a whole bunch of
 
01:10:11.990 --> 01:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
units that gives you
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
certain power gives you certain
 
01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:14.870 align:start position:0%
certain power gives you certain
abilities

01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
abilities
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
and i'm not sure we should legislate
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
those abilities away if you can scoop up
 
01:10:21.030 --> 01:10:21.040 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of google stock
 
01:10:22.470 --> 01:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't you have say in what that
 
01:10:24.709 --> 01:10:24.719 align:start position:0%
company does otherwise what's the point
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
of owning the stock
 
01:10:28.630 --> 01:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
so i i think you have severe
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional issues when you're
 
01:10:32.950 --> 01:10:32.960 align:start position:0%
telling someone who owns a large portion
 
01:10:35.750 --> 01:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
of something that they're not allowed to
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%
exert some influence
 
01:10:37.679 --> 01:10:39.750 align:start position:0%
exert some influence
um

01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
i i just
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
i keep on saying it's un-american i'm
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
not sure there's any other way to say it
 
01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
but if you own a lot of something you
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
have the right to control it and perhaps
 
01:10:52.870 --> 01:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
people shouldn't buy there uh if if they
 
01:10:55.270 --> 01:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
re you know if they don't want to cede
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
control to someone who who owns the
 
01:10:57.520 --> 01:11:00.550 align:start position:0%
control to someone who who owns the
majority

01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:03.430 --> 01:11:03.440 align:start position:0%
okay you all said chris
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes chairman thank you very much
 
01:11:17.350 --> 01:11:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
i'm here i'm sorry about that
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
i i got two mute buttons
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
just in case
 
01:11:30.070 --> 01:11:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my questions
 
01:11:33.030 --> 01:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um my question uh
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
relates to
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
having a majority interest
 
01:11:36.880 --> 01:11:38.070 align:start position:0%
having a majority interest
in

01:11:38.070 --> 01:11:38.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:11:39.990 --> 01:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
let's say a hundred unit condo let's say
 
01:11:41.830 --> 01:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
i own 60
 
01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:44.640 align:start position:0%
60 units in that 100 unit
 
01:11:44.640 --> 01:11:46.070 align:start position:0%
60 units in that 100 unit
building

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:11:48.870 --> 01:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
aren't i incentivized to
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
maintain that property so that
 
01:11:55.270 --> 01:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
my units maintain their value because if
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
if the value goes down in other units
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's a comparable
 
01:12:00.790 --> 01:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's a
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
real estate comp and uh i would lose
 
01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:05.030 align:start position:0%
real estate comp and uh i would lose
money

01:12:05.030 --> 01:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:12:07.590 --> 01:12:07.600 align:start position:0%
uh on my unit so aren't i incentivized
 
01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:09.350 align:start position:0%
uh on my unit so aren't i incentivized
to

01:12:09.350 --> 01:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:12:11.590 --> 01:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
you know provide for the best interest
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
i i certainly see it that way you have
 
01:12:18.630 --> 01:12:18.640 align:start position:0%
every incentive
 
01:12:20.229 --> 01:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps more than anyone else you want
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
to see these property values rise so
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
i totally agree with that and i wish i
 
01:12:28.470 --> 01:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative abramson
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:12:34.790 --> 01:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:12:36.950 --> 01:12:36.960 align:start position:0%
i've got quite a few people who do both
 
01:12:38.709 --> 01:12:38.719 align:start position:0%
plow business
 
01:12:38.719 --> 01:12:39.590 align:start position:0%
plow business
in

01:12:39.590 --> 01:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:12:42.229 --> 01:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
seabrook and they do something else
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
if somebody is a very successful plow
 
01:12:45.990 --> 01:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
business or even if they have a fleet of
 
01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:47.030 align:start position:0%
business or even if they have a fleet of
trucks

01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
trucks
 
01:12:49.189 --> 01:12:49.199 align:start position:0%
plow trucks would it be
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they want to be able to buy
 
01:12:55.830 --> 01:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
condos and apartments and things like
 
01:12:58.310 --> 01:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
that and take advantage of the savings
 
01:13:02.830 --> 01:13:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
internally that sounds like what you
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
believe question
 
01:13:08.470 --> 01:13:08.480 align:start position:0%
well it is i mean it's throwing it out
 
01:13:11.270 --> 01:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
there in case he has a
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
01:13:14.550 --> 01:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i think when you're
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
when you're performing work for
 
01:13:20.550 --> 01:13:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.390 --> 01:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
you want to do a good job you know
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to answer to your
 
01:13:27.350 --> 01:13:27.360 align:start position:0%
your neighbors perhaps your friends
 
01:13:29.430 --> 01:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
the idea is to do the best job possible
 
01:13:31.110 --> 01:13:31.120 align:start position:0%
if if you're doing the work for your own
 
01:13:32.470 --> 01:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
buildings you want people to slip and
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
fall of course you don't because as a
 
01:13:36.310 --> 01:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
majority owner you have a lot at stake
 
01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:37.750 align:start position:0%
majority owner you have a lot at stake
financially

01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
financially
 
01:13:39.590 --> 01:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
so i do think um
 
01:13:41.030 --> 01:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
i do think that's
 
01:13:43.270 --> 01:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
an incentive for the plower in this or
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
the roofer who whatever the contractor
 
01:13:48.149 --> 01:13:48.159 align:start position:0%
is um and the other on the other hand
 
01:13:50.149 --> 01:13:50.159 align:start position:0%
maybe you're going to give a better deal
 
01:13:52.470 --> 01:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
because you can afford to do that so
 
01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:53.840 align:start position:0%
the minor you know if we're talking
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
about 33 owners who aren't this majority
 
01:13:57.990 --> 01:13:58.000 align:start position:0%
owner they're going to benefit from a
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
lower price because uh the majority
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
owner can afford to do so so i think
 
01:14:04.550 --> 01:14:04.560 align:start position:0%
there can be situations where it's a
 
01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.669 align:start position:0%
there can be situations where it's a
win-win

01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
win-win
 
01:14:07.750 --> 01:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
um you know are there bad people out
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
there of course they are but there are
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
bad contractors you're going to hire
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
with a board that's totally
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
disinterested and there's no conflict so
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
i i just don't think you can legislate
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
away everything and these situations are
 
01:14:20.950 --> 01:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
so rare where there's a majority owner
 
01:14:23.990 --> 01:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
in a condo so so rare
 
01:14:25.910 --> 01:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you great thank you very
 
01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:26.950 align:start position:0%
all right thank you great thank you very
much

01:14:26.950 --> 01:14:26.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:14:30.790 --> 01:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
uh so i just promoted you uh
 
01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:32.950 align:start position:0%
uh so i just promoted you uh
lou

01:14:32.950 --> 01:14:32.960 align:start position:0%
lou
 
01:14:35.030 --> 01:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
oh i don't even see where you
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
did you get the
 
01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:39.280 align:start position:0%
i no i didn't put oh i'm sorry i didn't
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
forgot julia i did gary
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
didn't hear you over there
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm losing track of who
 
01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:48.560 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
huddy i'm here
 
01:14:51.750 --> 01:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i'll be very brief
 
01:14:56.630 --> 01:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
because frankly dean touched on several
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the points i would have made and i
 
01:15:01.270 --> 01:15:01.280 align:start position:0%
agree so i will focus primarily on just
 
01:15:02.390 --> 01:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
two points
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
um the question came up as to whether or
 
01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:06.640 align:start position:0%
not this is something that makes sense
 
01:15:08.550 --> 01:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
for associations to govern for
 
01:15:10.390 --> 01:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
themselves in their condominium
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
documents and i think the answer to that
 
01:15:16.870 --> 01:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
question is yes and in fact i have seen
 
01:15:18.709 --> 01:15:18.719 align:start position:0%
any number of sets of condominium
 
01:15:20.550 --> 01:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
documents in which this issue is
 
01:15:23.270 --> 01:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
addressed and so i think association by
 
01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
addressed and so i think association by
association

01:15:24.390 --> 01:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:15:26.470 --> 01:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
is the way for them to handle this based
 
01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.350 align:start position:0%
is the way for them to handle this based
on

01:15:27.350 --> 01:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:15:28.709 --> 01:15:28.719 align:start position:0%
what they choose to put in their
 
01:15:31.590 --> 01:15:31.600 align:start position:0%
documents the second point i would make
 
01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
is really just putting a focus on
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
something that we're talking about
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that's this notion of the majority
 
01:15:40.470 --> 01:15:40.480 align:start position:0%
owner so it's been said a number of
 
01:15:43.030 --> 01:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
times that the majority owner gets to
 
01:15:45.510 --> 01:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
vote in this contract and then because
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
it's their business
 
01:15:49.110 --> 01:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
they are now just making all of this
 
01:15:49.120 --> 01:15:50.070 align:start position:0%
they are now just making all of this
money

01:15:50.070 --> 01:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:15:52.630 --> 01:15:52.640 align:start position:0%
well um again consider that the way a
 
01:15:55.510 --> 01:15:55.520 align:start position:0%
condominium works for each unit that you
 
01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:56.310 align:start position:0%
condominium works for each unit that you
own

01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:15:57.750 --> 01:15:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're responsible for paying the
 
01:15:59.350 --> 01:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
condominium fee
 
01:16:01.030 --> 01:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
so if you're talking about someone who
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
owns a majority of the units in an
 
01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:05.679 align:start position:0%
association they're paying the condo fee
 
01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:08.640 align:start position:0%
on each of those units which means their
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
money is the majority of the
 
01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
association's total budget at the end of
 
01:16:14.390 --> 01:16:14.400 align:start position:0%
the day
 
01:16:16.470 --> 01:16:16.480 align:start position:0%
and so in effect you know whether they
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
contract with their own company or
 
01:16:20.550 --> 01:16:20.560 align:start position:0%
otherwise what the association is
 
01:16:22.709 --> 01:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
spending when the association spends its
 
01:16:22.719 --> 01:16:23.590 align:start position:0%
spending when the association spends its
money

01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:16:25.910 --> 01:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
is mostly the money of that majority
 
01:16:28.470 --> 01:16:28.480 align:start position:0%
owner um so i just want to clarify that
 
01:16:31.990 --> 01:16:32.000 align:start position:0%
it's not sort of like profit in a vacuum
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
um to the extent that that the owner is
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
wearing both hats and their company is
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
getting paid to do the job it's mostly
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
their money that's paying that company
 
01:16:42.790 --> 01:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
because they're paying the condo fee on
 
01:16:44.790 --> 01:16:44.800 align:start position:0%
each of those units that they own
 
01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:45.910 align:start position:0%
each of those units that they own
um

01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:48.229 --> 01:16:48.239 align:start position:0%
beyond that i i will uh in the interest
 
01:16:50.470 --> 01:16:50.480 align:start position:0%
of time uh let you move on i know there
 
01:16:53.350 --> 01:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.350 --> 01:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay i have no more questions and uh so
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh zulu
 
01:17:02.790 --> 01:17:02.800 align:start position:0%
they promoted you and you're all set
 
01:17:04.390 --> 01:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hunt and thank
 
01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hunt and thank
you

01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:08.270 --> 01:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
members for allowing me to speak on hb
 
01:17:11.910 --> 01:17:11.920 align:start position:0%
466. my name is lou gargiulo i've been
 
01:17:13.510 --> 01:17:13.520 align:start position:0%
involved in new hampshire condominium
 
01:17:16.630 --> 01:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
associations for 35 years i purchased my
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
first unit in hampton in 1986.
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
over the years i've served in multiple
 
01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
capacities as a unit owner a board
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
member a property manager and yes a ceo
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
of a large management firm based in new
 
01:17:32.470 --> 01:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire that employs more than 150
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
employees i also served in the general
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
court and understand how important your
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
role is in enacting the best thought out
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
laws for the people of new hampshire
 
01:17:43.910 --> 01:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
for the members not familiar with
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
condominiums although i think a lot of
 
01:17:48.310 --> 01:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
you have become more familiar today
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
condominiums associations are governed
 
01:17:53.590 --> 01:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
by an elected board of of directors that
 
01:17:55.270 --> 01:17:55.280 align:start position:0%
board is chosen through an election
 
01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:56.310 align:start position:0%
board is chosen through an election
process

01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:17:59.430 --> 01:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
each condominium unit has one vote and
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
the board members serve for a period
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
dictated by the association's
 
01:18:06.070 --> 01:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
condominium documents that board is
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
charged with ensuring the best insuring
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
the business of the association uh and
 
01:18:13.030 --> 01:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
that they act in the best interest of
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
the association members
 
01:18:17.669 --> 01:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
and for your information an association
 
01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
member is not a tenant unfortunately
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
representative reed i don't think
 
01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:26.719 align:start position:0%
understands that the association members
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
are those who own units in that
 
01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:31.350 align:start position:0%
are those who own units in that
association

01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:18:33.750 --> 01:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
i am here today because i oppose this
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
bill for a host of reasons
 
01:18:38.229 --> 01:18:38.239 align:start position:0%
it strips away the rights of a unit
 
01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
owner who may or may not be a board
 
01:18:44.149 --> 01:18:44.159 align:start position:0%
member from voting on contractual issues
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
because they provide a service in an
 
01:18:49.590 --> 01:18:49.600 align:start position:0%
association in some situations an owner
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
may own a large group of units and this
 
01:18:54.470 --> 01:18:54.480 align:start position:0%
bill will allow the minority group of
 
01:18:56.790 --> 01:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
units to control an owner who owns the
 
01:18:59.590 --> 01:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
majority of units it will strip away the
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
fundamental proposition of one unit one
 
01:19:05.030 --> 01:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
vote please keep in mind that the
 
01:19:07.510 --> 01:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
majority owner as said earlier pays a
 
01:19:10.790 --> 01:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
majority of the expenses and this bill
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
they will lose the right to have their
 
01:19:12.719 --> 01:19:13.590 align:start position:0%
they will lose the right to have their
say

01:19:13.590 --> 01:19:13.600 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
on its face i believe the bill is
 
01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:17.590 align:start position:0%
on its face i believe the bill is
unconstitutional

01:19:17.590 --> 01:19:17.600 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
it uh deprives individuals of
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
contractual rights established in the
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
condominium documents and it
 
01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:26.480 align:start position:0%
discriminates against them because they
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
are a service provider and a unit owner
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
in addition only a select few of
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
providers are being targeted why not the
 
01:19:36.950 --> 01:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
insurance agent the lawyer the
 
01:19:39.430 --> 01:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
structural engineer or anyone else who
 
01:19:41.990 --> 01:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
provides a service to the association
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
i can answer that question pretty
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
clearly this bill was introduced as an
 
01:19:49.510 --> 01:19:49.520 align:start position:0%
affront to one particular individual
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
folks that's me
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
i am not a huge business i am not a huge
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
unit owner but i do own units at a
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
variety of locations i've worked hard in
 
01:20:04.149 --> 01:20:04.159 align:start position:0%
my life and have built a significant
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
portfolio i should not be penalized and
 
01:20:09.990 --> 01:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
my constitutional rights should not be
 
01:20:12.229 --> 01:20:12.239 align:start position:0%
stripped away because of one
 
01:20:14.950 --> 01:20:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative who has a vendetta who
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
does not even own a unit in that
 
01:20:19.990 --> 01:20:20.000 align:start position:0%
particular property she's a tenant there
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i love tenants i can assure you i do
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
but they don't have a say in what goes
 
01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
on it's the unit owners and in the
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
association that she is referencing the
 
01:20:34.390 --> 01:20:34.400 align:start position:0%
unit owners have clear understanding
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
there is no conflict the conflict only
 
01:20:39.270 --> 01:20:39.280 align:start position:0%
exists when it's not disclosed and
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
everyone knows about who owns a unit who
 
01:20:45.910 --> 01:20:45.920 align:start position:0%
manages the property with that said i'd
 
01:20:47.510 --> 01:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
open it up to any of you for any
 
01:20:50.870 --> 01:20:50.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
representative abramson has a question
 
01:20:55.110 --> 01:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%

representative gargiulo for coming in to
testify

01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
testify
 
01:21:01.430 --> 01:21:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh you said that you own quite a few or
 
01:21:04.390 --> 01:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
you have quite a few properties uh i do
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
you also provide uh some of the services
 
01:21:09.110 --> 01:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
for those properties like plowing
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
no we don't provide plowing but we do
 
01:21:14.390 --> 01:21:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide property management just so that
 
01:21:17.030 --> 01:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
you understand the scale we manage more
 
01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:21.199 align:start position:0%
than 350 associations across new england
 
01:21:24.390 --> 01:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
uh i own units large numbers and about
 
01:21:27.669 --> 01:21:27.679 align:start position:0%
four associations uh so
 
01:21:30.070 --> 01:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
so that the information is correct for
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
the record
 
01:21:33.189 --> 01:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
your testimony
 
01:21:40.310 --> 01:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh so that is it for speakers um
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%

senator tom sherman is in support of the
bill

01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
on house bill 466 and thank you all
 
01:21:57.189 --> 01:21:57.199 align:start position:0%
okay i think we're
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
probably doing on scheduling here
 
01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:01.590 align:start position:0%
probably doing on scheduling here
uh

01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:03.750 align:start position:0%
uh
ooh

01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
ooh
 
01:22:05.910 --> 01:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
i got four minutes
 
01:22:09.590 --> 01:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
nice time good work
 
01:22:12.550 --> 01:22:12.560 align:start position:0%
um i i as uh someone who was uh
 
01:22:14.870 --> 01:22:14.880 align:start position:0%
in in the committee last year just so
 
01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
you know that language the canary
 
01:22:20.229 --> 01:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
benefit language uh was lifted from
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that i worked on many many
 
01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
01:22:25.830 --> 01:22:25.840 align:start position:0%
which is for non-profits
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
and that if you are on the board of a
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
non-profit and you do any activity with
 
01:22:32.629 --> 01:22:32.639 align:start position:0%
that non-profit
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
that's considered a bikinary benefit
 
01:22:36.790 --> 01:22:36.800 align:start position:0%
that's where the language comes from and
 
01:22:39.669 --> 01:22:39.679 align:start position:0%
there are dollar amounts listed there um
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
but if it's less than five dollars
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
all you have to do is make sure the
 
01:22:45.270 --> 01:22:45.280 align:start position:0%
person's not in the room but that if it
 
01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
gets over 500 or i think it's up to if
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's over 2500
 
01:22:52.229 --> 01:22:52.239 align:start position:0%
um you have to print it in the newspaper
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
that a board member of a non-profit had
 
01:22:57.910 --> 01:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
a has the beginner identification
 
01:22:59.669 --> 01:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
so that's where that all that language
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
came from
 
01:23:02.159 --> 01:23:03.270 align:start position:0%
came from
okay

01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:06.390 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:06.400 --> 01:23:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:18.229 --> 01:23:18.239 align:start position:0%
so so pam i have a question for you
 
01:23:20.790 --> 01:23:20.800 align:start position:0%
um you know when you send you send these
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
speakers and stuff to me you don't you
 
01:23:23.910 --> 01:23:23.920 align:start position:0%
don't send it to the committee members
 
01:23:25.270 --> 01:23:25.280 align:start position:0%
right i'm the only one who gets these
 
01:23:29.189 --> 01:23:29.199 align:start position:0%
things i send them to you and the clerk
 
01:23:30.870 --> 01:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
because some i was thinking especially
 
01:23:32.669 --> 01:23:32.679 align:start position:0%
when i had that one that had
 
01:23:36.070 --> 01:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
233 people and it might be helpful to be
 
01:23:37.189 --> 01:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
sending them to the members of the
 
01:23:38.629 --> 01:23:38.639 align:start position:0%
committee too because theoretically it's
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
public information it normally would
 
01:23:41.910 --> 01:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
have been stuck in the folder when you
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
have the blue sheet and the files so i
 
01:23:44.320 --> 01:23:45.669 align:start position:0%
have the blue sheet and the files so i
don't know

01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:23:47.110 --> 01:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
is there any been talking about making
 
01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:48.800 align:start position:0%
passing this on to the committee members
 
01:23:51.350 --> 01:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
also so there has been talk about that i
 
01:23:54.470 --> 01:23:54.480 align:start position:0%
have not heard um the resolution of that
 
01:23:54.480 --> 01:23:55.189 align:start position:0%
have not heard um the resolution of that
okay

01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:55.199 --> 01:23:56.390 align:start position:0%
okay
discussion

01:23:56.390 --> 01:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:23:57.910 --> 01:23:57.920 align:start position:0%
you can put in my word i think it's a
 
01:23:59.910 --> 01:23:59.920 align:start position:0%
good idea to demand it
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
that way
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
read it because then they could go read
 
01:24:04.149 --> 01:24:04.159 align:start position:0%
it for themselves but yeah before the
 
01:24:06.229 --> 01:24:06.239 align:start position:0%
long ones i think the idea was that
 
01:24:09.270 --> 01:24:09.280 align:start position:0%
you'd have at least the totals you know
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
yes i've already said you wouldn't want
 
01:24:14.070 --> 01:24:14.080 align:start position:0%
to read 100 names you know people would
 
01:24:15.669 --> 01:24:15.679 align:start position:0%
glaze over anyway you know that you
 
01:24:17.270 --> 01:24:17.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to absorb
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
how many were in favor and against just
 
01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:20.629 align:start position:0%
how many were in favor and against just
by

01:24:20.629 --> 01:24:20.639 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:24:21.910 --> 01:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
but i think people might like to see
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
who's on the list too oh yeah no i
 
01:24:24.790 --> 01:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying i'm just
 
01:24:26.870 --> 01:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
saying that that's one
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
innovation that that has been made
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
lately you know we are adapting
 
01:24:33.830 --> 01:24:33.840 align:start position:0%
um just about every day here
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's a moving target it's great
 
01:24:38.070 --> 01:24:38.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing that up mr chair
 
01:24:39.430 --> 01:24:39.440 align:start position:0%
i think that we would all appreciate it
 
01:24:42.390 --> 01:24:42.400 align:start position:0%
it's all electronic anyway all the time
 
01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh i would i would say yeah you have to
 
01:24:47.110 --> 01:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
be uh today was a little tricky pan
 
01:24:48.149 --> 01:24:48.159 align:start position:0%
because some of them did you send them
 
01:24:50.470 --> 01:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
as a pdf file or some of them i didn't
 
01:24:53.830 --> 01:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
come through clear the pdf ones are good
 
01:24:55.590 --> 01:24:55.600 align:start position:0%
if they if they come in the other ones
 
01:24:57.189 --> 01:24:57.199 align:start position:0%
they're kind of cut and paste they were
 
01:24:59.590 --> 01:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
a little fuzzy um i don't know in my
 
01:25:01.110 --> 01:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
printer today i thought they were all
 
01:25:03.910 --> 01:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
pdfs today yeah
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
well i i
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
won't put out the
 
01:25:07.679 --> 01:25:08.870 align:start position:0%
won't put out the
yes

01:25:08.870 --> 01:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
i think it maybe what happened was i
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
just tried to print the email
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
and so therefore it it has it has pdfs
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
on it and then it has
 
01:25:20.390 --> 01:25:20.400 align:start position:0%
bills that i that i can barely use
 
01:25:22.870 --> 01:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
but that but yeah you know once i i was
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
able to get them correctly by uh going
 
01:25:28.470 --> 01:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
into my pdf file and getting that
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
they don't always print the embedded uh
 
01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:33.430 align:start position:0%
they don't always print the embedded uh
documents

01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
documents
 
01:25:33.440 --> 01:25:42.709 align:start position:0%
documents
okay

01:25:42.709 --> 01:25:42.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:45.669 --> 01:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh i think um representative abramson
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
has a question for you oh yep sir yes go
 
01:25:49.910 --> 01:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
ahead max or did you still have your
 
01:25:54.149 --> 01:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
sorry no problem
 
01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay it's 10 30 so let's open up the
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
public hearing on house bill 358
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i will ask representative mcwilliams
 
01:26:10.790 --> 01:26:10.800 align:start position:0%
you just raise your hand
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
actually you don't have to i see you now
 
01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.350 align:start position:0%
actually you don't have to i see you now
okay

01:26:13.350 --> 01:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:16.070 --> 01:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm moving over
 
01:26:18.149 --> 01:26:18.159 align:start position:0%
it's a little tricky they sort the names
 
01:26:21.990 --> 01:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:24.400 align:start position:0%
a little tricky
 
01:26:25.990 --> 01:26:26.000 align:start position:0%
but i'm doing okay i think i'm doing
 
01:26:27.750 --> 01:26:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay here
 
01:26:28.950 --> 01:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
good morning representative mick
 
01:26:28.960 --> 01:26:30.149 align:start position:0%
good morning representative mick
williams

01:26:30.149 --> 01:26:30.159 align:start position:0%
williams
 
01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
good morning chair hunt can everyone
 
01:26:35.750 --> 01:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
hear me yes we can excellent
 
01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh for the record my name is
 
01:26:39.910 --> 01:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
representative rebecca mcwilliams i
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
serve in merrimack 27 which is the west
 
01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
side of concord
 
01:26:46.470 --> 01:26:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh we've got a about six inches of snow
 
01:26:46.480 --> 01:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
uh we've got a about six inches of snow
today

01:26:47.830 --> 01:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:26:48.870 --> 01:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
i'm here to basically
 
01:26:53.189 --> 01:26:53.199 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill um
 
01:26:55.830 --> 01:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
for those of you who are around in 2019
 
01:26:58.390 --> 01:26:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh this may look somewhat familiar
 
01:27:01.590 --> 01:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh this has been revised from house bill
 
01:27:05.110 --> 01:27:05.120 align:start position:0%
562 in 2019 it's been refined and
 
01:27:07.030 --> 01:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
changed with input from members of this
 
01:27:07.040 --> 01:27:08.790 align:start position:0%
changed with input from members of this
committee

01:27:08.790 --> 01:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
basically if you take a look at the bill
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's just a paragraph
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
it's really straightforward i encourage
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
you all to take a quick read of it
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
what the goal here is is to set a date
 
01:27:24.149 --> 01:27:24.159 align:start position:0%
and from this date forward we are
 
01:27:27.110 --> 01:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
removing barriers to solar installations
 
01:27:29.590 --> 01:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
on condos in new hampshire
 
01:27:32.870 --> 01:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the specific barrier that this bill
 
01:27:35.430 --> 01:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
is intended to remove
 
01:27:38.229 --> 01:27:38.239 align:start position:0%
is requiring a larger vote than a simple
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
majority in order to install solar
 
01:27:43.030 --> 01:27:43.040 align:start position:0%
on a condo
 
01:27:44.709 --> 01:27:44.719 align:start position:0%
so we're talking about if a new
 
01:27:46.790 --> 01:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
condominium is built
 
01:27:48.709 --> 01:27:48.719 align:start position:0%
say this year
 
01:27:50.470 --> 01:27:50.480 align:start position:0%
after the enacting date of this
 
01:27:53.830 --> 01:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
legislation so december 1st a new condo
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
is constructed
 
01:27:58.390 --> 01:27:58.400 align:start position:0%
everyone starts moving in and there's
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
discussion as to whether or not solar
 
01:28:02.149 --> 01:28:02.159 align:start position:0%
will be installed on this new condo uh
 
01:28:04.470 --> 01:28:04.480 align:start position:0%
well it was built and opened and the
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
bylaws went into effect after the uh
 
01:28:09.990 --> 01:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
condom the condominium statute that is
 
01:28:12.709 --> 01:28:12.719 align:start position:0%
proposed here goes online
 
01:28:15.270 --> 01:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
then they would need to vote 50
 
01:28:17.910 --> 01:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
plus one vote a simple majority in order
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
to put solar on that condo
 
01:28:23.189 --> 01:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
i've also included if you have an
 
01:28:26.390 --> 01:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
existing condominium and the
 
01:28:30.790 --> 01:28:30.800 align:start position:0%
bylaws are revised or changed and um
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
and so they're making a
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
an edit to the way that the condominium
 
01:28:36.390 --> 01:28:36.400 align:start position:0%
is being run
 
01:28:38.870 --> 01:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
then that also would trigger this uh
 
01:28:40.950 --> 01:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
statutory date meaning that if the
 
01:28:42.870 --> 01:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
bylaws were changed after the enabling
 
01:28:44.629 --> 01:28:44.639 align:start position:0%
date of this legislation then it would
 
01:28:46.870 --> 01:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
also fall under the 50
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
plus one simple majority vote in order
 
01:28:51.750 --> 01:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
to install solar on that specific
 
01:28:51.760 --> 01:28:53.270 align:start position:0%
to install solar on that specific
condominium

01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
condominium
 
01:28:55.590 --> 01:28:55.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason this is proposed is
 
01:28:55.600 --> 01:28:56.790 align:start position:0%
and the reason this is proposed is
because

01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:28:59.110 --> 01:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
there are all kinds of differing and
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
varying bylaws across the state for how
 
01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:02.870 align:start position:0%
varying bylaws across the state for how
and

01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
what is the requirement in order to make
 
01:29:08.470 --> 01:29:08.480 align:start position:0%
a vote to do a change to a common area
 
01:29:08.480 --> 01:29:09.350 align:start position:0%
a vote to do a change to a common area
and

01:29:09.350 --> 01:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
so instead of having an sort of
 
01:29:14.070 --> 01:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
hodgepodge of well this condo
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
in durham requires a three-quarters vote
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
this condo in concord requires a
 
01:29:21.750 --> 01:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
this condo in
 
01:29:26.550 --> 01:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
manchester is a simple majority it
 
01:29:28.629 --> 01:29:28.639 align:start position:0%
streamlines the process and makes it a
 
01:29:30.550 --> 01:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
simple majority when you're voting about
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
installing solar
 
01:29:34.149 --> 01:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
so that's really the intention is to
 
01:29:36.550 --> 01:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
remove barriers as of a date certain
 
01:29:39.430 --> 01:29:39.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward you would still obviously
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
need to have that vote and get enough
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
votes this is not
 
01:29:44.390 --> 01:29:44.400 align:start position:0%
bullying something through the system
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
it's just changing the vote requirement
 
01:29:50.229 --> 01:29:50.239 align:start position:0%
globally for all of new hampshire condos
 
01:29:54.390 --> 01:29:54.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative van halton has a
 
01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.350 align:start position:0%
okay representative van halton has a
question

01:29:57.350 --> 01:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:58.709 --> 01:29:58.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
representative for being with us i just
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
have a question about the clarity of the
 
01:30:05.270 --> 01:30:05.280 align:start position:0%
language does this say that and i i've
 
01:30:07.590 --> 01:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
disclosed that i am a condo owner does
 
01:30:10.310 --> 01:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
this say that if i wish to put up
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
a system myself
 
01:30:14.550 --> 01:30:14.560 align:start position:0%
i would have to get
 
01:30:18.790 --> 01:30:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
for my unit and then if the person next
 
01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:22.800 align:start position:0%
to me wants to put one up that has to go
 
01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
through the process again
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
the way it is written and i'm looking at
 
01:30:30.390 --> 01:30:30.400 align:start position:0%
the language that you're also looking at
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:35.669 --> 01:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
no condominium shall require a vote of
 
01:30:37.750 --> 01:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
the unit owners of greater than a simple
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
majority to consent to the installation
 
01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
and operation of a solar photovoltaic
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
energy system in or on a unit so that's
 
01:30:47.590 --> 01:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
the piece that you're talking about um
 
01:30:49.030 --> 01:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
am i correct in assuming that you
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
actually have sort of detached buildings
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
that you would be talking about doing a
 
01:30:56.070 --> 01:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
solo solar install on your own roof
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
well i actually now live in a detached
 
01:30:59.830 --> 01:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
building my question is is basically
 
01:31:02.070 --> 01:31:02.080 align:start position:0%
does each individual unit owner have to
 
01:31:04.310 --> 01:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
go for a vote before the board
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
so that i could get a vote of yes if i
 
01:31:08.390 --> 01:31:08.400 align:start position:0%
lived in a detached unit or even if i
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
lived in a uh in a community building
 
01:31:13.350 --> 01:31:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh and then the next unit
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
next door to me would have to go in
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
other words is this just an individual
 
01:31:19.350 --> 01:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
vote per unit owner
 
01:31:21.910 --> 01:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
the way it's written it does appear that
 
01:31:24.470 --> 01:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
it would be for the
 
01:31:27.590 --> 01:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
solar photovoltaic energy system right
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
so what are we defining as the solar
 
01:31:31.590 --> 01:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
photovoltaic energy system if you're
 
01:31:34.310 --> 01:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
just proposing installing solar panels
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
on one rooftop
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not saying that that's a good use of
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
time or money generally solar would be
 
01:31:42.950 --> 01:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
much more efficient in bulk
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
but if that were the proposal then
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
that's how it would be handled according
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
to this bill
 
01:31:50.390 --> 01:31:50.400 align:start position:0%
um the way it's written
 
01:31:52.470 --> 01:31:52.480 align:start position:0%
but i would i would kind of push back on
 
01:31:54.870 --> 01:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
your question and say generally if you
 
01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:55.750 align:start position:0%
your question and say generally if you
have

01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:31:58.470 --> 01:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
a proposed solar project
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
it would be for
 
01:32:03.189 --> 01:32:03.199 align:start position:0%
a rather large area because there is a
 
01:32:06.310 --> 01:32:06.320 align:start position:0%
huge benefit in doing it all at once
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
so i'm i'm questioning where that would
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
actually happen that there's just one
 
01:32:11.990 --> 01:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
rooftop with proposed solar and everyone
 
01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
votes for that rooftop yes another
 
01:32:15.990 --> 01:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
rooftop with proposed solar later
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
everyone votes against that other
 
01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:19.750 align:start position:0%
everyone votes against that other
rooftop

01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
rooftop
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much i'm um
 
01:32:23.669 --> 01:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
and i guess that's just my question do
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
we have to keep voting over and over or
 
01:32:27.350 --> 01:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
do we have a blanket
 
01:32:29.750 --> 01:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
uh statement that any kind of vote has
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
simple majority greater than the simple
 
01:32:34.470 --> 01:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
majority and doesn't have to keep going
 
01:32:36.950 --> 01:32:36.960 align:start position:0%
back to the board and to the the condo
 
01:32:36.960 --> 01:32:39.189 align:start position:0%
back to the board and to the the condo
owners

01:32:39.189 --> 01:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
owners
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's for the energy system meaning the
 
01:32:43.030 --> 01:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
project if there's one project it's one
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
vote if there are two projects proposed
 
01:32:46.870 --> 01:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
or phased it would be two votes excuse
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
me so if we want to put in a solar
 
01:32:51.510 --> 01:32:51.520 align:start position:0%
system say in the clubhouse
 
01:32:53.750 --> 01:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
um that would be one vote simple
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
majority if we wanted to do that for
 
01:32:56.239 --> 01:32:57.430 align:start position:0%
majority if we wanted to do that for
another

01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:32:59.189 --> 01:32:59.199 align:start position:0%
community building that we
 
01:33:01.430 --> 01:33:01.440 align:start position:0%
set up an indoor tennis court
 
01:33:02.709 --> 01:33:02.719 align:start position:0%
we would have to vote for that
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
separately am i correct
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
if they're being installed in two
 
01:33:08.790 --> 01:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
different phases
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
with two different contractors
 
01:33:12.550 --> 01:33:12.560 align:start position:0%
potentially then the answer is yes if
 
01:33:14.149 --> 01:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
they're being installed in one phase
 
01:33:16.390 --> 01:33:16.400 align:start position:0%
with one contractor it would be one
 
01:33:16.400 --> 01:33:17.669 align:start position:0%
with one contractor it would be one
project

01:33:17.669 --> 01:33:17.679 align:start position:0%
project
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
so this really i'm sorry may i follow
 
01:33:20.950 --> 01:33:20.960 align:start position:0%
the question yes
 
01:33:23.110 --> 01:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so this really has nothing to
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
do with the individual condo unit
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
it's for a much larger project am i
 
01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.470 align:start position:0%
it's for a much larger project am i
correct

01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:33.430 --> 01:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
understanding the economics of scale
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
i would expect that yes that is true
 
01:33:38.709 --> 01:33:38.719 align:start position:0%
it's for a much larger project however
 
01:33:41.990 --> 01:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
if you have individual say townhomes
 
01:33:44.070 --> 01:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
with one or two units in the townhomes
 
01:33:46.310 --> 01:33:46.320 align:start position:0%
and they're scattered about a campus
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
and we're only talking about doing solar
 
01:33:50.629 --> 01:33:50.639 align:start position:0%
on the south facing rooftops in the
 
01:33:50.639 --> 01:33:51.669 align:start position:0%
on the south facing rooftops in the
campus

01:33:51.669 --> 01:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
campus
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
so it's multiple projects perhaps with
 
01:33:57.830 --> 01:33:57.840 align:start position:0%
just one unit owner then this would also
 
01:34:00.310 --> 01:34:00.320 align:start position:0%
cover that scenario
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
thank you that helps a great deal
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you uh chairman hunt
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh just following on so i get i
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
understand what uh you have in mind with
 
01:34:19.110 --> 01:34:19.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation is that
 
01:34:22.629 --> 01:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
uh just by definition of the uh putting
 
01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:25.280 align:start position:0%
in a solar installation
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's not likely that
 
01:34:31.510 --> 01:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
say there's a 200 unit
 
01:34:33.270 --> 01:34:33.280 align:start position:0%
condominium association and there's
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
three buildings
 
01:34:37.430 --> 01:34:37.440 align:start position:0%
right and they're like three stories
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
and all everything is common the common
 
01:34:42.310 --> 01:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
roof on every one of those
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh buildings is uh
 
01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:46.629 align:start position:0%
uh buildings is uh
uh

01:34:46.629 --> 01:34:46.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:34:49.110 --> 01:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
shared it's a community uh you know
 
01:34:53.830 --> 01:34:53.840 align:start position:0%
community owned so it by definition
 
01:34:56.629 --> 01:34:56.639 align:start position:0%
follow i i'm trying to get this straight
 
01:34:56.639 --> 01:34:57.510 align:start position:0%
follow i i'm trying to get this straight
if

01:34:57.510 --> 01:34:57.520 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:34:59.270 --> 01:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
a majority vote
 
01:35:02.550 --> 01:35:02.560 align:start position:0%
of the condo condominium association
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
would was to put in solar
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
that would be one vote and all three
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
buildings would get a solar installation
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
as a as an operational reality
 
01:35:16.870 --> 01:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
right nobody's gonna nobody's gonna
 
01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:18.310 align:start position:0%
right nobody's gonna nobody's gonna
allow

01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.430 align:start position:0%
allow
uh

01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
in that kind of a condominium
 
01:35:24.310 --> 01:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
association allow one unit to put in the
 
01:35:26.310 --> 01:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
solar installation on the top of that
 
01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.189 align:start position:0%
solar installation on the top of that
roof

01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
roof
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
am i am i uh you know stumbling over
 
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
am i am i uh you know stumbling over
myself

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
myself
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
so you you mentioned economies of scale
 
01:35:35.669 --> 01:35:35.679 align:start position:0%
you're good you got it that's a question
 
01:35:36.870 --> 01:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:35:40.390 --> 01:35:40.400 align:start position:0%
yes i'm trying to understand how you
 
01:35:43.110 --> 01:35:43.120 align:start position:0%
what you imagine there
 
01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:43.910 align:start position:0%
what you imagine there
so

01:35:43.910 --> 01:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:47.270 --> 01:35:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:49.350 --> 01:35:49.360 align:start position:0%
there's no way in
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
in a business proposition that unit
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
number 101
 
01:35:56.950 --> 01:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
puts solar on all three building
 
01:36:00.390 --> 01:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
rooftops to benefit unit 101
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
or even just a small installation on one
 
01:36:05.270 --> 01:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
rooftop to benefit itself
 
01:36:07.110 --> 01:36:07.120 align:start position:0%
from a business proposition this would
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
be a project where
 
01:36:12.310 --> 01:36:12.320 align:start position:0%
everyone decides that solar is a benefit
 
01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
for the entire
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
all all of the condo owners it's it's a
 
01:36:18.070 --> 01:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
benefit for everyone and so they decide
 
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
we're doing an array on one two or three
 
01:36:23.669 --> 01:36:23.679 align:start position:0%
rooftops to benefit everyone they could
 
01:36:25.510 --> 01:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
just do an array on one rooftop and
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
still benefit all three buildings it's
 
01:36:27.679 --> 01:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
still benefit all three buildings it's
possible

01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:36:31.189 --> 01:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
but it really depends on south facing
 
01:36:33.510 --> 01:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
and some other project variables about
 
01:36:35.990 --> 01:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
how much sun you actually get if it
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense to do all three rooftops
 
01:36:40.310 --> 01:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
but really the goal here is to benefit
 
01:36:44.390 --> 01:36:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:46.229 --> 01:36:46.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:36:47.830 --> 01:36:47.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:36:50.629 --> 01:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
representative mckee
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman members of the
 
01:36:53.830 --> 01:36:53.840 align:start position:0%
committee and i'm happy to come to speak
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
to you today on behalf of hb 358.
 
01:37:00.149 --> 01:37:00.159 align:start position:0%
um i actually partook in the hearings
 
01:37:01.510 --> 01:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
last time around and a lot of the
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
questions that time
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
uh were
 
01:37:07.590 --> 01:37:07.600 align:start position:0%
fixated on
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
the issues that condo associations were
 
01:37:13.590 --> 01:37:13.600 align:start position:0%
having have having around grappling with
 
01:37:17.750 --> 01:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh how to approach solar technology um
 
01:37:21.270 --> 01:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that all of that is true
 
01:37:23.669 --> 01:37:23.679 align:start position:0%
but it is also unrelated to i think the
 
01:37:26.310 --> 01:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
objective of representative mcwilliams
 
01:37:27.750 --> 01:37:27.760 align:start position:0%
efforts here
 
01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:29.600 align:start position:0%
and so the only thing that i would add
 
01:37:31.990 --> 01:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
to what she had said is that
 
01:37:33.750 --> 01:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
i think what we're doing is we're
 
01:37:35.109 --> 01:37:35.119 align:start position:0%
hearing i've been hearing from
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
constituents who've asked me for this
 
01:37:39.030 --> 01:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
they've said hey you know why can't
 
01:37:41.910 --> 01:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
condo owners simply uh be able to move
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
forward with solar projects well
 
01:37:45.750 --> 01:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
if you're in a condo you're in a
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
different type of housing but you still
 
01:37:50.310 --> 01:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
should have the option to lower your
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
electric bills if you want to invest in
 
01:37:54.229 --> 01:37:54.239 align:start position:0%
that and if you can get the other people
 
01:37:55.990 --> 01:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
who live in your neighborhood you know
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
your condo association to agree that
 
01:38:00.149 --> 01:38:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's a good investment that you'll all
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
benefit from so it's really about making
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
the option more available to people
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
because the burden of two-thirds or
 
01:38:10.629 --> 01:38:10.639 align:start position:0%
three-quarters is very significant in
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
getting people to understand
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
how the project could be of benefit or
 
01:38:16.390 --> 01:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
even getting them
 
01:38:18.629 --> 01:38:18.639 align:start position:0%
heard on a regular basis so it's really
 
01:38:21.030 --> 01:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
about adaptation
 
01:38:21.040 --> 01:38:22.390 align:start position:0%
about adaptation
um

01:38:22.390 --> 01:38:22.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:24.870 --> 01:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
and transition that we're basically
 
01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:25.910 align:start position:0%
and transition that we're basically
saying

01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
right now it's really really hard for
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
somebody to get a project even if it's
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
viable and get it over two-thirds or
 
01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.510 align:start position:0%
viable and get it over two-thirds or
three-quarters

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
three-quarters
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
when really what you're trying to do is
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that the majority of people in
 
01:38:40.709 --> 01:38:40.719 align:start position:0%
your condo association agree
 
01:38:43.590 --> 01:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
with the proposal so
 
01:38:45.510 --> 01:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
it's really to me it's about you know
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
fairness and
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
choice and um allowing people to option
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
because the option wasn't available
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
before and so i think we're just trying
 
01:38:55.350 --> 01:38:55.360 align:start position:0%
to lower the burden
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
um to just make it uh majority rule
 
01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.750 align:start position:0%
um to just make it uh majority rule
yeah

01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:39:02.950 --> 01:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
01:39:06.550 --> 01:39:06.560 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee members
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
uh seeing that
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
01:39:11.910 --> 01:39:11.920 align:start position:0%
and uh gary
 
01:39:14.229 --> 01:39:14.239 align:start position:0%
dario you're
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
you're up next
 
01:39:17.910 --> 01:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
hi uh good morning again and thanks
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
again for some time uh i will try to be
 
01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:22.390 align:start position:0%
again for some time uh i will try to be
brief

01:39:22.390 --> 01:39:22.400 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
um as is often the case
 
01:39:27.109 --> 01:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
i just feel in looking at this bill that
 
01:39:29.270 --> 01:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
once again we're looking at an issue
 
01:39:31.270 --> 01:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
that should really be governed on an
 
01:39:34.629 --> 01:39:34.639 align:start position:0%
association basis there's no reason why
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
this can't be addressed by associations
 
01:39:39.590 --> 01:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
in their own governing documents
 
01:39:41.750 --> 01:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
for many it already is
 
01:39:43.590 --> 01:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
for instance adding something to an
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
association that didn't previously exist
 
01:39:48.950 --> 01:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
triggers an improvement vote and those
 
01:39:50.870 --> 01:39:50.880 align:start position:0%
standards are already in place in the
 
01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
standards are already in place in the
documents

01:39:52.390 --> 01:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
documents
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
i would point out that the existing law
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
um and it has been this way for years is
 
01:40:00.950 --> 01:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
that as a default standard amending the
 
01:40:04.229 --> 01:40:04.239 align:start position:0%
documents requires a two-thirds vote
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
and again by statute if you're looking
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
at potentially terminating the
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
condominium so that the unit owners can
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
own the property separately or sell it
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
and cease to be in association with each
 
01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.669 align:start position:0%
and cease to be in association with each
other

01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:40:20.550 --> 01:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
by law that requires an 80 percent vote
 
01:40:22.709 --> 01:40:22.719 align:start position:0%
so the default standards that are in
 
01:40:25.750 --> 01:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
place today um tend to be something more
 
01:40:28.709 --> 01:40:28.719 align:start position:0%
than a simple majority um and i think
 
01:40:30.390 --> 01:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's for good reason because when
 
01:40:32.709 --> 01:40:32.719 align:start position:0%
you've got people living together um
 
01:40:35.189 --> 01:40:35.199 align:start position:0%
sharing the space sharing uh the
 
01:40:37.109 --> 01:40:37.119 align:start position:0%
buildings and
 
01:40:39.830 --> 01:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
having agreed to live under the
 
01:40:41.430 --> 01:40:41.440 align:start position:0%
governing set of documents for that
 
01:40:41.440 --> 01:40:42.950 align:start position:0%
governing set of documents for that
association

01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
it's important to make sure that to the
 
01:40:46.629 --> 01:40:46.639 align:start position:0%
extent there's going to be a fundamental
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
change that there are a significant
 
01:40:51.430 --> 01:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
number of folks who are looking for it
 
01:40:53.669 --> 01:40:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think that this one really is very
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
much like the
 
01:41:00.070 --> 01:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
ham radio bill that we all spoke of
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
days ago last week i think that once
 
01:41:06.470 --> 01:41:06.480 align:start position:0%
again you've got the interests of some
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
of the owners that by statue
 
01:41:13.350 --> 01:41:13.360 align:start position:0%
would take an unfair advantage over the
 
01:41:16.229 --> 01:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
others and would tend to do away with
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
what the existing condominium documents
 
01:41:20.790 --> 01:41:20.800 align:start position:0%
already say you also will have the same
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
practical issues here meaning what
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
happens when holes start getting drilled
 
01:41:26.950 --> 01:41:26.960 align:start position:0%
in the roof or other parts of the
 
01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:28.149 align:start position:0%
in the roof or other parts of the
building

01:41:28.149 --> 01:41:28.159 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:41:29.910 --> 01:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
what happens if a piece of equipment
 
01:41:31.590 --> 01:41:31.600 align:start position:0%
blows off
 
01:41:32.790 --> 01:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
and injures
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
property or injures a person
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
i know from personal experience having
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
solar on my house which by the way is an
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
example of me not being against the
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
concept of solar
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the same way that i'm not against cam
 
01:41:49.350 --> 01:41:49.360 align:start position:0%
radio operators but i had solar on a
 
01:41:49.360 --> 01:41:50.310 align:start position:0%
radio operators but i had solar on a
house

01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
that i lived in and um it was definitely
 
01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:55.119 align:start position:0%
the case and the company warned me of
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
this that the panels being as flat and
 
01:41:59.270 --> 01:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
as sleek as they are
 
01:42:01.590 --> 01:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
the snow at a certain point in the
 
01:42:01.600 --> 01:42:03.109 align:start position:0%
the snow at a certain point in the
winters

01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
winters
 
01:42:05.350 --> 01:42:05.360 align:start position:0%
reaches a weight where it slides off the
 
01:42:09.030 --> 01:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
panel and then it crashes to the ground
 
01:42:11.990 --> 01:42:12.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes unsettlingly along the border
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
of the building and all of these things
 
01:42:15.830 --> 01:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
are are greater problems you know when
 
01:42:17.030 --> 01:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
you have people living in these
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
community settings
 
01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:21.440 align:start position:0%
than you would in a single family home
 
01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:22.149 align:start position:0%
than you would in a single family home
so

01:42:22.149 --> 01:42:22.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
i would ask the board to consider
 
01:42:27.109 --> 01:42:27.119 align:start position:0%
all of that and to just again along the
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
lines of the ham radio bill
 
01:42:30.870 --> 01:42:30.880 align:start position:0%
take note of the fact that in an
 
01:42:30.880 --> 01:42:32.149 align:start position:0%
take note of the fact that in an
association

01:42:32.149 --> 01:42:32.159 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
an individual unit owner simply doesn't
 
01:42:37.669 --> 01:42:37.679 align:start position:0%
own that roof it's not their property to
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
install equipment on or drill holes in
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
and these are fundamental basics of
 
01:42:44.470 --> 01:42:44.480 align:start position:0%
condominiums so i think we need to
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
uphold these principles again after all
 
01:42:49.750 --> 01:42:49.760 align:start position:0%
people choose to live in these
 
01:42:51.430 --> 01:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
condominium associations they're not
 
01:42:53.910 --> 01:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
forced to do so
 
01:42:55.510 --> 01:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
beyond that i'll just take a quick
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
moment to say that if the bill was to go
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
forward uh i do have some suggestions i
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
think it makes more sense
 
01:43:06.790 --> 01:43:06.800 align:start position:0%
if it is being
 
01:43:09.430 --> 01:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
proposed to deal with the association
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
project on an association scale
 
01:43:15.430 --> 01:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
meaning that that the entire association
 
01:43:17.590 --> 01:43:17.600 align:start position:0%
is involved with the solar project but
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
as it's worded it definitely does not
 
01:43:21.430 --> 01:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
say that
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
at present and so at present with the
 
01:43:26.390 --> 01:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
wording we have here an individual unit
 
01:43:28.709 --> 01:43:28.719 align:start position:0%
owner who wanted to put solar up on the
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
roof for their own benefit would be able
 
01:43:33.669 --> 01:43:33.679 align:start position:0%
to use this bill to say i need a lesser
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
vote so to the extent that this is meant
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
to apply to an association and not to
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
individual owners i think that would
 
01:43:42.870 --> 01:43:42.880 align:start position:0%
need to be made clear
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
i also think it needs to be made clear
 
01:43:48.149 --> 01:43:48.159 align:start position:0%
what the simple majority vote is of
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
again i'm against the idea of a simple
 
01:43:53.189 --> 01:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
majority vote because generally speaking
 
01:43:55.030 --> 01:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
the standards are higher both in
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
governing documents and in the law but
 
01:44:00.070 --> 01:44:00.080 align:start position:0%
in any event it's important to define a
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
vote at a condominium association and
 
01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
what i mean by that is are we talking
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
about the votes of the association as a
 
01:44:07.119 --> 01:44:08.149 align:start position:0%
about the votes of the association as a
whole

01:44:08.149 --> 01:44:08.159 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:44:10.310 --> 01:44:10.320 align:start position:0%
or are we talking about the votes of
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
persons attending a particular meeting
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
on this subject matter
 
01:44:16.629 --> 01:44:16.639 align:start position:0%
and i think it's always important for
 
01:44:18.950 --> 01:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
the votes to be described as being of
 
01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:21.360 align:start position:0%
the association as a whole
 
01:44:23.430 --> 01:44:23.440 align:start position:0%
because you have a lot of communities
 
01:44:25.830 --> 01:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
especially in an area like new hampshire
 
01:44:25.840 --> 01:44:26.629 align:start position:0%
especially in an area like new hampshire
where

01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:44:26.639 --> 01:44:27.350 align:start position:0%
where
the

01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
so-called snowbirds if you will are gone
 
01:44:33.189 --> 01:44:33.199 align:start position:0%
for the winter and so attendance at the
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
association is low to begin with and
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
then even at a large association on any
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
given evening that a meeting is
 
01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.709 align:start position:0%
given evening that a meeting is
scheduled

01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
scheduled
 
01:44:43.109 --> 01:44:43.119 align:start position:0%
if you only have 10 people appear and
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
then six of them vote in favor of solar
 
01:44:49.030 --> 01:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
now all of a sudden a solar project is
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
moving forward and and that may just be
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
a tiny fraction of the actual community
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
so again if it were moving forward a
 
01:44:59.669 --> 01:44:59.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that this vote
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
be described in further detail and that
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
it be described to apply to the voting
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
power of the association as a whole
 
01:45:10.070 --> 01:45:10.080 align:start position:0%
not just who may participate in one
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
particular meeting
 
01:45:12.000 --> 01:45:13.270 align:start position:0%
particular meeting
finally

01:45:13.270 --> 01:45:13.280 align:start position:0%
finally
 
01:45:16.229 --> 01:45:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm a little bit concerned about the
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
last part of this bill that states that
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
it will apply not only going forward but
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
to an association that amends their
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
governing documents
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
as a condominium law practitioner i can
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
tell you that for one reason or another
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
every association amends their documents
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
from time to time almost all of my
 
01:45:36.709 --> 01:45:36.719 align:start position:0%
clients have felt the need to do so
 
01:45:36.719 --> 01:45:37.709 align:start position:0%
clients have felt the need to do so
between

01:45:37.709 --> 01:45:37.719 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:45:37.719 --> 01:45:39.270 align:start position:0%
between
2016

01:45:39.270 --> 01:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
2016
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
and now just because of the amendments
 
01:45:43.830 --> 01:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
and i'm not saying it's a bad thing
 
01:45:45.510 --> 01:45:45.520 align:start position:0%
but but just the amendments that have
 
01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:46.550 align:start position:0%
but but just the amendments that have
passed

01:45:46.550 --> 01:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
passed
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the condominium act 356b
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
most of my clients have found a need to
 
01:45:57.669 --> 01:45:57.679 align:start position:0%
make a change to be in compliance and so
 
01:45:59.430 --> 01:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
i would urge you to consider that as
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
long as this bill says it also applies
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
to a condominium who amends their
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
documents that that really makes this a
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
bill of general applicability because at
 
01:46:11.669 --> 01:46:11.679 align:start position:0%
one time or another everybody amends
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
their documents and then they would get
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
pulled into this so the
 
01:46:17.830 --> 01:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
the proactive nature of the bill that
 
01:46:19.990 --> 01:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
was originally described i think really
 
01:46:24.390 --> 01:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:27.270 --> 01:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
okay uh we do have a couple of questions
 
01:46:29.910 --> 01:46:29.920 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:46:35.189 --> 01:46:35.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question um uh my concern is
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
about what you mentioned the majority um
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
are there condo associations where the
 
01:46:42.790 --> 01:46:42.800 align:start position:0%
the the number of condo buildings are so
 
01:46:45.350 --> 01:46:45.360 align:start position:0%
large that you have your overall condo
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
association for the whole property and
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
then also you have
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
different groups that vote for
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
individual buildings
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
and so that sort of creates another
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
level of complexity and another problem
 
01:47:03.189 --> 01:47:03.199 align:start position:0%
with um putting a measure like this into
 
01:47:03.199 --> 01:47:04.149 align:start position:0%
with um putting a measure like this into
law

01:47:04.149 --> 01:47:04.159 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:47:06.550 --> 01:47:06.560 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't take account for all
 
01:47:08.790 --> 01:47:08.800 align:start position:0%
of those nuances the way that the
 
01:47:11.590 --> 01:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
governing documents of the associations
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
actually do and what you're describing
 
01:47:17.109 --> 01:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
um is what we often refer to as like a
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
master and sub setup meaning that
 
01:47:21.510 --> 01:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
there's a master association
 
01:47:24.229 --> 01:47:24.239 align:start position:0%
and a board that makes decisions on a
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
property-wide basis and then smaller
 
01:47:29.950 --> 01:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
segments within that community exist as
 
01:47:32.709 --> 01:47:32.719 align:start position:0%
sub-associations sometimes
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
as you say the buildings are
 
01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
individually so large that i deal with
 
01:47:40.830 --> 01:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
associations where each building is a
 
01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:42.470 align:start position:0%
associations where each building is a
sub-association

01:47:42.470 --> 01:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
sub-association
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
that is also part of the overall master
 
01:47:44.960 --> 01:47:46.470 align:start position:0%
that is also part of the overall master
association

01:47:46.470 --> 01:47:46.480 align:start position:0%
association
 
01:47:49.109 --> 01:47:49.119 align:start position:0%
so yes that exists and and yes a bill
 
01:47:51.590 --> 01:47:51.600 align:start position:0%
like this um would create problems in
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
that situation because it's not at all
 
01:47:55.109 --> 01:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
clear how it would work
 
01:47:55.119 --> 01:47:56.310 align:start position:0%
clear how it would work
follow-up

01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:47:58.390 --> 01:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire
 
01:48:00.550 --> 01:48:00.560 align:start position:0%
then for your proposed amendment if we
 
01:48:01.750 --> 01:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
were going to go forward with this bill
 
01:48:04.149 --> 01:48:04.159 align:start position:0%
and tread and and correct these problems
 
01:48:06.070 --> 01:48:06.080 align:start position:0%
would you prefer that we do it break it
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
up building by building or the whole
 
01:48:10.790 --> 01:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
association or the smallest association
 
01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.189 align:start position:0%
association or the smallest association
unit

01:48:13.189 --> 01:48:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
i think if it's to go forward um the
 
01:48:19.030 --> 01:48:19.040 align:start position:0%
best measure would be to make it apply
 
01:48:21.430 --> 01:48:21.440 align:start position:0%
in the broadest sense
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
so that it applies to an association as
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
a whole or that where there are multiple
 
01:48:29.189 --> 01:48:29.199 align:start position:0%
associations or a master association in
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
a in a group of sub associations i think
 
01:48:33.750 --> 01:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
that it should be handled at that
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
highest level
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
the reason being that there should be
 
01:48:40.149 --> 01:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
consistency and equality and so for
 
01:48:40.159 --> 01:48:41.510 align:start position:0%
consistency and equality and so for
instance

01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
you could have a scenario where if
 
01:48:45.750 --> 01:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
applied on a building by building basis
 
01:48:47.430 --> 01:48:47.440 align:start position:0%
you may end up with
 
01:48:48.310 --> 01:48:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:49.669 align:start position:0%
you know
discontent

01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
discontent
 
01:48:51.750 --> 01:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
in the community because you've got a
 
01:48:54.149 --> 01:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
building reaping the benefits of lower
 
01:48:56.229 --> 01:48:56.239 align:start position:0%
electric bills because of their solar
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
but other buildings don't have the solar
 
01:49:00.709 --> 01:49:00.719 align:start position:0%
and then some buildings if it were
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
building by building vote it might pass
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
in one building not pass in another and
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
then the people who like solar that live
 
01:49:10.070 --> 01:49:10.080 align:start position:0%
in a building where it didn't pass now
 
01:49:11.750 --> 01:49:11.760 align:start position:0%
they resent the fact that they live in
 
01:49:13.590 --> 01:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
this particular building and have these
 
01:49:15.590 --> 01:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
particular neighbors
 
01:49:17.830 --> 01:49:17.840 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons i think it should
 
01:49:20.390 --> 01:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
apply on the broadest level possible and
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
again it would almost need to because
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
since um something like the roof where
 
01:49:27.669 --> 01:49:27.679 align:start position:0%
these panels are usually placed is owned
 
01:49:29.350 --> 01:49:29.360 align:start position:0%
by the association and not the
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
individual unit owners
 
01:49:33.270 --> 01:49:33.280 align:start position:0%
it would appear that it is most
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the decision to be made
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
at the highest level because that is
 
01:49:40.070 --> 01:49:40.080 align:start position:0%
really who sort of
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
controls for ownership purpose the
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
property in question which again is most
 
01:49:48.070 --> 01:49:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:54.310 --> 01:49:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.870 --> 01:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question um
 
01:49:59.910 --> 01:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
if this were um to be implemented on the
 
01:50:02.550 --> 01:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
um the the broadest possible level as
 
01:50:05.430 --> 01:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
you're saying my concern or actually say
 
01:50:07.750 --> 01:50:07.760 align:start position:0%
are you concerned that because of the
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
cost of solar if it was 50 plus one um
 
01:50:13.510 --> 01:50:13.520 align:start position:0%
that's that could be a huge expense for
 
01:50:15.910 --> 01:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
individual property owners so does that
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
concern you that it might be the
 
01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
just a small majority there
 
01:50:25.270 --> 01:50:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely in fact to be clear my my
 
01:50:28.149 --> 01:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
position in general is against this bill
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
um not because again not because i'm
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
against solar but because i don't think
 
01:50:35.910 --> 01:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
it works well this type of measure in a
 
01:50:38.950 --> 01:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
condominium association context
 
01:50:40.790 --> 01:50:40.800 align:start position:0%
um but certainly
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
there is an issue involved with
 
01:50:45.510 --> 01:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that any number of people which
 
01:50:47.270 --> 01:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
is usually why the voting standards are
 
01:50:49.510 --> 01:50:49.520 align:start position:0%
set high but there's always a concern
 
01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
when a number of people
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
might pass a vote that then has an
 
01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:56.159 align:start position:0%
impact on everyone else in the community
 
01:50:59.990 --> 01:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
especially uh financial impact so yes at
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
any level
 
01:51:03.189 --> 01:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
there is concern there because i think
 
01:51:03.199 --> 01:51:04.070 align:start position:0%
there is concern there because i think
that

01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:51:04.080 --> 01:51:05.510 align:start position:0%
that
again

01:51:05.510 --> 01:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:51:08.229 --> 01:51:08.239 align:start position:0%
the associations primarily should be
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
able to govern themselves and uh unit
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
owners should be making a choice about
 
01:51:15.109 --> 01:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
where they want to live and so again
 
01:51:17.590 --> 01:51:17.600 align:start position:0%
like like the ham radio folks it becomes
 
01:51:20.070 --> 01:51:20.080 align:start position:0%
a matter of choosing to live in a place
 
01:51:23.030 --> 01:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
where um you know it's not restrictive
 
01:51:24.550 --> 01:51:24.560 align:start position:0%
against something that you feel is
 
01:51:27.430 --> 01:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
important for you in your life
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:51:29.040 --> 01:51:29.990 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%

01:51:34.950 --> 01:51:34.960 align:start position:0%
questions answered okay yeah i i need to
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
ask my question there you go perfect
 
01:51:37.440 --> 01:51:38.390 align:start position:0%
ask my question there you go perfect
okay

01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%

lennon
 
01:51:49.030 --> 01:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure i can add anything that
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
gary didn't say he did a tremendous job
 
01:51:54.070 --> 01:51:54.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much okay perfect even
 
01:51:55.910 --> 01:51:55.920 align:start position:0%
better okay
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
um so having oh i do have an attendees
 
01:52:00.830 --> 01:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
got a hand up
 
01:52:03.830 --> 01:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
so uh represent mcmillions you would
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
like to
 
01:52:05.440 --> 01:52:06.950 align:start position:0%
like to
uh

01:52:06.950 --> 01:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:09.669 --> 01:52:09.679 align:start position:0%
put you back i guess and and
 
01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:18.310 --> 01:52:18.320 align:start position:0%
there you go go ahead
 
01:52:20.470 --> 01:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you chair uh hunt
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
um i i just wanted to take an
 
01:52:25.510 --> 01:52:25.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to rebut a little bit of the
 
01:52:27.589 --> 01:52:27.599 align:start position:0%
comments that were previously stated by
 
01:52:31.510 --> 01:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
mr d'addario um first of all the
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis which
 
01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:36.159 align:start position:0%
sounds like his preference is that
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
condos address this issue on a
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
case-by-case basis
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
understanding that the default rule in
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
new hampshire is that you need a
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
two-thirds vote by the
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
entire association as a whole
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
in order to change your bylaws
 
01:52:51.589 --> 01:52:51.599 align:start position:0%
you would need a two-thirds vote to
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
change the bylaws to allow a fifty
 
01:52:57.189 --> 01:52:57.199 align:start position:0%
percent plus one vote to put solar on
 
01:53:00.070 --> 01:53:00.080 align:start position:0%
each individual condo across the state
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
and i would argue that that's incredibly
 
01:53:04.390 --> 01:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
unwieldy and highly unlikely to happen
 
01:53:07.350 --> 01:53:07.360 align:start position:0%
so it would in effect
 
01:53:09.030 --> 01:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
cause this not to happen because you're
 
01:53:10.550 --> 01:53:10.560 align:start position:0%
not going to see all those two-thirds
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
votes and you're not going to see the
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
individual initiative from each of the
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:18.790 align:start position:0%
 
also

01:53:18.790 --> 01:53:18.800 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:53:19.990 --> 01:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:53:22.629 --> 01:53:22.639 align:start position:0%
there really is no unfair advantage to
 
01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
installing solar with a majority vote
 
01:53:28.870 --> 01:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
the advantage would be decreased
 
01:53:31.270 --> 01:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
electric bills for everyone
 
01:53:33.430 --> 01:53:33.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm not seeing this as anything other
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
than another construction project that's
 
01:53:37.350 --> 01:53:37.360 align:start position:0%
being undertaken in common area and
 
01:53:38.950 --> 01:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
decided upon
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
by the majority of the voters
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
for how to spend the money that the
 
01:53:46.070 --> 01:53:46.080 align:start position:0%
association has
 
01:53:47.830 --> 01:53:47.840 align:start position:0%
to do a construction project and
 
01:53:49.910 --> 01:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
obviously those of you who are familiar
 
01:53:52.149 --> 01:53:52.159 align:start position:0%
with living in condos know that
 
01:53:53.830 --> 01:53:53.840 align:start position:0%
expenses come up construction projects
 
01:53:55.830 --> 01:53:55.840 align:start position:0%
happen uh you need all kinds of
 
01:53:58.229 --> 01:53:58.239 align:start position:0%
maintenance repairs a new roof
 
01:53:59.669 --> 01:53:59.679 align:start position:0%
new siding
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
addressing issues um also when we talk
 
01:54:04.390 --> 01:54:04.400 align:start position:0%
about construction there seemed to be
 
01:54:06.390 --> 01:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
some concern about drilling holes in the
 
01:54:09.189 --> 01:54:09.199 align:start position:0%
roof or equipment blowing off
 
01:54:11.510 --> 01:54:11.520 align:start position:0%
i would argue that in this day and age
 
01:54:13.910 --> 01:54:13.920 align:start position:0%
in 2021 we've gotten really good at
 
01:54:15.510 --> 01:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
installing solar
 
01:54:17.430 --> 01:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
so it's not necessarily the case that
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
there will be holes drilled in the roof
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
or equipment blowing off this could be
 
01:54:22.950 --> 01:54:22.960 align:start position:0%
happening in a fields this could be
 
01:54:25.109 --> 01:54:25.119 align:start position:0%
happening on a flat surface
 
01:54:28.390 --> 01:54:28.400 align:start position:0%
um it could be uh mounted with sandbags
 
01:54:29.510 --> 01:54:29.520 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
drilled so i just want to be clear that
 
01:54:33.910 --> 01:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
we've gotten really good at solar as an
 
01:54:37.589 --> 01:54:37.599 align:start position:0%
industry um in the last 30 years
 
01:54:39.990 --> 01:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
in addition i i am open to doing an
 
01:54:41.990 --> 01:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to clarify about having the
 
01:54:44.070 --> 01:54:44.080 align:start position:0%
vote being by the whole association for
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
the same reasons outlined by mr dadario
 
01:54:48.550 --> 01:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
i think it makes sense to be very clear
 
01:54:51.830 --> 01:54:51.840 align:start position:0%
that this is about everyone voting
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
about whether or not a solar project
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
would happen it's a construction project
 
01:54:56.239 --> 01:54:57.109 align:start position:0%
would happen it's a construction project
um

01:54:57.109 --> 01:54:57.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:59.189 --> 01:54:59.199 align:start position:0%
and then uh finally
 
01:55:01.510 --> 01:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
the uh the intention of benefiting one
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
owner i would be okay with um a little
 
01:55:06.629 --> 01:55:06.639 align:start position:0%
tweak in the language to to just make
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
sure that we're benefiting obviously the
 
01:55:10.709 --> 01:55:10.719 align:start position:0%
condo owners as a whole so
 
01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
that's a brief response thank you
 
01:55:17.589 --> 01:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
uh okay so now it's 10 59 we're almost
 
01:55:18.790 --> 01:55:18.800 align:start position:0%
in i said you're gonna be the last
 
01:55:20.470 --> 01:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
speaker and then i have three hands pop
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
up so i can i will take the questions
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
but all i can ask you the three of you
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that's you in particular chris keep
 
01:55:29.030 --> 01:55:29.040 align:start position:0%
make the ques question a yes or no
 
01:55:31.030 --> 01:55:31.040 align:start position:0%
answer so that we can get on to the next
 
01:55:35.270 --> 01:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:36.950 --> 01:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
my question uh my question is um so if
 
01:55:41.109 --> 01:55:41.119 align:start position:0%
an association
 
01:55:43.510 --> 01:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
member owns several units
 
01:55:46.709 --> 01:55:46.719 align:start position:0%
and he or she does not want solar or
 
01:55:49.350 --> 01:55:49.360 align:start position:0%
because uh he or she has um stock or
 
01:55:51.430 --> 01:55:51.440 align:start position:0%
investment in a different energy source
 
01:55:55.750 --> 01:55:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:57.350 --> 01:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
that's a would you believe
 
01:55:59.430 --> 01:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's a would you believe
 
01:56:01.030 --> 01:56:01.040 align:start position:0%
okay that's an interesting question but
 
01:56:02.390 --> 01:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
that's a would you believe question all
 
01:56:02.400 --> 01:56:03.830 align:start position:0%
that's a would you believe question all
right

01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:56:06.870 --> 01:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you what'd you believe
 
01:56:08.070 --> 01:56:08.080 align:start position:0%
okay chris
 
01:56:09.430 --> 01:56:09.440 align:start position:0%
you're gonna it's gonna be easy right
 
01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:14.870 align:start position:0%
you're gonna it's gonna be easy right
chris

01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.880 --> 01:56:15.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:56:15.990 --> 01:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:56:18.790 --> 01:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
yes sir uh thank you chairman
 
01:56:22.390 --> 01:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
so um just so as i've got this clear
 
01:56:24.950 --> 01:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
only association uh members who own
 
01:56:26.709 --> 01:56:26.719 align:start position:0%
their condos
 
01:56:28.550 --> 01:56:28.560 align:start position:0%
are involved in this vote is that
 
01:56:28.560 --> 01:56:29.589 align:start position:0%
are involved in this vote is that
correct

01:56:29.589 --> 01:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:56:31.750 --> 01:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
in other words if there's 50 units that
 
01:56:34.390 --> 01:56:34.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
the people that are renting
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
are going to not be able to vote
 
01:56:41.990 --> 01:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
but they're going to i would i would as
 
01:56:44.229 --> 01:56:44.239 align:start position:0%
an association member
 
01:56:47.589 --> 01:56:47.599 align:start position:0%
want them to also help pay for this unit
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm just i want to make that clear
 
01:56:52.950 --> 01:56:52.960 align:start position:0%
and and uh and maybe maybe recommend to
 
01:56:54.870 --> 01:56:54.880 align:start position:0%
the gentleman that was
 
01:56:57.669 --> 01:56:57.679 align:start position:0%
uh the business owner with majority rule
 
01:56:59.109 --> 01:56:59.119 align:start position:0%
he probably should get in the solar
 
01:56:59.119 --> 01:57:00.470 align:start position:0%
he probably should get in the solar
business

01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
so it is unit unit owners it's just unit
 
01:57:05.669 --> 01:57:05.679 align:start position:0%
owners it says unit owners are voting
 
01:57:05.679 --> 01:57:07.189 align:start position:0%
owners it says unit owners are voting
yep

01:57:07.189 --> 01:57:07.199 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:57:11.430 --> 01:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
okay and max last but not least
 
01:57:13.350 --> 01:57:13.360 align:start position:0%
a question on this hypothetical
 
01:57:15.109 --> 01:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
amendment um
 
01:57:16.870 --> 01:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
does this
 
01:57:18.629 --> 01:57:18.639 align:start position:0%
i guess the problem i run into if you're
 
01:57:19.910 --> 01:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to go for the whole property
 
01:57:21.990 --> 01:57:22.000 align:start position:0%
instead of just the building are you
 
01:57:24.070 --> 01:57:24.080 align:start position:0%
what happens if the property becomes
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
bifurcated or subdivided later or the
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
association subdivides later does this
 
01:57:31.350 --> 01:57:31.360 align:start position:0%
you know if we're going to handle this
 
01:57:33.109 --> 01:57:33.119 align:start position:0%
in law and this is going to handle all
 
01:57:35.109 --> 01:57:35.119 align:start position:0%
cases going forward how do we address
 
01:57:37.030 --> 01:57:37.040 align:start position:0%
all of the contingencies that come up
 
01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:38.550 align:start position:0%
all of the contingencies that come up
that

01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:57:40.070 --> 01:57:40.080 align:start position:0%
that we have a hard time dealing with
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
now what happens if
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
you know two condo adjacent condo
 
01:57:46.070 --> 01:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
associations merge
 
01:57:48.390 --> 01:57:48.400 align:start position:0%
you know how do we handle those kinds of
 
01:57:50.830 --> 01:57:50.840 align:start position:0%
situations in
 
01:57:54.149 --> 01:57:54.159 align:start position:0%
law so um i i just want to say this is a
 
01:57:55.990 --> 01:57:56.000 align:start position:0%
construction improvement
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
so we would address this just like
 
01:57:59.270 --> 01:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
putting up a new clubhouse
 
01:58:01.830 --> 01:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
if the if the units were split out into
 
01:58:03.910 --> 01:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
two different owners ownership and
 
01:58:05.510 --> 01:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
compensation would be addressed the same
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
way as if you had built a new clubhouse
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
or vice versa if you added on and
 
01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
purchased more units that belong to a
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
neighboring condo and there was
 
01:58:16.709 --> 01:58:16.719 align:start position:0%
say a bond or a loan or some long-term
 
01:58:18.149 --> 01:58:18.159 align:start position:0%
financial instrument related to the
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
clubhouse that would be dealt with as
 
01:58:21.830 --> 01:58:21.840 align:start position:0%
part of the purchase and integration of
 
01:58:26.149 --> 01:58:26.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
great we thank you very much and uh well
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
with this i will close the public
 
01:58:31.040 --> 01:58:32.229 align:start position:0%
with this i will close the public
hearing

01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:58:32.239 --> 01:58:33.109 align:start position:0%
hearing
on

01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%

house bill 358
 
01:58:39.030 --> 01:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
and so the next
 
01:58:40.950 --> 01:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
one we have
 
01:58:44.390 --> 01:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:44.400 --> 01:58:46.550 align:start position:0%

the the purpose of the bill
 
02:00:15.030 --> 02:00:15.040 align:start position:0%
is to allow homeowners a remedy
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
other than going to the superior court
 
02:00:22.229 --> 02:00:22.239 align:start position:0%
currently if condominium unit owners
 
02:00:24.629 --> 02:00:24.639 align:start position:0%
have a complaint with the association
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that complaint may involve
 
02:00:29.109 --> 02:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
the fact that the board is not complying
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
with the declaration or bylaws or other
 
02:00:35.189 --> 02:00:35.199 align:start position:0%
condominium documents

condominium documents
or

02:00:35.990 --> 02:00:36.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
it may be a complaint with regard to
 
02:00:41.189 --> 02:00:41.199 align:start position:0%
wrongful voting procedures or it could
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
be a complaint with regard to uses of
 
02:00:45.189 --> 02:00:45.199 align:start position:0%
the property
 
02:00:45.199 --> 02:00:46.310 align:start position:0%
the property
their

02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
their
 
02:00:48.229 --> 02:00:48.239 align:start position:0%
only remedy other than complaining to
 
02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
the board itself
 
02:00:52.229 --> 02:00:52.239 align:start position:0%
is to go to the superior court
 
02:00:53.350 --> 02:00:53.360 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:00:55.030 --> 02:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
oversight committee condominium
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
oversight committee has heard repeated
 
02:01:01.990 --> 02:01:02.000 align:start position:0%
concerns expressed by unit owners
 
02:01:04.470 --> 02:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
that that process is
 
02:01:06.950 --> 02:01:06.960 align:start position:0%
expensive that process
 
02:01:09.109 --> 02:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
is intimidating
 
02:01:11.910 --> 02:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
and it's a formal process it's a formal
 
02:01:13.910 --> 02:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
process and that the
 
02:01:15.830 --> 02:01:15.840 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence are required and
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
really the only way
 
02:01:20.229 --> 02:01:20.239 align:start position:0%
to go through that process you really
 
02:01:22.310 --> 02:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
need to have an attorney in order to do
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
that and because it is an intimidating
 
02:01:28.229 --> 02:01:28.239 align:start position:0%
process it discourages many homeowners
 
02:01:30.149 --> 02:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
from going forward
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
and with with their complaints or their
 
02:01:32.480 --> 02:01:33.750 align:start position:0%
and with with their complaints or their
concerns

02:01:33.750 --> 02:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
so they're looking for a method of
 
02:01:37.830 --> 02:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
addressing those concerns
 
02:01:40.070 --> 02:01:40.080 align:start position:0%
without having to go through the formal
 
02:01:40.080 --> 02:01:42.470 align:start position:0%
without having to go through the formal
process

02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
process
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
what has been developed
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
in the legislation is a dispute
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
resolution board it would consist of
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
nine members
 
02:01:52.790 --> 02:01:52.800 align:start position:0%
they would be appointed
 
02:01:54.149 --> 02:01:54.159 align:start position:0%
there would be members of the house of
 
02:01:55.830 --> 02:01:55.840 align:start position:0%
representatives there would be members
 
02:01:57.750 --> 02:01:57.760 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
02:02:00.310 --> 02:02:00.320 align:start position:0%
but nine members
 
02:02:01.990 --> 02:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
some involved
 
02:02:04.870 --> 02:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
potentially in the condominium industry
 
02:02:07.189 --> 02:02:07.199 align:start position:0%
but there would be unit owners involved
 
02:02:09.510 --> 02:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
there would be board members involved
 
02:02:12.550 --> 02:02:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:13.990 --> 02:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
members of the board
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
which would have
 
02:02:16.790 --> 02:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
an interest that would be a person who
 
02:02:18.070 --> 02:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
would be appointed by the bar
 
02:02:18.080 --> 02:02:20.709 align:start position:0%
would be appointed by the bar
association

02:02:20.709 --> 02:02:20.719 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:02:20.719 --> 02:02:22.550 align:start position:0%
association
and

02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:25.030 --> 02:02:25.040 align:start position:0%
this board is designed after
 
02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:26.550 align:start position:0%
this board is designed after
the

02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
the board which is currently in effect
 
02:02:30.950 --> 02:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to manufactured housing
 
02:02:33.350 --> 02:02:33.360 align:start position:0%
and that board has been successful
 
02:02:35.270 --> 02:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
in dealing with complaints with
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing complaints
 
02:02:40.790 --> 02:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
without having to have
 
02:02:42.070 --> 02:02:42.080 align:start position:0%
people who
 
02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
in many cases just simply do not have
 
02:02:46.709 --> 02:02:46.719 align:start position:0%
the means to go to court to be able to
 
02:02:49.430 --> 02:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
provide them with a remedy for their
 
02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:51.669 align:start position:0%
provide them with a remedy for their
concerns

02:02:51.669 --> 02:02:51.679 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
02:02:51.679 --> 02:02:52.870 align:start position:0%
concerns
the

02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:55.109 --> 02:02:55.119 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:02:55.119 --> 02:02:56.229 align:start position:0%
the uh
the

02:02:56.229 --> 02:02:56.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:56.239 --> 02:02:58.149 align:start position:0%
the
uh

02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:01.510 --> 02:03:01.520 align:start position:0%
the legal effect of decisions uh it does
 
02:03:03.430 --> 02:03:03.440 align:start position:0%
not deprive
 
02:03:05.270 --> 02:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
anyone from going to court what would
 
02:03:08.629 --> 02:03:08.639 align:start position:0%
happen is the dispute resolution board
 
02:03:11.030 --> 02:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
would make a determination would make a
 
02:03:14.870 --> 02:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
determination with regard to complaints
 
02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:17.270 align:start position:0%
determination with regard to complaints
and

02:03:17.270 --> 02:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
and if and then if either party the unit
 
02:03:24.310 --> 02:03:24.320 align:start position:0%
owner or the association were unhappy
 
02:03:27.109 --> 02:03:27.119 align:start position:0%
with the outcome they could in fact go
 
02:03:29.910 --> 02:03:29.920 align:start position:0%
to court and have it resolved in court
 
02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:30.870 align:start position:0%
to court and have it resolved in court
but

02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
if uh it's not appealed to court if
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
either party wants to go to court it
 
02:03:36.790 --> 02:03:36.800 align:start position:0%
will become
 
02:03:41.270 --> 02:03:41.280 align:start position:0%
a binding resolution to the complaint
 
02:03:41.280 --> 02:03:42.550 align:start position:0%
a binding resolution to the complaint
and

02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:46.390 --> 02:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
i think that that is a fair uh outcome
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
and a good way of resolving the
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
complaints in a fair and equitable
 
02:03:54.629 --> 02:03:54.639 align:start position:0%
manner and in an economical manner
 
02:03:54.639 --> 02:03:55.430 align:start position:0%
manner and in an economical manner
uh

02:03:55.430 --> 02:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:03:58.229 --> 02:03:58.239 align:start position:0%
like most people i don't necessarily
 
02:04:00.070 --> 02:04:00.080 align:start position:0%
want to see more regulations or more
 
02:04:02.149 --> 02:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
levels of bureaucracy
 
02:04:04.950 --> 02:04:04.960 align:start position:0%
uh but this is a way of providing people
 
02:04:07.350 --> 02:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
with a remedy without having to go
 
02:04:10.149 --> 02:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
through the formal process of going to
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
obtain that remedy
 
02:04:12.639 --> 02:04:13.430 align:start position:0%
obtain that remedy
and

02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:04:15.270 --> 02:04:15.280 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:04:17.589 --> 02:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions that people may
 
02:04:17.599 --> 02:04:19.910 align:start position:0%
entertain any questions that people may
have

02:04:19.910 --> 02:04:19.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:04:22.229 --> 02:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
uh great thank you we do have some
 
02:04:24.070 --> 02:04:24.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative abramson has a
 
02:04:24.080 --> 02:04:25.270 align:start position:0%
questions representative abramson has a
question

02:04:25.270 --> 02:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:04:26.629 --> 02:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:04:28.070 --> 02:04:28.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:29.189 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
i do have a i actually like the idea of
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
i do have a concern that
 
02:04:37.270 --> 02:04:37.280 align:start position:0%
the members are
 
02:04:38.709 --> 02:04:38.719 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are just members of the
 
02:04:41.030 --> 02:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
general court who under our constitution
 
02:04:43.189 --> 02:04:43.199 align:start position:0%
can't be compensated
 
02:04:44.629 --> 02:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
um other than the hundred dollar a year
 
02:04:47.830 --> 02:04:47.840 align:start position:0%
honorarium um it looks like
 
02:04:49.669 --> 02:04:49.679 align:start position:0%
i i guess i guess i'm guessing that
 
02:04:51.270 --> 02:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
there would be a lot of disputes that
 
02:04:52.709 --> 02:04:52.719 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few of these cases
 
02:04:54.149 --> 02:04:54.159 align:start position:0%
that go to court
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering why
 
02:04:56.719 --> 02:04:57.910 align:start position:0%
um i'm wondering why
this

02:04:57.910 --> 02:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:04:59.669 --> 02:04:59.679 align:start position:0%
you know wouldn't go maybe to the
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
housing board
 
02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:02.550 align:start position:0%
housing board
or

02:05:02.550 --> 02:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
some other organization
 
02:05:08.470 --> 02:05:08.480 align:start position:0%
to just look at the facts of the case
 
02:05:12.229 --> 02:05:12.239 align:start position:0%
and decide the case based on the facts
 
02:05:15.109 --> 02:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
i think the design of the board
 
02:05:17.350 --> 02:05:17.360 align:start position:0%
was created with the purpose of having
 
02:05:20.149 --> 02:05:20.159 align:start position:0%
people who generally were familiar with
 
02:05:20.159 --> 02:05:21.109 align:start position:0%
people who generally were familiar with
the

02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:05:23.350 --> 02:05:23.360 align:start position:0%
industry and you'll see that most people
 
02:05:25.510 --> 02:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
are there's one member who's just simply
 
02:05:27.189 --> 02:05:27.199 align:start position:0%
a lawyer
 
02:05:28.470 --> 02:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
one member appointed by the bar
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
association which i think always having
 
02:05:32.709 --> 02:05:32.719 align:start position:0%
some legal expertise
 
02:05:34.470 --> 02:05:34.480 align:start position:0%
added is a good idea
 
02:05:37.750 --> 02:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to the legislative members
 
02:05:39.350 --> 02:05:39.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i could let you decide whether
 
02:05:42.229 --> 02:05:42.239 align:start position:0%
you think that's in the interest but
 
02:05:44.470 --> 02:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
frankly i think having the legislature
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
involved is not a bad idea
 
02:05:49.990 --> 02:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned about their compensation
 
02:05:56.790 --> 02:05:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:57.589 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:06:01.270 --> 02:06:01.280 align:start position:0%
uh next up is representative bartlett
 
02:06:03.990 --> 02:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
02:06:06.470 --> 02:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
we have lost our institutional memory
 
02:06:07.669 --> 02:06:07.679 align:start position:0%
with kermit
 
02:06:07.679 --> 02:06:09.350 align:start position:0%
with kermit
williams

02:06:09.350 --> 02:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
williams
 
02:06:11.030 --> 02:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
that because this bill has come up so
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
many times
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
would you be able to
 
02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:17.510 align:start position:0%
would you be able to
refresh

02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
refresh
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
our memories and inform others that
 
02:06:22.709 --> 02:06:22.719 align:start position:0%
we're not in on these the last
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
few sessions
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
of why we haven't been able to move
 
02:06:28.870 --> 02:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
forward with this i think a lot of
 
02:06:31.350 --> 02:06:31.360 align:start position:0%
people understand the need for it
 
02:06:33.189 --> 02:06:33.199 align:start position:0%
but it hasn't passed and it's very
 
02:06:35.430 --> 02:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
complicated i know that you have
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
amended it a number of times
 
02:06:39.990 --> 02:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
can you help us
 
02:06:42.470 --> 02:06:42.480 align:start position:0%
well yes and uh and and frankly i'm
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
bringing the bill forward because kermit
 
02:06:46.310 --> 02:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
wasn't re-elected and he he did bring
 
02:06:48.550 --> 02:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
this bill forward and he was the prime
 
02:06:51.030 --> 02:06:51.040 align:start position:0%
sponsor last year
 
02:06:51.040 --> 02:06:51.830 align:start position:0%
sponsor last year
the

02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:06:56.790 --> 02:06:56.800 align:start position:0%
is uh different than the bill
 
02:06:58.790 --> 02:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is the same bill as last year but
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that was offered last year
 
02:07:05.430 --> 02:07:05.440 align:start position:0%
was uh substantially amended
 
02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:06.390 align:start position:0%
was uh substantially amended
to

02:07:06.390 --> 02:07:06.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:07:09.189 --> 02:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
make it more streamlined and to make it
 
02:07:13.430 --> 02:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
apply only for complaints that were made
 
02:07:13.440 --> 02:07:14.229 align:start position:0%
apply only for complaints that were made
by

02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
by
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
unit owners so
 
02:07:19.750 --> 02:07:19.760 align:start position:0%
it's unit owners complaints only
 
02:07:22.790 --> 02:07:22.800 align:start position:0%
it also did some other things that
 
02:07:24.709 --> 02:07:24.719 align:start position:0%
this particular bill makes it so it's
 
02:07:26.950 --> 02:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
non-binding so if in fact there is a
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
decision that's made either party the
 
02:07:29.440 --> 02:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
decision that's made either party the
association

02:07:30.870 --> 02:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:07:33.109 --> 02:07:33.119 align:start position:0%
whichever can bring their complaint
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
forward to the superior court if they
 
02:07:37.109 --> 02:07:37.119 align:start position:0%
wish to do so
 
02:07:37.119 --> 02:07:38.550 align:start position:0%
wish to do so
um

02:07:38.550 --> 02:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:42.470 --> 02:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
but it's it's been redesigned uh as of
 
02:07:44.550 --> 02:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
last year last year's bill was
 
02:07:47.189 --> 02:07:47.199 align:start position:0%
redesigned to make it more efficient
 
02:07:48.870 --> 02:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
more practical
 
02:07:48.880 --> 02:07:50.390 align:start position:0%
more practical
um

02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
less bureaucratic and so i think that's
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why the bill perhaps
 
02:07:57.270 --> 02:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
had more success last year than it had
 
02:07:59.350 --> 02:07:59.360 align:start position:0%
in the past and and should have more
 
02:08:01.109 --> 02:08:01.119 align:start position:0%
success this year
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:12.550 --> 02:08:12.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
um i have i have a question and and uh
 
02:08:18.629 --> 02:08:18.639 align:start position:0%
and then a follow-up if i can
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
um does this apply to
 
02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
um does this apply to
cooperatives

02:08:22.920 --> 02:08:22.930 align:start position:0%
cooperatives
 
02:08:22.930 --> 02:08:24.870 align:start position:0%
cooperatives
[Music]

02:08:24.870 --> 02:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:08:28.229 --> 02:08:28.239 align:start position:0%
a group of folks that get together
 
02:08:28.239 --> 02:08:29.270 align:start position:0%
a group of folks that get together
and

02:08:29.270 --> 02:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:08:32.229 --> 02:08:32.239 align:start position:0%
form a cooperative on the land in common
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
but on their home
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
does this apply to them also
 
02:08:39.589 --> 02:08:39.599 align:start position:0%
it does not apply to cooperatives
 
02:08:41.750 --> 02:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations
 
02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
or to
 
02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.709 align:start position:0%
or to
timeshare

02:08:44.709 --> 02:08:44.719 align:start position:0%
timeshare
 
02:08:44.719 --> 02:08:47.189 align:start position:0%
timeshare
and

02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:48.870 --> 02:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that our committee
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
frequently hears issues with regard to
 
02:08:53.830 --> 02:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
or i soon say issues they hear
 
02:08:55.430 --> 02:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
complaints with regard to homeowners
 
02:08:59.270 --> 02:08:59.280 align:start position:0%
associations and cooperatives and
 
02:09:02.229 --> 02:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
i think perhaps legislation needs to be
 
02:09:04.629 --> 02:09:04.639 align:start position:0%
put in place with regard to that as well
 
02:09:07.830 --> 02:09:07.840 align:start position:0%
but this has this bill has nothing to do
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
with cooperatives homeowners association
 
02:09:12.229 --> 02:09:12.239 align:start position:0%
or timeshare
 
02:09:14.310 --> 02:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
follow-up please the question you may
 
02:09:16.310 --> 02:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
inquire yes um
 
02:09:19.589 --> 02:09:19.599 align:start position:0%
i was uh i was hoping the answer was
 
02:09:22.149 --> 02:09:22.159 align:start position:0%
that it did apply to cooperatives
 
02:09:24.870 --> 02:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
because most of the things i hear of
 
02:09:26.629 --> 02:09:26.639 align:start position:0%
um are
 
02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:29.360 align:start position:0%
are related to to co-ops but it's the
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
same exact um
 
02:09:34.629 --> 02:09:34.639 align:start position:0%
type of um community living
 
02:09:37.189 --> 02:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
uh neighbors neighborly disputes come up
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it's the same in condominiums
 
02:09:42.069 --> 02:09:42.079 align:start position:0%
as what i hear in cooperatives that
 
02:09:43.830 --> 02:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
you're living in close quarters and
 
02:09:46.950 --> 02:09:46.960 align:start position:0%
neighbors get on each other's nerves
 
02:09:50.550 --> 02:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
and it would be good uh to have a place
 
02:09:51.910 --> 02:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
to go
 
02:09:53.830 --> 02:09:53.840 align:start position:0%
to um
 
02:09:53.840 --> 02:09:54.550 align:start position:0%
to um
to

02:09:54.550 --> 02:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps resolve their dispute it could
 
02:10:00.550 --> 02:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
be between neighbor to neighbor or or
 
02:10:02.470 --> 02:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
one um
 
02:10:06.310 --> 02:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
one person in the um condominium
 
02:10:09.589 --> 02:10:09.599 align:start position:0%
complex that's unhappy with the board or
 
02:10:13.430 --> 02:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
unhappy with the owner of the
 
02:10:16.149 --> 02:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
property and so it's a good place to go
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
without having to run to court to try to
 
02:10:21.430 --> 02:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
be heard
 
02:10:24.390 --> 02:10:24.400 align:start position:0%
both parties are telling this story
 
02:10:26.149 --> 02:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
and come up with something that seems to
 
02:10:29.589 --> 02:10:29.599 align:start position:0%
be a reasonable uh compromise
 
02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
would you believe that that i think that
 
02:10:34.069 --> 02:10:34.079 align:start position:0%
that this would be a good idea and if we
 
02:10:36.790 --> 02:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
could only expand it to co-ops and
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
associations and others that also would
 
02:10:40.870 --> 02:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
be a good thing
 
02:10:42.950 --> 02:10:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative ham i actually put in an
 
02:10:45.750 --> 02:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
lsr to create uh
 
02:10:47.589 --> 02:10:47.599 align:start position:0%
some regulation with regard to
 
02:10:50.629 --> 02:10:50.639 align:start position:0%
homeowners associations and co-ops but
 
02:10:53.750 --> 02:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't uh bring it forward this year
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
because of the covet year and the
 
02:10:58.069 --> 02:10:58.079 align:start position:0%
complexity of the issue
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
and thought that perhaps bringing it
 
02:11:03.030 --> 02:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
forward in the next year would be better
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:08.390 --> 02:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative van halen
 
02:11:12.790 --> 02:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:11:15.350 --> 02:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
representative i actually also agree uh
 
02:11:17.189 --> 02:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
that some kind of regulation is needed
 
02:11:19.109 --> 02:11:19.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm glad that this once again
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
parallels the manufactured housing
 
02:11:23.430 --> 02:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
legislation because
 
02:11:25.270 --> 02:11:25.280 align:start position:0%
there are things that are tried and true
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
i do have some non-specific questions
 
02:11:29.669 --> 02:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
about some of the language and i'd like
 
02:11:31.510 --> 02:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
to see some of the language tightened up
 
02:11:34.069 --> 02:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
i'm just looking at at um
 
02:11:35.830 --> 02:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
there's a section that talks about the
 
02:11:37.750 --> 02:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
chairperson for the board shall be
 
02:11:40.229 --> 02:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
chosen from blah blah blah but shall
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
serve at the pleasure of the members of
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
the board i'm not sure what that means
 
02:11:45.669 --> 02:11:45.679 align:start position:0%
shall serve at the pleasure of the
 
02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
members of the board um there's another
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
other sections too and i don't mean to
 
02:11:52.069 --> 02:11:52.079 align:start position:0%
diminish at all the work that went into
 
02:11:53.910 --> 02:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
this but i think if we're going to do
 
02:11:55.510 --> 02:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
something of this sort and it's
 
02:11:57.350 --> 02:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
all-encompassing it's a very large piece
 
02:12:00.310 --> 02:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
of legislation that it needs to be done
 
02:12:03.270 --> 02:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
appropriately i'm looking at another um
 
02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:04.870 align:start position:0%
appropriately i'm looking at another um
out-of-context

02:12:04.870 --> 02:12:04.880 align:start position:0%
out-of-context
 
02:12:07.589 --> 02:12:07.599 align:start position:0%
sentence that says i may exclude
 
02:12:09.350 --> 02:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
evidence which in the opinion of the
 
02:12:12.149 --> 02:12:12.159 align:start position:0%
board is immaterial irrelevant or unduly
 
02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
repetitious again these are issues that
 
02:12:18.470 --> 02:12:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and i i did i did begin this morning
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
by stating that i am an owner of a condo
 
02:12:23.109 --> 02:12:23.119 align:start position:0%
and i live in a condo association and by
 
02:12:24.950 --> 02:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
and large the questions and concerns
 
02:12:26.470 --> 02:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
that i have been raised for me since the
 
02:12:27.990 --> 02:12:28.000 align:start position:0%
advent of covid
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
um have been these little itty itchy
 
02:12:31.910 --> 02:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
glitchy kinds of things people have gone
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
back to
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
356b to attempt to answer their
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
questions and reading legislation can be
 
02:12:40.069 --> 02:12:40.079 align:start position:0%
formidable i find it for medical as well
 
02:12:40.079 --> 02:12:40.950 align:start position:0%
formidable i find it for medical as well
so

02:12:40.950 --> 02:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:43.430 --> 02:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
my question is simply this would you be
 
02:12:45.270 --> 02:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
open to going back to tightening some of
 
02:12:47.669 --> 02:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
this language by amendment in order to
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
be sure that we close some of the
 
02:12:52.310 --> 02:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
possible loopholes that um that can't
 
02:12:54.390 --> 02:12:54.400 align:start position:0%
arise because as the previous speaker
 
02:12:54.400 --> 02:12:55.830 align:start position:0%
arise because as the previous speaker
said

02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:12:57.510 --> 02:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
neighboring neighbor can sometimes get
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
very contentious
 
02:13:01.189 --> 02:13:01.199 align:start position:0%
we had issues about whether the tennis
 
02:13:02.550 --> 02:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
court should be closed because it's
 
02:13:03.830 --> 02:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
coveted or not
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
and that was contentious between the
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
tennis players and those who said you
 
02:13:08.790 --> 02:13:08.800 align:start position:0%
know kovit is is threatening my
 
02:13:11.189 --> 02:13:11.199 align:start position:0%
livelihood and i don't care about tennis
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
again i'm sorry for the length of that
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
question uh just to paraphrase and to
 
02:13:16.550 --> 02:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
come to the heart of it would you be
 
02:13:17.669 --> 02:13:17.679 align:start position:0%
open to going through some of the
 
02:13:19.430 --> 02:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
language to make sure that it's a bit
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
tighter as much as possible
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
i i'd be
 
02:13:27.270 --> 02:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
obviously i'd be more than happy to do
 
02:13:29.510 --> 02:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment to make any improvement in
 
02:13:33.109 --> 02:13:33.119 align:start position:0%
the legislation that was needed i
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
i need if i'm going to do that i need to
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
understand what the loopholes are i
 
02:13:39.350 --> 02:13:39.360 align:start position:0%
guess and
 
02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:41.270 align:start position:0%
guess and
and

02:13:41.270 --> 02:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:43.270 --> 02:13:43.280 align:start position:0%
to do that i know we have gone through
 
02:13:44.629 --> 02:13:44.639 align:start position:0%
the legislation i can't tell you how
 
02:13:45.669 --> 02:13:45.679 align:start position:0%
many times we've gone through the
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
legislation to try to tighten it up as
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
much as we can so
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
again i'd be more than happy to amend
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
something if i
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
if i
 
02:13:55.910 --> 02:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
think there's a problem
 
02:13:59.990 --> 02:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you um just a quick follow-up
 
02:14:01.910 --> 02:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm a teacher of english and so maybe i
 
02:14:03.270 --> 02:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
get a little hung up on language
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes but i do think that legalities
 
02:14:08.310 --> 02:14:08.320 align:start position:0%
need to be carefully worded so thank you
 
02:14:09.510 --> 02:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
very much and i'll be looking at the
 
02:14:10.870 --> 02:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
legislation to see if i can be
 
02:14:12.709 --> 02:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
supportive of that idea
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:14:14.079 --> 02:14:15.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:14:17.990 --> 02:14:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh seeing none no no more hands because
 
02:14:19.750 --> 02:14:19.760 align:start position:0%
i know connie wants to put her hand down
 
02:14:20.950 --> 02:14:20.960 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much uh thank you mr
 
02:14:23.679 --> 02:14:24.470 align:start position:0%
uh thank you very much uh thank you mr
chair

02:14:24.470 --> 02:14:24.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
02:14:27.189 --> 02:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
and uh and uh
 
02:14:30.790 --> 02:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
i will now call on will infantine
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
who is also signed up to speak uh
 
02:14:34.709 --> 02:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i will be
 
02:14:38.870 --> 02:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
extremely brief because i know you're
 
02:14:42.149 --> 02:14:42.159 align:start position:0%
busy it seems like i have condos coming
 
02:14:44.629 --> 02:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
out my ears all the time it's part of my
 
02:14:46.790 --> 02:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
life my company insurers have 300
 
02:14:48.629 --> 02:14:48.639 align:start position:0%
different condo associations in new
 
02:14:50.709 --> 02:14:50.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire and massachusetts i've served
 
02:14:52.950 --> 02:14:52.960 align:start position:0%
on four boards before
 
02:14:54.790 --> 02:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i own a condo so i've seen the good
 
02:14:57.109 --> 02:14:57.119 align:start position:0%
the bad and the ugly uh more often than
 
02:14:59.910 --> 02:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
not though it's all does work itself out
 
02:15:03.109 --> 02:15:03.119 align:start position:0%
uh between boards changing of boards
 
02:15:04.390 --> 02:15:04.400 align:start position:0%
people uh
 
02:15:06.069 --> 02:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
deciding that um
 
02:15:09.510 --> 02:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
to resolve an issue um professionally
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
versus legally
 
02:15:12.709 --> 02:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
i don't think the government should be
 
02:15:15.270 --> 02:15:15.280 align:start position:0%
involved uh with disputes can you
 
02:15:17.189 --> 02:15:17.199 align:start position:0%
imagine if we had a dispute resolution
 
02:15:19.270 --> 02:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
board for small claims court we had a
 
02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
few representatives on them uh first of
 
02:15:22.709 --> 02:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
all i don't think representatives should
 
02:15:24.709 --> 02:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
be adjudicating things that kind of a
 
02:15:26.470 --> 02:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
cross between the legislative and
 
02:15:30.229 --> 02:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
judicial branches there in my opinion um
 
02:15:32.550 --> 02:15:32.560 align:start position:0%
this has been reviewed a number of times
 
02:15:33.830 --> 02:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
while it
 
02:15:34.870 --> 02:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:15:37.030 --> 02:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
laudable idea
 
02:15:39.189 --> 02:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
i i don't think it it would be
 
02:15:40.870 --> 02:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
successful i also just don't think the
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
numbers make make any sense
 
02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:44.470 align:start position:0%
numbers make make any sense
um

02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
what you would charge someone to come in
 
02:15:48.069 --> 02:15:48.079 align:start position:0%
and have a dispute versus the cost of
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
the attorneys and the other things so in
 
02:15:55.830 --> 02:15:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:55.840 --> 02:15:56.790 align:start position:0%
 
paying

02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
paying
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
more than it receives
 
02:16:00.229 --> 02:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
for this service and i'm just not sure
 
02:16:02.629 --> 02:16:02.639 align:start position:0%
that's the goal of government thank you
 
02:16:05.030 --> 02:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
02:16:08.550 --> 02:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
thank you for being a model of brevity
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from committee members
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh seeing seeing uh oh representative
 
02:16:17.669 --> 02:16:17.679 align:start position:0%
abramson has a question
 
02:16:19.669 --> 02:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
sorry mr chair i was cleaning my uh
 
02:16:21.669 --> 02:16:21.679 align:start position:0%
keyboard and i had to turn it off it's a
 
02:16:23.990 --> 02:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
bluetooth keyboard um
 
02:16:25.750 --> 02:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
same question thank you representative
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
infantine um for taking my question uh
 
02:16:30.870 --> 02:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
same question as before do you see any
 
02:16:33.429 --> 02:16:33.439 align:start position:0%
reason why you know we already have this
 
02:16:35.110 --> 02:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
housing appeals board with three
 
02:16:37.910 --> 02:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
salaried members is there any reason why
 
02:16:39.750 --> 02:16:39.760 align:start position:0%
disputes couldn't be taken there before
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
you know i don't know enough about what
 
02:16:47.750 --> 02:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
that board does to see whether it fits
 
02:16:50.469 --> 02:16:50.479 align:start position:0%
within um
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
what how they what they were established
 
02:16:53.349 --> 02:16:53.359 align:start position:0%
to do
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so i can't i'm sorry i can't answer
 
02:16:57.030 --> 02:16:57.040 align:start position:0%
that because i just don't know enough
 
02:16:59.669 --> 02:16:59.679 align:start position:0%
about what that board does
 
02:17:01.110 --> 02:17:01.120 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and for members
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
that's under rsa 679 that's uh took
 
02:17:06.389 --> 02:17:06.399 align:start position:0%
effect july of last year
 
02:17:09.190 --> 02:17:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett
 
02:17:13.110 --> 02:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering uh representative
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
infantine if you have any idea how many
 
02:17:20.389 --> 02:17:20.399 align:start position:0%
condo bills we get regarding disputes
 
02:17:22.709 --> 02:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
um this committee deals with this year
 
02:17:24.629 --> 02:17:24.639 align:start position:0%
after year after year and
 
02:17:26.950 --> 02:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
i wondered if you realize that
 
02:17:30.070 --> 02:17:30.080 align:start position:0%
this dispute resolution board was really
 
02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
one of the aims has been to try to keep
 
02:17:35.830 --> 02:17:35.840 align:start position:0%
the legislature out of all of these
 
02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:37.030 align:start position:0%
the legislature out of all of these
disputes

02:17:37.030 --> 02:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
disputes
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
so that they have a place to go just
 
02:17:43.110 --> 02:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
like the manufactured housing does
 
02:17:44.870 --> 02:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative bartlett i am aware i
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
do watch these year and year out and i
 
02:17:49.030 --> 02:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
was very pleased four or five years ago
 
02:17:50.070 --> 02:17:50.080 align:start position:0%
when i think it was representative
 
02:17:52.870 --> 02:17:52.880 align:start position:0%
almighty and current uh and i'm sorry i
 
02:17:54.070 --> 02:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
can't remember
 
02:17:58.150 --> 02:17:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:00.709 --> 02:18:00.719 align:start position:0%
the whole thing really did a great job
 
02:18:02.629 --> 02:18:02.639 align:start position:0%
in and revising the entire uh
 
02:18:04.790 --> 02:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
condominium off and then it was amazing
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
to me that the following year
 
02:18:10.150 --> 02:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
three or four more bills it does seem um
 
02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:12.160 align:start position:0%
like there are a lot of these issues and
 
02:18:13.669 --> 02:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
disputes but when you have people living
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
in the community and certain rules
 
02:18:17.669 --> 02:18:17.679 align:start position:0%
you're always going to have these things
 
02:18:17.679 --> 02:18:18.629 align:start position:0%
you're always going to have these things
um

02:18:18.629 --> 02:18:18.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
so yes i do you know you see all of
 
02:18:21.750 --> 02:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
these things but there are other
 
02:18:23.990 --> 02:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
mechanisms in place auto dealers have
 
02:18:26.870 --> 02:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
their own dispute resolution with with
 
02:18:29.110 --> 02:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
um customers and the attorneys have
 
02:18:30.309 --> 02:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
something as well
 
02:18:30.319 --> 02:18:31.910 align:start position:0%
something as well
uh

02:18:31.910 --> 02:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:18:35.349 --> 02:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
whether it's an individual outside group
 
02:18:36.950 --> 02:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
that would want to be involved with this
 
02:18:38.389 --> 02:18:38.399 align:start position:0%
i think that makes more sense than
 
02:18:40.150 --> 02:18:40.160 align:start position:0%
having it uh involved with the
 
02:18:40.160 --> 02:18:42.150 align:start position:0%
having it uh involved with the
government

02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
government
 
02:18:44.150 --> 02:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
now follow up here's a question main
 
02:18:46.629 --> 02:18:46.639 align:start position:0%
choir thank you so um
 
02:18:46.639 --> 02:18:47.429 align:start position:0%
choir thank you so um
well

02:18:47.429 --> 02:18:47.439 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:18:49.030 --> 02:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
since you brought it up
 
02:18:51.190 --> 02:18:51.200 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to have a to come up with a
 
02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:52.389 align:start position:0%
i'd like you to have a to come up with a
suggestion

02:18:52.389 --> 02:18:52.399 align:start position:0%
suggestion
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
of how you think the thousands and
 
02:18:57.750 --> 02:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of condominium unit owners
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
that do have problems
 
02:18:59.599 --> 02:19:00.629 align:start position:0%
that do have problems
could

02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:19:00.639 --> 02:19:01.669 align:start position:0%
could
um

02:19:01.669 --> 02:19:01.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
resolve these problems other than a
 
02:19:05.750 --> 02:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
resolution just
 
02:19:09.190 --> 02:19:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:10.790 --> 02:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
would i believe i do believe no i'm
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
asking him if he's got another idea
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
i mean we spent hours and i mean years
 
02:19:19.110 --> 02:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
on this
 
02:19:22.469 --> 02:19:22.479 align:start position:0%
i believe uh uh attorney general had
 
02:19:24.150 --> 02:19:24.160 align:start position:0%
some ideas a few years ago of an
 
02:19:24.160 --> 02:19:25.270 align:start position:0%
some ideas a few years ago of an
alternative

02:19:25.270 --> 02:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
alternative
 
02:19:25.280 --> 02:19:26.549 align:start position:0%
alternative
um

02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:28.549 --> 02:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
outside of government um and i just
 
02:19:30.629 --> 02:19:30.639 align:start position:0%
don't recall that and i see that he's
 
02:19:32.309 --> 02:19:32.319 align:start position:0%
watching maybe he can answer that
 
02:19:35.190 --> 02:19:35.200 align:start position:0%
question um but you're right i mean
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
there are disputes that need to be
 
02:19:38.790 --> 02:19:38.800 align:start position:0%
resolved and many of them are taken care
 
02:19:38.800 --> 02:19:39.669 align:start position:0%
resolved and many of them are taken care
of

02:19:39.669 --> 02:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
uh but i've seen them all i've seen
 
02:19:43.030 --> 02:19:43.040 align:start position:0%
really serious ones and i've seen
 
02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
ridiculously frivolous ones and
 
02:19:47.589 --> 02:19:47.599 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:19:51.510 --> 02:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
there should be a better mechanism um
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
outside of government but i i don't want
 
02:19:56.870 --> 02:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
to keep repeating myself
 
02:19:59.030 --> 02:19:59.040 align:start position:0%
great uh representative abramson do you
 
02:20:03.510 --> 02:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:04.950 --> 02:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
sorry about that that's my keyboard
 
02:20:06.790 --> 02:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
again okay
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
02:20:10.550 --> 02:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh well
 
02:20:11.830 --> 02:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have uh gary daddario to
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.429 --> 02:20:21.439 align:start position:0%
hi good morning again and thank you
 
02:20:23.110 --> 02:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
again for the time
 
02:20:23.120 --> 02:20:23.990 align:start position:0%
again for the time
um

02:20:23.990 --> 02:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:26.230 --> 02:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i'll start by saying that i
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
agree with comments made by
 
02:20:29.750 --> 02:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
representative infantine
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
especially with respect to the fact that
 
02:20:34.070 --> 02:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
this will
 
02:20:36.469 --> 02:20:36.479 align:start position:0%
certainly at the end of the day impose
 
02:20:40.070 --> 02:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
some measure of cost for the state
 
02:20:43.270 --> 02:20:43.280 align:start position:0%
that i'm not sure is is warranted
 
02:20:45.670 --> 02:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
i guess before i get into the bill i'll
 
02:20:47.030 --> 02:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
start with the question that was
 
02:20:48.389 --> 02:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
recently asked about what the
 
02:20:49.910 --> 02:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
alternatives are
 
02:20:52.070 --> 02:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
and i would say again
 
02:20:54.389 --> 02:20:54.399 align:start position:0%
that as a condominium practitioner i see
 
02:20:56.309 --> 02:20:56.319 align:start position:0%
these things addressed within the
 
02:20:59.110 --> 02:20:59.120 align:start position:0%
association's governing documents and so
 
02:21:01.030 --> 02:21:01.040 align:start position:0%
as a for instance
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
there's always a provision by which a
 
02:21:05.990 --> 02:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
number of unit owners can command a
 
02:21:07.910 --> 02:21:07.920 align:start position:0%
special meeting to be had by an
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
association there are also provisions in
 
02:21:12.550 --> 02:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
individual condominium documents that
 
02:21:16.150 --> 02:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
allow unit owners to have a hearing
 
02:21:18.550 --> 02:21:18.560 align:start position:0%
internally before their own board
 
02:21:20.630 --> 02:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
at the condominium association relative
 
02:21:20.640 --> 02:21:21.590 align:start position:0%
at the condominium association relative
to

02:21:21.590 --> 02:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:21:24.710 --> 02:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
an alleged violation or an issue so
 
02:21:27.750 --> 02:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
those are are some other avenues uh to
 
02:21:29.750 --> 02:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
the extent that there would be a 250
 
02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
dollar filing fee here uh i would note
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
that that would cover
 
02:21:37.110 --> 02:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
at a minimum a consultation for a unit
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
owner to have with an attorney who may
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
be able to explain to them you know once
 
02:21:42.550 --> 02:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
they hear
 
02:21:45.830 --> 02:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
the problem or complaint at issue
 
02:21:48.550 --> 02:21:48.560 align:start position:0%
either how to go about it or be able to
 
02:21:51.030 --> 02:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
explain to them that it is or or isn't
 
02:21:53.030 --> 02:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
something that can be addressed by an
 
02:21:56.630 --> 02:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
individual unit owner uh somehow
 
02:21:58.230 --> 02:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
it looks nice
 
02:21:58.240 --> 02:22:00.710 align:start position:0%
it looks nice
rich

02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:05.910 --> 02:22:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:08.070 --> 02:22:08.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to the particulars of the
 
02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
bill um and i guess we're at a good
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
point of transition for this
 
02:22:12.399 --> 02:22:13.590 align:start position:0%
point of transition for this
um

02:22:13.590 --> 02:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:16.870 --> 02:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
it states now it reads very much as a
 
02:22:19.670 --> 02:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
one-way street meaning that unit owner
 
02:22:21.830 --> 02:22:21.840 align:start position:0%
complaints would be accepted by this
 
02:22:23.670 --> 02:22:23.680 align:start position:0%
board and
 
02:22:25.510 --> 02:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
the language here indicates that there
 
02:22:26.950 --> 02:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
would be complaints
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
against the board meaning that the
 
02:22:30.309 --> 02:22:30.319 align:start position:0%
association board had done something
 
02:22:32.070 --> 02:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
wrong so
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
two pieces we see
 
02:22:36.389 --> 02:22:36.399 align:start position:0%
lacking here one would be for an
 
02:22:36.399 --> 02:22:37.830 align:start position:0%
lacking here one would be for an
association

02:22:37.830 --> 02:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
association
 
02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
to be able to seek some assistance from
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
this board if this board were to exist
 
02:22:44.710 --> 02:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
to deal with a unit owner
 
02:22:47.110 --> 02:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
who is violating the rules
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
the other problem
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
perhaps a more significant problem
 
02:22:53.030 --> 02:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
because it's been mentioned several
 
02:22:55.190 --> 02:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
times that there are a lot of unit owner
 
02:22:57.030 --> 02:22:57.040 align:start position:0%
to unit owner disputes because when
 
02:22:59.510 --> 02:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
people live you know this close to each
 
02:23:01.590 --> 02:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
other they might have disagreements and
 
02:23:01.600 --> 02:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
other they might have disagreements and
issues

02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
issues
 
02:23:05.190 --> 02:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
this language about a unit owner
 
02:23:06.870 --> 02:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
complaining that the board is doing
 
02:23:10.150 --> 02:23:10.160 align:start position:0%
things wrong means that this board uh in
 
02:23:11.990 --> 02:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
the current form of this bill
 
02:23:15.270 --> 02:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
would also not be hearing complaints
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
from one unit owner to another and so i
 
02:23:20.550 --> 02:23:20.560 align:start position:0%
think if this board we're going to exist
 
02:23:23.429 --> 02:23:23.439 align:start position:0%
at all it probably makes sense for it to
 
02:23:25.030 --> 02:23:25.040 align:start position:0%
exist to service
 
02:23:26.870 --> 02:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
whatever types of issues people are
 
02:23:29.110 --> 02:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
trying to address and not just the
 
02:23:31.910 --> 02:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
singular focus of a unit owner doesn't
 
02:23:35.670 --> 02:23:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:39.110 --> 02:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
another issue that i i see here is that
 
02:23:41.750 --> 02:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the language provides for a review to be
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
done of the complaint
 
02:23:45.590 --> 02:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
on an initial basis and for
 
02:23:47.830 --> 02:23:47.840 align:start position:0%
determination to be made about whether
 
02:23:50.150 --> 02:23:50.160 align:start position:0%
or not the complaint has merit enough to
 
02:23:51.510 --> 02:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
go forward
 
02:23:54.710 --> 02:23:54.720 align:start position:0%
now in in concept i love that idea i
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
think it makes perfect sense any
 
02:23:58.550 --> 02:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
complaint should be reviewed at the
 
02:24:01.030 --> 02:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
outset to see what kind of merit is
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
there about where something should go
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
the problem i have and it may very well
 
02:24:08.309 --> 02:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
get to due process concerns for an
 
02:24:09.910 --> 02:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
association board
 
02:24:13.510 --> 02:24:13.520 align:start position:0%
is that that decision gets made
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
the association has an opportunity to
 
02:24:19.510 --> 02:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
file anything with this board
 
02:24:21.990 --> 02:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
now the problem there becomes that i
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
would propose to you that if you look at
 
02:24:26.309 --> 02:24:26.319 align:start position:0%
a complaint in a vacuum
 
02:24:28.469 --> 02:24:28.479 align:start position:0%
it will almost always have an air of
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
legitimacy about it in other words a
 
02:24:33.190 --> 02:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
unit owner might say i was at the annual
 
02:24:33.200 --> 02:24:34.230 align:start position:0%
unit owner might say i was at the annual
meeting

02:24:34.230 --> 02:24:34.240 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:24:36.230 --> 02:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
i tried to vote it's the most important
 
02:24:39.190 --> 02:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
thing we do as unit owners and they
 
02:24:42.070 --> 02:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't accept my ballot and so my vote
 
02:24:42.080 --> 02:24:43.270 align:start position:0%
wouldn't accept my ballot and so my vote
didn't

02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
didn't
 
02:24:45.110 --> 02:24:45.120 align:start position:0%
and in a vacuum that complaint will
 
02:24:47.590 --> 02:24:47.600 align:start position:0%
always look very legitimate but if the
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
association only had a moment or only
 
02:24:53.349 --> 02:24:53.359 align:start position:0%
had the ability to to hand in a written
 
02:24:56.230 --> 02:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
statement of some kind about this case
 
02:24:58.150 --> 02:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
they might educate the board to the fact
 
02:25:00.710 --> 02:25:00.720 align:start position:0%
that at this association the governing
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
documents and this is real and it's not
 
02:25:04.950 --> 02:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
uncommon require unit owners to be in
 
02:25:06.630 --> 02:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
good standing
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
in order to cast their vote and maybe
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
this unit owner hasn't paid a condo fee
 
02:25:12.070 --> 02:25:12.080 align:start position:0%
in a year
 
02:25:14.389 --> 02:25:14.399 align:start position:0%
and so by their own documents definition
 
02:25:16.150 --> 02:25:16.160 align:start position:0%
they're not in good standing and that's
 
02:25:18.309 --> 02:25:18.319 align:start position:0%
why their ballot didn't come in
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
my point is only that uh to the extent
 
02:25:23.190 --> 02:25:23.200 align:start position:0%
and that's how the language here is at
 
02:25:25.590 --> 02:25:25.600 align:start position:0%
present to the extent the board decides
 
02:25:27.270 --> 02:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
whether or not a complaint has merit
 
02:25:29.670 --> 02:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
based only on the complaint it's going
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
to be hard for those decisions to not
 
02:25:34.710 --> 02:25:34.720 align:start position:0%
all come out one way because in a vacuum
 
02:25:36.630 --> 02:25:36.640 align:start position:0%
the complaints always look like there's
 
02:25:39.270 --> 02:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
something there and really you need at
 
02:25:41.670 --> 02:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
least just a taste of information from
 
02:25:43.270 --> 02:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
the other side
 
02:25:44.790 --> 02:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to really weigh the
 
02:25:47.030 --> 02:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
situation and see whether or not there's
 
02:25:49.110 --> 02:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
a legitimate dispute
 
02:25:50.710 --> 02:25:50.720 align:start position:0%
so that's an issue i have as well with
 
02:25:53.429 --> 02:25:53.439 align:start position:0%
the particular wording
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
in in terms of the process here it's
 
02:25:57.670 --> 02:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
been noted that the parties would not be
 
02:25:59.990 --> 02:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
denied access to court because they
 
02:26:02.309 --> 02:26:02.319 align:start position:0%
could appeal these decisions and get
 
02:26:05.349 --> 02:26:05.359 align:start position:0%
into court but i would note that it also
 
02:26:07.349 --> 02:26:07.359 align:start position:0%
says in the bill that this board would
 
02:26:10.309 --> 02:26:10.319 align:start position:0%
not be bound by the rules of evidence
 
02:26:13.190 --> 02:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
and it says in the bill that if it is
 
02:26:14.550 --> 02:26:14.560 align:start position:0%
not appealed
 
02:26:16.469 --> 02:26:16.479 align:start position:0%
the decision of this board would then go
 
02:26:18.469 --> 02:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
to superior court where it would be
 
02:26:20.230 --> 02:26:20.240 align:start position:0%
entered in the nature of a judgment of a
 
02:26:21.910 --> 02:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
superior court case
 
02:26:24.230 --> 02:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
and so oddly enough from a legal
 
02:26:26.150 --> 02:26:26.160 align:start position:0%
perspective you would have a dispute
 
02:26:28.230 --> 02:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
resolution board who's not bound by the
 
02:26:31.270 --> 02:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence that makes a decision
 
02:26:33.190 --> 02:26:33.200 align:start position:0%
that unless it's appealed
 
02:26:35.030 --> 02:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
ends up being endorsed as if it was a
 
02:26:37.030 --> 02:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
decision of the superior court where the
 
02:26:39.910 --> 02:26:39.920 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence would have applied
 
02:26:41.670 --> 02:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
and so procedurally i i think that
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
there's a problem there
 
02:26:44.710 --> 02:26:44.720 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:26:46.309 --> 02:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
and i know others are are waiting to
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
speak so i think at this point i'll
 
02:26:50.950 --> 02:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
limit my comments to that
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:26:53.910 --> 02:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh we do have a couple of questions uh
 
02:26:57.190 --> 02:26:57.200 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett you inquire
 
02:26:57.200 --> 02:26:58.710 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett you inquire
um

02:26:58.710 --> 02:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:01.190 --> 02:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
would you believe though that
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
the 250
 
02:27:02.479 --> 02:27:03.590 align:start position:0%
the 250
fee

02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
fee
 
02:27:06.630 --> 02:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
is one trying to get rid of frivolous
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
complaints because somebody has to think
 
02:27:10.550 --> 02:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
about whether they want to spend 250 to
 
02:27:13.110 --> 02:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
go before this dispute resolution board
 
02:27:14.230 --> 02:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
but also
 
02:27:14.240 --> 02:27:15.750 align:start position:0%
but also
um

02:27:15.750 --> 02:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:17.910 --> 02:27:17.920 align:start position:0%
it's not that even if they decide to do
 
02:27:17.920 --> 02:27:19.110 align:start position:0%
it's not that even if they decide to do
that

02:27:19.110 --> 02:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:27:22.070 --> 02:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
and and pay the 250
 
02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
and and pay the 250
fee

02:27:23.510 --> 02:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
fee
 
02:27:25.910 --> 02:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're not giving up any rights
 
02:27:25.920 --> 02:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
they're not giving up any rights
this

02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:28.309 --> 02:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:27:30.550 --> 02:27:30.560 align:start position:0%
i mean don't you think that this kind of
 
02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:31.590 align:start position:0%
i mean don't you think that this kind of
board

02:27:31.590 --> 02:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:27:33.030 --> 02:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
could take care of
 
02:27:35.349 --> 02:27:35.359 align:start position:0%
many of the smaller issues
 
02:27:35.359 --> 02:27:36.309 align:start position:0%
many of the smaller issues
um

02:27:36.309 --> 02:27:36.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
that come before these condominium
 
02:27:38.479 --> 02:27:40.710 align:start position:0%
that come before these condominium
boards

02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
boards
 
02:27:40.720 --> 02:27:41.670 align:start position:0%
boards
um

02:27:41.670 --> 02:27:41.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:43.510 --> 02:27:43.520 align:start position:0%
i would say i agree with both of those
 
02:27:46.070 --> 02:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
points i think that certainly a filing
 
02:27:46.080 --> 02:27:47.110 align:start position:0%
points i think that certainly a filing
fee

02:27:47.110 --> 02:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
fee
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
and something in the nature of 250
 
02:27:51.750 --> 02:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
dollars will be uh you know a bit of an
 
02:27:51.760 --> 02:27:52.870 align:start position:0%
dollars will be uh you know a bit of an
impediment

02:27:52.870 --> 02:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
impediment
 
02:27:55.110 --> 02:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
to some who would make a frivolous claim
 
02:27:57.510 --> 02:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
i would agree with that i would also
 
02:27:59.270 --> 02:27:59.280 align:start position:0%
agree that i'm sure that this board if
 
02:28:02.230 --> 02:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
it existed um would be performing some
 
02:28:02.240 --> 02:28:03.190 align:start position:0%
it existed um would be performing some
function

02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
function
 
02:28:06.630 --> 02:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
um but again i i think that i see this
 
02:28:08.950 --> 02:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
type of language in a lot of association
 
02:28:11.349 --> 02:28:11.359 align:start position:0%
documents where they can have their own
 
02:28:13.910 --> 02:28:13.920 align:start position:0%
special meetings in their own hearings
 
02:28:17.270 --> 02:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
i also think that that 250 dollars
 
02:28:19.910 --> 02:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
most unit owners
 
02:28:21.750 --> 02:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't because it isn't part of the real
 
02:28:23.670 --> 02:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
estate closing process they don't
 
02:28:26.230 --> 02:28:26.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily know what they've purchased
 
02:28:28.389 --> 02:28:28.399 align:start position:0%
when they purchase a condominium unit
 
02:28:30.710 --> 02:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
and so as a for instance i get a lot of
 
02:28:31.990 --> 02:28:32.000 align:start position:0%
calls from union owners who have
 
02:28:34.150 --> 02:28:34.160 align:start position:0%
received a violation letter and their
 
02:28:37.270 --> 02:28:37.280 align:start position:0%
new unit owners and what they tell me is
 
02:28:38.710 --> 02:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
you and your rules
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
need to get lost because i'm not
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
anybody's tenant i pay my mortgage i own
 
02:28:44.710 --> 02:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
my unit
 
02:28:46.870 --> 02:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
and so they don't even realize that even
 
02:28:48.950 --> 02:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
though they own the unit there are
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
restrictions that they're required to
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
comply with because they're part of a
 
02:28:55.270 --> 02:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
condominium community
 
02:28:57.190 --> 02:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
and so again to the extent that someone
 
02:28:59.830 --> 02:28:59.840 align:start position:0%
were going to spend 250 dollars i think
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
a consultation with an attorney might
 
02:29:04.070 --> 02:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
help them a lot because someone might be
 
02:29:06.309 --> 02:29:06.319 align:start position:0%
able to explain to them whether or not
 
02:29:09.110 --> 02:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
there really is an issue there to pursue
 
02:29:11.510 --> 02:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
but your point i also think that if this
 
02:29:13.270 --> 02:29:13.280 align:start position:0%
board were going to
 
02:29:15.830 --> 02:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
address a lot of the concerns out there
 
02:29:17.270 --> 02:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
it would need to be the case that
 
02:29:19.830 --> 02:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
associations could apply to it too to
 
02:29:21.750 --> 02:29:21.760 align:start position:0%
deal with a unit owner committing
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
violations or that when you have these
 
02:29:26.550 --> 02:29:26.560 align:start position:0%
neighbor to neighbor disputes
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they be able to go to this board
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
right now it really just deals and i'm
 
02:29:33.990 --> 02:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
not sure why but it really just deals
 
02:29:36.469 --> 02:29:36.479 align:start position:0%
with this singular notion of a unit
 
02:29:39.030 --> 02:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
owner wants to complain that their board
 
02:29:40.630 --> 02:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
isn't doing it right
 
02:29:40.640 --> 02:29:42.070 align:start position:0%
isn't doing it right
and

02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:29:44.230 --> 02:29:44.240 align:start position:0%
it seems that to the extent that state
 
02:29:46.550 --> 02:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
resources were being expended on this
 
02:29:46.560 --> 02:29:47.750 align:start position:0%
resources were being expended on this
board

02:29:47.750 --> 02:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
board
 
02:29:49.910 --> 02:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
that it should have a broader function
 
02:29:52.790 --> 02:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:55.190 --> 02:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
great uh representative abramson has a
 
02:29:55.200 --> 02:29:56.309 align:start position:0%
great uh representative abramson has a
question

02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:29:59.910 --> 02:29:59.920 align:start position:0%
taking the same question do you see any
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
problem with sending these cases to that
 
02:30:04.150 --> 02:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
the housing board of appeals under rsa
 
02:30:07.830 --> 02:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
679 couldn't we just replace this entire
 
02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
board with uh one that's already
 
02:30:09.520 --> 02:30:11.750 align:start position:0%
board with uh one that's already
existing

02:30:11.750 --> 02:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
existing
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately if i'm going to be
 
02:30:15.990 --> 02:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
honest i would have to give the same
 
02:30:17.830 --> 02:30:17.840 align:start position:0%
answer that representative infantine
 
02:30:19.510 --> 02:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
gave um
 
02:30:21.429 --> 02:30:21.439 align:start position:0%
i don't know enough about that other
 
02:30:24.070 --> 02:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
board but my wheelhouse is strictly with
 
02:30:27.110 --> 02:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
condominium associations um and so i
 
02:30:29.030 --> 02:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
just i'm not familiar enough with that
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
other board to say whether or not
 
02:30:33.349 --> 02:30:33.359 align:start position:0%
they would be a good source
 
02:30:36.230 --> 02:30:36.240 align:start position:0%
for these disputes to to land with
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
fair enough
 
02:30:40.150 --> 02:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
i would interject and say that the
 
02:30:43.270 --> 02:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
boards are designed to address the issue
 
02:30:45.429 --> 02:30:45.439 align:start position:0%
so the manufactured housing board is
 
02:30:47.030 --> 02:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
more the expertise on it is about
 
02:30:49.670 --> 02:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing not necessarily
 
02:30:49.680 --> 02:30:50.950 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing not necessarily
condos

02:30:50.950 --> 02:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
condos
 
02:30:53.110 --> 02:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
so the condo board is the theory is that
 
02:30:55.110 --> 02:30:55.120 align:start position:0%
the people are on there are people who
 
02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:55.750 align:start position:0%
the people are on there are people who
are

02:30:55.750 --> 02:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:30:57.590 --> 02:30:57.600 align:start position:0%
aware of the issues that are going on in
 
02:31:01.030 --> 02:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
condos not manufactured housing
 
02:31:04.710 --> 02:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much gary and
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:12.389 --> 02:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
hello thank you representative hunt um
 
02:31:13.910 --> 02:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be brief and i certainly
 
02:31:16.389 --> 02:31:16.399 align:start position:0%
echo what what gary has just said
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
i think this is a bill whose heart is in
 
02:31:20.309 --> 02:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
the right place but uh in spite of the
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
250 dollar filing fee i think uh this is
 
02:31:26.150 --> 02:31:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to result in associations having
 
02:31:28.710 --> 02:31:28.720 align:start position:0%
to uh expend a lot and legal fees
 
02:31:31.510 --> 02:31:31.520 align:start position:0%
defending themselves in these cases of
 
02:31:32.950 --> 02:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
course they're not required to hire
 
02:31:34.550 --> 02:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
counsel but when you're talking about a
 
02:31:36.870 --> 02:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
decision that will essentially be a
 
02:31:38.150 --> 02:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
judgment against them if they don't
 
02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
appeal it you better get it right the
 
02:31:44.070 --> 02:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
first time um so when owners have
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
issues that perhaps are frivolous
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps are a misunderstanding
 
02:31:51.110 --> 02:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
to expend
 
02:31:52.710 --> 02:31:52.720 align:start position:0%
a thousand or two thousand dollars to
 
02:31:56.469 --> 02:31:56.479 align:start position:0%
defend yourself is is awfully onerous um
 
02:31:58.309 --> 02:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
superior court is not the the only
 
02:32:01.030 --> 02:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
option for owners they can file a in in
 
02:32:03.349 --> 02:32:03.359 align:start position:0%
district court or circuit court uh they
 
02:32:05.110 --> 02:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
can file in small claims court within
 
02:32:07.910 --> 02:32:07.920 align:start position:0%
circuit court and that's very cheap uh
 
02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:08.790 align:start position:0%
circuit court and that's very cheap uh
and

02:32:08.790 --> 02:32:08.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:32:10.710 --> 02:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
relatively fast
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
um so i'm opposed to the bill on that
 
02:32:15.750 --> 02:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
basis that it's going to cause
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
associations to spend a lot of money uh
 
02:32:20.389 --> 02:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
in addition to everything set forth uh
 
02:32:22.830 --> 02:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
by gary previously thank you very
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
much okay any questions representative
 
02:32:26.160 --> 02:32:39.030 align:start position:0%
much okay any questions representative

rich

02:32:41.590 --> 02:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
oh you took your head okay oh he's
 
02:32:46.150 --> 02:32:46.160 align:start position:0%
waving off okay okay okay any other
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions from anybody

questions from anybody
uh

02:32:49.750 --> 02:32:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:32:54.710 --> 02:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
like to wrap up uh so yes representative
 
02:32:59.990 --> 02:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
gordon you can speak
 
02:33:02.469 --> 02:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
i i don't want to i don't necessarily
 
02:33:04.790 --> 02:33:04.800 align:start position:0%
need to wrap up and and i appreciate all
 
02:33:06.550 --> 02:33:06.560 align:start position:0%
of the testimony we've heard here today

04:09:49.030 --> 04:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
up when i did it but i i realized before
 
04:09:50.710 --> 04:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
after i did it i did not turn off my
 
04:09:52.710 --> 04:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
microphone when i was well you're
 
04:09:55.910 --> 04:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
unmicked all the time john i am i i i
 
04:09:58.229 --> 04:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
the only time i mic up is when i i hear

out like garbage man and other things
 
04:10:02.550 --> 04:10:02.560 align:start position:0%

04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
to me turning that thing on and off
 
04:10:05.910 --> 04:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
would be you know it's like it's like
 
04:10:07.269 --> 04:10:07.279 align:start position:0%
the speaker you know how this figure
 
04:10:09.830 --> 04:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
always seems to forget to turn the click
 
04:10:11.349 --> 04:10:11.359 align:start position:0%
the switch on and
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
i understand the importance of turning
 
04:10:14.550 --> 04:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
your mic off you want to hear people
 
04:10:16.070 --> 04:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
hear what your hands say but i feel like
 
04:10:16.080 --> 04:10:17.030 align:start position:0%
hear what your hands say but i feel like
i'm

04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:10:21.189 --> 04:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:24.229 --> 04:10:24.239 align:start position:0%
i have two very large shepherds that get
 
04:10:25.750 --> 04:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
the wind
 
04:10:28.710 --> 04:10:28.720 align:start position:0%
so i keep mine off for that
 
04:10:30.309 --> 04:10:30.319 align:start position:0%
or if my daughters decide to end on the
 
04:10:33.590 --> 04:10:33.600 align:start position:0%
stairs in an argument for something
 
04:10:35.990 --> 04:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
i have two black labs and they are out
 
04:10:37.510 --> 04:10:37.520 align:start position:0%
of the house because they will bark at
 
04:10:39.110 --> 04:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
any moment for anything
 
04:10:39.120 --> 04:10:40.710 align:start position:0%
any moment for anything
yeah

04:10:40.710 --> 04:10:40.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:10:42.790 --> 04:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
especially i reloaded the bird feeder
 
04:10:44.710 --> 04:10:44.720 align:start position:0%
and and the birds are going crazy and
 
04:10:46.389 --> 04:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
the dogs are
 
04:10:48.229 --> 04:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
really enjoying the entertainment
 
04:10:50.389 --> 04:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i've got one shepherd who likes to
 
04:10:51.510 --> 04:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
talk to me
 
04:10:53.349 --> 04:10:53.359 align:start position:0%
if i don't pay attention to him right
 
04:10:55.189 --> 04:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
away and it's
 
04:10:57.110 --> 04:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
and he'll do that for 20 minutes while i
 
04:10:58.790 --> 04:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
try to ignore him and make him go away
 
04:10:58.800 --> 04:11:02.150 align:start position:0%
try to ignore him and make him go away
so

04:11:02.150 --> 04:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:04.790 --> 04:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
and i have one puppy that is barking at
 
04:11:06.710 --> 04:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
everything and they're painting the
 
04:11:08.309 --> 04:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
common areas
 
04:11:15.830 --> 04:11:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
all right so i count 16 people
 
04:11:22.710 --> 04:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
which is a quorum but that means we're
 
04:11:23.910 --> 04:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
missing people
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
all right mr chairman can you hear me
 
04:11:28.469 --> 04:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:28.479 --> 04:11:29.590 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:11:29.590 --> 04:11:29.600 align:start position:0%

our first vote yep first one i'm
recording

04:12:11.830 --> 04:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
recording
 
04:12:13.990 --> 04:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
so would you like to go first or less i
 
04:12:16.229 --> 04:12:16.239 align:start position:0%
know there's a difference of opinion on
 
04:12:16.239 --> 04:12:18.389 align:start position:0%
know there's a difference of opinion on
that

04:12:18.389 --> 04:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:12:19.510 --> 04:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:12:21.590 --> 04:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
i'll i'm fine with going last
 
04:12:24.870 --> 04:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
okay that's fine um in the old days i
 
04:12:26.550 --> 04:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
didn't have to vote at all unless to
 
04:12:28.229 --> 04:12:28.239 align:start position:0%
make her break a tie
 
04:12:30.710 --> 04:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
and that was i was uh
 
04:12:34.469 --> 04:12:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:34.479 --> 04:12:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:12:35.189 --> 04:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:38.070 --> 04:12:38.080 align:start position:0%

the total has the motion first and
 
04:12:45.030 --> 04:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
second and the vote total
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%

billing fees
 
04:18:21.269 --> 04:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
representative terry seconded by
 
04:18:23.189 --> 04:18:23.199 align:start position:0%
representative patusik moves in
 
04:18:25.110 --> 04:18:25.120 align:start position:0%
expedient the legislate
 
04:18:26.710 --> 04:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
and representative terry is recognized
 
04:18:31.269 --> 04:18:31.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.269 --> 04:18:35.279 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh
 
04:18:38.070 --> 04:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
to be succinct is uh as possible i'm
 
04:18:40.309 --> 04:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
going to uh read the following number
 
04:18:41.990 --> 04:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
one of four
 
04:18:43.429 --> 04:18:43.439 align:start position:0%
the bill would transfer what is
 
04:18:45.830 --> 04:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
effectively a user fee to all who engage
 
04:18:47.910 --> 04:18:47.920 align:start position:0%
for services with the biller that is the
 
04:18:47.920 --> 04:18:49.030 align:start position:0%
for services with the biller that is the
provider

04:18:49.030 --> 04:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
provider
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
the sponsor has not demonstrated either
 
04:18:53.590 --> 04:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
the range of adverse impact in dollars
 
04:18:55.269 --> 04:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
upon paper billers
 
04:18:57.429 --> 04:18:57.439 align:start position:0%
or the class of bill payers as a whole
 
04:18:59.990 --> 04:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
if the bill were to be enacted into law
 
04:19:01.750 --> 04:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
this is highly problematic for a
 
04:19:03.670 --> 04:19:03.680 align:start position:0%
thorough consideration of the bill's
 
04:19:03.680 --> 04:19:05.189 align:start position:0%
thorough consideration of the bill's
ramifications

04:19:05.189 --> 04:19:05.199 align:start position:0%
ramifications
 
04:19:07.269 --> 04:19:07.279 align:start position:0%
accordingly any thought of a recommended
 
04:19:09.990 --> 04:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
to pass action would be exceedingly
 
04:19:10.000 --> 04:19:11.269 align:start position:0%
to pass action would be exceedingly
premature

04:19:11.269 --> 04:19:11.279 align:start position:0%
premature
 
04:19:13.030 --> 04:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
and fraught with many unanswered
 
04:19:15.269 --> 04:19:15.279 align:start position:0%
essential questions two
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
the bill specifically exempts
 
04:19:19.189 --> 04:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
governmental agencies without providing
 
04:19:21.510 --> 04:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
a rationale or statement of necessity
 
04:19:22.950 --> 04:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
for doing so
 
04:19:25.110 --> 04:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
exempting large governmental agencies
 
04:19:27.429 --> 04:19:27.439 align:start position:0%
while adversely impacting a whole range
 
04:19:29.910 --> 04:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
of much smaller providers directly or
 
04:19:31.269 --> 04:19:31.279 align:start position:0%
through their customers who pay
 
04:19:33.750 --> 04:19:33.760 align:start position:0%
electronically is particularly and
 
04:19:36.550 --> 04:19:36.560 align:start position:0%
disturbingly nettlesome to say the least
 
04:19:36.560 --> 04:19:37.670 align:start position:0%
disturbingly nettlesome to say the least
three

04:19:37.670 --> 04:19:37.680 align:start position:0%
three
 
04:19:39.670 --> 04:19:39.680 align:start position:0%
the bill's sponsors have not provided
 
04:19:41.429 --> 04:19:41.439 align:start position:0%
measurable and meaningful data to
 
04:19:43.910 --> 04:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate the number of customers who
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
have failed in their efforts to appeal
 
04:19:47.510 --> 04:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
to the providers for a hardship
 
04:19:49.910 --> 04:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
exemption or the types and degrees of
 
04:19:51.990 --> 04:19:52.000 align:start position:0%
the difficulty encountered by customers
 
04:19:54.229 --> 04:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
who have been unable to locate and
 
04:19:56.149 --> 04:19:56.159 align:start position:0%
secure the services of an alternate
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
provider who either does not surcharge
 
04:20:00.950 --> 04:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
for paper billing or whose fees are less
 
04:20:02.870 --> 04:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
than the existing provider and number
 
04:20:02.880 --> 04:20:03.750 align:start position:0%
than the existing provider and number
four

04:20:03.750 --> 04:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
four
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
the bill's fine for a first offense is
 
04:20:07.750 --> 04:20:07.760 align:start position:0%
up to five hundred dollars this seems
 
04:20:10.710 --> 04:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
rather large but more problematically
 
04:20:13.110 --> 04:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
first offense is not defined as the
 
04:20:16.149 --> 04:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
first billy or all those as effectively
 
04:20:18.630 --> 04:20:18.640 align:start position:0%
as a class in a first billing period
 
04:20:21.110 --> 04:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
brought under scrutiny
 
04:20:23.590 --> 04:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
i'll stop there
 
04:20:26.389 --> 04:20:26.399 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative bartlett has her
 
04:20:31.189 --> 04:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:33.189 --> 04:20:33.199 align:start position:0%
yes um i have to say that
 
04:20:34.469 --> 04:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
this is catching us a little bit by
 
04:20:34.479 --> 04:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
this is catching us a little bit by
surprise

04:20:35.990 --> 04:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
surprise
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
i thought that
 
04:20:39.269 --> 04:20:39.279 align:start position:0%
there was really quite a lot of
 
04:20:41.750 --> 04:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
testimony um at the public hearing and
 
04:20:43.910 --> 04:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
that this is affecting people
 
04:20:45.590 --> 04:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
um there it
 
04:20:47.590 --> 04:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
i i agree that it's not ready to go the
 
04:20:49.590 --> 04:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
way it is right now but i do think that
 
04:20:50.630 --> 04:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
we could
 
04:20:52.229 --> 04:20:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh retain it
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:20:56.149 --> 04:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
work on it
 
04:21:01.670 --> 04:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:01.680 --> 04:21:02.950 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:21:02.950 --> 04:21:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:21:02.960 --> 04:21:04.309 align:start position:0%
okay
uh

04:21:04.309 --> 04:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:21:04.319 --> 04:21:05.590 align:start position:0%
uh
obviously

04:21:05.590 --> 04:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the motion is that there
 
04:21:10.070 --> 04:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
was a feeling that that that this bill
 
04:21:11.670 --> 04:21:11.680 align:start position:0%
was is
 
04:21:13.429 --> 04:21:13.439 align:start position:0%
there's too many uh ends to it to
 
04:21:15.110 --> 04:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
whether it was going to get resolved
 
04:21:15.120 --> 04:21:16.309 align:start position:0%
whether it was going to get resolved

see you

i think i'm all set now am i
 
04:21:36.550 --> 04:21:36.560 align:start position:0%
yep oh there you are okay i apologize
 
04:21:38.790 --> 04:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
um i do agree that there are definitely
 
04:21:41.349 --> 04:21:41.359 align:start position:0%
problems with this um with this bill
 
04:21:44.389 --> 04:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
however i do see a constituency that has
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
this need that
 
04:21:47.990 --> 04:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
um the older people those people without
 
04:21:50.710 --> 04:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
access to computers and i would hope
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
also that we would take down um the itl
 
04:21:56.950 --> 04:21:56.960 align:start position:0%
motion by vote and go to a retained
 
04:21:56.960 --> 04:21:59.349 align:start position:0%
motion by vote and go to a retained
motion

04:21:59.349 --> 04:21:59.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.359 --> 04:22:00.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:00.229 --> 04:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson has his hand
 
04:22:04.469 --> 04:22:04.479 align:start position:0%
up next
 
04:22:07.189 --> 04:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
oh i'm not on mute all right um so
 
04:22:09.590 --> 04:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
although i agree with the sentiment of
 
04:22:12.309 --> 04:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
representative bartlett and van hooten
 
04:22:13.910 --> 04:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
um that
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
there is an issue here that needs to be
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
dealt with
 
04:22:19.030 --> 04:22:19.040 align:start position:0%
the problems that i saw with the bill
 
04:22:19.040 --> 04:22:19.830 align:start position:0%
the problems that i saw with the bill
are

04:22:19.830 --> 04:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:22:22.389 --> 04:22:22.399 align:start position:0%
are structural meaning that as i said
 
04:22:24.149 --> 04:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
asked during the hearing
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't protect new hampshire
 
04:22:26.640 --> 04:22:27.990 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't protect new hampshire
consumers

04:22:27.990 --> 04:22:28.000 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
it punishes companies that move to new
 
04:22:31.750 --> 04:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire and it created a second
 
04:22:33.590 --> 04:22:33.600 align:start position:0%
structural problem which would also not
 
04:22:36.149 --> 04:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
be solvable with making changes to this
 
04:22:37.510 --> 04:22:37.520 align:start position:0%
bill which is
 
04:22:37.520 --> 04:22:38.950 align:start position:0%
bill which is
um

04:22:38.950 --> 04:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:22:40.950 --> 04:22:40.960 align:start position:0%
at no point
 
04:22:43.349 --> 04:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
to make it clear if somebody offers a
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
discount for online building billing
 
04:22:47.429 --> 04:22:47.439 align:start position:0%
even if it's a dollar or two or five
 
04:22:50.790 --> 04:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
dollars um to do things more efficiently
 
04:22:52.710 --> 04:22:52.720 align:start position:0%
would they be fined how many times would
 
04:22:54.149 --> 04:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
they be fined what would be counted as a
 
04:22:56.469 --> 04:22:56.479 align:start position:0%
second offense and so on and so forth so
 
04:22:58.550 --> 04:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that retaining the bill
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
and trying to fix this bill would fix
 
04:23:02.710 --> 04:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
the problem i think that
 
04:23:04.710 --> 04:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh if it's even possible to fix this
 
04:23:06.229 --> 04:23:06.239 align:start position:0%
problem for example out of state
 
04:23:06.239 --> 04:23:07.349 align:start position:0%
problem for example out of state
companies

04:23:07.349 --> 04:23:07.359 align:start position:0%
companies
 
04:23:09.830 --> 04:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
doing this it cert it certainly wouldn't
 
04:23:11.429 --> 04:23:11.439 align:start position:0%
be fixed by retaining the bill and try
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
to make changes it would have to be done
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:20.309 --> 04:23:20.319 align:start position:0%
okay representative van halton
 
04:23:22.389 --> 04:23:22.399 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i will lower my hand i
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:43.269 --> 04:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry i'm i uh there there is a
 
04:23:45.510 --> 04:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
constituency or several constituencies
 
04:23:46.550 --> 04:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
out there
 
04:23:48.149 --> 04:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
who i think uh
 
04:23:50.229 --> 04:23:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh require
 
04:23:51.750 --> 04:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
paper billing
 
04:23:53.030 --> 04:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
04:23:54.790 --> 04:23:54.800 align:start position:0%
and i'm concerned about anything that
 
04:23:56.790 --> 04:23:56.800 align:start position:0%
might cause
 
04:23:56.800 --> 04:23:58.070 align:start position:0%
might cause
someone

04:23:58.070 --> 04:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
someone
 
04:24:01.830 --> 04:24:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know overdraft fees
 
04:24:06.950 --> 04:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
or late fees on credit
 
04:24:10.710 --> 04:24:10.720 align:start position:0%
and so as a result of that
 
04:24:13.110 --> 04:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm pretty sure that
 
04:24:14.790 --> 04:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
if everybody went to
 
04:24:16.630 --> 04:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
electronic billing
 
04:24:19.110 --> 04:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
there would be a number of number of
 
04:24:21.189 --> 04:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
people who would uh
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
suffer so i'm not
 
04:24:26.120 --> 04:24:26.130 align:start position:0%

yes
 
04:27:15.920 --> 04:27:16.950 align:start position:0%
yes
and

04:27:16.950 --> 04:27:16.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:23.269 --> 04:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
you're missing i know yes and the phone
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
was ringing so your yes is that yes i'm
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
assuming okay
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
all right uh let's see that is uh
 
04:27:37.269 --> 04:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
the vote is 13 to 6
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
and the motion passes
 
04:27:44.389 --> 04:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:44.399 --> 04:27:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:27:45.510 --> 04:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:27:45.520 --> 04:27:47.510 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

04:27:47.510 --> 04:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:27:49.349 --> 04:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
all right and who sorry who's writing
 
04:27:52.830 --> 04:27:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:52.840 --> 04:27:54.389 align:start position:0%
 
christy

04:27:54.389 --> 04:27:54.399 align:start position:0%
christy
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:58.720 --> 04:27:59.990 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:28:02.550 --> 04:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
um are we gonna get forms
 
04:28:03.830 --> 04:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
for that
 
04:28:06.229 --> 04:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh pam are we sending out forms to
 
04:28:07.429 --> 04:28:07.439 align:start position:0%
people or
 
04:28:10.149 --> 04:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
no i think just an email um we'll we'll
 
04:28:13.189 --> 04:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
do it for them yeah so both
 
04:28:15.670 --> 04:28:15.680 align:start position:0%
yeah for you representation for you
 
04:28:18.070 --> 04:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
just send send the email to me and then
 
04:28:22.389 --> 04:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:24.790 --> 04:28:24.800 align:start position:0%
the form asks me for the minority motion
 
04:28:27.510 --> 04:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
is that retain oh that's right but your
 
04:28:38.710 --> 04:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:38.720 --> 04:28:40.149 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:28:40.149 --> 04:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:28:42.630 --> 04:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh is it customary for the uh
 
04:28:44.950 --> 04:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
since i'm a freshman yeah legislator uh
 
04:28:46.229 --> 04:28:46.239 align:start position:0%
is it customary for the move or the
 
04:28:48.830 --> 04:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
motion to automatically uh write the
 
04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
maturity report that is uh traditional
 
04:28:55.670 --> 04:28:55.680 align:start position:0%
so so the clerk so noted that yeah well
 
04:28:56.790 --> 04:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
you know i was i was going to mention
 
04:28:58.550 --> 04:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
that i i'm going to assume that whoever
 
04:29:00.469 --> 04:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
made the motion will do the majority
 
04:29:01.990 --> 04:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
report thank you for that assumption is
 
04:29:04.630 --> 04:29:04.640 align:start position:0%
that and then but um once you do it you
 
04:29:07.030 --> 04:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
just email it to me yes well thank you
 
04:29:08.229 --> 04:29:08.239 align:start position:0%
for that great honor and that
 
04:29:10.229 --> 04:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
clarification thank you and uh
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:29:14.229 --> 04:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:29:15.750 --> 04:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
chrissy do you have another question you
 
04:29:17.110 --> 04:29:17.120 align:start position:0%
have your hand up
 
04:29:19.429 --> 04:29:19.439 align:start position:0%
nope unintentionally okay now paul you
 
04:29:21.110 --> 04:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
can take your hands off good get all the
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
hands down all right so now we can go
 
04:29:27.030 --> 04:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
are we ready time for our public hearing
 
04:29:27.040 --> 04:29:29.189 align:start position:0%
are we ready time for our public hearing
and

04:29:29.189 --> 04:29:29.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:29:29.199 --> 04:29:31.030 align:start position:0%
and
okay

04:29:31.030 --> 04:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:29:32.469 --> 04:29:32.479 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:29:34.149 --> 04:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
we have about 10 minutes yeah i think
 
04:29:35.269 --> 04:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
we're early
 
04:29:37.800 --> 04:29:37.810 align:start position:0%
what did i do that for
 
04:29:37.810 --> 04:29:41.830 align:start position:0%
what did i do that for
[Laughter]

04:29:41.830 --> 04:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:29:43.510 --> 04:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
enough practice
 
04:29:45.670 --> 04:29:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's you know i was out of shape for
 
04:29:47.830 --> 04:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
two years you know two years and i
 
04:29:49.670 --> 04:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
didn't have anything to do with it but i
 
04:29:51.590 --> 04:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
thought i did pretty good yesterday this
 
04:29:53.349 --> 04:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
morning and yesterday we got through it
 
04:29:57.910 --> 04:29:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:00.229 --> 04:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
these split notices are confusing some
 
04:30:01.269 --> 04:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
of us
 
04:30:04.469 --> 04:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
um yes so i'll just just review that for
 
04:30:07.590 --> 04:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
everybody so again technology is uh
 
04:30:11.110 --> 04:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
where we now are at the mercy of of our
 
04:30:13.910 --> 04:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
new software system and everybody will
 
04:30:15.349 --> 04:30:15.359 align:start position:0%
always tell you that anytime you have a
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
new software it's uh you have new new
 
04:30:19.830 --> 04:30:19.840 align:start position:0%
things that you were never expected or
 
04:30:20.790 --> 04:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
used to
 
04:30:23.750 --> 04:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
so what's going happening going forward
 
04:30:26.469 --> 04:30:26.479 align:start position:0%
from now now whereas before i would just
 
04:30:26.479 --> 04:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
from now now whereas before i would just
list

04:30:27.590 --> 04:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
list
 
04:30:29.429 --> 04:30:29.439 align:start position:0%
or we would you know but like so it's
 
04:30:32.550 --> 04:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
not just me the previous
 
04:30:33.990 --> 04:30:34.000 align:start position:0%
previous chair the same thing you would
 
04:30:35.590 --> 04:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
just we would list all the bills that
 
04:30:37.189 --> 04:30:37.199 align:start position:0%
would be exact
 
04:30:39.510 --> 04:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
now we have to put him in his time
 
04:30:43.990 --> 04:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:30:49.750 --> 04:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
benefit this is to a chairman
 
04:30:51.269 --> 04:30:51.279 align:start position:0%
who's scheduling it
 
04:30:53.349 --> 04:30:53.359 align:start position:0%
is to uh
 
04:30:54.870 --> 04:30:54.880 align:start position:0%
schedule it tight
 
04:30:56.950 --> 04:30:56.960 align:start position:0%
because you don't want to have like this
 
04:30:58.630 --> 04:30:58.640 align:start position:0%
lull that we're having now
 
04:31:00.309 --> 04:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
so but it's okay to
 
04:31:01.590 --> 04:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
be late
 
04:31:04.229 --> 04:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
which does not make sense to me you know
 
04:31:05.910 --> 04:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
because it seems a little rude to make
 
04:31:08.229 --> 04:31:08.239 align:start position:0%
people sit in but i would say there are
 
04:31:10.870 --> 04:31:10.880 align:start position:0%
times when we when we have exact very
 
04:31:12.550 --> 04:31:12.560 align:start position:0%
large pile when we have a large pile of
 
04:31:15.349 --> 04:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
bills and we start out at 10 o'clock or
 
04:31:17.510 --> 04:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatever the exact session and the room
 
04:31:19.750 --> 04:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
would be packed full of people
 
04:31:22.309 --> 04:31:22.319 align:start position:0%
and so my tendency was usually to look
 
04:31:23.510 --> 04:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
around and see
 
04:31:25.910 --> 04:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
what bills they were here for and try to
 
04:31:27.269 --> 04:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
you know weed through and pick out the
 
04:31:29.189 --> 04:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
bills that i could try to weed out the
 
04:31:32.149 --> 04:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
crowd um and then or whether there was a
 
04:31:33.990 --> 04:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
department if there's some department
 
04:31:35.349 --> 04:31:35.359 align:start position:0%
you know if they're a commissioner
 
04:31:36.630 --> 04:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
sitting in the room i definitely want to
 
04:31:39.349 --> 04:31:39.359 align:start position:0%
take care of that bill right away but
 
04:31:41.590 --> 04:31:41.600 align:start position:0%
so with this new system
 
04:31:43.990 --> 04:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
um everything is time certain
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
and uh but i obviously i do have the the
 
04:31:48.870 --> 04:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
we have to push push someone off if
 
04:31:50.630 --> 04:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
we're running late but which i don't
 
04:31:52.790 --> 04:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
think is a good thing to do it is what
 
04:31:55.349 --> 04:31:55.359 align:start position:0%
it is so my hands up
 
04:31:55.359 --> 04:31:57.510 align:start position:0%
it is so my hands up
okay

04:31:57.510 --> 04:31:57.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:59.349 --> 04:31:59.359 align:start position:0%
yes chris
 
04:31:59.359 --> 04:32:00.309 align:start position:0%
yes chris
yeah

04:32:00.309 --> 04:32:00.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
um earlier on
 
04:32:04.950 --> 04:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
you went through the
 
04:32:08.309 --> 04:32:08.319 align:start position:0%
um the benefits of uh retaining
 
04:32:09.590 --> 04:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
and i think had uh
 
04:32:15.429 --> 04:32:15.439 align:start position:0%
that's why i voted the way i did
 
04:32:17.910 --> 04:32:17.920 align:start position:0%
with the idea of retention
 
04:32:20.550 --> 04:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:32:21.670 --> 04:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
because i don't think i don't think
 
04:32:22.870 --> 04:32:22.880 align:start position:0%
anybody was
 
04:32:24.630 --> 04:32:24.640 align:start position:0%
thought this bill was
 
04:32:27.030 --> 04:32:27.040 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time as it were
 
04:32:30.149 --> 04:32:30.159 align:start position:0%
um but if if we kill it like this is it
 
04:32:32.149 --> 04:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
more difficult it does it have to be
 
04:32:34.309 --> 04:32:34.319 align:start position:0%
reintroduced i mean what are the uh what
 
04:32:36.870 --> 04:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
is the hurdle we put in front of this
 
04:32:38.229 --> 04:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
this idea
 
04:32:39.830 --> 04:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
by going itl
 
04:32:43.590 --> 04:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
versus retention uh well technically
 
04:32:45.510 --> 04:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh so technically we would have
 
04:32:48.469 --> 04:32:48.479 align:start position:0%
uh were our session in february uh this
 
04:32:51.670 --> 04:32:51.680 align:start position:0%
february 24th i guess 25th
 
04:32:54.950 --> 04:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
and which uh if the bill is um
 
04:32:58.070 --> 04:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
if the house does kill the bill then um
 
04:33:00.469 --> 04:33:00.479 align:start position:0%
theoretically it is dead for the the
 
04:33:04.070 --> 04:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
biennium that it cannot be reintroduced
 
04:33:07.349 --> 04:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
um having said that um you all you have
 
04:33:09.590 --> 04:33:09.600 align:start position:0%
to do is change the way the bill was
 
04:33:12.150 --> 04:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
written and do it in a different way
 
04:33:14.470 --> 04:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
like put it under consumer protection or
 
04:33:17.109 --> 04:33:17.119 align:start position:0%
do something different with it um and
 
04:33:19.590 --> 04:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
suddenly the bill will have life
 
04:33:21.349 --> 04:33:21.359 align:start position:0%
come next year
 
04:33:23.750 --> 04:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i mean i've seen that happen a lot so
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
but technically i think that you know at
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
least um in terms of my caucus it was
 
04:33:31.109 --> 04:33:31.119 align:start position:0%
pretty much that that that
 
04:33:32.949 --> 04:33:32.959 align:start position:0%
there is no way no way you're going to
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
do this unless you want to treat it as
 
04:33:36.551 --> 04:33:36.561 align:start position:0%
like an elderly exemption
 
04:33:38.629 --> 04:33:38.639 align:start position:0%
um there was no way we were really going
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
to be able to implement it and even then
 
04:33:42.390 --> 04:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
it how do you enforce that you know an
 
04:33:44.390 --> 04:33:44.400 align:start position:0%
elderly exemption so
 
04:33:46.470 --> 04:33:46.480 align:start position:0%
um that's why the uh
 
04:33:49.670 --> 04:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know the motion was inexpedient
 
04:33:49.680 --> 04:33:51.029 align:start position:0%
you know the motion was inexpedient
so

04:33:51.029 --> 04:33:51.039 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:52.789 --> 04:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
and i always say every bill has a grain
 
04:33:54.070 --> 04:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
of truth to it
 
04:33:55.750 --> 04:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
every bill does but some of them it's
 
04:33:59.109 --> 04:33:59.119 align:start position:0%
just the devil's in the details
 
04:34:01.189 --> 04:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
so yes chrissy you know we have too many
 
04:34:03.910 --> 04:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
chris on this committee you know yeah we
 
04:34:06.070 --> 04:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of christmas
 
04:34:06.080 --> 04:34:07.029 align:start position:0%
do have a lot of christmas
um

04:34:07.029 --> 04:34:07.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:09.429 --> 04:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
i was just wondering if you would mind
 
04:34:11.670 --> 04:34:11.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of reiterating what's going on
 
04:34:11.680 --> 04:34:13.510 align:start position:0%
just kind of reiterating what's going on
um

04:34:13.510 --> 04:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:13.520 --> 04:34:15.269 align:start position:0%
um
the

04:34:15.269 --> 04:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:34:17.109 --> 04:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
the schedule for next week we had an
 
04:34:18.709 --> 04:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
awful lot of notices
 
04:34:21.029 --> 04:34:21.039 align:start position:0%
yes okay you did ask me about that yeah
 
04:34:24.470 --> 04:34:24.480 align:start position:0%
okay so so um getting back to this this
 
04:34:24.480 --> 04:34:25.830 align:start position:0%
okay so so um getting back to this this
problematic

04:34:25.830 --> 04:34:25.840 align:start position:0%
problematic
 
04:34:28.150 --> 04:34:28.160 align:start position:0%
system of the dates every the time
 
04:34:29.349 --> 04:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
certain so
 
04:34:31.349 --> 04:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
when you're getting these notices where
 
04:34:31.359 --> 04:34:32.470 align:start position:0%
when you're getting these notices where
before

04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:34:34.230 --> 04:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
if we were doing an exact session that
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
day it would be listed on that same
 
04:34:40.470 --> 04:34:40.480 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper but because of this new
 
04:34:42.310 --> 04:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
software the new system
 
04:34:44.869 --> 04:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
um executing a bill is treated as a
 
04:34:46.310 --> 04:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
totally different
 
04:34:49.910 --> 04:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
um memo and and i i guess in defense of
 
04:34:53.750 --> 04:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
the computer it is it is true that the
 
04:34:53.760 --> 04:34:54.629 align:start position:0%
the computer it is it is true that the
um

04:34:54.629 --> 04:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:34:54.639 --> 04:34:55.349 align:start position:0%
um
it

04:34:55.349 --> 04:34:55.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:34:57.349 --> 04:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
it has to go and see who all the
 
04:34:59.910 --> 04:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
sponsors are and notify them
 
04:35:02.310 --> 04:35:02.320 align:start position:0%
that it's occurring which should still
 
04:35:04.390 --> 04:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
be happening even when we schedule the
 
04:35:06.629 --> 04:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
bill so i don't know why the computer
 
04:35:08.230 --> 04:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
feels compelled to do this but when it
 
04:35:10.310 --> 04:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
comes to exec session
 
04:35:12.070 --> 04:35:12.080 align:start position:0%
it really wants to treat it as though
 
04:35:13.590 --> 04:35:13.600 align:start position:0%
it's a different day even though it's
 
04:35:15.349 --> 04:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
the same day
 
04:35:17.830 --> 04:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have any questions um about
 
04:35:22.470 --> 04:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:22.480 --> 04:35:23.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:35:24.789 --> 04:35:24.799 align:start position:0%
and of course always look at the
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
calendar if that helps you too
 
04:35:26.799 --> 04:35:27.750 align:start position:0%
calendar if that helps you too
yeah

04:35:27.750 --> 04:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:35:29.029 --> 04:35:29.039 align:start position:0%
well the count you know hopefully the
 
04:35:30.949 --> 04:35:30.959 align:start position:0%
calendar well we'll see what the
 
04:35:30.959 --> 04:35:31.910 align:start position:0%
calendar well we'll see what the
calendar

04:35:31.910 --> 04:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
calendar
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
how the calendar treats this
 
04:35:34.000 --> 04:35:34.830 align:start position:0%
how the calendar treats this
but

04:35:34.830 --> 04:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:35:37.590 --> 04:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh but i guess other committees exactly
 
04:35:39.029 --> 04:35:39.039 align:start position:0%
now they've the exact same day i don't
 
04:35:40.709 --> 04:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
think has anybody scheduled an exact
 
04:35:42.949 --> 04:35:42.959 align:start position:0%
session on the calendar i don't remember
 
04:35:44.310 --> 04:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
seeing that but
 
04:35:46.470 --> 04:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative johnson
 
04:35:46.480 --> 04:35:47.510 align:start position:0%
yes representative johnson
so

04:35:47.510 --> 04:35:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:35:49.189 --> 04:35:49.199 align:start position:0%
did everybody see
 
04:35:52.150 --> 04:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
um the email that went out i got it at
 
04:35:54.470 --> 04:35:54.480 align:start position:0%
lunch about the new
 
04:35:56.949 --> 04:35:56.959 align:start position:0%
online version of the calendar where you
 
04:36:00.789 --> 04:36:00.799 align:start position:0%
can click on the different information
 
04:36:02.390 --> 04:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
sessions and
 
04:36:03.830 --> 04:36:03.840 align:start position:0%
links for all the different committee
 
04:36:06.310 --> 04:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
meetings and stuff i just figured i
 
04:36:08.150 --> 04:36:08.160 align:start position:0%
happened to see it at when we were on
 
04:36:08.160 --> 04:36:09.109 align:start position:0%
happened to see it at when we were on
lunch

04:36:09.109 --> 04:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:36:10.629 --> 04:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
so i wanted to just make sure everybody
 
04:36:12.551 --> 04:36:12.561 align:start position:0%
know it was out there it looks kind of
 
04:36:15.510 --> 04:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
easy and fun to use i don't know
 
04:36:17.189 --> 04:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
i'm still an old-fashioned girl i like
 
04:36:21.269 --> 04:36:21.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:22.709 --> 04:36:22.719 align:start position:0%
just kind of you know bring that to
 
04:36:24.150 --> 04:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
somebody's attention if they haven't
 
04:36:24.160 --> 04:36:25.189 align:start position:0%
somebody's attention if they haven't
seen

04:36:25.189 --> 04:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
seen
 
04:36:26.709 --> 04:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
the emails yet
 
04:36:28.230 --> 04:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
yeah and and the other thing i can't
 
04:36:30.070 --> 04:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
emphasize enough is that if you are
 
04:36:31.910 --> 04:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
going to testify if you don't want to be
 
04:36:34.629 --> 04:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
sure you do it the night before
 
04:36:36.869 --> 04:36:36.879 align:start position:0%
so uh reason saying that representative
 
04:36:38.869 --> 04:36:38.879 align:start position:0%
greeson you didn't actually sign up for
 
04:36:40.310 --> 04:36:40.320 align:start position:0%
your own bills
 
04:36:42.709 --> 04:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
to speak on your own bills and i know
 
04:36:43.990 --> 04:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
you you're a freshman so you probably
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know you were supposed to do that
 
04:36:45.920 --> 04:36:46.709 align:start position:0%
didn't know you were supposed to do that
but

04:36:46.709 --> 04:36:46.719 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:36:48.230 --> 04:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
in the old days you know when the
 
04:36:49.750 --> 04:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
committee we would just say all right
 
04:36:51.349 --> 04:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
fill out a pink card
 
04:36:52.551 --> 04:36:52.561 align:start position:0%
and we know you know go ahead and
 
04:36:56.150 --> 04:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
testify but obviously we have this new
 
04:36:56.160 --> 04:36:57.189 align:start position:0%
testify but obviously we have this new
new

04:36:57.189 --> 04:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
new
 
04:37:00.310 --> 04:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
whiz-bang system and so yeah the night
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
before you need to sign up um and and
 
04:37:05.990 --> 04:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
what really important and i can't
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
emphasize this enough because this gets
 
04:37:09.510 --> 04:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
me in good with my clerks
 
04:37:11.510 --> 04:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
is that if you are going to do a
 
04:37:13.189 --> 04:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
testimony if you are going to write
 
04:37:15.910 --> 04:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
something up just submit it at the same
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
time when you sign up and that will make
 
04:37:20.070 --> 04:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
make the clerk love you
 
04:37:22.470 --> 04:37:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes can i add something right
 
04:37:24.789 --> 04:37:24.799 align:start position:0%
on the subject i'm sorry to interrupt
 
04:37:24.799 --> 04:37:25.510 align:start position:0%
on the subject i'm sorry to interrupt
but

04:37:25.510 --> 04:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:37:29.109 --> 04:37:29.119 align:start position:0%
if you happen to not sign in but but do
 
04:37:31.830 --> 04:37:31.840 align:start position:0%
speak just as in the
 
04:37:33.670 --> 04:37:33.680 align:start position:0%
when we meet in person we ask somebody
 
04:37:35.910 --> 04:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
to fill out a pink card sort of after
 
04:37:38.709 --> 04:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
they speak often we ask you to register
 
04:37:41.269 --> 04:37:41.279 align:start position:0%
after you speak because and for that
 
04:37:43.670 --> 04:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
reason we are printing the the final
 
04:37:45.590 --> 04:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
testimony sheets
 
04:37:48.150 --> 04:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
the day after the hearing to capture
 
04:37:50.629 --> 04:37:50.639 align:start position:0%
those people that's that volunteered you
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
know raise their hand to speak but have
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
not made the registration cut off
 
04:37:59.750 --> 04:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
okay okay so that's great but uh so you
 
04:38:01.750 --> 04:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
you wanted i guess i needed to contact
 
04:38:04.230 --> 04:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
ned gordon and tell him he needed to
 
04:38:06.789 --> 04:38:06.799 align:start position:0%
do that because
 
04:38:06.799 --> 04:38:07.670 align:start position:0%
do that because
um

04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
i haven't been monitoring who's not on
 
04:38:11.029 --> 04:38:11.039 align:start position:0%
your list
 
04:38:12.949 --> 04:38:12.959 align:start position:0%
and i had to hand write him in
 
04:38:15.349 --> 04:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
oh okay yeah we need to get him into the
 
04:38:17.029 --> 04:38:17.039 align:start position:0%
system i'll look i'll go through this
 
04:38:19.109 --> 04:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
but i think he's never written yeah he's
 
04:38:21.109 --> 04:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
the only one but okay
 
04:38:22.629 --> 04:38:22.639 align:start position:0%
yes joyce
 
04:38:25.269 --> 04:38:25.279 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify should i go
 
04:38:27.670 --> 04:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
i i introduced a bill yesterday should i
 
04:38:31.349 --> 04:38:31.359 align:start position:0%
go in and sign in for that testimony
 
04:38:33.349 --> 04:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
even though i was in the committee it
 
04:38:35.269 --> 04:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
was your yes you need a pin card if
 
04:38:36.709 --> 04:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
you're you know a committee member
 
04:38:39.349 --> 04:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
normally so yeah it's the same process
 
04:38:41.590 --> 04:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
okay i'll go back and do it thank you
 
04:38:43.429 --> 04:38:43.439 align:start position:0%
yeah and nothing else is important just
 
04:38:45.590 --> 04:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
so you're on record that you did testify
 
04:38:47.429 --> 04:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
you were here and you did testify even
 
04:38:50.230 --> 04:38:50.240 align:start position:0%
though we've got youtube to prove it but
 
04:38:50.240 --> 04:38:50.830 align:start position:0%

as you signed in you're good yeah
 
04:39:17.990 --> 04:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
but like i say but if you want to endear
 
04:39:21.429 --> 04:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
yourself to the to the clerk is is to
 
04:39:23.349 --> 04:39:23.359 align:start position:0%
whatever testimony you had or type what
 
04:39:25.510 --> 04:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
you typed up is just to you know
 
04:39:28.230 --> 04:39:28.240 align:start position:0%

04:39:32.390 --> 04:39:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh no no no just upload it on that
 
04:39:34.789 --> 04:39:34.799 align:start position:0%
screen don't and this is probably oh
 
04:39:36.551 --> 04:39:36.561 align:start position:0%
okay can i go back and do it now because
 
04:39:38.150 --> 04:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
04:39:40.788 --> 04:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
uh uh well she'd be getting yesterday so
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
i don't know pam didn't okay i didn't
 
04:39:43.670 --> 04:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
know i was supposed to upload that okay
 
04:39:45.910 --> 04:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
good to know
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
you can
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
send your testimony to the
 
04:39:51.990 --> 04:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
committee's distribution list oh i did i
 
04:39:53.830 --> 04:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
did that okay then you're covered you
 
04:39:57.030 --> 04:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
don't just need to submit it once okay
 
04:39:58.470 --> 04:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
if you did that then you're all good
 
04:40:01.510 --> 04:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's the point anyway so that
 
04:40:03.910 --> 04:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
is a nice feature of this sign up is
 
04:40:06.470 --> 04:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
that when you sign up you submit that
 
04:40:08.708 --> 04:40:08.718 align:start position:0%
testimony so that goes to the clerk but
 
04:40:10.550 --> 04:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
then goes to all the committee members
 
04:40:13.430 --> 04:40:13.440 align:start position:0%
automatically okay it really is a you
 
04:40:13.440 --> 04:40:14.470 align:start position:0%
automatically okay it really is a you
know

04:40:14.470 --> 04:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:40:16.470 --> 04:40:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's and it's the committee clerk that
 
04:40:18.150 --> 04:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
we're referring to because it's the
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
committee clerk that takes the notes
 
04:40:24.150 --> 04:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
of each hearing not paul smith okay
 
04:40:26.070 --> 04:40:26.080 align:start position:0%

i'm sorry
 
04:40:29.620 --> 04:40:32.230 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry
[Music]

04:40:32.230 --> 04:40:32.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
on your last um
 
04:40:36.868 --> 04:40:36.878 align:start position:0%
executive session on the on the house
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
bill 76 yes i had some doubt about the
 
04:40:40.638 --> 04:40:41.990 align:start position:0%
bill 76 yes i had some doubt about the
the

04:40:41.990 --> 04:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:40:44.070 --> 04:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
ability of a minority report to be
 
04:40:47.190 --> 04:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
retained and so i emailed our clerk paul
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
smith to see if
 
04:40:52.070 --> 04:40:52.080 align:start position:0%
you know to refresh my memory before i
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
gave you information and he says you
 
04:40:56.550 --> 04:40:56.560 align:start position:0%
cannot retain as a minority because it
 
04:40:58.948 --> 04:40:58.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to the floor
 
04:40:58.958 --> 04:41:00.070 align:start position:0%
doesn't come to the floor
okay

04:41:00.070 --> 04:41:00.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:41:03.750 --> 04:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:05.190 --> 04:41:05.200 align:start position:0%
the party
 
04:41:09.110 --> 04:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:11.750 --> 04:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
oh yuck so oh this is
 
04:41:14.470 --> 04:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
no that kind of makes sense
 
04:41:15.990 --> 04:41:16.000 align:start position:0%
yes we used to have a
 
04:41:18.390 --> 04:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
re-refer for interim study so when they
 
04:41:21.830 --> 04:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
changed that the re they've changed it
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm i'm i had a doubt
 
04:41:26.628 --> 04:41:26.638 align:start position:0%
he wrote me back and that's that's his
 
04:41:29.430 --> 04:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
answer so i
 
04:41:31.270 --> 04:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
i'll put something in the note that'll
 
04:41:32.470 --> 04:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
make it clear
 
04:41:34.868 --> 04:41:34.878 align:start position:0%
there you go all's been wrong before
 
04:41:36.310 --> 04:41:36.320 align:start position:0%
right but you're gonna have to motion's
 
04:41:41.670 --> 04:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:43.270 --> 04:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
if you want to have fun with it you
 
04:41:45.990 --> 04:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
could make it up an amendment
 
04:41:47.510 --> 04:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't have to be an amendment
 
04:41:49.110 --> 04:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
that the committee ever saw you can make
 
04:41:50.390 --> 04:41:50.400 align:start position:0%
up an amendment and say out to pass with
 
04:41:51.910 --> 04:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
an amendment that's more work than i'm
 
04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
willing to put into it well i mean i've
 
04:41:55.270 --> 04:41:55.280 align:start position:0%
just for discussion just to humor you i
 
04:41:57.750 --> 04:41:57.760 align:start position:0%
would if i were in your shoes if i were
 
04:42:00.470 --> 04:42:00.480 align:start position:0%
in the mirror and i wanted to do that um
 
04:42:02.390 --> 04:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
the amendment i would submit would be a
 
04:42:04.948 --> 04:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:42:08.550 --> 04:42:08.560 align:start position:0%
right you of all people
 
04:42:08.560 --> 04:42:10.310 align:start position:0%
right you of all people
yeah

04:42:10.310 --> 04:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
i think that makes more sense because i
 
04:42:14.470 --> 04:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have voted otp
 
04:42:14.480 --> 04:42:15.590 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have voted otp
well

04:42:15.590 --> 04:42:15.600 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:42:17.590 --> 04:42:17.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair you would never vote for study
 
04:42:20.390 --> 04:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
committee if you could that's not true i
 
04:42:22.708 --> 04:42:22.718 align:start position:0%

04:42:24.390 --> 04:42:24.400 align:start position:0%
study committee i wanted to be very
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
narrow very narrow and really you know
 
04:42:29.110 --> 04:42:29.120 align:start position:0%
right to the subject matter and
 
04:42:30.310 --> 04:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
not be true
 
04:42:31.830 --> 04:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%

04:42:36.230 --> 04:42:36.240 align:start position:0%

04:42:42.550 --> 04:42:42.560 align:start position:0%

representing hillsborough 44 which is

southern manchester and the town of
 
04:44:31.350 --> 04:44:31.360 align:start position:0%
litchfield i'm here today to introduce
 
04:44:34.390 --> 04:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
hb 264 which requires that health care
 
04:44:36.628 --> 04:44:36.638 align:start position:0%
providers provide the patient upon
 
04:44:36.638 --> 04:44:37.910 align:start position:0%
providers provide the patient upon
request

04:44:37.910 --> 04:44:37.920 align:start position:0%

care services
 
04:44:45.270 --> 04:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i'm going to illustrate why the bill
 
04:44:48.230 --> 04:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
is needed uh with two quick examples um
 
04:44:50.070 --> 04:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
the first is that my wife is a
 
04:44:52.628 --> 04:44:52.638 align:start position:0%
sonographer at a hospital i won't name
 
04:44:54.708 --> 04:44:54.718 align:start position:0%
and a patient from brazil came in with
 
04:44:56.788 --> 04:44:56.798 align:start position:0%
severe pain and they wanted to do an
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
ultrasound on them but he had heard that
 
04:45:00.868 --> 04:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
health care in america was expensive and
 
04:45:02.470 --> 04:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
he had no insurance
 
04:45:04.868 --> 04:45:04.878 align:start position:0%
so he wanted to know the cost prior to
 
04:45:07.030 --> 04:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
agreeing to have any procedure done on
 
04:45:07.040 --> 04:45:08.070 align:start position:0%
agreeing to have any procedure done on
them

04:45:08.070 --> 04:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
but they wouldn't give him the cost and
 
04:45:12.070 --> 04:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the end they let him leave
 
04:45:14.628 --> 04:45:14.638 align:start position:0%
undiagnosed and in pain rather than
 
04:45:16.628 --> 04:45:16.638 align:start position:0%
provide them the cost and i think that
 
04:45:19.190 --> 04:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
that's wrong and um on a personal note
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
uh the second situation i was in a minor
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
car accident two years ago
 
04:45:25.510 --> 04:45:25.520 align:start position:0%
because it was minor i notified my
 
04:45:27.670 --> 04:45:27.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company but i didn't file a
 
04:45:30.070 --> 04:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
claim but my wife insisted i go in and
 
04:45:32.070 --> 04:45:32.080 align:start position:0%
get a check up just to make sure you
 
04:45:34.310 --> 04:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
know that's kind of how she is so when i
 
04:45:36.550 --> 04:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
got to the urgent care because i had not
 
04:45:38.470 --> 04:45:38.480 align:start position:0%
filed a claim i just told them look i'm
 
04:45:39.910 --> 04:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
going to be paying out of my own pocket
 
04:45:42.390 --> 04:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
for this so i asked them how much the
 
04:45:43.830 --> 04:45:43.840 align:start position:0%
checkup was going to cost it was going
 
04:45:45.990 --> 04:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
to be one or two hundred dollars i'd go
 
04:45:48.550 --> 04:45:48.560 align:start position:0%
forward with the exam keep my wife happy
 
04:45:49.990 --> 04:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
but if it's going to be a thousand
 
04:45:52.150 --> 04:45:52.160 align:start position:0%
dollars i was feeling pretty good and i
 
04:45:53.750 --> 04:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
said obviously i don't want to go
 
04:45:57.430 --> 04:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
forward with the exam in that case again
 
04:46:00.390 --> 04:46:00.400 align:start position:0%
they couldn't even give me a ballpark
 
04:46:02.470 --> 04:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
answer even in the case where this is
 
04:46:04.708 --> 04:46:04.718 align:start position:0%
just a simple exam and i was going to be
 
04:46:07.270 --> 04:46:07.280 align:start position:0%
paying directly out of my pocket so
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
these are two examples of very simple
 
04:46:13.430 --> 04:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
procedures just imagine the uncertainty
 
04:46:15.590 --> 04:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
that consumers feel when they have to
 
04:46:18.628 --> 04:46:18.638 align:start position:0%
navigate their way through very complex
 
04:46:21.990 --> 04:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
medical procedures and imagine
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
their shock when they open up a bill
 
04:46:27.110 --> 04:46:27.120 align:start position:0%
that they had no idea uh was coming and
 
04:46:30.150 --> 04:46:30.160 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that many of you on this
 
04:46:32.470 --> 04:46:32.480 align:start position:0%
committee have experienced this and
 
04:46:35.270 --> 04:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
providing some form of upfront pricing
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
it's just going to allow people to plan
 
04:46:39.670 --> 04:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
and maybe seek out treatment when the
 
04:46:41.830 --> 04:46:41.840 align:start position:0%
fear of unknown costs might keep them
 
04:46:44.708 --> 04:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
away and also introduce some market
 
04:46:48.550 --> 04:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
forces to the healthcare arena so
 
04:46:50.230 --> 04:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
i went through three draftings of the
 
04:46:52.788 --> 04:46:52.798 align:start position:0%
language of this bill consulting uh the
 
04:46:55.030 --> 04:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors and former health care
 
04:46:57.830 --> 04:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
billers as i went along so we put in
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
provisions for itemization so that would
 
04:47:02.550 --> 04:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
make cost comparisons easy for the
 
04:47:02.560 --> 04:47:03.670 align:start position:0%
make cost comparisons easy for the
consumers

04:47:03.670 --> 04:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
consumers
 
04:47:05.590 --> 04:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
we allowed three days to provide the
 
04:47:08.310 --> 04:47:08.320 align:start position:0%
quote and in the final draft we
 
04:47:10.628 --> 04:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
eliminated any binding provisions on the
 
04:47:13.030 --> 04:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
quotes to mitigate
 
04:47:16.470 --> 04:47:16.480 align:start position:0%
the risk for the providers um but but
 
04:47:19.030 --> 04:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
here's the rub when i spoke with the
 
04:47:21.350 --> 04:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
policy experts in the insurance
 
04:47:21.360 --> 04:47:22.788 align:start position:0%
policy experts in the insurance
department

04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:47:24.628 --> 04:47:24.638 align:start position:0%
they still felt
 
04:47:24.638 --> 04:47:25.750 align:start position:0%
they still felt
that

04:47:25.750 --> 04:47:25.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
the technical challenges involved in
 
04:47:30.628 --> 04:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
providing individualized quotes that
 
04:47:33.030 --> 04:47:33.040 align:start position:0%
were going to have any value for the
 
04:47:35.750 --> 04:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
consumer it was just too overwhelming
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
they felt that
 
04:47:38.948 --> 04:47:38.958 align:start position:0%
the problems with the reimbursement
 
04:47:41.430 --> 04:47:41.440 align:start position:0%
model coupled with the complexities of
 
04:47:43.510 --> 04:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
incorporating third party
 
04:47:45.350 --> 04:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh were just too much
 
04:47:48.470 --> 04:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore the bill as it was written
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
actually would have the unintended
 
04:47:54.230 --> 04:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
consequence of driving costs up and that
 
04:47:57.990 --> 04:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
is going in the opposite direction
 
04:48:00.390 --> 04:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
of where i obviously want to go
 
04:48:03.030 --> 04:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
so i mean after those discussions i
 
04:48:05.430 --> 04:48:05.440 align:start position:0%
really struggled a lot with how to
 
04:48:09.270 --> 04:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
proceed and i seriously considered
 
04:48:11.030 --> 04:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
pulling the bill but in the end i
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
decided to move forward with the bill
 
04:48:15.430 --> 04:48:15.440 align:start position:0%
and because i recognize as i think
 
04:48:17.590 --> 04:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
everybody on this committee does on that
 
04:48:20.390 --> 04:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
the problem is real and at some point it
 
04:48:22.470 --> 04:48:22.480 align:start position:0%
does need to be addressed so while i
 
04:48:24.470 --> 04:48:24.480 align:start position:0%
know that the bill can't be
 
04:48:27.510 --> 04:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
passed in its current form i hope that
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
you know while you recognize the flaws
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill you also recognize that the
 
04:48:34.788 --> 04:48:34.798 align:start position:0%
problem is still persisting and that
 
04:48:36.948 --> 04:48:36.958 align:start position:0%
you'll retain the bill and pull in some
 
04:48:39.110 --> 04:48:39.120 align:start position:0%
of the subject experts from the industry
 
04:48:41.270 --> 04:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
to maybe start to tackle the issue i
 
04:48:43.270 --> 04:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
really think that's where the solutions
 
04:48:45.750 --> 04:48:45.760 align:start position:0%
are going to come from and it's going to
 
04:48:49.190 --> 04:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
be an iterative process so uh so the
 
04:48:50.948 --> 04:48:50.958 align:start position:0%
journey to full transparency it's going
 
04:48:52.470 --> 04:48:52.480 align:start position:0%
to be a long one it's going to be a
 
04:48:54.948 --> 04:48:54.958 align:start position:0%
difficult one but i really think that at
 
04:48:57.830 --> 04:48:57.840 align:start position:0%
some point we have to start walking
 
04:48:57.840 --> 04:48:58.550 align:start position:0%
some point we have to start walking
so

04:48:58.550 --> 04:48:58.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:49:00.708 --> 04:49:00.718 align:start position:0%
i do hope that you will consider
 
04:49:03.350 --> 04:49:03.360 align:start position:0%
retaining the bill and that's my
 
04:49:06.070 --> 04:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
testimony and i'll answer any questions
 
04:49:07.750 --> 04:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
or attempt to answer any questions you
 
04:49:09.110 --> 04:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
may have
 
04:49:11.030 --> 04:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh we do have questions
 
04:49:14.550 --> 04:49:14.560 align:start position:0%
um let's see who was first and first up
 
04:49:14.560 --> 04:49:15.750 align:start position:0%
um let's see who was first and first up
was

04:49:15.750 --> 04:49:15.760 align:start position:0%
was
 
04:49:20.070 --> 04:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:21.510 --> 04:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:49:24.310 --> 04:49:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative um i'm glad that you said
 
04:49:26.310 --> 04:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
to retain because i do see that there
 
04:49:27.990 --> 04:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
are issues and i know that we've had
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
emails about those issues um one of the
 
04:49:32.708 --> 04:49:32.718 align:start position:0%
things you didn't address is the solo
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
health care provider or the two or three
 
04:49:38.708 --> 04:49:38.718 align:start position:0%
uh health office health care provider um
 
04:49:41.510 --> 04:49:41.520 align:start position:0%
and and the honoris task that this might
 
04:49:43.190 --> 04:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
be for them to do this within a three
 
04:49:45.830 --> 04:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
day period with current procedural
 
04:49:47.910 --> 04:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
terminology as well what would you
 
04:49:51.190 --> 04:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
suggest as a fix for those people
 
04:49:53.110 --> 04:49:53.120 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
04:49:55.030 --> 04:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
i don't i don't have the answer as i
 
04:49:57.110 --> 04:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
said when i when i talk to the folks
 
04:49:58.628 --> 04:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
when i when i talked with the health
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
care billers um i was left with the
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
impression that as you go forward you're
 
04:50:07.670 --> 04:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
often getting pre-approval from the
 
04:50:09.190 --> 04:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
insurance companies
 
04:50:10.948 --> 04:50:10.958 align:start position:0%
so i was left when i was drafting the
 
04:50:12.628 --> 04:50:12.638 align:start position:0%
bill with the impression that that would
 
04:50:15.750 --> 04:50:15.760 align:start position:0%
be less onerous than it was so when i
 
04:50:17.590 --> 04:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
was again talking to the folks with the
 
04:50:19.670 --> 04:50:19.680 align:start position:0%
insurance department they said i know
 
04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the case so maybe
 
04:50:22.480 --> 04:50:23.350 align:start position:0%
that's not necessarily the case so maybe
um

04:50:23.350 --> 04:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:24.948 --> 04:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:50:26.788 --> 04:50:26.798 align:start position:0%
the first step in this might be to say
 
04:50:29.590 --> 04:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
you know what we're just going to just
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
carve it out and look at people who are
 
04:50:34.550 --> 04:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
making uh direct payments or something
 
04:50:37.590 --> 04:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
of that nature um as i said it's it's
 
04:50:40.310 --> 04:50:40.320 align:start position:0%
gonna maybe have to start with uh a
 
04:50:43.270 --> 04:50:43.280 align:start position:0%
smaller model um and maybe if you retain
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
it you might say these are areas and
 
04:50:47.830 --> 04:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
these are providers that maybe have the
 
04:50:50.470 --> 04:50:50.480 align:start position:0%
resources let's start there let's narrow
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
the scope of who has to provide it let's
 
04:50:54.550 --> 04:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope of the situations where
 
04:50:56.788 --> 04:50:56.798 align:start position:0%
it would have to be provided
 
04:50:59.190 --> 04:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
to start to to build the model so i
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
recognize your concern and it is
 
04:51:05.350 --> 04:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:13.670 --> 04:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
so i appreciate you
 
04:51:15.670 --> 04:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
coming before us thank you let me ask my
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
question my question is
 
04:51:20.948 --> 04:51:20.958 align:start position:0%
on most insurance companies if like even
 
04:51:23.030 --> 04:51:23.040 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to
 
04:51:23.040 --> 04:51:24.788 align:start position:0%
if i wanted to
um

04:51:24.788 --> 04:51:24.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:26.948 --> 04:51:26.958 align:start position:0%
do something like pay out of my pocket
 
04:51:29.110 --> 04:51:29.120 align:start position:0%
for a procedure
 
04:51:30.868 --> 04:51:30.878 align:start position:0%
most insurance companies will also help
 
04:51:33.270 --> 04:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
you i know i can call multiple doctors
 
04:51:35.110 --> 04:51:35.120 align:start position:0%
in hospitals now and they will give me
 
04:51:35.120 --> 04:51:36.310 align:start position:0%
in hospitals now and they will give me
quotes

04:51:36.310 --> 04:51:36.320 align:start position:0%
quotes
 
04:51:39.110 --> 04:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
so isn't this already an option
 
04:51:42.150 --> 04:51:42.160 align:start position:0%
and why would we need to put it into law
 
04:51:43.590 --> 04:51:43.600 align:start position:0%
if it's already being done by the
 
04:51:46.310 --> 04:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and by the providers
 
04:51:47.830 --> 04:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
if you call and ask because i know i
 
04:51:51.590 --> 04:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
have i get i can do that at any time
 
04:51:51.600 --> 04:51:52.948 align:start position:0%
have i get i can do that at any time
um

04:51:52.948 --> 04:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:54.788 --> 04:51:54.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
04:51:57.590 --> 04:51:57.600 align:start position:0%
that has not been my experience um
 
04:51:57.600 --> 04:51:59.430 align:start position:0%
that has not been my experience um
um

04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:52:01.670 --> 04:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
it that just hasn't been my experience
 
04:52:03.190 --> 04:52:03.200 align:start position:0%
so i i would
 
04:52:05.110 --> 04:52:05.120 align:start position:0%
i would love to talk to you offline
 
04:52:06.390 --> 04:52:06.400 align:start position:0%
about that and
 
04:52:07.990 --> 04:52:08.000 align:start position:0%
if that is
 
04:52:09.350 --> 04:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
the case
 
04:52:12.390 --> 04:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
then it may speak to the fact that the
 
04:52:15.990 --> 04:52:16.000 align:start position:0%
journey may not be as difficult um
 
04:52:18.470 --> 04:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
as it is i mean if if they're if they
 
04:52:20.868 --> 04:52:20.878 align:start position:0%
are able to provide that to you as you
 
04:52:20.878 --> 04:52:21.750 align:start position:0%
are able to provide that to you as you
say

04:52:21.750 --> 04:52:21.760 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:52:25.190 --> 04:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
um then maybe there is a model that
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
could be expanded upon um it has just
 
04:52:29.430 --> 04:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
not been my experience or the experience
 
04:52:33.430 --> 04:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:35.830 --> 04:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson who's
 
04:52:35.840 --> 04:52:38.470 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson who's
next

04:52:38.470 --> 04:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:52:40.070 --> 04:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
04:52:42.390 --> 04:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
representative mclean for taking uh my
 
04:52:42.400 --> 04:52:43.430 align:start position:0%
representative mclean for taking uh my
question

04:52:43.430 --> 04:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
04:52:46.390 --> 04:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
um looking at the bill um
 
04:52:48.550 --> 04:52:48.560 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to simply uh
 
04:52:48.560 --> 04:52:49.670 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to simply uh
deleting

04:52:49.670 --> 04:52:49.680 align:start position:0%
deleting
 
04:52:52.708 --> 04:52:52.718 align:start position:0%
where it says for example i an itemized
 
04:52:54.470 --> 04:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
cost quote from all non-emergency
 
04:52:56.868 --> 04:52:56.878 align:start position:0%
services just remove itemized
 
04:52:59.270 --> 04:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then uh not including third-party
 
04:53:01.350 --> 04:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
services and then delete the last part
 
04:53:03.430 --> 04:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
because i i i think what it sounded like
 
04:53:05.510 --> 04:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
based on your testimony was you want to
 
04:53:07.990 --> 04:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
see you know what am i paying
 
04:53:09.270 --> 04:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
if i
 
04:53:11.030 --> 04:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
get this service here and is this going
 
04:53:12.470 --> 04:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
to be too much money and then making the
 
04:53:14.550 --> 04:53:14.560 align:start position:0%
decision based on the bottom line
 
04:53:15.910 --> 04:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
in other words just a bottom line cost
 
04:53:15.920 --> 04:53:17.830 align:start position:0%
in other words just a bottom line cost
quote

04:53:17.830 --> 04:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
quote
 
04:53:21.750 --> 04:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
well i mean i think um
 
04:53:24.070 --> 04:53:24.080 align:start position:0%
the reason that i look to have it
 
04:53:26.070 --> 04:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
the goal ultimately representative
 
04:53:28.948 --> 04:53:28.958 align:start position:0%
abramson is to have something that has
 
04:53:33.350 --> 04:53:33.360 align:start position:0%
value to the consumer um so
 
04:53:35.190 --> 04:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
i i sometimes
 
04:53:37.430 --> 04:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
you might get a a bottom line quote
 
04:53:40.070 --> 04:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
that's just a bottom line quote um from
 
04:53:42.550 --> 04:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
one provider that uh
 
04:53:45.110 --> 04:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
is contains different things than a
 
04:53:46.868 --> 04:53:46.878 align:start position:0%
quote you might get from from somebody
 
04:53:50.788 --> 04:53:50.798 align:start position:0%
else um so if you could do it in a way
 
04:53:58.550 --> 04:53:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.550 --> 04:54:00.560 align:start position:0%
but if you could do it in a way i mean
 
04:54:00.560 --> 04:54:01.430 align:start position:0%
but if you could do it in a way i mean
or

04:54:01.430 --> 04:54:01.440 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:54:03.190 --> 04:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
an option might be if you left it
 
04:54:05.430 --> 04:54:05.440 align:start position:0%
itemized but did not put in the third
 
04:54:08.230 --> 04:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
party just put down these are my cpt
 
04:54:10.550 --> 04:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
codes but these are all third-party
 
04:54:11.830 --> 04:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
provided i mean
 
04:54:13.510 --> 04:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
i don't want to jump to what the what
 
04:54:15.590 --> 04:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
the solution is but at the end of the
 
04:54:15.600 --> 04:54:17.510 align:start position:0%
the solution is but at the end of the
day

04:54:17.510 --> 04:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
day
 
04:54:19.910 --> 04:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
the goal would be to
 
04:54:19.920 --> 04:54:21.030 align:start position:0%
the goal would be to
give

04:54:21.030 --> 04:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
give
 
04:54:23.590 --> 04:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
the the consumer something that is
 
04:54:26.390 --> 04:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
meaningful and useful to them
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
right now they have something on the the
 
04:54:30.788 --> 04:54:30.798 align:start position:0%
u.s health cost
 
04:54:33.430 --> 04:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
which is on the nh.gov website is on a
 
04:54:35.830 --> 04:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
sub tab where you can go in and you can
 
04:54:37.910 --> 04:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
say look at i want to get a gallbladder
 
04:54:41.590 --> 04:54:41.600 align:start position:0%
surgery and um i want to get it you know
 
04:54:44.708 --> 04:54:44.718 align:start position:0%
at i put in that i have for example a
 
04:54:46.788 --> 04:54:46.798 align:start position:0%
harvard pilgrim and it will tell me the
 
04:54:49.030 --> 04:54:49.040 align:start position:0%
hospitals and what it costs
 
04:54:49.040 --> 04:54:50.470 align:start position:0%
hospitals and what it costs
but

04:54:50.470 --> 04:54:50.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:54:52.390 --> 04:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
are they all including the same thing
 
04:54:54.070 --> 04:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
are they not all including the same
 
04:54:56.628 --> 04:54:56.638 align:start position:0%
thing uh on some of that it says it's
 
04:54:59.110 --> 04:54:59.120 align:start position:0%
highly accurate on some hospitals as
 
04:55:01.830 --> 04:55:01.840 align:start position:0%
this is very low accuracy when i talk to
 
04:55:03.030 --> 04:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
the folks
 
04:55:04.628 --> 04:55:04.638 align:start position:0%
in the insurance department about what
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
drives that level of accuracy
 
04:55:10.948 --> 04:55:10.958 align:start position:0%
they're really soft on that um it's just
 
04:55:14.390 --> 04:55:14.400 align:start position:0%
aggregated data so um i guess i would be
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
agreeable to everything that you would
 
04:55:19.270 --> 04:55:19.280 align:start position:0%
propose as long as in the end
 
04:55:23.190 --> 04:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
it provided some value to the consumer
 
04:55:25.030 --> 04:55:25.040 align:start position:0%
okay fair enough all right
 
04:55:27.190 --> 04:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
representative burrows
 
04:55:28.948 --> 04:55:28.958 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
04:55:30.550 --> 04:55:30.560 align:start position:0%
question good to hear your voice
 
04:55:33.190 --> 04:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative mclean um
 
04:55:35.590 --> 04:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
i i guess my question is whether you
 
04:55:38.070 --> 04:55:38.080 align:start position:0%
know um when you say healthcare provider
 
04:55:40.550 --> 04:55:40.560 align:start position:0%
i i assume that could mean individual
 
04:55:43.190 --> 04:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
health care providers or
 
04:55:44.628 --> 04:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
or a small group of health care
 
04:55:44.638 --> 04:55:45.990 align:start position:0%
or a small group of health care
providers

04:55:45.990 --> 04:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
providers
 
04:55:46.000 --> 04:55:47.110 align:start position:0%
providers
correct

04:55:47.110 --> 04:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:55:49.110 --> 04:55:49.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up please another question you
 
04:55:50.150 --> 04:55:50.160 align:start position:0%
may inquire
 
04:55:52.788 --> 04:55:52.798 align:start position:0%
okay um so my question is
 
04:55:55.110 --> 04:55:55.120 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that many healthcare
 
04:55:57.350 --> 04:55:57.360 align:start position:0%
providers do not unders don't know the
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
codes the the um cpt codes they don't
 
04:56:01.830 --> 04:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
know the codes and the value of the
 
04:56:04.230 --> 04:56:04.240 align:start position:0%
codes and the second part of it is when
 
04:56:06.390 --> 04:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
they're calculating costs there's also a
 
04:56:09.190 --> 04:56:09.200 align:start position:0%
facilities cost that um
 
04:56:11.670 --> 04:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
is calculated in the cost so those are
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
those things that you'll also be looking
 
04:56:13.360 --> 04:56:14.310 align:start position:0%
those things that you'll also be looking
at

04:56:14.310 --> 04:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:56:14.320 --> 04:56:15.350 align:start position:0%
at
um

04:56:15.350 --> 04:56:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%
and and that's exactly you know building
 
04:56:19.110 --> 04:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
on the point that representative van
 
04:56:22.230 --> 04:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
houghton brought up so yes i mean it it
 
04:56:24.550 --> 04:56:24.560 align:start position:0%
it is problematic okay
 
04:56:26.470 --> 04:56:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:56:26.480 --> 04:56:27.750 align:start position:0%
thank you
and

04:56:27.750 --> 04:56:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:56:29.990 --> 04:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative fargo
 
04:56:32.150 --> 04:56:32.160 align:start position:0%
um yes i
 
04:56:35.350 --> 04:56:35.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
04:56:36.948 --> 04:56:36.958 align:start position:0%
having had
 
04:56:40.070 --> 04:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
several non-emergency type
 
04:56:42.150 --> 04:56:42.160 align:start position:0%
surgeries myself like hip replacements
 
04:56:43.750 --> 04:56:43.760 align:start position:0%
and knee replacements
 
04:56:45.510 --> 04:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
um there's a lot of things that are
 
04:56:47.270 --> 04:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
unpredictable that can happen to you
 
04:56:49.510 --> 04:56:49.520 align:start position:0%
when you're in that process so
 
04:56:51.990 --> 04:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
you could be given a quote but then
 
04:56:52.000 --> 04:56:52.788 align:start position:0%
you could be given a quote but then
have

04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:56:55.590 --> 04:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
a medical emergency or have something
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
unusual happen or have to see an
 
04:57:00.150 --> 04:57:00.160 align:start position:0%
additional specialist and i don't know
 
04:57:02.868 --> 04:57:02.878 align:start position:0%
how you could hold a provider to a quote
 
04:57:05.110 --> 04:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
when each individual case may be
 
04:57:08.470 --> 04:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
different how would you address that
 
04:57:11.270 --> 04:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
um well um the
 
04:57:13.430 --> 04:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
in the final draft all the binding
 
04:57:15.510 --> 04:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
provisions uh were taken out of it you
 
04:57:18.390 --> 04:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
know for that very reason because um a
 
04:57:21.830 --> 04:57:21.840 align:start position:0%
lot of the the healthcare individual
 
04:57:24.230 --> 04:57:24.240 align:start position:0%
health the pardon my the healthcare
 
04:57:27.670 --> 04:57:27.680 align:start position:0%
industry today is is managing risk and
 
04:57:29.750 --> 04:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
04:57:33.510 --> 04:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
so i took those because out because if
 
04:57:35.910 --> 04:57:35.920 align:start position:0%
you made a quote that was binding
 
04:57:37.990 --> 04:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
that would i think have just been too
 
04:57:39.190 --> 04:57:39.200 align:start position:0%
much because
 
04:57:41.270 --> 04:57:41.280 align:start position:0%
the risk is just too great and the other
 
04:57:42.628 --> 04:57:42.638 align:start position:0%
thing that
 
04:57:46.788 --> 04:57:46.798 align:start position:0%
does not apply in the original bill
 
04:57:46.798 --> 04:57:47.750 align:start position:0%
does not apply in the original bill
is

04:57:47.750 --> 04:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:57:50.708 --> 04:57:50.718 align:start position:0%
any emergency care so it exclusively
 
04:57:53.510 --> 04:57:53.520 align:start position:0%
addresses non-emergency care so
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
obviously if you are in the middle of a
 
04:57:59.510 --> 04:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
routine non-emergency procedure but an
 
04:58:01.830 --> 04:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
emergency event arises like you have a
 
04:58:04.310 --> 04:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
bleed out or something like that
 
04:58:06.550 --> 04:58:06.560 align:start position:0%
that's an emergency event
 
04:58:09.830 --> 04:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
that is not covered under the provisions
 
04:58:12.550 --> 04:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
of the bill you know but again um
 
04:58:14.948 --> 04:58:14.958 align:start position:0%
even whether it's covered or not covered
 
04:58:18.390 --> 04:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
i recognize even this language um needs
 
04:58:20.070 --> 04:58:20.080 align:start position:0%
to be worked on so this would this would
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
definitely not be the final language
 
04:58:24.708 --> 04:58:24.718 align:start position:0%
that could uh that could uh go to the
 
04:58:24.718 --> 04:58:27.430 align:start position:0%
that could uh that could uh go to the
house

04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:29.110 --> 04:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
 
04:58:29.120 --> 04:58:30.708 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you very much for your
testimony

04:58:30.708 --> 04:58:30.718 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
04:58:30.718 --> 04:58:31.590 align:start position:0%
testimony
uh

04:58:31.590 --> 04:58:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:58:35.750 --> 04:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
chair well then call on paula minahan
 
04:58:35.760 --> 04:58:37.430 align:start position:0%
chair well then call on paula minahan
and

04:58:37.430 --> 04:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:58:39.030 --> 04:58:39.040 align:start position:0%
okay there you are
 
04:58:46.070 --> 04:58:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:55.750 --> 04:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:57.830 --> 04:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
oh she will be sorry about that um can
 
04:59:00.470 --> 04:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
you hear me yes we can great sorry about
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
that there was a little delay good
 
04:59:03.990 --> 04:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
afternoon mr chairman members of the
 
04:59:05.590 --> 04:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is
 
04:59:07.510 --> 04:59:07.520 align:start position:0%
paula minihan senior vice president
 
04:59:09.110 --> 04:59:09.120 align:start position:0%
state government relations with the new
 
04:59:10.628 --> 04:59:10.638 align:start position:0%
hampshire hospital association
 
04:59:12.310 --> 04:59:12.320 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
 
04:59:12.320 --> 04:59:13.270 align:start position:0%
representing all our hospitals in the
state

04:59:13.270 --> 04:59:13.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
04:59:15.270 --> 04:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
the hospital association is opposed to
 
04:59:19.270 --> 04:59:19.280 align:start position:0%
house bill 264 um and i wanted to just
 
04:59:22.150 --> 04:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
clarify a few things i know a lot of you
 
04:59:23.190 --> 04:59:23.200 align:start position:0%
know me
 
04:59:25.750 --> 04:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
from years past um so
 
04:59:28.150 --> 04:59:28.160 align:start position:0%
um i will just kind of i've submitted my
 
04:59:29.990 --> 04:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
testimony which is kind of long but it
 
04:59:31.990 --> 04:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
provided a lot of um background that i
 
04:59:34.390 --> 04:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
thought might be helpful for you um but
 
04:59:37.750 --> 04:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify the bill um
 
04:59:42.070 --> 04:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
is amending 151 rsa 151 that is specific
 
04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
to health care facilities
 
04:59:46.470 --> 04:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
so i think to answer representative
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
burroughs question does not incorporate
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
any of the private
 
04:59:55.750 --> 04:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
doctors offices provider offices so
 
04:59:58.230 --> 04:59:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's important for folks to understand
 
05:00:00.310 --> 05:00:00.320 align:start position:0%
they are not licensed
 
05:00:02.150 --> 05:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
as a health care facility in the state
 
05:00:04.150 --> 05:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire their private doctors
 
05:00:06.310 --> 05:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
offices fall under the board of medicine
 
05:00:08.150 --> 05:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
and do not require
 
05:00:10.788 --> 05:00:10.798 align:start position:0%
a specific facility license
 
05:00:10.798 --> 05:00:11.670 align:start position:0%
a specific facility license
um

05:00:11.670 --> 05:00:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:00:14.550 --> 05:00:14.560 align:start position:0%
as representative fargo indicated
 
05:00:18.788 --> 05:00:18.798 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of um unassoci un
 
05:00:22.070 --> 05:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
identified potentially um emergency
 
05:00:25.030 --> 05:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
services that might result in in
 
05:00:27.750 --> 05:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
addition to a non-emergent service and
 
05:00:29.510 --> 05:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
that is really our issue with the
 
05:00:31.270 --> 05:00:31.280 align:start position:0%
hospitals and again anyone that has
 
05:00:33.670 --> 05:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
heard me testify on similar bills in the
 
05:00:33.680 --> 05:00:34.788 align:start position:0%
heard me testify on similar bills in the
past

05:00:34.788 --> 05:00:34.798 align:start position:0%
past
 
05:00:37.750 --> 05:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
knows that um they they are complex um
 
05:00:39.750 --> 05:00:39.760 align:start position:0%
so what hospitals have done
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
voluntarily for years
 
05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
is um to provide these
 
05:00:45.200 --> 05:00:46.708 align:start position:0%
is um to provide these
tools

05:00:46.708 --> 05:00:46.718 align:start position:0%
tools
 
05:00:48.628 --> 05:00:48.638 align:start position:0%
and i would say i don't speak obviously
 
05:00:50.470 --> 05:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
for the carriers but they also have
 
05:00:53.190 --> 05:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
tools um and then if you're uninsured
 
05:00:55.590 --> 05:00:55.600 align:start position:0%
151 colon 12
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
there is an uninsured law on the state
 
05:00:59.990 --> 05:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
on the on the books in new hampshire
 
05:01:01.510 --> 05:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
that actually provides a pretty
 
05:01:03.910 --> 05:01:03.920 align:start position:0%
substantial discount for anyone that is
 
05:01:07.270 --> 05:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
uninsured um so getting a quote um is a
 
05:01:08.628 --> 05:01:08.638 align:start position:0%
little more challenging but they
 
05:01:11.510 --> 05:01:11.520 align:start position:0%
certainly the hospitals do that um so
 
05:01:13.590 --> 05:01:13.600 align:start position:0%
what the hospitals try to do is to
 
05:01:15.590 --> 05:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
provide accurate and relevant cost
 
05:01:15.600 --> 05:01:16.868 align:start position:0%
provide accurate and relevant cost
information

05:01:16.868 --> 05:01:16.878 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:01:19.750 --> 05:01:19.760 align:start position:0%
that that may include out-of-pocket cost
 
05:01:22.150 --> 05:01:22.160 align:start position:0%
calculators on the hospitals have
 
05:01:24.310 --> 05:01:24.320 align:start position:0%
created tools on that um they've
 
05:01:26.948 --> 05:01:26.958 align:start position:0%
invested in technology to streamline the
 
05:01:28.868 --> 05:01:28.878 align:start position:0%
process of getting information to the
 
05:01:32.070 --> 05:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
patient and they provide a phone number
 
05:01:35.270 --> 05:01:35.280 align:start position:0%
um readily available on their website
 
05:01:36.948 --> 05:01:36.958 align:start position:0%
to assist
 
05:01:39.030 --> 05:01:39.040 align:start position:0%
patients so what they really have done
 
05:01:41.830 --> 05:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
is they try to uh make it really easy
 
05:01:43.670 --> 05:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
for the hot the patient to actually call
 
05:01:46.230 --> 05:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
the hospital and have that conversation
 
05:01:48.868 --> 05:01:48.878 align:start position:0%
as representative fargo said if you're
 
05:01:50.628 --> 05:01:50.638 align:start position:0%
getting a total knee replacement there
 
05:01:53.110 --> 05:01:53.120 align:start position:0%
are a lot of components to that beyond
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
just getting a um going on a website and
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
and getting a
 
05:01:58.750 --> 05:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
an estimate you need have the
 
05:02:01.190 --> 05:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
anesthesiologist the physician
 
05:02:04.310 --> 05:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
um the hospital or if it's an uh
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgery center attached to
 
05:02:08.868 --> 05:02:08.878 align:start position:0%
the hospital you gotta
 
05:02:11.030 --> 05:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
get that information so that's what they
 
05:02:13.270 --> 05:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
do they really focus on trying to be
 
05:02:14.788 --> 05:02:14.798 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
05:02:18.708 --> 05:02:18.718 align:start position:0%
um and but more importantly and it's um
 
05:02:20.948 --> 05:02:20.958 align:start position:0%
i think it's new information that maybe
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
some of you are not aware but the
 
05:02:24.550 --> 05:02:24.560 align:start position:0%
federal government implemented a
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
hospital transparency regulation in 2019
 
05:02:30.708 --> 05:02:30.718 align:start position:0%
that was phased in the last couple years
 
05:02:30.718 --> 05:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
that was phased in the last couple years
i

05:02:31.510 --> 05:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
05:02:34.550 --> 05:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
incorporate i included your the um
 
05:02:37.430 --> 05:02:37.440 align:start position:0%
the link to the to the website the cms
 
05:02:40.628 --> 05:02:40.638 align:start position:0%
website um on in my testimony
 
05:02:43.270 --> 05:02:43.280 align:start position:0%
but a lot in that there was a component
 
05:02:46.150 --> 05:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
that was passed in 2019 for that went
 
05:02:48.550 --> 05:02:48.560 align:start position:0%
into effect in 2020 and now there's a
 
05:02:51.270 --> 05:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
brand new one um that is even more
 
05:02:53.750 --> 05:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
elaborate and um and detailed that went
 
05:02:57.510 --> 05:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
into effect last month in january 2021
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
hospitals in new hampshire have spent a
 
05:03:01.590 --> 05:03:01.600 align:start position:0%
considerable time effort and financial
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
resources to implement this rule they're
 
05:03:07.350 --> 05:03:07.360 align:start position:0%
substantial uh substantive excuse me and
 
05:03:08.788 --> 05:03:08.798 align:start position:0%
we do not believe additional
 
05:03:10.788 --> 05:03:10.798 align:start position:0%
requirements should be imposed on our
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
hospitals at this time
 
05:03:15.270 --> 05:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
um and despite the major the major
 
05:03:18.470 --> 05:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
expanse of this rule again we we believe
 
05:03:20.070 --> 05:03:20.080 align:start position:0%
it's best that the hospitals and the
 
05:03:22.550 --> 05:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
patients talk directly to get a more
 
05:03:22.560 --> 05:03:23.750 align:start position:0%
patients talk directly to get a more
meaningful

05:03:23.750 --> 05:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
05:03:27.110 --> 05:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
um estimate um that will be more
 
05:03:30.708 --> 05:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
relevant for the for the patient um so
 
05:03:32.948 --> 05:03:32.958 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions but we
 
05:03:36.070 --> 05:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
do not believe that this um bill is
 
05:03:38.150 --> 05:03:38.160 align:start position:0%
necessary and we ask that
 
05:03:40.868 --> 05:03:40.878 align:start position:0%
you not um you find it inexpedient to
 
05:03:42.310 --> 05:03:42.320 align:start position:0%
legislate i'm happy to answer any
 
05:03:42.320 --> 05:03:43.350 align:start position:0%
legislate i'm happy to answer any
questions

05:03:43.350 --> 05:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
questions
 
05:03:46.550 --> 05:03:46.560 align:start position:0%
okay yeah before i take a question um
 
05:03:48.708 --> 05:03:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's funny because you said 155 and just
 
05:03:50.628 --> 05:03:50.638 align:start position:0%
dragged my memory because i know many
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
moons ago
 
05:03:53.670 --> 05:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh there used to be a
 
05:03:55.830 --> 05:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
patient's bill of rights under that that
 
05:03:57.910 --> 05:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
hospital statute
 
05:03:59.670 --> 05:03:59.680 align:start position:0%
and isn't one of them one of the statute
 
05:04:02.830 --> 05:04:02.840 align:start position:0%
requirements in 155 is to is to give a
 
05:04:06.150 --> 05:04:06.160 align:start position:0%
rough look of what the what the uh
 
05:04:07.990 --> 05:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost
 
05:04:10.550 --> 05:04:10.560 align:start position:0%
upon request yes yes you're right
 
05:04:12.230 --> 05:04:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative so i was going to say
 
05:04:14.550 --> 05:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
this is already law theoretically
 
05:04:18.708 --> 05:04:18.718 align:start position:0%
um it's i think i got to pull up 150 um
 
05:04:20.390 --> 05:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
what is the patient bill of rights i
 
05:04:22.868 --> 05:04:22.878 align:start position:0%
should know it by heart but i don't know
 
05:04:24.550 --> 05:04:24.560 align:start position:0%
why i'm asking you
 
05:04:28.948 --> 05:04:28.958 align:start position:0%
i know um i i'll look it up um
 
05:04:30.628 --> 05:04:30.638 align:start position:0%
that was just my that was my when he
 
05:04:32.470 --> 05:04:32.480 align:start position:0%
said one two it dawned on me that that
 
05:04:35.270 --> 05:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
was it's um the patient that's primarily
 
05:04:36.948 --> 05:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
for inpatient i think and it's upon
 
05:04:39.590 --> 05:04:39.600 align:start position:0%
request but yes you're right it's 151
 
05:04:41.110 --> 05:04:41.120 align:start position:0%
colon 21
 
05:04:42.550 --> 05:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
is the patient bill of rights but you're
 
05:04:45.110 --> 05:04:45.120 align:start position:0%
right it is incorporated into that
 
05:04:48.230 --> 05:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
but this is more the bill um represented
 
05:04:50.230 --> 05:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
mclean's bill obviously is more than
 
05:04:52.628 --> 05:04:52.638 align:start position:0%
just hospitals as he mentioned urgent
 
05:04:54.788 --> 05:04:54.798 align:start position:0%
care centers um
 
05:04:56.550 --> 05:04:56.560 align:start position:0%
would fall under this but doctors
 
05:04:58.628 --> 05:04:58.638 align:start position:0%
offices don't and i just wanted to make
 
05:05:01.190 --> 05:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
that point um because i don't know that
 
05:05:03.750 --> 05:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
everyone understands
 
05:05:06.150 --> 05:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
what 151 incorporates and what it does
 
05:05:08.230 --> 05:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
not got it okay
 
05:05:10.788 --> 05:05:10.798 align:start position:0%
representative herbert your your hand is
 
05:05:12.708 --> 05:05:12.718 align:start position:0%
up but i'm not sure you're with us that
 
05:05:14.708 --> 05:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
was a mistake because you took yourself
 
05:05:17.430 --> 05:05:17.440 align:start position:0%
video off so are you
 
05:05:18.788 --> 05:05:18.798 align:start position:0%
okay wait a minute
 
05:05:21.190 --> 05:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
i took i forgot about the video part
 
05:05:23.750 --> 05:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
um no i was uh just a couple
 
05:05:27.110 --> 05:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
observations number one is uh
 
05:05:28.470 --> 05:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
i remember you
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
i remember your question right you could
 
05:05:31.830 --> 05:05:31.840 align:start position:0%
do a question or yes
 
05:05:34.070 --> 05:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
i did it did you not uh
 
05:05:36.550 --> 05:05:36.560 align:start position:0%
make reference to we like to get a
 
05:05:39.590 --> 05:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
written testimony in
 
05:05:41.030 --> 05:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
and i i
 
05:05:42.708 --> 05:05:42.718 align:start position:0%
and isn't it true
 
05:05:46.230 --> 05:05:46.240 align:start position:0%
that that is aimed at uh not extending
 
05:05:48.070 --> 05:05:48.080 align:start position:0%
the uh conversation
 
05:05:48.080 --> 05:05:49.510 align:start position:0%
the uh conversation
beyond

05:05:49.510 --> 05:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
beyond
 
05:05:50.948 --> 05:05:50.958 align:start position:0%
uh uh
 
05:05:52.708 --> 05:05:52.718 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily especially if there's
 
05:05:54.470 --> 05:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
written testimony
 
05:05:57.270 --> 05:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
and that so i what i'm trying to get at
 
05:05:59.510 --> 05:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that
 
05:06:01.750 --> 05:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
the uh sponsor of this bill
 
05:06:04.070 --> 05:06:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh has already told us that it is not
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
ready for prime time
 
05:06:08.628 --> 05:06:08.638 align:start position:0%
and and as a result of that
 
05:06:11.430 --> 05:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
i thought we might uh figure out how to
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
move it move it somewhere else and then
 
05:06:17.110 --> 05:06:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a sufficient time in order to
 
05:06:18.708 --> 05:06:18.718 align:start position:0%
actually look at the bill
 
05:06:20.390 --> 05:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
in depth i didn't think we were going to
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
do it today i think that's uh
 
05:06:23.440 --> 05:06:24.628 align:start position:0%
do it today i think that's uh
over

05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:06:26.868 --> 05:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
a bridge too far when the sponsor
 
05:06:29.910 --> 05:06:29.920 align:start position:0%
himself is not all that comfortable uh
 
05:06:29.920 --> 05:06:30.628 align:start position:0%
himself is not all that comfortable uh
with

05:06:30.628 --> 05:06:30.638 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:06:33.350 --> 05:06:33.360 align:start position:0%
the bill itself as it currently stands
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
it's just that i you know i'm old i
 
05:06:37.430 --> 05:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't have as many days in front of me
 
05:06:40.390 --> 05:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
as i did before so i like to get things
 
05:06:42.868 --> 05:06:42.878 align:start position:0%
done as efficiently as possible if you
 
05:06:44.470 --> 05:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
don't mind uh
 
05:06:47.510 --> 05:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
so go ahead and tune yourself out go go
 
05:06:49.990 --> 05:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
do what you old geezers like to do and
 
05:06:51.510 --> 05:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
but yes i still got to go through the
 
05:06:54.470 --> 05:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
hearing and have everybody testify
 
05:06:57.990 --> 05:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
and and have the questions and that i'm
 
05:07:00.868 --> 05:07:00.878 align:start position:0%
i'm obligated to do to do that hearing
 
05:07:04.150 --> 05:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
i'm still listening i just uh okay i
 
05:07:05.910 --> 05:07:05.920 align:start position:0%
make faces and stuff like that yeah so
 
05:07:07.510 --> 05:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
well i did see you make a face last time
 
05:07:08.868 --> 05:07:08.878 align:start position:0%
and i was glad you turned your camera
 
05:07:11.750 --> 05:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
off okay represent hamilton
 
05:07:13.110 --> 05:07:13.120 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chair thank you for
 
05:07:15.750 --> 05:07:15.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony um i guess in the spirit
 
05:07:17.510 --> 05:07:17.520 align:start position:0%
of streamlining
 
05:07:19.350 --> 05:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
uh you mentioned in your testimony and i
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
was vaguely aware of this but i don't
 
05:07:23.510 --> 05:07:23.520 align:start position:0%
know the details these new requirements
 
05:07:25.110 --> 05:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
these new transparency requirements
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
coming from the federal government
 
05:07:29.670 --> 05:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
you mentioned they were phased in
 
05:07:31.430 --> 05:07:31.440 align:start position:0%
and the most recent went into effect
 
05:07:34.868 --> 05:07:34.878 align:start position:0%
january 1st of this year
 
05:07:37.670 --> 05:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
is that correct um
 
05:07:39.830 --> 05:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
does that accomplish some of the things
 
05:07:42.550 --> 05:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
that uh representative mclean's bill is
 
05:07:44.948 --> 05:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
attempting to accomplish and
 
05:07:44.958 --> 05:07:46.150 align:start position:0%
attempting to accomplish and
uh

05:07:46.150 --> 05:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:07:48.470 --> 05:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
would it be a good idea to allow those
 
05:07:51.910 --> 05:07:51.920 align:start position:0%
new regs to settle before
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
putting additional
 
05:07:55.830 --> 05:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
burdens on to hospitals
 
05:07:55.840 --> 05:07:58.868 align:start position:0%
burdens on to hospitals
um

05:07:58.868 --> 05:07:58.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:02.150 --> 05:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that the federal
 
05:08:04.788 --> 05:08:04.798 align:start position:0%
regulations although they are expansive
 
05:08:08.868 --> 05:08:08.878 align:start position:0%
um they require lots of posting of
 
05:08:11.590 --> 05:08:11.600 align:start position:0%
information on the hospital's websites
 
05:08:14.868 --> 05:08:14.878 align:start position:0%
that is very detailed um
 
05:08:19.190 --> 05:08:19.200 align:start position:0%
but um to be um perfectly um
 
05:08:22.070 --> 05:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
on uh frank um we as the hospital
 
05:08:23.750 --> 05:08:23.760 align:start position:0%
industry had concerns about these
 
05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
regulations when they were introduced
 
05:08:28.550 --> 05:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
and and promulgated by um the previous
 
05:08:30.948 --> 05:08:30.958 align:start position:0%
administration because
 
05:08:33.430 --> 05:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
they are not what i would call consumer
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
friendly um they are very very very
 
05:08:38.708 --> 05:08:38.718 align:start position:0%
detailed with detailed charges
 
05:08:41.270 --> 05:08:41.280 align:start position:0%
difficult for an individual going into a
 
05:08:43.110 --> 05:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
hospital for like a total knee
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
replacement to actually figure out
 
05:08:48.788 --> 05:08:48.798 align:start position:0%
what it's going to cost them um and
 
05:08:51.190 --> 05:08:51.200 align:start position:0%
furthermore as someone else indicated
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
because when you have insurance it is a
 
05:08:55.190 --> 05:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
whole different dynamic because the
 
05:08:55.200 --> 05:08:56.150 align:start position:0%
whole different dynamic because the
insurance

05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:09:00.070 --> 05:09:00.080 align:start position:0%
company actually is more effective i
 
05:09:02.550 --> 05:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
would say in bit in being able to help
 
05:09:04.550 --> 05:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
that consumer figure out what their
 
05:09:06.230 --> 05:09:06.240 align:start position:0%
out-of-pocket will be
 
05:09:09.670 --> 05:09:09.680 align:start position:0%
um so while i think it was an attempt to
 
05:09:11.670 --> 05:09:11.680 align:start position:0%
make the um
 
05:09:14.230 --> 05:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
the charges i guess of the hospitals
 
05:09:14.240 --> 05:09:15.030 align:start position:0%
the charges i guess of the hospitals
more

05:09:15.030 --> 05:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
more
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
transparent to the consumer our concern
 
05:09:21.270 --> 05:09:21.280 align:start position:0%
as a hospital industry is it's just too
 
05:09:23.190 --> 05:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
much in the weeds and it really does not
 
05:09:25.110 --> 05:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
help the consumer necessarily figure out
 
05:09:27.910 --> 05:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
what they what their cost is having said
 
05:09:30.628 --> 05:09:30.638 align:start position:0%
all that um back to your question about
 
05:09:32.708 --> 05:09:32.718 align:start position:0%
the the bill before you
 
05:09:34.868 --> 05:09:34.878 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
05:09:37.110 --> 05:09:37.120 align:start position:0%
other concerns about this putting this
 
05:09:40.628 --> 05:09:40.638 align:start position:0%
into law we're doing it voluntarily um
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the specificity with
 
05:09:45.030 --> 05:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
the three days and the specifics with
 
05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
the cpts except like i said
 
05:09:50.230 --> 05:09:50.240 align:start position:0%
that's when the patient
 
05:09:52.708 --> 05:09:52.718 align:start position:0%
will call the hospital talk to the right
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
financial patient representative and
 
05:09:56.868 --> 05:09:56.878 align:start position:0%
work through that
 
05:09:59.750 --> 05:09:59.760 align:start position:0%
to find out exactly what that person is
 
05:10:01.990 --> 05:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
the doctor has said they need
 
05:10:05.670 --> 05:10:05.680 align:start position:0%
they get then they do the estimate um so
 
05:10:07.750 --> 05:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
i guess i would say we don't need the we
 
05:10:09.670 --> 05:10:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't believe it the bill is necessary
 
05:10:12.070 --> 05:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
because the hospitals are providing to
 
05:10:14.310 --> 05:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
the to the extent that they're able
 
05:10:18.390 --> 05:10:18.400 align:start position:0%
um this this information now um
 
05:10:21.670 --> 05:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
but like you said the new law or the new
 
05:10:23.670 --> 05:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
reg it's not a law the new regulation
 
05:10:25.590 --> 05:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
went into effect like you said a month
 
05:10:28.550 --> 05:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
ago um we do need to see what
 
05:10:30.708 --> 05:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
transpires as a result of that there's
 
05:10:33.030 --> 05:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
also another piece of that law
 
05:10:36.070 --> 05:10:36.080 align:start position:0%
that impacts the cons the carriers and
 
05:10:39.430 --> 05:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
that goes into effect in 2022 um so it's
 
05:10:42.150 --> 05:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
really really expansive um legislation
 
05:10:43.990 --> 05:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
uh excuse me i keep saying like
 
05:10:47.030 --> 05:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
regulation um and it's um i think we
 
05:10:48.868 --> 05:10:48.878 align:start position:0%
need some time to see how it plays out i
 
05:10:50.868 --> 05:10:50.878 align:start position:0%
think you you bring up a very good point
 
05:10:50.878 --> 05:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
think you you bring up a very good point
representative

05:10:53.510 --> 05:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:10:55.830 --> 05:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
okay all set
 
05:10:57.990 --> 05:10:58.000 align:start position:0%
uh no more hands up and we're all set
 
05:10:59.910 --> 05:10:59.920 align:start position:0%
thank you paula
 
05:11:02.628 --> 05:11:02.638 align:start position:0%
and last but not least is tyler brennan
 
05:11:03.910 --> 05:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire insurance
 
05:11:03.920 --> 05:11:06.628 align:start position:0%
from the new hampshire insurance
department

05:11:06.628 --> 05:11:06.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:09.030 --> 05:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um by the brandon with the
 
05:11:11.190 --> 05:11:11.200 align:start position:0%
insurance department and the department
 
05:11:13.990 --> 05:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
does not have a position on the bill but
 
05:11:15.990 --> 05:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
we have been a long time supporter of
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
price transparency in general
 
05:11:20.948 --> 05:11:20.958 align:start position:0%
our new hampshire health cost website in
 
05:11:22.868 --> 05:11:22.878 align:start position:0%
early 2007
 
05:11:24.708 --> 05:11:24.718 align:start position:0%
largely because of
 
05:11:26.628 --> 05:11:26.638 align:start position:0%
the legislative legislature's interest
 
05:11:28.550 --> 05:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
in price transparency among health care
 
05:11:28.560 --> 05:11:29.830 align:start position:0%
in price transparency among health care
providers

05:11:29.830 --> 05:11:29.840 align:start position:0%
providers
 
05:11:31.510 --> 05:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
the website's received a fair amount of
 
05:11:31.520 --> 05:11:32.550 align:start position:0%
the website's received a fair amount of
attention

05:11:32.550 --> 05:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
attention
 
05:11:32.560 --> 05:11:33.510 align:start position:0%
attention
and

05:11:33.510 --> 05:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:11:34.948 --> 05:11:34.958 align:start position:0%
both nationally and we're still really
 
05:11:36.310 --> 05:11:36.320 align:start position:0%
considered new hampshire is considered
 
05:11:37.910 --> 05:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
the benchmark
 
05:11:39.990 --> 05:11:40.000 align:start position:0%
price transparency because of the effort
 
05:11:41.670 --> 05:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
around that website
 
05:11:44.550 --> 05:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
that being said i can't over overstate
 
05:11:46.150 --> 05:11:46.160 align:start position:0%
kind of the complexity of trying to
 
05:11:46.160 --> 05:11:47.670 align:start position:0%
kind of the complexity of trying to
provide

05:11:47.670 --> 05:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
provide
 
05:11:50.070 --> 05:11:50.080 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly format
 
05:11:52.150 --> 05:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
for people to use and
 
05:11:53.670 --> 05:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
you've got so many different moving
 
05:11:53.680 --> 05:11:54.628 align:start position:0%
you've got so many different moving
parts

05:11:54.628 --> 05:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
parts
 
05:11:56.788 --> 05:11:56.798 align:start position:0%
um between the reimbursement systems and
 
05:11:57.910 --> 05:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
the payments going to different
 
05:11:59.270 --> 05:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
providers that are involved in
 
05:12:01.350 --> 05:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
particular service and even who the
 
05:12:03.750 --> 05:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
patient would see as provider is it
 
05:12:05.350 --> 05:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
going to be the physician is it going to
 
05:12:07.510 --> 05:12:07.520 align:start position:0%
be the hospital the surgery center is it
 
05:12:08.948 --> 05:12:08.958 align:start position:0%
going to be the group practice that
 
05:12:10.310 --> 05:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're a part of
 
05:12:10.320 --> 05:12:11.110 align:start position:0%
they're a part of
so

05:12:11.110 --> 05:12:11.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:12:12.868 --> 05:12:12.878 align:start position:0%
framing the data in such a way it's
 
05:12:16.550 --> 05:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
actually useful and the analysis or the
 
05:12:18.230 --> 05:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
way the methodology is applied
 
05:12:18.240 --> 05:12:19.830 align:start position:0%
way the methodology is applied
consistently

05:12:19.830 --> 05:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
consistently
 
05:12:22.070 --> 05:12:22.080 align:start position:0%
these are some some challenging areas to
 
05:12:24.390 --> 05:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
work through so i think what a good
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
example is some even something as simple
 
05:12:28.470 --> 05:12:28.480 align:start position:0%
as a mammogram tends to have a
 
05:12:31.270 --> 05:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
professional and a technical component
 
05:12:33.030 --> 05:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
but even better not all the time
 
05:12:35.590 --> 05:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's just built globally so if
 
05:12:36.788 --> 05:12:36.798 align:start position:0%
you want to know the price of a
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
mammogram you might go to a hospital and
 
05:12:40.708 --> 05:12:40.718 align:start position:0%
ask and they might just tell you the
 
05:12:42.390 --> 05:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
technical component the amount they're
 
05:12:44.550 --> 05:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
paid for it and in fact a hospital did
 
05:12:45.990 --> 05:12:46.000 align:start position:0%
that a number of years ago and they
 
05:12:48.310 --> 05:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
looked really inexpensive because
 
05:12:49.990 --> 05:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't include the radiologist that
 
05:12:52.868 --> 05:12:52.878 align:start position:0%
didn't actually work for the hospital
 
05:12:55.350 --> 05:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
i heard from a radiologist when we first
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
put up the website who said yeah you've
 
05:12:59.590 --> 05:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
got our group practice up there but i
 
05:13:01.110 --> 05:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
don't think the rate is right and they
 
05:13:03.270 --> 05:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
were quite specific to anthem and this
 
05:13:04.868 --> 05:13:04.878 align:start position:0%
is one of the only examples where we
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
heard from a provider and they were
 
05:13:09.190 --> 05:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
right we were posting their rates but
 
05:13:11.270 --> 05:13:11.280 align:start position:0%
sometimes the group practice build a
 
05:13:12.948 --> 05:13:12.958 align:start position:0%
global rate which was just the group
 
05:13:14.948 --> 05:13:14.958 align:start position:0%
practice billing it other times they
 
05:13:16.868 --> 05:13:16.878 align:start position:0%
worked at the local hospital in which
 
05:13:18.788 --> 05:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
case the hospital reimbursement portion
 
05:13:20.150 --> 05:13:20.160 align:start position:0%
was more than what the group practice
 
05:13:21.910 --> 05:13:21.920 align:start position:0%
would have normally seen
 
05:13:23.830 --> 05:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
our methodology would just bundle the
 
05:13:25.830 --> 05:13:25.840 align:start position:0%
services together regardless of where
 
05:13:27.750 --> 05:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
this particular radiology group was
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
performing the service and
 
05:13:32.310 --> 05:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
separate those two so clarify if you
 
05:13:33.590 --> 05:13:33.600 align:start position:0%
went to the hospital if you went to the
 
05:13:36.070 --> 05:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
group practice
 
05:13:38.150 --> 05:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
so there are a lot of challenges in
 
05:13:40.310 --> 05:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
producing information like this we do
 
05:13:42.150 --> 05:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
include a kind of a field that gives you
 
05:13:45.030 --> 05:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
a sense of how accurate our estimate is
 
05:13:46.948 --> 05:13:46.958 align:start position:0%
and one of the reasons the accuracy can
 
05:13:49.030 --> 05:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
suffer is we're looking at actual
 
05:13:51.190 --> 05:13:51.200 align:start position:0%
patient experiences so we use our
 
05:13:53.270 --> 05:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
anonymous claims data to produce the
 
05:13:55.350 --> 05:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
price estimates but the reality is
 
05:13:57.510 --> 05:13:57.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes every patient's experience is
 
05:13:59.030 --> 05:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
different from the other even at the
 
05:14:01.430 --> 05:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
same provider can't always explain why
 
05:14:03.270 --> 05:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
that's the case but if you've got 10
 
05:14:05.430 --> 05:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
different patients they all had 10
 
05:14:08.070 --> 05:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
different total price for their services
 
05:14:10.230 --> 05:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
um we can't provide an estimate with a
 
05:14:11.670 --> 05:14:11.680 align:start position:0%
lot of confidence so that's one of the
 
05:14:13.750 --> 05:14:13.760 align:start position:0%
biggest reasons for that field if you
 
05:14:15.350 --> 05:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
actually want to know how that field is
 
05:14:17.190 --> 05:14:17.200 align:start position:0%
is created it's it's based on the
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
coefficient of variation which is the
 
05:14:20.868 --> 05:14:20.878 align:start position:0%
standard deviation is a percentage of
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
the mean but that's not something we
 
05:14:25.910 --> 05:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
normally throw out there um so if we
 
05:14:27.750 --> 05:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that kind of a legislation
 
05:14:29.910 --> 05:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
like this might increase cost it
 
05:14:31.910 --> 05:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
probably was just along the lines that
 
05:14:33.910 --> 05:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
um if the intention is to have whatever
 
05:14:35.750 --> 05:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
thousands of providers in new hampshire
 
05:14:38.470 --> 05:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
producing price information um that may
 
05:14:41.270 --> 05:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
not be uh in the same consumer-friendly
 
05:14:42.550 --> 05:14:42.560 align:start position:0%
format then you've got the
 
05:14:44.310 --> 05:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
administrative cost of producing the
 
05:14:46.070 --> 05:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
information out there potentially
 
05:14:48.150 --> 05:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
without the benefit and
 
05:14:50.070 --> 05:14:50.080 align:start position:0%
based on history most of the price
 
05:14:52.070 --> 05:14:52.080 align:start position:0%
transparency initiatives
 
05:14:53.990 --> 05:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
haven't resulted in consumer friendly
 
05:14:54.000 --> 05:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
haven't resulted in consumer friendly
information

05:14:55.670 --> 05:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
information
 
05:14:55.680 --> 05:14:56.550 align:start position:0%
information
so

05:14:56.550 --> 05:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:14:57.990 --> 05:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a general overview of
 
05:14:59.190 --> 05:14:59.200 align:start position:0%
what we've done and some of the
 
05:15:01.430 --> 05:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
challenges in producing useful price
 
05:15:03.750 --> 05:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
price transparency information but happy
 
05:15:07.750 --> 05:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:10.390 --> 05:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson has a
 
05:15:10.400 --> 05:15:11.750 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson has a
question

05:15:11.750 --> 05:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:15:13.830 --> 05:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and
 
05:15:17.910 --> 05:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for taking my question um
 
05:15:20.310 --> 05:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
so this bill would be added if it were
 
05:15:24.390 --> 05:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
passed as is to rsa 151 section 12 b
 
05:15:26.230 --> 05:15:26.240 align:start position:0%
which is hospital rates for self-pay
 
05:15:26.240 --> 05:15:27.430 align:start position:0%
which is hospital rates for self-pay
patients

05:15:27.430 --> 05:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
patients
 
05:15:29.030 --> 05:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um do you think would you see any
 
05:15:31.270 --> 05:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
problem with simply adding
 
05:15:32.788 --> 05:15:32.798 align:start position:0%
this language
 
05:15:34.708 --> 05:15:34.718 align:start position:0%
um stating that the
 
05:15:36.708 --> 05:15:36.718 align:start position:0%
the hospital which presumably has the
 
05:15:38.470 --> 05:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
self-pay patient rate that they would
 
05:15:38.480 --> 05:15:39.270 align:start position:0%
self-pay patient rate that they would
just

05:15:39.270 --> 05:15:39.280 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:15:41.110 --> 05:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
tell the the patient
 
05:15:43.750 --> 05:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
or tell the buyer right then
 
05:15:46.788 --> 05:15:46.798 align:start position:0%
what that cost is before they buy it
 
05:15:48.708 --> 05:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
in other words just add it right into
 
05:15:48.718 --> 05:15:51.350 align:start position:0%
in other words just add it right into
the

05:15:51.350 --> 05:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.910 --> 05:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
patient bill of rights
 
05:15:56.390 --> 05:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
so i think it would have to include
 
05:15:58.708 --> 05:15:58.718 align:start position:0%
enough clarification for the hospital to
 
05:16:01.190 --> 05:16:01.200 align:start position:0%
provide what at best would still be an
 
05:16:03.190 --> 05:16:03.200 align:start position:0%
estimate and it would just be for the
 
05:16:05.430 --> 05:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
hospital services so that could be
 
05:16:07.110 --> 05:16:07.120 align:start position:0%
misleading because when you go to the
 
05:16:08.708 --> 05:16:08.718 align:start position:0%
hospital you're never going to get a
 
05:16:11.830 --> 05:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill just for hospital services so um i
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
mean you have to remember sometimes
 
05:16:15.190 --> 05:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
hospitals are paid on a discount from
 
05:16:16.868 --> 05:16:16.878 align:start position:0%
charges from sure sometimes they
 
05:16:19.510 --> 05:16:19.520 align:start position:0%
calculate their rates based on sort of a
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
per case payment that medicare might use
 
05:16:23.270 --> 05:16:23.280 align:start position:0%
for payment there are a lot of different
 
05:16:25.830 --> 05:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
ways of looking at it so it's um i think
 
05:16:27.750 --> 05:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
it still has a number of challenges
 
05:16:29.750 --> 05:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
obviously if you narrow the requirement
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
as much as possible then um then it's
 
05:16:35.670 --> 05:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
potentially simpler to uh to implement
 
05:16:38.788 --> 05:16:38.798 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up for the question inquire
 
05:16:40.708 --> 05:16:40.718 align:start position:0%
um i well i guess what i'm getting at is
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
just you know there's there's a rate
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
that the hospital already knows that
 
05:16:45.430 --> 05:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
05:16:45.440 --> 05:16:46.470 align:start position:0%
they have to
um

05:16:46.470 --> 05:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:48.788 --> 05:16:48.798 align:start position:0%
you know charge self-pay patients
 
05:16:48.798 --> 05:16:49.670 align:start position:0%
you know charge self-pay patients
um

05:16:49.670 --> 05:16:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:16:52.830 --> 05:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
obviously leaving out third party
 
05:16:55.590 --> 05:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
um uh third-party providers if they
 
05:16:58.070 --> 05:16:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't have that information there only
 
05:16:59.990 --> 05:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh requiring it if they do have that
 
05:17:01.430 --> 05:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
information there at the time that the
 
05:17:02.788 --> 05:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
patient goes in
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
and asks
 
05:17:04.480 --> 05:17:05.510 align:start position:0%
and asks
um

05:17:05.510 --> 05:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:07.750 --> 05:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
would you see a a problem with rewriting
 
05:17:09.750 --> 05:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
the bill that way
 
05:17:11.030 --> 05:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
well i think the important thing to
 
05:17:12.868 --> 05:17:12.878 align:start position:0%
remember about hospitals particularly
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
when they're dealing with the uninsured
 
05:17:16.550 --> 05:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
so it might be the expectation that they
 
05:17:19.110 --> 05:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
give an uninsured person a sort of a
 
05:17:21.110 --> 05:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
discount from charges that's similar to
 
05:17:22.788 --> 05:17:22.798 align:start position:0%
what they would give
 
05:17:24.948 --> 05:17:24.958 align:start position:0%
a commercially insured patient but i
 
05:17:26.788 --> 05:17:26.798 align:start position:0%
think the reality is that hospitals will
 
05:17:28.470 --> 05:17:28.480 align:start position:0%
often look at a patient's financial
 
05:17:30.708 --> 05:17:30.718 align:start position:0%
situation and they'll go through a set
 
05:17:33.190 --> 05:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
of financial counseling and figure out
 
05:17:35.190 --> 05:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
what how much of the original bill
 
05:17:36.628 --> 05:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
they're going to actually waive so
 
05:17:38.470 --> 05:17:38.480 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a floor that might be
 
05:17:40.550 --> 05:17:40.560 align:start position:0%
expected and that's actually what we use
 
05:17:42.310 --> 05:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
for our health cost website if you go to
 
05:17:44.470 --> 05:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
the uninsured section we've obtained
 
05:17:46.390 --> 05:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
information from the hospitals but it's
 
05:17:48.150 --> 05:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
just an estimate
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
of what what percentage of charges um
 
05:17:52.788 --> 05:17:52.798 align:start position:0%
the patient would be liable for but the
 
05:17:54.628 --> 05:17:54.638 align:start position:0%
reality is they actually might get a
 
05:17:55.990 --> 05:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
much better deal by working with the
 
05:17:58.788 --> 05:17:58.798 align:start position:0%
hospital so i think similarly it could
 
05:18:00.708 --> 05:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
not it could be misleading to the extent
 
05:18:02.708 --> 05:18:02.718 align:start position:0%
it doesn't accurately represent what a
 
05:18:04.150 --> 05:18:04.160 align:start position:0%
patient's experience will be when they
 
05:18:07.030 --> 05:18:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:08.470 --> 05:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
all right fair enough
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
all right representative bartlett
 
05:18:13.430 --> 05:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
05:18:14.868 --> 05:18:14.878 align:start position:0%
mr brennan
 
05:18:19.830 --> 05:18:19.840 align:start position:0%
can you give me an idea of how often
 
05:18:22.150 --> 05:18:22.160 align:start position:0%
they um whoever
 
05:18:24.550 --> 05:18:24.560 align:start position:0%
tracks these pricing
 
05:18:24.560 --> 05:18:26.150 align:start position:0%
tracks these pricing
um

05:18:26.150 --> 05:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:18:28.708 --> 05:18:28.718 align:start position:0%
the prices on the website has to be
 
05:18:31.590 --> 05:18:31.600 align:start position:0%
updated my i mean i have to guess that
 
05:18:33.670 --> 05:18:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's got to be a moving target how could
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
you keep this up to date
 
05:18:39.830 --> 05:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
yeah that's a great question we um
 
05:18:42.310 --> 05:18:42.320 align:start position:0%
we used to do it quarterly so we get new
 
05:18:44.070 --> 05:18:44.080 align:start position:0%
data on a quarterly basis and we used to
 
05:18:46.390 --> 05:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
update the website as often as quarterly
 
05:18:49.990 --> 05:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
we now do it twice a year and there are
 
05:18:51.910 --> 05:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
going to be changes in healthcare
 
05:18:53.270 --> 05:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to be changes in the
 
05:18:54.788 --> 05:18:54.798 align:start position:0%
contracts and they're going to be
 
05:18:56.708 --> 05:18:56.718 align:start position:0%
changes um really in the way the
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
services are delivered so um you know
 
05:19:02.550 --> 05:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
for example even the kind of the the way
 
05:19:04.708 --> 05:19:04.718 align:start position:0%
of delivering colonoscopies is changing
 
05:19:06.868 --> 05:19:06.878 align:start position:0%
a bit and you may not always have a
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
an anesthesiologist or or certain key
 
05:19:11.590 --> 05:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
players involved but the biggest thing
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
we saw was just looking at the prices
 
05:19:16.310 --> 05:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
over time and seeing how they might go
 
05:19:19.110 --> 05:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
up and trying to report on on data that
 
05:19:21.830 --> 05:19:21.840 align:start position:0%
that is a year or year and a half long
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
but the contract changed halfway through
 
05:19:26.550 --> 05:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
that year you want enough data to
 
05:19:28.390 --> 05:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
produce a reliable estimate but at the
 
05:19:30.310 --> 05:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
same time you have to recognize there
 
05:19:31.990 --> 05:19:32.000 align:start position:0%
have been changes during the time frame
 
05:19:33.830 --> 05:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
that you're reporting on so that's one
 
05:19:35.590 --> 05:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
of the reasons we refer to it as an
 
05:19:37.830 --> 05:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
estimate it's based on real experiences
 
05:19:39.430 --> 05:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
but those real experiences will have
 
05:19:42.708 --> 05:19:42.718 align:start position:0%
changed over time so um yeah it is a
 
05:19:43.830 --> 05:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
certainly a challenge when you're
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
looking at uh prices and and how they
 
05:19:47.990 --> 05:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
they will go up and usually they go up
 
05:19:50.310 --> 05:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
occasionally they go down
 
05:19:52.390 --> 05:19:52.400 align:start position:0%
okay my followers look at that
 
05:19:54.390 --> 05:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
thanks very much
 
05:19:57.270 --> 05:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
at lunchtime today i paid bills
 
05:19:57.280 --> 05:19:58.390 align:start position:0%
at lunchtime today i paid bills
and

05:19:58.390 --> 05:19:58.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:20:00.390 --> 05:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
this is a would you believe
 
05:20:02.390 --> 05:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
i from concord hospital my husband had a
 
05:20:05.990 --> 05:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
procedure done in january 2020.
 
05:20:07.910 --> 05:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
um the bill came in
 
05:20:10.470 --> 05:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
on january the 5th
 
05:20:11.910 --> 05:20:11.920 align:start position:0%
this year
 
05:20:15.270 --> 05:20:15.280 align:start position:0%
and the doctor's charges were 17
 
05:20:15.280 --> 05:20:16.628 align:start position:0%
and the doctor's charges were 17
500

05:20:16.628 --> 05:20:16.638 align:start position:0%
500
 
05:20:18.948 --> 05:20:18.958 align:start position:0%
with a 13 000
 
05:20:18.958 --> 05:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
with a 13 000
discount

05:20:20.470 --> 05:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
discount
 
05:20:23.110 --> 05:20:23.120 align:start position:0%
um there were other professional fees of
 
05:20:25.350 --> 05:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
three thousand with the discount of
 
05:20:27.430 --> 05:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
twenty six hundred
 
05:20:27.440 --> 05:20:28.310 align:start position:0%
twenty six hundred
um

05:20:28.310 --> 05:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
how anybody can figure out
 
05:20:34.150 --> 05:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
what the real cost is beyond me i don't
 
05:20:35.750 --> 05:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
know how you do it at the insurance
 
05:20:35.760 --> 05:20:37.350 align:start position:0%
know how you do it at the insurance
department

05:20:37.350 --> 05:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
department
 
05:20:40.868 --> 05:20:40.878 align:start position:0%
yeah so i do believe your example and
 
05:20:43.670 --> 05:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
what we do is we are using actual claims
 
05:20:46.628 --> 05:20:46.638 align:start position:0%
so um in the example you had we would we
 
05:20:48.628 --> 05:20:48.638 align:start position:0%
would see both the charge and we would
 
05:20:51.190 --> 05:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
see the actual amount due so when i say
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
mountain dew it includes what the
 
05:20:54.868 --> 05:20:54.878 align:start position:0%
insurer paid but includes any cost
 
05:20:56.948 --> 05:20:56.958 align:start position:0%
sharing due from the patient as well so
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
we use the charges only to the extent
 
05:21:00.390 --> 05:21:00.400 align:start position:0%
that we're sort of tracking one patient
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
experience to the next let's see if
 
05:21:03.910 --> 05:21:03.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of variation but we're
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
actually looking at the prices paid
 
05:21:07.350 --> 05:21:07.360 align:start position:0%
because they're going to be different
 
05:21:10.150 --> 05:21:10.160 align:start position:0%
between an anthem and a cigna or harvard
 
05:21:12.070 --> 05:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
so that's why we we haven't reported at
 
05:21:14.150 --> 05:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
the actual insurer level but sort of
 
05:21:16.070 --> 05:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
adding to to kind of the point you're
 
05:21:17.750 --> 05:21:17.760 align:start position:0%
trying to make i've heard from
 
05:21:20.550 --> 05:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
healthcare providers occasionally when
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
they were for example a surgery center
 
05:21:24.550 --> 05:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
and they were questioning the price we
 
05:21:27.030 --> 05:21:27.040 align:start position:0%
had on health cost and i said well do
 
05:21:28.948 --> 05:21:28.958 align:start position:0%
you realize what the physicians are paid
 
05:21:30.948 --> 05:21:30.958 align:start position:0%
and what and they said no but i can't
 
05:21:32.628 --> 05:21:32.638 align:start position:0%
believe it's that high and i need to
 
05:21:33.990 --> 05:21:34.000 align:start position:0%
come back and say well well actually it
 
05:21:35.830 --> 05:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
is it's this
 
05:21:37.670 --> 05:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
two of those physicians involved and
 
05:21:39.430 --> 05:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's going to reason for the total so
 
05:21:40.868 --> 05:21:40.878 align:start position:0%
that gives you a sense of how even
 
05:21:42.708 --> 05:21:42.718 align:start position:0%
within an organization they may not
 
05:21:45.110 --> 05:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
understand some of the the variation or
 
05:21:47.030 --> 05:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
some of the charges versus the amount
 
05:21:48.628 --> 05:21:48.638 align:start position:0%
paid that that you've given as an
 
05:21:48.638 --> 05:21:50.230 align:start position:0%
paid that that you've given as an
example

05:21:50.230 --> 05:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
example
 
05:21:52.070 --> 05:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:21:53.830 --> 05:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
so well said that
 
05:21:53.840 --> 05:21:55.430 align:start position:0%
so well said that
yeah

05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:21:58.390 --> 05:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
okay uh seeing no more questions i guess
 
05:22:00.470 --> 05:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
we're all set and uh
 
05:22:02.868 --> 05:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
but i would say it uh tyler i in my
 
05:22:05.750 --> 05:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
memory it took us a couple of years to
 
05:22:07.670 --> 05:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
figure out all the different
 
05:22:10.310 --> 05:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
pieces to get them to report
 
05:22:11.750 --> 05:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
and we had several different legis
 
05:22:13.590 --> 05:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation to finally get all
 
05:22:15.430 --> 05:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
those pieces to get them to report all
 
05:22:17.350 --> 05:22:17.360 align:start position:0%
these different numbers and
 
05:22:19.270 --> 05:22:19.280 align:start position:0%
is that is that my memory correct on
 
05:22:19.280 --> 05:22:20.230 align:start position:0%
is that is that my memory correct on
that

05:22:20.230 --> 05:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:22:20.240 --> 05:22:21.030 align:start position:0%
that
um

05:22:21.030 --> 05:22:21.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:22:21.040 --> 05:22:21.750 align:start position:0%
um
so

05:22:21.750 --> 05:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:23.550 --> 05:22:23.560 align:start position:0%
you may be talking about going back to
 
05:22:26.150 --> 05:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
2003 when the legislation was actually
 
05:22:29.708 --> 05:22:29.718 align:start position:0%
being done so we got the data in
 
05:22:31.590 --> 05:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
2005-ish that was what started he
 
05:22:34.070 --> 05:22:34.080 align:start position:0%
collected i came to the department 2006
 
05:22:36.590 --> 05:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
we got the up on the website in early
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
2007 there were fewer procedures then
 
05:22:41.510 --> 05:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
but i think during the time frame since
 
05:22:43.510 --> 05:22:43.520 align:start position:0%
then we at one time were explored
 
05:22:45.670 --> 05:22:45.680 align:start position:0%
getting down on the uninsured another
 
05:22:47.670 --> 05:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
time we've had to deal with the go bag
 
05:22:49.270 --> 05:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
versus liberty mutual which had to deal
 
05:22:51.350 --> 05:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
with self-funded so there have been some
 
05:22:53.350 --> 05:22:53.360 align:start position:0%
revisiting of the statute but i think to
 
05:22:55.350 --> 05:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
the extent that um we're producing
 
05:22:57.430 --> 05:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
information um it's largely done the
 
05:23:00.550 --> 05:23:00.560 align:start position:0%
same way as it used to but um we uh but
 
05:23:02.470 --> 05:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
we have a lot more services and we
 
05:23:04.150 --> 05:23:04.160 align:start position:0%
actually even have a downloadable
 
05:23:06.310 --> 05:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
template that's designed for healthcare
 
05:23:08.708 --> 05:23:08.718 align:start position:0%
providers and insurers that show data at
 
05:23:10.470 --> 05:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
the cpt code level it's not very
 
05:23:12.470 --> 05:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
consumer friendly but it hopefully will
 
05:23:14.628 --> 05:23:14.638 align:start position:0%
lead to a more efficient market as
 
05:23:16.150 --> 05:23:16.160 align:start position:0%
people better understand the price of
 
05:23:17.750 --> 05:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
health care services
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay cool
 
05:23:21.350 --> 05:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you very much thank
 
05:23:23.990 --> 05:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
you i have no one else who would like to
 
05:23:27.270 --> 05:23:27.280 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill so uh and no more
 
05:23:29.110 --> 05:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
hands up so i will close the public
 
05:23:32.230 --> 05:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 264.
 
05:23:32.240 --> 05:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
hearing on house bill 264.
yeah

05:23:33.830 --> 05:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:23:36.550 --> 05:23:36.560 align:start position:0%
time being 227 how are we doing with the
 
05:23:38.948 --> 05:23:38.958 align:start position:0%
next bill here
 
05:23:38.958 --> 05:23:40.628 align:start position:0%
next bill here
okay

05:23:40.628 --> 05:23:40.638 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:23:42.390 --> 05:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
all right so we're all right so now
 
05:23:42.400 --> 05:23:43.830 align:start position:0%
all right so we're all right so now
we're

05:23:43.830 --> 05:23:43.840 align:start position:0%
we're
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
fine okay
 
05:23:48.150 --> 05:23:48.160 align:start position:0%
so representative greeson's up for your
 
05:23:51.990 --> 05:23:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:52.000 --> 05:23:53.030 align:start position:0%
 
and

05:23:53.030 --> 05:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:23:55.590 --> 05:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
given that we're past time so
 
05:23:56.788 --> 05:23:56.798 align:start position:0%
we can
 
05:23:58.470 --> 05:23:58.480 align:start position:0%
full steam ahead
 
05:24:01.270 --> 05:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll open up the public hearing on
 
05:24:03.910 --> 05:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
house bill 488
 
05:24:05.270 --> 05:24:05.280 align:start position:0%
establishing committee to study the
 
05:24:06.868 --> 05:24:06.878 align:start position:0%
benefits allowing new hampshire citizens
 
05:24:09.110 --> 05:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
to purchase health insurance from out of
 
05:24:09.120 --> 05:24:10.070 align:start position:0%
to purchase health insurance from out of
state

05:24:10.070 --> 05:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
05:24:10.080 --> 05:24:12.230 align:start position:0%
state
companies

05:24:12.230 --> 05:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
companies
 
05:24:12.240 --> 05:24:13.270 align:start position:0%
companies
and

05:24:13.270 --> 05:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann are you ready
 
05:24:16.390 --> 05:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
05:24:18.390 --> 05:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you and thank you uh
 
05:24:20.708 --> 05:24:20.718 align:start position:0%
committee members uh so this was my
 
05:24:23.670 --> 05:24:23.680 align:start position:0%
first stab at a legis proposal for
 
05:24:25.590 --> 05:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislation uh
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
with so many representatives on all
 
05:24:29.990 --> 05:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
sides trying to
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
find ways of reducing health care costs
 
05:24:35.430 --> 05:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
especially the out-of-pocket costs
 
05:24:37.990 --> 05:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
consumers must pay including premiums
 
05:24:40.470 --> 05:24:40.480 align:start position:0%
and co-pays associated with their health
 
05:24:42.628 --> 05:24:42.638 align:start position:0%
insurance policies medications and
 
05:24:44.948 --> 05:24:44.958 align:start position:0%
medical treatments outside of their
 
05:24:44.958 --> 05:24:46.628 align:start position:0%
medical treatments outside of their
insurance

05:24:46.628 --> 05:24:46.638 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
05:24:49.110 --> 05:24:49.120 align:start position:0%
with such a noble goal this is not an
 
05:24:51.430 --> 05:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
easy problem to fix and it's sort of
 
05:24:53.350 --> 05:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
like the mythical creature hydra when
 
05:24:56.230 --> 05:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
you lop off one head two more grow back
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
this bill had the intention of seeking
 
05:24:59.360 --> 05:25:00.868 align:start position:0%
this bill had the intention of seeking
solutions

05:25:00.868 --> 05:25:00.878 align:start position:0%
solutions
 
05:25:02.948 --> 05:25:02.958 align:start position:0%
uh with with the objective of bringing
 
05:25:04.868 --> 05:25:04.878 align:start position:0%
down health care costs but i think it's
 
05:25:07.670 --> 05:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
not exploring in a right direction
 
05:25:10.390 --> 05:25:10.400 align:start position:0%
i know that there are other uh bills
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
proposed that i think may uh may
 
05:25:15.910 --> 05:25:15.920 align:start position:0%
may be going in a better direction uh
 
05:25:18.550 --> 05:25:18.560 align:start position:0%
the the thought was to table this one
 
05:25:20.470 --> 05:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
and refine it
 
05:25:23.030 --> 05:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure that it is going to to
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
potentially find solutions uh to just
 
05:25:27.270 --> 05:25:27.280 align:start position:0%
simply go out and say find something
 
05:25:30.868 --> 05:25:30.878 align:start position:0%
across state lines uh is too broad or
 
05:25:32.708 --> 05:25:32.718 align:start position:0%
may not find anything it would and
 
05:25:34.550 --> 05:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
therefore would be counterproductive so
 
05:25:35.990 --> 05:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
if we if we
 
05:25:37.750 --> 05:25:37.760 align:start position:0%
narrow the scope or give it a little bit
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
better direction i think that would be
 
05:25:42.550 --> 05:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
uh would be beneficial
 
05:25:45.030 --> 05:25:45.040 align:start position:0%
at this point to not kill it necessarily
 
05:25:46.230 --> 05:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
because i think we need to find
 
05:25:50.310 --> 05:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
solutions but give it better direction
 
05:25:52.628 --> 05:25:52.638 align:start position:0%
that's all i have okay
 
05:25:54.948 --> 05:25:54.958 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs has her hand
 
05:25:54.958 --> 05:25:55.830 align:start position:0%
uh representative burroughs has her hand
up

05:25:55.830 --> 05:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:25:57.750 --> 05:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
 
05:25:57.760 --> 05:25:58.948 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for taking my
question

05:25:58.948 --> 05:25:58.958 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:26:01.030 --> 05:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
representative i guess it's a two-prong
 
05:26:02.868 --> 05:26:02.878 align:start position:0%
question um
 
05:26:05.190 --> 05:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh which is if there are three members
 
05:26:07.190 --> 05:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
of the house house of representatives
 
05:26:09.510 --> 05:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker and one member
 
05:26:11.590 --> 05:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
of the senate appointed by the president
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
of the senate um do you think this would
 
05:26:16.310 --> 05:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
be a bipartisan commission uh and do you
 
05:26:18.390 --> 05:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
think that that would be important
 
05:26:20.550 --> 05:26:20.560 align:start position:0%
i think a bipartisan commission would be
 
05:26:22.230 --> 05:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
important uh
 
05:26:24.310 --> 05:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
again there are there are people on all
 
05:26:26.310 --> 05:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
sides seeking solutions
 
05:26:28.470 --> 05:26:28.480 align:start position:0%
um there there's no
 
05:26:31.030 --> 05:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
uh no one party has a solution no one
 
05:26:32.788 --> 05:26:32.798 align:start position:0%
person probably has a solution if they
 
05:26:36.390 --> 05:26:36.400 align:start position:0%
do i'd like to find them um so
 
05:26:39.750 --> 05:26:39.760 align:start position:0%
who comprises uh the study uh
 
05:26:42.310 --> 05:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
is immaterial to me as long as they are
 
05:26:44.628 --> 05:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
honest about their intentions and are
 
05:26:46.390 --> 05:26:46.400 align:start position:0%
truly seeking a solution and not just
 
05:26:50.150 --> 05:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:26:52.390 --> 05:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
thank you okay
 
05:26:56.070 --> 05:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
next up representative bartlett
 
05:26:57.990 --> 05:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
you mr chair
 
05:27:00.310 --> 05:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
representative greece
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
we struggle with this
 
05:27:05.430 --> 05:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
year after year and there are various
 
05:27:06.868 --> 05:27:06.878 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
05:27:09.030 --> 05:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
study committees that we tried to pull
 
05:27:09.040 --> 05:27:10.788 align:start position:0%
study committees that we tried to pull
together

05:27:10.788 --> 05:27:10.798 align:start position:0%
together
 
05:27:10.798 --> 05:27:11.670 align:start position:0%
together
um

05:27:11.670 --> 05:27:11.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
i think last time everything got
 
05:27:15.750 --> 05:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
tabled after or went to the senate and
 
05:27:19.350 --> 05:27:19.360 align:start position:0%
got killed i don't remember which um
 
05:27:21.430 --> 05:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
but if you're really thinking that this
 
05:27:22.948 --> 05:27:22.958 align:start position:0%
is too broad
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
would you consider withdrawing it
 
05:27:27.510 --> 05:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
and trying to come up with a bill that's
 
05:27:29.670 --> 05:27:29.680 align:start position:0%
much more narrow
 
05:27:31.190 --> 05:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
that that
 
05:27:31.200 --> 05:27:33.670 align:start position:0%
that that
might

05:27:33.670 --> 05:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.430 --> 05:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
there there is no i have enough interest
 
05:27:37.590 --> 05:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
there is no withdrawal you can't always
 
05:27:39.430 --> 05:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
know what's wrong you can't withdraw
 
05:27:40.948 --> 05:27:40.958 align:start position:0%
bill you can
 
05:27:42.390 --> 05:27:42.400 align:start position:0%
all you do is come to the committee and
 
05:27:42.400 --> 05:27:43.350 align:start position:0%
all you do is come to the committee and
say

05:27:43.350 --> 05:27:43.360 align:start position:0%
say
 
05:27:45.510 --> 05:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know kill it or pass it you know
 
05:27:48.390 --> 05:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
or i mean i think it's
 
05:27:50.070 --> 05:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
i think you're very well intentioned and
 
05:27:51.430 --> 05:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think there's lots of us here that
 
05:27:54.230 --> 05:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
would like to figure out some solutions
 
05:27:56.230 --> 05:27:56.240 align:start position:0%
but this is so broad
 
05:27:57.750 --> 05:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
with only four people
 
05:27:59.030 --> 05:27:59.040 align:start position:0%
there's no way they're going to be able
 
05:28:01.430 --> 05:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
that's my thought
 
05:28:05.990 --> 05:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
and that's why the committee can vote in
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate or we can make a
 
05:28:10.390 --> 05:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
motion to table so
 
05:28:12.310 --> 05:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
retain we could retain it
 
05:28:14.470 --> 05:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
or we can itl it
 
05:28:14.480 --> 05:28:15.990 align:start position:0%
or we can itl it
but

05:28:15.990 --> 05:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
05:28:17.590 --> 05:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
obviously ought to pass is probably not
 
05:28:19.510 --> 05:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to work
 
05:28:22.628 --> 05:28:22.638 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative abramson
 
05:28:24.150 --> 05:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thank you
 
05:28:26.070 --> 05:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
representative greeson for taking my
 
05:28:27.990 --> 05:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
question i actually had almost the uh
 
05:28:29.510 --> 05:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
the opposite
 
05:28:31.590 --> 05:28:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh impression that it only deals with
 
05:28:32.788 --> 05:28:32.798 align:start position:0%
one way of
 
05:28:35.190 --> 05:28:35.200 align:start position:0%
reducing costs and improving
 
05:28:36.868 --> 05:28:36.878 align:start position:0%
care would you be amenable to a
 
05:28:38.150 --> 05:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
different amendment
 
05:28:38.160 --> 05:28:39.030 align:start position:0%
different amendment
that

05:28:39.030 --> 05:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:28:41.190 --> 05:28:41.200 align:start position:0%
opens up the bill
 
05:28:43.270 --> 05:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
opens up the study committee's
 
05:28:45.750 --> 05:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction i mean to
 
05:28:47.510 --> 05:28:47.520 align:start position:0%
also look into things like allowing
 
05:28:49.670 --> 05:28:49.680 align:start position:0%
portability of health care plans direct
 
05:28:52.070 --> 05:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
primary care physicians
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
a la carte insurance and
 
05:28:55.910 --> 05:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
and and some of these other types of
 
05:28:58.628 --> 05:28:58.638 align:start position:0%
issues so that it's not just
 
05:29:00.548 --> 05:29:00.558 align:start position:0%
narrow to this we do have every year we
 
05:29:02.310 --> 05:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
have this the
 
05:29:04.150 --> 05:29:04.160 align:start position:0%
bill that comes up saying let people buy
 
05:29:05.830 --> 05:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
health insurance across state lines but
 
05:29:07.670 --> 05:29:07.680 align:start position:0%
there are quite a few things that kind
 
05:29:09.430 --> 05:29:09.440 align:start position:0%
of have to get looked at by a study
 
05:29:12.310 --> 05:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
committee before they come come to uh
 
05:29:14.830 --> 05:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
the commerce committee i
 
05:29:17.350 --> 05:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
think if i understand your question
 
05:29:19.030 --> 05:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
correctly my answer would be those are
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
all reasonable potential solutions so
 
05:29:24.470 --> 05:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely we can amend this to explore
 
05:29:25.990 --> 05:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
those possibilities again the end
 
05:29:28.310 --> 05:29:28.320 align:start position:0%
objective is to bring down cost to
 
05:29:31.270 --> 05:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
consumer and so those are clearly ways
 
05:29:33.430 --> 05:29:33.440 align:start position:0%
that can be that can be done so yes we
 
05:29:34.868 --> 05:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
could uh
 
05:29:36.628 --> 05:29:36.638 align:start position:0%
bring some more direction into this
 
05:29:38.948 --> 05:29:38.958 align:start position:0%
particular study to find out whether
 
05:29:40.788 --> 05:29:40.798 align:start position:0%
those are our reasonable solutions or
 
05:29:42.830 --> 05:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
how to make those
 
05:29:45.030 --> 05:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
work all right sure thing i'd answer
 
05:29:46.708 --> 05:29:46.718 align:start position:0%
your question i guess i should does that
 
05:29:48.390 --> 05:29:48.400 align:start position:0%
actually answer your question yes it
 
05:29:48.400 --> 05:29:49.430 align:start position:0%
actually answer your question yes it
does

05:29:49.430 --> 05:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
does
 
05:29:50.390 --> 05:29:50.400 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:29:52.628 --> 05:29:52.638 align:start position:0%
yeah representative patusik
 
05:29:52.638 --> 05:29:53.590 align:start position:0%
yeah representative patusik
uh

05:29:53.590 --> 05:29:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:29:55.030 --> 05:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
05:29:56.948 --> 05:29:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann for taking my
 
05:30:00.470 --> 05:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
question uh would you be amenable to
 
05:30:02.070 --> 05:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
retaining this
 
05:30:04.150 --> 05:30:04.160 align:start position:0%
and bringing it back next year with the
 
05:30:06.628 --> 05:30:06.638 align:start position:0%
required amendments
 
05:30:10.070 --> 05:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
working on it again next year
 
05:30:13.670 --> 05:30:13.680 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh th this is uh this is how
 
05:30:15.030 --> 05:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
are we gonna how are we gonna make it
 
05:30:15.040 --> 05:30:15.910 align:start position:0%
are we gonna how are we gonna make it
work

05:30:15.910 --> 05:30:15.920 align:start position:0%
work
 
05:30:17.670 --> 05:30:17.680 align:start position:0%
so absolutely
 
05:30:20.868 --> 05:30:20.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:22.708 --> 05:30:22.718 align:start position:0%
okay i assume max you just still have
 
05:30:24.948 --> 05:30:24.958 align:start position:0%
your hand up so is there any other
 
05:30:27.990 --> 05:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
questions for representative greeson
 
05:30:30.150 --> 05:30:30.160 align:start position:0%
the representative
 
05:30:32.868 --> 05:30:32.878 align:start position:0%
clear okay yeah let's see if they heard
 
05:30:34.788 --> 05:30:34.798 align:start position:0%
their hands somehow disappeared so
 
05:30:36.390 --> 05:30:36.400 align:start position:0%
representative mcclaire
 
05:30:36.400 --> 05:30:37.350 align:start position:0%
representative mcclaire
um

05:30:37.350 --> 05:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
my question is you're talking about
 
05:30:42.470 --> 05:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
buying insurance across state lines
 
05:30:45.270 --> 05:30:45.280 align:start position:0%
you actually buy a product
 
05:30:47.910 --> 05:30:47.920 align:start position:0%
where the insurance company is is not
 
05:30:50.868 --> 05:30:50.878 align:start position:0%
allowed to do business in the state um
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:58.708 --> 05:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
tyler will speak on this bill
 
05:31:00.310 --> 05:31:00.320 align:start position:0%
he is he's the only one signed up
 
05:31:00.320 --> 05:31:01.110 align:start position:0%
he is he's the only one signed up
actually

05:31:01.110 --> 05:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
actually
 
05:31:01.120 --> 05:31:03.110 align:start position:0%
actually
okay

05:31:03.110 --> 05:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:31:05.830 --> 05:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
i i will defer to his expertise i am not
 
05:31:08.868 --> 05:31:08.878 align:start position:0%
an insurance uh guru so
 
05:31:10.470 --> 05:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
although i do pay my premiums and grit
 
05:31:13.270 --> 05:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
my teeth when i do
 
05:31:15.830 --> 05:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
um well to be the chair's opinion that
 
05:31:18.390 --> 05:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
um that for all of us the longer we stay
 
05:31:20.628 --> 05:31:20.638 align:start position:0%
on this committee the more we'll be able
 
05:31:23.030 --> 05:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
to get our arms around the the problems
 
05:31:24.470 --> 05:31:24.480 align:start position:0%
and all the issues that are involved
 
05:31:25.830 --> 05:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
here and
 
05:31:28.708 --> 05:31:28.718 align:start position:0%
and that and and yes there are no simple
 
05:31:30.548 --> 05:31:30.558 align:start position:0%
solutions if there were we would have
 
05:31:32.788 --> 05:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
already applied them
 
05:31:35.190 --> 05:31:35.200 align:start position:0%
okay uh tyler you're the only person
 
05:31:37.670 --> 05:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
signed up to speak on this bill
 
05:31:39.910 --> 05:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
um okay thanks actually what didn't know
 
05:31:43.510 --> 05:31:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
oh no you're right you did you're right
 
05:31:46.470 --> 05:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry
 
05:31:49.750 --> 05:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
take it back but nobody signed
 
05:31:51.110 --> 05:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
all up so
 
05:31:52.548 --> 05:31:52.558 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe just give a little
 
05:31:52.558 --> 05:31:53.670 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe just give a little
structural

05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
structural
 
05:31:56.070 --> 05:31:56.080 align:start position:0%
conversation about the idea of buying
 
05:31:57.430 --> 05:31:57.440 align:start position:0%
because the way that the title of the
 
05:31:59.670 --> 05:31:59.680 align:start position:0%
bill is buying insurance from an
 
05:32:01.430 --> 05:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
out-of-state company
 
05:32:03.430 --> 05:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
so why don't you give everybody a little
 
05:32:04.868 --> 05:32:04.878 align:start position:0%
feeling for how that's supposed to how
 
05:32:06.948 --> 05:32:06.958 align:start position:0%
could or can't work or whatever
 
05:32:09.990 --> 05:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah so so sticking to the 30 000 foot
 
05:32:12.070 --> 05:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
level we have a lot of companies that
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
are licensed in new hampshire um i think
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
it's in the thousands most of the
 
05:32:18.470 --> 05:32:18.480 align:start position:0%
companies don't offer
 
05:32:20.070 --> 05:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
health insurance products that are
 
05:32:20.080 --> 05:32:21.350 align:start position:0%
health insurance products that are
approved

05:32:21.350 --> 05:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
approved
 
05:32:23.830 --> 05:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
by the department and if they haven't
 
05:32:25.910 --> 05:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
got a product that has been approved by
 
05:32:27.510 --> 05:32:27.520 align:start position:0%
the department they're basically
 
05:32:29.750 --> 05:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
prohibited from marketing the product in
 
05:32:30.948 --> 05:32:30.958 align:start position:0%
the state
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
and it's a little more significant with
 
05:32:35.430 --> 05:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
the federal exchange and we use were
 
05:32:37.590 --> 05:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
federally facilitated exchange states so
 
05:32:39.590 --> 05:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
while we approve products it's the
 
05:32:41.750 --> 05:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
federal government's website so if you
 
05:32:43.750 --> 05:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
put in new hampshire zip code you're not
 
05:32:45.110 --> 05:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
going to see
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
a product that isn't approved in new
 
05:32:49.510 --> 05:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire that being said there actually
 
05:32:52.150 --> 05:32:52.160 align:start position:0%
isn't anything that prevents you
 
05:32:54.150 --> 05:32:54.160 align:start position:0%
from buying a product that is sold in
 
05:32:56.470 --> 05:32:56.480 align:start position:0%
another state in fact if you worked in
 
05:32:58.948 --> 05:32:58.958 align:start position:0%
dc or if you worked for the most part in
 
05:33:00.788 --> 05:33:00.798 align:start position:0%
another state then it might be a good
 
05:33:02.548 --> 05:33:02.558 align:start position:0%
idea to buy an insurance product that
 
05:33:04.948 --> 05:33:04.958 align:start position:0%
has a network there which lends itself
 
05:33:07.270 --> 05:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
to what is usually the biggest issue
 
05:33:09.510 --> 05:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
with a new territory for an insurance
 
05:33:12.150 --> 05:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
company is developing a local network of
 
05:33:14.230 --> 05:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
health care providers and that can be
 
05:33:15.750 --> 05:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
challenging if you don't have a lot of
 
05:33:17.910 --> 05:33:17.920 align:start position:0%
members because if you want to negotiate
 
05:33:19.030 --> 05:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
with concord hospital or
 
05:33:21.270 --> 05:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
dartmouth-hitchcock it's a lot easier to
 
05:33:23.030 --> 05:33:23.040 align:start position:0%
do if you're a big company like anthem
 
05:33:24.868 --> 05:33:24.878 align:start position:0%
and you're 40 of the commercially
 
05:33:26.948 --> 05:33:26.958 align:start position:0%
insured people they treat if you're a
 
05:33:29.030 --> 05:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
company they haven't heard of or even a
 
05:33:31.670 --> 05:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
national company like united or retina
 
05:33:32.948 --> 05:33:32.958 align:start position:0%
but you don't have much of a local
 
05:33:34.788 --> 05:33:34.798 align:start position:0%
presence it's very difficult to
 
05:33:36.230 --> 05:33:36.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate with those health care
 
05:33:38.310 --> 05:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
providers locally so that tends to be
 
05:33:40.470 --> 05:33:40.480 align:start position:0%
one of the larger barriers but but that
 
05:33:42.708 --> 05:33:42.718 align:start position:0%
being said i think to the extent that
 
05:33:44.628 --> 05:33:44.638 align:start position:0%
somebody might want to purchase an
 
05:33:45.990 --> 05:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
insurance product that's in another
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
state i'm even thinking about new
 
05:33:49.270 --> 05:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire residents that actually work
 
05:33:51.110 --> 05:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
in massachusetts they might get their
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
insurance through blue cross and
 
05:33:54.948 --> 05:33:54.958 align:start position:0%
massachusetts and that's another example
 
05:33:56.788 --> 05:33:56.798 align:start position:0%
of how they actually have a an
 
05:33:58.788 --> 05:33:58.798 align:start position:0%
out-of-state product
 
05:34:01.750 --> 05:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
but that would be uh employer-provided
 
05:34:03.510 --> 05:34:03.520 align:start position:0%
insurance right you couldn't get into
 
05:34:06.310 --> 05:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
the non-group product in washington dc
 
05:34:08.110 --> 05:34:08.120 align:start position:0%
you would have to be you'd have to be an
 
05:34:10.628 --> 05:34:10.638 align:start position:0%
employer-sponsored program no as an
 
05:34:12.310 --> 05:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
individual there's there's no new
 
05:34:15.110 --> 05:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire law that prohibits a new
 
05:34:16.788 --> 05:34:16.798 align:start position:0%
resident from buying one of those
 
05:34:18.708 --> 05:34:18.718 align:start position:0%
products in their state obviously there
 
05:34:21.270 --> 05:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
could be another state law that says you
 
05:34:22.788 --> 05:34:22.798 align:start position:0%
can only sell it to somebody in their
 
05:34:24.948 --> 05:34:24.958 align:start position:0%
state but um that would be more
 
05:34:26.948 --> 05:34:26.958 align:start position:0%
restrictive than is typically the case i
 
05:34:26.958 --> 05:34:27.830 align:start position:0%
restrictive than is typically the case i
think

05:34:27.830 --> 05:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:34:29.910 --> 05:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
right so so the key element is there's
 
05:34:32.230 --> 05:34:32.240 align:start position:0%
not a law barring anybody from buying
 
05:34:35.190 --> 05:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
across it it's just that would a company
 
05:34:37.270 --> 05:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
out of state companies sell you
 
05:34:40.310 --> 05:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
a product intentionally to new hampshire
 
05:34:42.390 --> 05:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying is unless they
 
05:34:44.150 --> 05:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
have built up a network or have some
 
05:34:46.390 --> 05:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
agreements with some hospital they're
 
05:34:47.830 --> 05:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
they're not going to offer you the
 
05:34:47.840 --> 05:34:49.350 align:start position:0%
they're not going to offer you the
product

05:34:49.350 --> 05:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
product
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
it might be a concern from a consumer
 
05:34:53.270 --> 05:34:53.280 align:start position:0%
services point of view they wouldn't
 
05:34:54.470 --> 05:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
want you to think that you could get
 
05:34:56.310 --> 05:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
local access to a health care provider
 
05:34:57.990 --> 05:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
so they they might do what they can to
 
05:34:59.590 --> 05:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
discourage you from from buying their
 
05:35:01.750 --> 05:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
product that being said i have heard
 
05:35:04.150 --> 05:35:04.160 align:start position:0%
insurance companies say to to us that uh
 
05:35:05.910 --> 05:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
you know they have they could go so far
 
05:35:07.910 --> 05:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
as putting the skull and crossbones on
 
05:35:09.910 --> 05:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
the product but uh if it's cheap enough
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
some people will buy it anyway and
 
05:35:13.830 --> 05:35:13.840 align:start position:0%
they'll complain later
 
05:35:15.190 --> 05:35:15.200 align:start position:0%
when they find out that they can't get
 
05:35:17.190 --> 05:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
service locally
 
05:35:17.200 --> 05:35:18.948 align:start position:0%
service locally
okay

05:35:18.948 --> 05:35:18.958 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:35:21.670 --> 05:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative abramson's next
 
05:35:23.430 --> 05:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh thank you for
 
05:35:25.830 --> 05:35:25.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question um as i i've said
 
05:35:28.948 --> 05:35:28.958 align:start position:0%
before in some of our other hearings um
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
i live in seabrook which is right on the
 
05:35:32.390 --> 05:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
border with massachusetts and we have
 
05:35:34.948 --> 05:35:34.958 align:start position:0%
about half of our people when they get
 
05:35:36.390 --> 05:35:36.400 align:start position:0%
taken by the ambulance they either want
 
05:35:37.750 --> 05:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
to go to
 
05:35:40.230 --> 05:35:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh portsmouth or exeter the other half
 
05:35:41.670 --> 05:35:41.680 align:start position:0%
want to go to anna jakes which is in
 
05:35:43.990 --> 05:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
massachusetts if anna jakes were to set
 
05:35:45.910 --> 05:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
up an hmo
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
or you have you have a number of health
 
05:35:49.510 --> 05:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
providers in
 
05:35:49.520 --> 05:35:50.548 align:start position:0%
providers in
um

05:35:50.548 --> 05:35:50.558 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:35:53.190 --> 05:35:53.200 align:start position:0%
in north shore massachusetts uh is there
 
05:35:54.548 --> 05:35:54.558 align:start position:0%
something specifically that prevents
 
05:35:57.670 --> 05:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
them from doing that right now
 
05:35:59.670 --> 05:35:59.680 align:start position:0%
um they live in new hampshire
 
05:36:03.030 --> 05:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so there are a number of of
 
05:36:04.948 --> 05:36:04.958 align:start position:0%
what are now federal requirements for
 
05:36:06.628 --> 05:36:06.638 align:start position:0%
what the health insurance product needs
 
05:36:06.638 --> 05:36:07.350 align:start position:0%
what the health insurance product needs
to

05:36:07.350 --> 05:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:36:09.590 --> 05:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
include and the essential health
 
05:36:12.150 --> 05:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
benefits are an example of that but as
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
long as they are offering a a product um
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
they wanted to offer a product they
 
05:36:18.708 --> 05:36:18.718 align:start position:0%
would have to be licensed insurer and a
 
05:36:20.868 --> 05:36:20.878 align:start position:0%
lot of that has to do with solvency and
 
05:36:22.230 --> 05:36:22.240 align:start position:0%
some of your traditional financial
 
05:36:24.548 --> 05:36:24.558 align:start position:0%
measures but um but to have a health
 
05:36:25.910 --> 05:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
insurance product they would just need
 
05:36:27.990 --> 05:36:28.000 align:start position:0%
to demonstrate that they had all the
 
05:36:30.628 --> 05:36:30.638 align:start position:0%
network adequacy components to it so i
 
05:36:30.638 --> 05:36:31.430 align:start position:0%
network adequacy components to it so i
think

05:36:31.430 --> 05:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:36:33.510 --> 05:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
i may be providing more detail than than
 
05:36:35.910 --> 05:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
you're looking for but um they basically
 
05:36:37.350 --> 05:36:37.360 align:start position:0%
have to be a licensed insurer they have
 
05:36:38.628 --> 05:36:38.638 align:start position:0%
to offer a product that meets the
 
05:36:40.788 --> 05:36:40.798 align:start position:0%
standards that are in this state network
 
05:36:42.070 --> 05:36:42.080 align:start position:0%
adequacy probably being one of the
 
05:36:45.910 --> 05:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
biggest hurdles um but uh but but no i
 
05:36:47.590 --> 05:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
mean i i'm not maybe i'm missing the
 
05:36:49.190 --> 05:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
point of your question i apologize if i
 
05:36:49.200 --> 05:36:50.310 align:start position:0%
point of your question i apologize if i
am

05:36:50.310 --> 05:36:50.320 align:start position:0%
am
 
05:36:50.320 --> 05:36:51.510 align:start position:0%
am
follow-up

05:36:51.510 --> 05:36:51.520 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
05:36:51.520 --> 05:36:52.868 align:start position:0%
follow-up
certainly

05:36:52.868 --> 05:36:52.878 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
05:36:52.878 --> 05:36:53.910 align:start position:0%
certainly
so

05:36:53.910 --> 05:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:36:53.920 --> 05:36:54.708 align:start position:0%
so
uh

05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
if they're currently getting their
 
05:36:58.150 --> 05:36:58.160 align:start position:0%
health insurance coverage with a new
 
05:37:00.070 --> 05:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire company but they're almost
 
05:37:02.070 --> 05:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
always going to north shore providers or
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
to anna jakes is there an increased cost
 
05:37:06.470 --> 05:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
associated with that if they have to go
 
05:37:07.830 --> 05:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
out of state in order
 
05:37:09.910 --> 05:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
to to see their doctor
 
05:37:13.670 --> 05:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so there could be so it depends on
 
05:37:16.390 --> 05:37:16.400 align:start position:0%
what network is offered to them and uh
 
05:37:17.750 --> 05:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
if they're buying like an individual
 
05:37:20.390 --> 05:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
product those individual products are
 
05:37:21.430 --> 05:37:21.440 align:start position:0%
the products that tend to have the
 
05:37:24.390 --> 05:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
narrowest networks because um it's it's
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
the carrier seal that's your most price
 
05:37:28.150 --> 05:37:28.160 align:start position:0%
sensitive population whereas in the
 
05:37:29.910 --> 05:37:29.920 align:start position:0%
group market you tend to have a more
 
05:37:33.030 --> 05:37:33.040 align:start position:0%
robust network some of the the carriers
 
05:37:35.110 --> 05:37:35.120 align:start position:0%
are well most of our
 
05:37:37.430 --> 05:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
either regional or national carriers so
 
05:37:39.110 --> 05:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
they do try to
 
05:37:41.910 --> 05:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
work on more than just a state level to
 
05:37:43.910 --> 05:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
give people access to providers in
 
05:37:45.750 --> 05:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
another state under the contractual
 
05:37:47.910 --> 05:37:47.920 align:start position:0%
arrangements that they might have there
 
05:37:50.070 --> 05:37:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's a little different between new
 
05:37:51.510 --> 05:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
hampshire and massachusetts because
 
05:37:52.628 --> 05:37:52.638 align:start position:0%
you've got kind of anthem in new
 
05:37:54.310 --> 05:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
hampshire and you've got blue cross blue
 
05:37:56.948 --> 05:37:56.958 align:start position:0%
shield of massachusetts which is not an
 
05:37:59.990 --> 05:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
anthem company but um there also is also
 
05:38:02.310 --> 05:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
coordination between blue cross plans so
 
05:38:04.390 --> 05:38:04.400 align:start position:0%
they can sometimes access at least some
 
05:38:05.990 --> 05:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
of the contracts and the benefits of
 
05:38:07.670 --> 05:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
going to an out-of-state provider so
 
05:38:09.510 --> 05:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
depending on the actual product in the
 
05:38:11.990 --> 05:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
company there may be flexibility to go
 
05:38:14.470 --> 05:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
to those providers in massachusetts and
 
05:38:16.548 --> 05:38:16.558 align:start position:0%
clearly if it's for specialized services
 
05:38:17.990 --> 05:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
that are only going to be available
 
05:38:20.230 --> 05:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
there that has to be offered in order to
 
05:38:21.990 --> 05:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
meet the network adequacy requirements
 
05:38:23.590 --> 05:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
we would have
 
05:38:26.070 --> 05:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
05:38:27.910 --> 05:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
all right thank you yeah why don't you
 
05:38:30.948 --> 05:38:30.958 align:start position:0%
describe what network adequacy means
 
05:38:33.750 --> 05:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so there is a statute that
 
05:38:33.760 --> 05:38:34.548 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so there is a statute that
says

05:38:34.548 --> 05:38:34.558 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:38:36.470 --> 05:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
for an insurance product to be marketed
 
05:38:38.548 --> 05:38:38.558 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and the decision is
 
05:38:41.670 --> 05:38:41.680 align:start position:0%
county by county then the network has to
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
have include providers that offer
 
05:38:45.830 --> 05:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
services within a certain time and
 
05:38:48.628 --> 05:38:48.638 align:start position:0%
distance so for every county there is an
 
05:38:50.708 --> 05:38:50.718 align:start position:0%
analysis done as to whether or not there
 
05:38:53.590 --> 05:38:53.600 align:start position:0%
are local primary care physical therapy
 
05:38:55.830 --> 05:38:55.840 align:start position:0%
mental health services but on the other
 
05:38:57.590 --> 05:38:57.600 align:start position:0%
end of the spectrum the carrier just
 
05:38:59.670 --> 05:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
needs to ensure that very specialized
 
05:39:01.990 --> 05:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
services are available within some
 
05:39:04.150 --> 05:39:04.160 align:start position:0%
greater distance so for something like
 
05:39:06.788 --> 05:39:06.798 align:start position:0%
knee surgery the proximity might not be
 
05:39:08.868 --> 05:39:08.878 align:start position:0%
as close as something for like primary
 
05:39:10.788 --> 05:39:10.798 align:start position:0%
care but if it's something like a very
 
05:39:12.548 --> 05:39:12.558 align:start position:0%
specialized service the carrier could
 
05:39:14.708 --> 05:39:14.718 align:start position:0%
have the only provider as one that's
 
05:39:16.548 --> 05:39:16.558 align:start position:0%
available someplace in massachusetts or
 
05:39:18.788 --> 05:39:18.798 align:start position:0%
connecticut but again these decisions
 
05:39:21.270 --> 05:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
are made county by counties so
 
05:39:23.030 --> 05:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're pretty lucky
 
05:39:24.628 --> 05:39:24.638 align:start position:0%
because the carriers tend to have very
 
05:39:27.190 --> 05:39:27.200 align:start position:0%
robust networks they include most of the
 
05:39:29.510 --> 05:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
providers most of the hospitals and many
 
05:39:31.190 --> 05:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
other states where they have perhaps
 
05:39:33.110 --> 05:39:33.120 align:start position:0%
half the providers then it would be more
 
05:39:35.590 --> 05:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
of an issue but um but to the extent a
 
05:39:38.150 --> 05:39:38.160 align:start position:0%
carrier um has a network we actually
 
05:39:40.788 --> 05:39:40.798 align:start position:0%
receive those networks we evaluate those
 
05:39:42.548 --> 05:39:42.558 align:start position:0%
networks to see whether or not the the
 
05:39:44.150 --> 05:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
services are available locally the
 
05:39:45.830 --> 05:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
services that are spelled out in our
 
05:39:48.150 --> 05:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
rule and
 
05:39:50.788 --> 05:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
that's how we ensure sort of reasonable
 
05:39:53.990 --> 05:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
access to health care services
 
05:39:54.000 --> 05:39:54.868 align:start position:0%
access to health care services
okay

05:39:54.868 --> 05:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:39:58.230 --> 05:39:58.240 align:start position:0%
oh chris you got up from your nap uh
 
05:40:01.030 --> 05:40:01.040 align:start position:0%
you ready to uh have a question
 
05:40:02.470 --> 05:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
yes i do
 
05:40:02.480 --> 05:40:03.750 align:start position:0%
yes i do
um

05:40:03.750 --> 05:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:07.750 --> 05:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
my question is that uh number one uh i i
 
05:40:10.150 --> 05:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
understand what tyler brennan is
 
05:40:12.310 --> 05:40:12.320 align:start position:0%
explaining about robust networks and
 
05:40:15.110 --> 05:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that is a big problem if you're buying
 
05:40:17.430 --> 05:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
trying to get cheaper insurance out of
 
05:40:19.670 --> 05:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
from an out of state firm so you have
 
05:40:21.190 --> 05:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
you have to understand the risks
 
05:40:21.200 --> 05:40:22.230 align:start position:0%
you have to understand the risks
involved

05:40:22.230 --> 05:40:22.240 align:start position:0%
involved
 
05:40:25.590 --> 05:40:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:26.830 --> 05:40:26.840 align:start position:0%
causing yourself
 
05:40:30.310 --> 05:40:30.320 align:start position:0%
expenses anyway uh the and i also like
 
05:40:31.750 --> 05:40:31.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of
 
05:40:33.910 --> 05:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
a committee that would look at some
 
05:40:36.708 --> 05:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
areas where we might be able to
 
05:40:38.868 --> 05:40:38.878 align:start position:0%
uh improve
 
05:40:42.230 --> 05:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
the uh health care here in the state uh
 
05:40:45.190 --> 05:40:45.200 align:start position:0%
by state legislation and uh i mean i
 
05:40:48.230 --> 05:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
i've read about uh doctors who
 
05:40:50.548 --> 05:40:50.558 align:start position:0%
um are working in the state and they
 
05:40:53.510 --> 05:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
negotiate all the pricing and and so
 
05:40:55.190 --> 05:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
that's something that's
 
05:40:57.910 --> 05:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
interests me and i'm sure it would fall
 
05:40:59.750 --> 05:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
under what uh
 
05:41:02.390 --> 05:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
mr greeson is thinking of in terms of
 
05:41:04.788 --> 05:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
things that can be discussed that said
 
05:41:07.990 --> 05:41:08.000 align:start position:0%
my question to mr greeson is one of the
 
05:41:10.628 --> 05:41:10.638 align:start position:0%
most thoroughly investigated
 
05:41:10.638 --> 05:41:12.788 align:start position:0%
most thoroughly investigated
and

05:41:12.788 --> 05:41:12.798 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:41:12.798 --> 05:41:15.030 align:start position:0%
and
debated

05:41:15.030 --> 05:41:15.040 align:start position:0%
debated
 
05:41:17.990 --> 05:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
things that might reduce and improve
 
05:41:19.190 --> 05:41:19.200 align:start position:0%
health care
 
05:41:19.200 --> 05:41:22.708 align:start position:0%
health care
are

05:41:22.708 --> 05:41:22.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:23.910 --> 05:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
universal universal healthcare for
 
05:41:25.750 --> 05:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
example so i'm thinking if you're going
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
to have a discussion
 
05:41:30.150 --> 05:41:30.160 align:start position:0%
about what might be improved here in the
 
05:41:32.470 --> 05:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire i would hope that
 
05:41:33.910 --> 05:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
05:41:35.750 --> 05:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
one of the items
 
05:41:38.628 --> 05:41:38.638 align:start position:0%
that your your committee would discuss
 
05:41:41.510 --> 05:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
is in fact single-payer healthcare and
 
05:41:44.470 --> 05:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
uh and normally uh
 
05:41:46.628 --> 05:41:46.638 align:start position:0%
the people you know normally that's
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
considered divisive
 
05:41:50.868 --> 05:41:50.878 align:start position:0%
right by one of our parties and and you
 
05:41:52.788 --> 05:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
know so they don't they don't like it so
 
05:41:54.150 --> 05:41:54.160 align:start position:0%
they don't want anybody else to talk
 
05:41:55.030 --> 05:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
about it
 
05:41:57.430 --> 05:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
so i i would think that in in the with
 
05:41:57.440 --> 05:41:58.788 align:start position:0%
so i i would think that in in the with
the

05:41:58.788 --> 05:41:58.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:42:01.670 --> 05:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
idea of fairness and clarity
 
05:42:03.670 --> 05:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
that we would discuss we would also have
 
05:42:04.948 --> 05:42:04.958 align:start position:0%
this committee
 
05:42:04.958 --> 05:42:07.990 align:start position:0%
this committee
uh

05:42:07.990 --> 05:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:09.590 --> 05:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
you know observe the
 
05:42:11.110 --> 05:42:11.120 align:start position:0%
pros and cons
 
05:42:13.350 --> 05:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
of uh a single-payer
 
05:42:14.948 --> 05:42:14.958 align:start position:0%
or whatever you want to call it your
 
05:42:16.628 --> 05:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
question is should he include
 
05:42:19.030 --> 05:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
single-payer i'm yes
 
05:42:21.510 --> 05:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
obviously and and if he he thinks that's
 
05:42:21.520 --> 05:42:22.470 align:start position:0%
obviously and and if he he thinks that's
uh

05:42:22.470 --> 05:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:42:24.708 --> 05:42:24.718 align:start position:0%
i think in order to be fair the answer
 
05:42:30.150 --> 05:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:32.948 --> 05:42:32.958 align:start position:0%
i i i will answer that question be
 
05:42:37.110 --> 05:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:41.030 --> 05:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's i i think of it as like this
 
05:42:43.430 --> 05:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
there are those who believe in creation
 
05:42:44.868 --> 05:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
and there are those who believe in
 
05:42:44.878 --> 05:42:47.350 align:start position:0%
and there are those who believe in
evolution

05:42:47.350 --> 05:42:47.360 align:start position:0%
evolution
 
05:42:49.910 --> 05:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
i have one position you may have another
 
05:42:49.920 --> 05:42:52.868 align:start position:0%
i have one position you may have another
position

05:42:52.868 --> 05:42:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:54.788 --> 05:42:54.798 align:start position:0%
you believe yours is right i believe
 
05:42:57.830 --> 05:42:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:01.430 --> 05:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
if i thought that we studied it all out
 
05:43:04.070 --> 05:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
and the answer was universal health care
 
05:43:06.070 --> 05:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
if that was truly the end-all be-all
 
05:43:09.030 --> 05:43:09.040 align:start position:0%
that that would bring all the the utopia
 
05:43:11.510 --> 05:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
of low prices and everything like that
 
05:43:11.520 --> 05:43:12.628 align:start position:0%
of low prices and everything like that
then

05:43:12.628 --> 05:43:12.638 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:43:14.230 --> 05:43:14.240 align:start position:0%
i guess that would be the solution to
 
05:43:15.430 --> 05:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
05:43:17.510 --> 05:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
however i do not believe that that is
 
05:43:19.430 --> 05:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
the correct answer i believe that the
 
05:43:20.948 --> 05:43:20.958 align:start position:0%
competition in the marketplace and
 
05:43:23.110 --> 05:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
freedom of choices and things like that
 
05:43:25.670 --> 05:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh and and and get get government
 
05:43:28.470 --> 05:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
regulations and crony capitalism out of
 
05:43:31.270 --> 05:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
the picture and bring it down to to more
 
05:43:33.350 --> 05:43:33.360 align:start position:0%
of an individual level where people can
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
buy what they need to buy when they need
 
05:43:37.830 --> 05:43:37.840 align:start position:0%
to buy it uh and then maybe have a
 
05:43:40.230 --> 05:43:40.240 align:start position:0%
catastrophic insurance policy that would
 
05:43:41.910 --> 05:43:41.920 align:start position:0%
cover the oops that we didn't weren't
 
05:43:44.788 --> 05:43:44.798 align:start position:0%
expecting that one uh you know there are
 
05:43:46.708 --> 05:43:46.718 align:start position:0%
there are there are numerous solutions
 
05:43:48.708 --> 05:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
to that to the to this
 
05:43:49.910 --> 05:43:49.920 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:43:49.920 --> 05:43:50.788 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

05:43:50.788 --> 05:43:50.798 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:43:52.628 --> 05:43:52.638 align:start position:0%
we could explore
 
05:43:54.868 --> 05:43:54.878 align:start position:0%
any number of options
 
05:43:57.190 --> 05:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
but if we're going to be honest
 
05:43:59.110 --> 05:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
whichever one is going to win out is the
 
05:44:00.788 --> 05:44:00.798 align:start position:0%
one that wins out so we can't just go in
 
05:44:02.390 --> 05:44:02.400 align:start position:0%
with preconceived notions and say well
 
05:44:05.030 --> 05:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
by god this is the answer now let's make
 
05:44:08.230 --> 05:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
the answer the solution and so i'll
 
05:44:10.868 --> 05:44:10.878 align:start position:0%
corrupt all the data to show this is the
 
05:44:12.628 --> 05:44:12.638 align:start position:0%
answer when that may not be the answer
 
05:44:13.910 --> 05:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
and i don't care which side of this
 
05:44:15.110 --> 05:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
political spectrum you're on if you're
 
05:44:16.948 --> 05:44:16.958 align:start position:0%
going to fudge the data i won't support
 
05:44:20.548 --> 05:44:20.558 align:start position:0%
you and so uh if i mean it is a solution
 
05:44:23.270 --> 05:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
you put it out there uh let's explore it
 
05:44:25.430 --> 05:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
but if that's not the solution then
 
05:44:27.590 --> 05:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's not the solution and if if
 
05:44:29.190 --> 05:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
something else that somebody else comes
 
05:44:31.110 --> 05:44:31.120 align:start position:0%
up with is not the solution that's not
 
05:44:33.270 --> 05:44:33.280 align:start position:0%
the solution we're here to find the
 
05:44:33.280 --> 05:44:34.548 align:start position:0%
the solution we're here to find the
solution

05:44:34.548 --> 05:44:34.558 align:start position:0%
solution
 
05:44:34.558 --> 05:44:35.350 align:start position:0%
solution
uh

05:44:35.350 --> 05:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:44:35.360 --> 05:44:36.788 align:start position:0%
uh
just

05:44:36.788 --> 05:44:36.798 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:44:38.548 --> 05:44:38.558 align:start position:0%
one observation
 
05:44:42.310 --> 05:44:42.320 align:start position:0%
i'm 71 years old so i have medicare
 
05:44:44.150 --> 05:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you
 
05:44:46.788 --> 05:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:49.510 --> 05:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
take my word for it
 
05:44:51.590 --> 05:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
and you spent your entire adult life
 
05:44:56.070 --> 05:44:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.470 --> 05:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
oh i got the benefit that's all i can do
 
05:45:00.868 --> 05:45:00.878 align:start position:0%
it works well if i just say aren't you
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
what do you live to be 65 so you get the
 
05:45:03.360 --> 05:45:04.628 align:start position:0%
what do you live to be 65 so you get the
benefit

05:45:04.628 --> 05:45:04.638 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
05:45:06.628 --> 05:45:06.638 align:start position:0%
oh well i would extend it to everybody
 
05:45:06.638 --> 05:45:09.270 align:start position:0%
oh well i would extend it to everybody
yeah

05:45:09.270 --> 05:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:45:12.310 --> 05:45:12.320 align:start position:0%
okay well uh this is actually the feels
 
05:45:15.430 --> 05:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
like the very first year and almost a
 
05:45:17.510 --> 05:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
good half a dozen years that we don't
 
05:45:19.990 --> 05:45:20.000 align:start position:0%
have any single-payer legislation this
 
05:45:21.430 --> 05:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
year this is we
 
05:45:23.110 --> 05:45:23.120 align:start position:0%
i know representative kenner usually
 
05:45:25.350 --> 05:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
puts something in but it's not coming
 
05:45:30.548 --> 05:45:30.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:33.350 --> 05:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
but all right with that uh we'll end the
 
05:45:38.548 --> 05:45:38.558 align:start position:0%
public hearing on uh on house bill 4
 
05:45:38.558 --> 05:45:40.030 align:start position:0%

grafton county district 16. this is a
 
05:46:08.070 --> 05:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
floaterial district that covers eight

towns from wentworth east to thornton
 
05:46:13.910 --> 05:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
and south to canaan i'm introducing
 
05:46:17.030 --> 05:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 592 as a means of providing
 
05:46:19.030 --> 05:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
all new hampshire residents with
 
05:46:21.270 --> 05:46:21.280 align:start position:0%
protection against injury caused by
 
05:46:21.280 --> 05:46:22.868 align:start position:0%
protection against injury caused by
vaccinations

05:46:22.868 --> 05:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
vaccinations
 
05:46:24.948 --> 05:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
nothing about this bill should be
 
05:46:27.510 --> 05:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
considered anti-vaccine
 
05:46:29.590 --> 05:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
i have been vaccinated my two children
 
05:46:31.510 --> 05:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
were vaccinated my five grandchildren
 
05:46:34.070 --> 05:46:34.080 align:start position:0%
have been vaccinated i respect those who
 
05:46:36.868 --> 05:46:36.878 align:start position:0%
choose not to be vaccinated equally as i
 
05:46:38.470 --> 05:46:38.480 align:start position:0%
respect those who choose to be
 
05:46:41.270 --> 05:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinated this bill provides everyone
 
05:46:44.708 --> 05:46:44.718 align:start position:0%
who chooses to receive any vaccine with
 
05:46:47.190 --> 05:46:47.200 align:start position:0%
a means of being compensated at least in
 
05:46:49.990 --> 05:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
part if they should be harmed by a
 
05:46:52.628 --> 05:46:52.638 align:start position:0%
vaccine because it does happen
 
05:46:54.548 --> 05:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
advancements in medicine have resulted
 
05:46:56.948 --> 05:46:56.958 align:start position:0%
in vaccines being developed that have
 
05:46:59.350 --> 05:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
helped minimize the effects and the
 
05:47:01.350 --> 05:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
spread of some of the deadliest viruses
 
05:47:03.750 --> 05:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
ever to plague this planet so there is
 
05:47:06.548 --> 05:47:06.558 align:start position:0%
value to vaccines but as with every
 
05:47:08.868 --> 05:47:08.878 align:start position:0%
medicine or vaccine there are potential
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
risks no vaccine or medicine is 100
 
05:47:13.990 --> 05:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
percent effective and some people will
 
05:47:16.548 --> 05:47:16.558 align:start position:0%
experience significant side effects even
 
05:47:16.558 --> 05:47:17.510 align:start position:0%
experience significant side effects even

05:47:19.110 --> 05:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
the national institutes for health state
 
05:47:21.270 --> 05:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
that more than 1.5 million people are
 
05:47:24.150 --> 05:47:24.160 align:start position:0%
hospitalized every year because quote

in a civil action for damages arising
 
05:47:45.910 --> 05:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
from a vaccine-related injury or death
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
associated with the administration of a
 
05:47:51.510 --> 05:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine after october 1 1988. if the
 
05:47:53.270 --> 05:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
injury or death resulted from side
 
05:47:55.190 --> 05:47:55.200 align:start position:0%
effects that were unavoidable even
 
05:47:57.350 --> 05:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
though the vaccine was properly prepared
 
05:47:59.270 --> 05:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
and was accompanied by proper directions
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
and warnings
 
05:48:02.708 --> 05:48:02.718 align:start position:0%
the national vaccine injury compensation
 
05:48:04.708 --> 05:48:04.718 align:start position:0%
program was subsequently developed to
 
05:48:07.350 --> 05:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
handle vaccine injury claims because
 
05:48:10.390 --> 05:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine injuries do happen according to
 
05:48:12.708 --> 05:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
the federal health resources and
 
05:48:15.350 --> 05:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
services administration uh in those
 
05:48:17.590 --> 05:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
instances when people experience more
 
05:48:19.990 --> 05:48:20.000 align:start position:0%
serious side effects from vaccines such
 
05:48:22.150 --> 05:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
as allergic reactions the national

vaccine injury compensation program
 
05:48:27.590 --> 05:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
allows individuals to file a petition
 
05:48:30.948 --> 05:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
for compensation the process is
 
05:48:33.910 --> 05:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
a typical government process about five
 
05:48:35.990 --> 05:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
steps where first of all the individual
 
05:48:38.310 --> 05:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
files a petition with the u.s court of
 
05:48:40.628 --> 05:48:40.638 align:start position:0%
federal claims then the u.s department
 
05:48:42.310 --> 05:48:42.320 align:start position:0%
of health and human services medical
 
05:48:44.708 --> 05:48:44.718 align:start position:0%
staff reviews that petition determines
 
05:48:46.788 --> 05:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
if it meets the medical criteria for
 
05:48:49.030 --> 05:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
compensation and makes a preliminary
 
05:48:49.040 --> 05:48:50.470 align:start position:0%
compensation and makes a preliminary
recommendation

05:48:50.470 --> 05:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
05:48:52.230 --> 05:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
then the u.s department of justice
 
05:48:53.830 --> 05:48:53.840 align:start position:0%
develops a report that includes the
 
05:48:56.070 --> 05:48:56.080 align:start position:0%
medical recommendation and legal
 
05:48:58.948 --> 05:48:58.958 align:start position:0%
analysis and submits it to the court
 
05:49:00.788 --> 05:49:00.798 align:start position:0%
after that the report is presented to a
 
05:49:02.868 --> 05:49:02.878 align:start position:0%
court appointed special master that's
 
05:49:04.948 --> 05:49:04.958 align:start position:0%
the title that they're given who decides
 
05:49:06.390 --> 05:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
whether the petitioner should be
 
05:49:08.868 --> 05:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
compensated and often after holding a
 
05:49:10.470 --> 05:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
hearing in which both parties can
 
05:49:13.270 --> 05:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
present evidence then if compensation is
 
05:49:15.830 --> 05:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
awarded that special master determines
 
05:49:18.310 --> 05:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
the amount and the type of compensation
 
05:49:19.990 --> 05:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
the court then orders the united states
 
05:49:21.510 --> 05:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:49:23.990 --> 05:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
to award the compensation uh and even if
 
05:49:26.150 --> 05:49:26.160 align:start position:0%
the petition is dismissed in certain
 
05:49:27.910 --> 05:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
circumstances the court may order that
 
05:49:29.670 --> 05:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
the department pay for attorney's fees
 
05:49:30.948 --> 05:49:30.958 align:start position:0%
and costs
 
05:49:30.958 --> 05:49:32.628 align:start position:0%
and costs
uh

05:49:32.628 --> 05:49:32.638 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:49:35.110 --> 05:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
in and and looking at how many uh
 
05:49:36.948 --> 05:49:36.958 align:start position:0%
petitions have actually been awarded
 
05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
compensation between 2006 when they
 
05:49:42.230 --> 05:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
began including influenza
 
05:49:45.830 --> 05:49:45.840 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccines uh and and 2018 which
 
05:49:47.910 --> 05:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
is the latest data i could find on the
 
05:49:50.150 --> 05:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
05:49:50.160 --> 05:49:51.190 align:start position:0%
on the uh
the

05:49:51.190 --> 05:49:51.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:49:53.830 --> 05:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
website of the health resources services
 
05:49:53.840 --> 05:49:55.350 align:start position:0%
website of the health resources services
administration

05:49:55.350 --> 05:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
administration
 
05:49:59.310 --> 05:49:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh between 2006 and 2018 there were 5
 
05:50:04.310 --> 05:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
351 compensable claims out of 23 619
 
05:50:07.190 --> 05:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
claims filed and a total of 2.2 billion
 
05:50:09.270 --> 05:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
dollars was awarded to petitioners
 
05:50:11.670 --> 05:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
during that time attorney's fees were
 
05:50:14.310 --> 05:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
additional to that 2.2 billion
 
05:50:18.708 --> 05:50:18.718 align:start position:0%
so far excuse me in 2020 734 claims were
 
05:50:22.628 --> 05:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
paid totaling 187 million dollars and so
 
05:50:26.230 --> 05:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
far in 2021 73 million dollars have been
 
05:50:30.150 --> 05:50:30.160 align:start position:0%
paid to 196 petitioners
 
05:50:32.230 --> 05:50:32.240 align:start position:0%
is there risk that uh vaccine
 
05:50:34.150 --> 05:50:34.160 align:start position:0%
manufacturers would discontinue selling
 
05:50:36.390 --> 05:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
their products if they if this bill were
 
05:50:37.750 --> 05:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
to be signed into law and they would
 
05:50:40.070 --> 05:50:40.080 align:start position:0%
have to put up the bond etc i guess
 
05:50:42.310 --> 05:50:42.320 align:start position:0%
anything is possible but history does
 
05:50:44.390 --> 05:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
not show that to be likely
 
05:50:46.868 --> 05:50:46.878 align:start position:0%
as of december 2020 lawsuits were
 
05:50:48.628 --> 05:50:48.638 align:start position:0%
underway across the country against the
 
05:50:51.590 --> 05:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
makers of zantac evandia several acid
 
05:50:54.150 --> 05:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
reflux medications in fact i was able to
 
05:50:57.110 --> 05:50:57.120 align:start position:0%
find 58 products that have lawsuits
 
05:50:58.390 --> 05:50:58.400 align:start position:0%
currently underway
 
05:51:00.150 --> 05:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
for which settlements have recent or
 
05:51:02.310 --> 05:51:02.320 align:start position:0%
either lawsuits are currently underway
 
05:51:04.788 --> 05:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
or settlements have recently been made
 
05:51:07.190 --> 05:51:07.200 align:start position:0%
yet despite these lawsuits most of these
 
05:51:09.030 --> 05:51:09.040 align:start position:0%
products are still readily available in
 
05:51:11.990 --> 05:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
the states in which those suits occurred
 
05:51:13.750 --> 05:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
just a few years ago the state of new
 
05:51:15.670 --> 05:51:15.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire sued several manufacturers of
 
05:51:17.910 --> 05:51:17.920 align:start position:0%
various opioid medications including
 
05:51:20.628 --> 05:51:20.638 align:start position:0%
teva pharmaceuticals johnson and johnson
 
05:51:22.948 --> 05:51:22.958 align:start position:0%
purdue pharma and several others and yet
 
05:51:24.470 --> 05:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
many of those companies still do
 
05:51:26.150 --> 05:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire and you can
 
05:51:28.628 --> 05:51:28.638 align:start position:0%
still get those opioid medications now
 
05:51:30.548 --> 05:51:30.558 align:start position:0%
it is should be noted that purdue pharma
 
05:51:32.788 --> 05:51:32.798 align:start position:0%
is no longer in business as they decided
 
05:51:34.868 --> 05:51:34.878 align:start position:0%
to close after filing bankruptcy
 
05:51:36.628 --> 05:51:36.638 align:start position:0%
subsequent to pleading guilty to three
 
05:51:38.708 --> 05:51:38.718 align:start position:0%
federal criminal charges but that's not
 
05:51:41.190 --> 05:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
the same as product liability
 
05:51:43.510 --> 05:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
in 2019 the state of new hampshire sued
 
05:51:45.670 --> 05:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
teva pharmaceuticals and others in an
 
05:51:48.150 --> 05:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
anti-trust lawsuit interestingly tava
 
05:51:50.548 --> 05:51:50.558 align:start position:0%
pharmaceuticals usa incorporated with a
 
05:51:52.310 --> 05:51:52.320 align:start position:0%
principal address in parsippany new
 
05:51:54.548 --> 05:51:54.558 align:start position:0%
jersey is also registered as a new
 
05:51:56.548 --> 05:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
hampshire foreign profit corporation
 
05:51:59.990 --> 05:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
filed on march 18 2020 that's after
 
05:52:01.830 --> 05:52:01.840 align:start position:0%
being sued and their address is in
 
05:52:03.590 --> 05:52:03.600 align:start position:0%
bedford new hampshire their filing
 
05:52:05.590 --> 05:52:05.600 align:start position:0%
status is listed as good standing and
 
05:52:08.310 --> 05:52:08.320 align:start position:0%
its file number is 83819
 
05:52:10.150 --> 05:52:10.160 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire has also sued
 
05:52:12.470 --> 05:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers of other products and
 
05:52:14.310 --> 05:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
yet they continue to do business in the
 
05:52:16.868 --> 05:52:16.878 align:start position:0%
state in 2012 the state of new hampshire
 
05:52:19.030 --> 05:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
received a portion of 4 billion dollar
 
05:52:20.830 --> 05:52:20.840 align:start position:0%
settlement with several cigarette
 
05:52:22.788 --> 05:52:22.798 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can you still buy
 
05:52:24.628 --> 05:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
cigarettes in the state of new hampshire
 
05:52:27.670 --> 05:52:27.680 align:start position:0%
yes you can in fact we are celebrating
 
05:52:30.070 --> 05:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
the the increase in revenue
 
05:52:31.750 --> 05:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
to the state because massachusetts
 
05:52:34.070 --> 05:52:34.080 align:start position:0%
banned menthol flavored cigarettes
 
05:52:36.470 --> 05:52:36.480 align:start position:0%
so here you have a company that was sued
 
05:52:38.548 --> 05:52:38.558 align:start position:0%
uh and yet they do business in the state
 
05:52:39.990 --> 05:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
and the state is happy about them
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
selling their products
 
05:52:43.990 --> 05:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
so what this legislation does is hold
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
these companies accountable for the
 
05:52:47.750 --> 05:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines that they sell just like every
 
05:52:49.750 --> 05:52:49.760 align:start position:0%
other product they sell and every other
 
05:52:52.150 --> 05:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
product made by every other company just
 
05:52:53.990 --> 05:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
without the lawsuits the lengthy time
 
05:52:55.910 --> 05:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
delays and without tarnishing their
 
05:52:58.390 --> 05:52:58.400 align:start position:0%
reputations this does not interfere with
 
05:53:00.948 --> 05:53:00.958 align:start position:0%
anyone's options in filing a claim with
 
05:53:04.708 --> 05:53:04.718 align:start position:0%
the the federal vicp program it provides
 
05:53:06.708 --> 05:53:06.718 align:start position:0%
a means of making those who have been
 
05:53:09.190 --> 05:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
harmed as whole as possible as quickly
 
05:53:11.670 --> 05:53:11.680 align:start position:0%
as possible since most people will not
 
05:53:14.070 --> 05:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
experience any harm from vaccines the
 
05:53:16.390 --> 05:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
number of claims should be low but those
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
few people who are harmed can receive
 
05:53:21.190 --> 05:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
some compensation no money can replace
 
05:53:23.190 --> 05:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
the life of a loved one some people are
 
05:53:25.030 --> 05:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
not going to be made completely whole
 
05:53:26.868 --> 05:53:26.878 align:start position:0%
but at the very least they are not being
 
05:53:29.030 --> 05:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
carelessly told suck it up
 
05:53:30.548 --> 05:53:30.558 align:start position:0%
claims will be initiated by the
 
05:53:32.708 --> 05:53:32.718 align:start position:0%
patient's doctor who will determine that
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
the vaccine was the cause of harm and
 
05:53:37.030 --> 05:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
this harm must have been determined to
 
05:53:38.390 --> 05:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
occur within two weeks of the
 
05:53:40.708 --> 05:53:40.718 align:start position:0%
vaccination the pharmaceutical companies
 
05:53:43.270 --> 05:53:43.280 align:start position:0%
state that most side effects especially
 
05:53:45.990 --> 05:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me the severe effects would occur
 
05:53:48.628 --> 05:53:48.638 align:start position:0%
within that two weeks vaccination uh so
 
05:53:50.390 --> 05:53:50.400 align:start position:0%
that's the window that's where i where
 
05:53:52.470 --> 05:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
that two weeks comes from
 
05:53:54.470 --> 05:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
one last thought it should be noted that
 
05:53:57.190 --> 05:53:57.200 align:start position:0%
hb 20 currently being uh in the
 
05:53:59.190 --> 05:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
legislature which is the education
 
05:54:01.750 --> 05:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
freedom account bill requires a surety
 
05:54:04.070 --> 05:54:04.080 align:start position:0%
bond for education service providers
 
05:54:05.750 --> 05:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
receiving more than one hundred thousand
 
05:54:08.548 --> 05:54:08.558 align:start position:0%
dollars in efa funds so the drafters of
 
05:54:10.868 --> 05:54:10.878 align:start position:0%
that legislation are not concerned that
 
05:54:13.110 --> 05:54:13.120 align:start position:0%
potential education service providers
 
05:54:15.030 --> 05:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
will simply refuse to do business in the
 
05:54:16.628 --> 05:54:16.638 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire because they
 
05:54:18.948 --> 05:54:18.958 align:start position:0%
would have to put up a bond that's all i
 
05:54:22.788 --> 05:54:22.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:54:22.798 --> 05:54:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:54:23.590 --> 05:54:23.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:54:25.350 --> 05:54:25.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
05:54:28.948 --> 05:54:28.958 align:start position:0%
van outen has a question thank you mr
 
05:54:31.270 --> 05:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
chair and and thank you representative
 
05:54:33.910 --> 05:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
um there was just a whole lot there uh
 
05:54:36.070 --> 05:54:36.080 align:start position:0%
so let me just cut to the quick
 
05:54:39.030 --> 05:54:39.040 align:start position:0%
um toward the end you just alluded uh to
 
05:54:41.670 --> 05:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
this toward the end in roman four
 
05:54:43.990 --> 05:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
you indicate that this will be done by
 
05:54:45.990 --> 05:54:46.000 align:start position:0%
the diagnosis of illness and
 
05:54:47.670 --> 05:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
determination that the illness is
 
05:54:50.150 --> 05:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
directly linked to the vaccine by a
 
05:54:52.310 --> 05:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
physician do you think you're asking too
 
05:54:54.070 --> 05:54:54.080 align:start position:0%
much of a physician to be able to come
 
05:54:57.190 --> 05:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
to that determination
 
05:54:58.788 --> 05:54:58.798 align:start position:0%
isn't that what a doctor is supposed to
 
05:54:58.798 --> 05:55:00.310 align:start position:0%
isn't that what a doctor is supposed to
do

05:55:00.310 --> 05:55:00.320 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:55:01.990 --> 05:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
follow please
 
05:55:04.948 --> 05:55:04.958 align:start position:0%
oh yes for the question you inquire
 
05:55:07.270 --> 05:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh my question is i don't know a doctor
 
05:55:08.868 --> 05:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
is supposed to diagnose illness and
 
05:55:10.310 --> 05:55:10.320 align:start position:0%
things of that sort i agree with you
 
05:55:12.070 --> 05:55:12.080 align:start position:0%
there's not a problem there but to
 
05:55:15.910 --> 05:55:15.920 align:start position:0%
diagnose that uh an illness is directly
 
05:55:17.830 --> 05:55:17.840 align:start position:0%
linked to the vaccine
 
05:55:20.470 --> 05:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
may in my opinion is is likely to go
 
05:55:22.470 --> 05:55:22.480 align:start position:0%
beyond the purview of doctor do you not
 
05:55:23.670 --> 05:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
agree with that
 
05:55:25.190 --> 05:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
i do not agree with that because they
 
05:55:27.430 --> 05:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
determined that lung cancer can be
 
05:55:29.110 --> 05:55:29.120 align:start position:0%
caused by smoking and that's where all
 
05:55:31.350 --> 05:55:31.360 align:start position:0%
those lawsuits came from
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
and an individual physician i know i'm
 
05:55:34.948 --> 05:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
sorry follow-up please
 
05:55:36.390 --> 05:55:36.400 align:start position:0%
hear the question
 
05:55:38.628 --> 05:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
uh an individual like my individual
 
05:55:40.868 --> 05:55:40.878 align:start position:0%
physician would be able to diagnose that
 
05:55:43.430 --> 05:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
and say that if i were a smoker my lung
 
05:55:45.830 --> 05:55:45.840 align:start position:0%
disease was directly related i and
 
05:55:47.110 --> 05:55:47.120 align:start position:0%
actually i think i'll withdraw the
 
05:55:48.948 --> 05:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
question i think perhaps where we're
 
05:55:50.948 --> 05:55:50.958 align:start position:0%
going in divergent directions i
 
05:55:53.830 --> 05:55:53.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your input thank you
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
representative herbert
 
05:56:00.948 --> 05:56:00.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:04.310 --> 05:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can okay
 
05:56:04.320 --> 05:56:07.990 align:start position:0%
can you hear me yes we can okay
um

05:56:07.990 --> 05:56:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:09.910 --> 05:56:09.920 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks thanks for letting me uh
 
05:56:12.708 --> 05:56:12.718 align:start position:0%
ask the question and uh thank you uh
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
representative griezmann i like the idea
 
05:56:18.628 --> 05:56:18.638 align:start position:0%
of uh posting a bond
 
05:56:22.470 --> 05:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
and uh and the fact is uh
 
05:56:24.628 --> 05:56:24.638 align:start position:0%
and you had a lot of statistics but
 
05:56:27.350 --> 05:56:27.360 align:start position:0%
those were a lot of that stuff was uh
 
05:56:29.670 --> 05:56:29.680 align:start position:0%
was not vaccine related it was other
 
05:56:31.590 --> 05:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
other problems that arose
 
05:56:33.190 --> 05:56:33.200 align:start position:0%
for instance for cigarettes and that
 
05:56:35.590 --> 05:56:35.600 align:start position:0%
kind of thing but uh
 
05:56:37.110 --> 05:56:37.120 align:start position:0%
and i don't know
 
05:56:38.708 --> 05:56:38.718 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
05:56:41.110 --> 05:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
i like the idea but
 
05:56:41.120 --> 05:56:41.990 align:start position:0%
i like the idea but
did

05:56:41.990 --> 05:56:42.000 align:start position:0%
did
 
05:56:45.990 --> 05:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
i my understanding is uh
 
05:56:48.948 --> 05:56:48.958 align:start position:0%
bad things from uh taking a vaccine are
 
05:56:50.390 --> 05:56:50.400 align:start position:0%
fairly rare
 
05:56:52.788 --> 05:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
did you see any statistics
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
you i couldn't keep up with you on your
 
05:56:57.910 --> 05:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
statistics so i was just wondering is
 
05:56:59.750 --> 05:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
was there some statistics you had there
 
05:57:03.670 --> 05:57:03.680 align:start position:0%
that that said if you took a vaccine
 
05:57:07.510 --> 05:57:07.520 align:start position:0%
x number of people died or or sued or
 
05:57:09.910 --> 05:57:09.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing i i what i what i do
 
05:57:11.430 --> 05:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
have and what i shared and i'll share
 
05:57:15.510 --> 05:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
again is uh with with just the claims
 
05:57:18.230 --> 05:57:18.240 align:start position:0%
filed now this is just claims filed
 
05:57:22.150 --> 05:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
uh 23 619 claims have have been filed
 
05:57:25.350 --> 05:57:25.360 align:start position:0%
through the uh the federal visit program
 
05:57:25.360 --> 05:57:26.390 align:start position:0%
through the uh the federal visit program
uh

05:57:26.390 --> 05:57:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:57:29.590 --> 05:57:29.600 align:start position:0%
and 5 351 were found to be compensable
 
05:57:29.600 --> 05:57:30.708 align:start position:0%
and 5 351 were found to be compensable
claims

05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
claims
 
05:57:30.718 --> 05:57:31.670 align:start position:0%
claims
um

05:57:31.670 --> 05:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:57:34.150 --> 05:57:34.160 align:start position:0%
so that's that is just based just on
 
05:57:36.708 --> 05:57:36.718 align:start position:0%
their numbers they have acknowledged uh
 
05:57:40.150 --> 05:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
23 619 these are all just vaccine injury
 
05:57:40.160 --> 05:57:41.110 align:start position:0%
23 619 these are all just vaccine injury
claims

05:57:41.110 --> 05:57:41.120 align:start position:0%
claims
 
05:57:43.670 --> 05:57:43.680 align:start position:0%
uh there are there there may have uh
 
05:57:45.350 --> 05:57:45.360 align:start position:0%
there may be others people who just
 
05:57:47.750 --> 05:57:47.760 align:start position:0%
chose not to because of the cumbersome
 
05:57:50.868 --> 05:57:50.878 align:start position:0%
process uh but they uh
 
05:57:52.548 --> 05:57:52.558 align:start position:0%
yes overall
 
05:57:55.830 --> 05:57:55.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the number of vaccine injuries is
 
05:57:58.548 --> 05:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
relatively small uh but that's not the
 
05:58:01.830 --> 05:58:01.840 align:start position:0%
point the fact is that they do occur
 
05:58:02.948 --> 05:58:02.958 align:start position:0%
and so
 
05:58:07.670 --> 05:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
this is uh their this is a way of
 
05:58:10.230 --> 05:58:10.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with when they do occur uh
 
05:58:12.948 --> 05:58:12.958 align:start position:0%
everyone alive today uh that's before me
 
05:58:15.110 --> 05:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
has probably had a vaccine i'm assuming
 
05:58:17.110 --> 05:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
and maybe not uh has received some sort
 
05:58:19.430 --> 05:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
of vaccine you're still alive today you
 
05:58:21.910 --> 05:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
did not have an injury or i assume you
 
05:58:24.150 --> 05:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have an injury so we're living
 
05:58:25.990 --> 05:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
testimonies that you can receive
 
05:58:28.070 --> 05:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
vaccines and not be injured
 
05:58:30.548 --> 05:58:30.558 align:start position:0%
but there are those who clearly do uh
 
05:58:33.190 --> 05:58:33.200 align:start position:0%
suffer injuries and and even just just
 
05:58:35.590 --> 05:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
so far this year we are on the
 
05:58:37.750 --> 05:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
34th day of the year
 
05:58:40.708 --> 05:58:40.718 align:start position:0%
and uh and so far over 73 million
 
05:58:43.510 --> 05:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
dollars have been paid out to almost 200
 
05:58:46.310 --> 05:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
petitioners and so they're happening
 
05:58:48.548 --> 05:58:48.558 align:start position:0%
these injuries are occurring
 
05:58:48.558 --> 05:58:49.510 align:start position:0%
these injuries are occurring
and

05:58:49.510 --> 05:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:51.750 --> 05:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
so this is this is uh taking care of
 
05:58:54.390 --> 05:58:54.400 align:start position:0%
those people just one more question
 
05:58:56.310 --> 05:58:56.320 align:start position:0%
you might um
 
05:58:58.948 --> 05:58:58.958 align:start position:0%
the uh thanks for the stat uh and i
 
05:59:00.708 --> 05:59:00.718 align:start position:0%
don't disagree with you by the way in
 
05:59:03.910 --> 05:59:03.920 align:start position:0%
terms of posting a bond but of the
 
05:59:06.310 --> 05:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
statistics you have quoted
 
05:59:08.548 --> 05:59:08.558 align:start position:0%
and and we're undergoing a
 
05:59:08.558 --> 05:59:10.548 align:start position:0%
and and we're undergoing a
massive

05:59:10.548 --> 05:59:10.558 align:start position:0%
massive
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
massive vaccination program uh but how
 
05:59:15.270 --> 05:59:15.280 align:start position:0%
many of those stats right now have come
 
05:59:17.110 --> 05:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
out of covid19
 
05:59:17.120 --> 05:59:18.628 align:start position:0%
out of covid19
vaccines

05:59:18.628 --> 05:59:18.638 align:start position:0%
vaccines
 
05:59:20.868 --> 05:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
uh none of the statistics that i have
 
05:59:24.070 --> 05:59:24.080 align:start position:0%
shared the thus far are coveted vaccine
 
05:59:27.750 --> 05:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
uh injuries uh co the cobit vaccine is
 
05:59:31.110 --> 05:59:31.120 align:start position:0%
an unusual animal in fact it is not
 
05:59:33.510 --> 05:59:33.520 align:start position:0%
actually considered it is not an actual
 
05:59:37.110 --> 05:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
fda approved vaccine it is actually an
 
05:59:39.350 --> 05:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
experimental medical therapy that has
 
05:59:41.830 --> 05:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
been authorized and being administered
 
05:59:44.868 --> 05:59:44.878 align:start position:0%
under emergency use authorization
 
05:59:47.270 --> 05:59:47.280 align:start position:0%
and so and to try to get compensation
 
05:59:49.270 --> 05:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
for any injuries from that is a much
 
05:59:52.310 --> 05:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
more difficult process
 
05:59:52.320 --> 05:59:53.510 align:start position:0%
more difficult process
so

05:59:53.510 --> 05:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:59:55.270 --> 05:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
the covet vaccine is completely
 
05:59:58.708 --> 05:59:58.718 align:start position:0%
different uh there there
 
06:00:00.230 --> 06:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
but just
 
06:00:02.070 --> 06:00:02.080 align:start position:0%
from the numbers that i have shared with
 
06:00:06.470 --> 06:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
you that would be things like the the
 
06:00:06.480 --> 06:00:08.788 align:start position:0%
you that would be things like the the
influenza

06:00:08.788 --> 06:00:08.798 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
06:00:08.798 --> 06:00:09.910 align:start position:0%
influenza
to

06:00:09.910 --> 06:00:09.920 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:00:13.030 --> 06:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
dtp to whatever else
 
06:00:15.190 --> 06:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
the normal vaccinations not including
 
06:00:15.200 --> 06:00:16.628 align:start position:0%
the normal vaccinations not including
kobe

06:00:16.628 --> 06:00:16.638 align:start position:0%
kobe
 
06:00:16.638 --> 06:00:17.750 align:start position:0%
kobe
finally

06:00:17.750 --> 06:00:17.760 align:start position:0%
finally
 
06:00:17.760 --> 06:00:18.470 align:start position:0%
finally
no

06:00:18.470 --> 06:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
no
 
06:00:21.110 --> 06:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
is there a way is there a way we can uh
 
06:00:24.070 --> 06:00:24.080 align:start position:0%
ask whether or not the bond would
 
06:00:26.868 --> 06:00:26.878 align:start position:0%
create problems with sales
 
06:00:28.470 --> 06:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
is there a way of finding out the answer
 
06:00:30.868 --> 06:00:30.878 align:start position:0%
to that question
 
06:00:33.350 --> 06:00:33.360 align:start position:0%
well i you know
 
06:00:35.590 --> 06:00:35.600 align:start position:0%
are they gonna
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to find out that that's
 
06:00:39.350 --> 06:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
why i brought up the fact that uh
 
06:00:39.360 --> 06:00:40.310 align:start position:0%
why i brought up the fact that uh
uh

06:00:40.310 --> 06:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:00:42.868 --> 06:00:42.878 align:start position:0%
you know this the state of new hampshire
 
06:00:44.830 --> 06:00:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh has sued
 
06:00:47.270 --> 06:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturers uh well pharmaceutical
 
06:00:48.470 --> 06:00:48.480 align:start position:0%
companies first of all it's because it's
 
06:00:49.670 --> 06:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
you know pharmaceutical companies
 
06:00:51.590 --> 06:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturing the vaccines and
 
06:00:53.430 --> 06:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies manufacture
 
06:00:56.708 --> 06:00:56.718 align:start position:0%
other medications and so we can sue
 
06:00:58.868 --> 06:00:58.878 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical companies because of
 
06:01:00.788 --> 06:01:00.798 align:start position:0%
their medical their their medications
 
06:01:02.548 --> 06:01:02.558 align:start position:0%
and the liabilities and injuries
 
06:01:04.230 --> 06:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
associated with that
 
06:01:06.628 --> 06:01:06.638 align:start position:0%
but for some reason we can't sue
 
06:01:08.788 --> 06:01:08.798 align:start position:0%
the same pharmaceutical companies for
 
06:01:10.230 --> 06:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
their vaccines
 
06:01:11.430 --> 06:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:01:12.948 --> 06:01:12.958 align:start position:0%
they still do business in the state
 
06:01:14.548 --> 06:01:14.558 align:start position:0%
despite being sued
 
06:01:18.070 --> 06:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
and so uh so it's i think it's it's it's
 
06:01:20.230 --> 06:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
just not legitimate to think that we
 
06:01:22.070 --> 06:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
can't hold them accountable well they'll
 
06:01:24.230 --> 06:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
just pack up and go home uh they won't
 
06:01:25.590 --> 06:01:25.600 align:start position:0%
do business with us because we're gonna
 
06:01:29.510 --> 06:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
hold them accountable so the the bond is
 
06:01:33.590 --> 06:01:33.600 align:start position:0%
is in lieu of any kind of legis or um
 
06:01:33.600 --> 06:01:35.030 align:start position:0%
is in lieu of any kind of legis or um
litigation

06:01:35.030 --> 06:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
litigation
 
06:01:35.040 --> 06:01:35.910 align:start position:0%
litigation
uh

06:01:35.910 --> 06:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:01:39.110 --> 06:01:39.120 align:start position:0%
and and again the idea of bringing up hb
 
06:01:42.470 --> 06:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
20 is is because that bill is calling
 
06:01:44.230 --> 06:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
for a bond as well
 
06:01:45.430 --> 06:01:45.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:01:48.390 --> 06:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know putting up a bond and and
 
06:01:50.150 --> 06:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
holding people accountable the
 
06:01:52.150 --> 06:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
liabilities and such like that is not an
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
unreasonable request or in this case a
 
06:01:57.430 --> 06:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable demand and so
 
06:01:59.270 --> 06:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
yes there's a risk that they would just
 
06:02:00.708 --> 06:02:00.718 align:start position:0%
not do business in the state but i just
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
don't see that happening because there's
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
other other issues
 
06:02:05.750 --> 06:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
they can be held accountable for
 
06:02:07.750 --> 06:02:07.760 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
06:02:11.510 --> 06:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson has a
 
06:02:11.520 --> 06:02:13.190 align:start position:0%
okay representative abramson has a
question

06:02:13.190 --> 06:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:02:15.190 --> 06:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
all right thank you mr chair and
 
06:02:16.708 --> 06:02:16.718 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question on this
 
06:02:19.270 --> 06:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
one i absolutely agree 100 with the
 
06:02:20.470 --> 06:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
intent of
 
06:02:21.830 --> 06:02:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
06:02:21.840 --> 06:02:23.510 align:start position:0%
of the bill
um

06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:25.590 --> 06:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
my concern is not with it with the
 
06:02:27.750 --> 06:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
structure of the bill or what its intent
 
06:02:30.070 --> 06:02:30.080 align:start position:0%
is but i'm wondering what happens when a
 
06:02:32.150 --> 06:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
company decides to stop
 
06:02:35.110 --> 06:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
either stop selling that vaccine or that
 
06:02:37.510 --> 06:02:37.520 align:start position:0%
vaccine gets uh superseded by another
 
06:02:39.350 --> 06:02:39.360 align:start position:0%
product in the marketplace
 
06:02:39.360 --> 06:02:40.788 align:start position:0%
product in the marketplace
um

06:02:40.788 --> 06:02:40.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:42.708 --> 06:02:42.718 align:start position:0%
is there a provision for kind of getting
 
06:02:44.470 --> 06:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
the bond back or getting the letter back
 
06:02:45.750 --> 06:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
from the insurance
 
06:02:47.910 --> 06:02:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner is that just uh is that
 
06:02:47.920 --> 06:02:50.788 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner is that just uh is that
implied

06:02:50.788 --> 06:02:50.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:52.868 --> 06:02:52.878 align:start position:0%
are you saying that if if
 
06:02:54.868 --> 06:02:54.878 align:start position:0%
they're selling the selling a vaccine
 
06:02:54.878 --> 06:02:56.310 align:start position:0%
they're selling the selling a vaccine
for

06:02:56.310 --> 06:02:56.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:02:56.320 --> 06:02:57.270 align:start position:0%
for
um

06:02:57.270 --> 06:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:02:59.750 --> 06:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
malaria or or some other
 
06:03:01.270 --> 06:03:01.280 align:start position:0%
provision and someone some other
 
06:03:02.948 --> 06:03:02.958 align:start position:0%
competing company comes by with a better
 
06:03:04.708 --> 06:03:04.718 align:start position:0%
vaccine product
 
06:03:06.548 --> 06:03:06.558 align:start position:0%
and this company stopped selling the
 
06:03:08.548 --> 06:03:08.558 align:start position:0%
product the old vaccine on the on the
 
06:03:08.558 --> 06:03:10.150 align:start position:0%
product the old vaccine on the on the
marketplace

06:03:10.150 --> 06:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
06:03:10.160 --> 06:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
marketplace
would

06:03:11.030 --> 06:03:11.040 align:start position:0%
would
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
what would happen with that that company
 
06:03:16.070 --> 06:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
are they are they getting the bond back
 
06:03:16.080 --> 06:03:17.190 align:start position:0%
are they are they getting the bond back
uh

06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:03:19.110 --> 06:03:19.120 align:start position:0%
this bill does not actually address that
 
06:03:20.708 --> 06:03:20.718 align:start position:0%
because that's not be honestly that was
 
06:03:22.948 --> 06:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
not something that i had considered uh
 
06:03:24.708 --> 06:03:24.718 align:start position:0%
that they would
 
06:03:27.030 --> 06:03:27.040 align:start position:0%
they would just stop
 
06:03:28.548 --> 06:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
i apologize for that i actually did not
 
06:03:30.548 --> 06:03:30.558 align:start position:0%
even think about that being the case but
 
06:03:32.470 --> 06:03:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh they should get their their bond the
 
06:03:34.150 --> 06:03:34.160 align:start position:0%
balance would ever be it would ever be
 
06:03:36.868 --> 06:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
remaining uh because the claims would be
 
06:03:39.670 --> 06:03:39.680 align:start position:0%
paid out of that uh and then they would
 
06:03:42.548 --> 06:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
have to refresh that uh to maintain that
 
06:03:44.868 --> 06:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
balance but at the end uh if there was
 
06:03:44.878 --> 06:03:46.150 align:start position:0%
balance but at the end uh if there was
anything

06:03:46.150 --> 06:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
anything
 
06:03:48.628 --> 06:03:48.638 align:start position:0%
then they should get that back yes
 
06:03:50.150 --> 06:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
but that's just that's not in the bill
 
06:03:51.270 --> 06:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
though no
 
06:03:54.230 --> 06:03:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay i have a follow-up further question
 
06:03:56.470 --> 06:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
inquiry uh this one's a would you
 
06:03:57.990 --> 06:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
believe it's my first would you believe
 
06:04:01.110 --> 06:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
of the day that i did do some
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh research on the federal vaccine
 
06:04:05.750 --> 06:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
injury fund and that it's only paying
 
06:04:05.760 --> 06:04:06.628 align:start position:0%
injury fund and that it's only paying
out

06:04:06.628 --> 06:04:06.638 align:start position:0%
out
 
06:04:09.350 --> 06:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh at six percent rate only six percent
 
06:04:11.910 --> 06:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
of the claims and they have a maximum of
 
06:04:13.510 --> 06:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
two hundred fifty thousand dollars per
 
06:04:16.628 --> 06:04:16.638 align:start position:0%
payout most people don't get the 250 000
 
06:04:18.070 --> 06:04:18.080 align:start position:0%
even if they have a relative who've died
 
06:04:20.628 --> 06:04:20.638 align:start position:0%
from vaccine injury
 
06:04:22.470 --> 06:04:22.480 align:start position:0%
i do believe that because i looked up at
 
06:04:25.910 --> 06:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the same information and you are correct
 
06:04:27.590 --> 06:04:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right thank you very much okay learn
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
something new every day all right
 
06:04:32.548 --> 06:04:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:35.270 --> 06:04:35.280 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and thank you uh
 
06:04:38.230 --> 06:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
representative greeson for uh for
 
06:04:39.910 --> 06:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
testimony and for answering our
 
06:04:39.920 --> 06:04:40.948 align:start position:0%
testimony and for answering our
questions

06:04:40.948 --> 06:04:40.958 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:04:43.670 --> 06:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
um i've got a question
 
06:04:43.680 --> 06:04:44.948 align:start position:0%
um i've got a question
about

06:04:44.948 --> 06:04:44.958 align:start position:0%
about
 
06:04:44.958 --> 06:04:46.070 align:start position:0%
about
whether

06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether
 
06:04:48.948 --> 06:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
the state legislature
 
06:04:48.958 --> 06:04:49.990 align:start position:0%
the state legislature
or

06:04:49.990 --> 06:04:50.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:04:51.910 --> 06:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
is the right
 
06:04:53.590 --> 06:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
is the right
 
06:04:56.948 --> 06:04:56.958 align:start position:0%
place for this
 
06:04:59.990 --> 06:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
kind of legislation or whether it needs
 
06:05:03.190 --> 06:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
to be federal because i believe
 
06:05:06.708 --> 06:05:06.718 align:start position:0%
most of most of uh the examples you gave
 
06:05:06.718 --> 06:05:07.670 align:start position:0%
most of most of uh the examples you gave
us

06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
us
 
06:05:09.830 --> 06:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
dealt with the federal uh federal
 
06:05:15.430 --> 06:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:18.230 --> 06:05:18.240 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or or uh
 
06:05:21.670 --> 06:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
paying a paying for debt for damages
 
06:05:23.430 --> 06:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
at the very beginning
 
06:05:27.350 --> 06:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
of your uh of your uh testimony i know
 
06:05:29.750 --> 06:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
you said something about the state and
 
06:05:32.628 --> 06:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
state law but i kind of missed that and
 
06:05:35.030 --> 06:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
so in addition to telling me why this
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:40.868 --> 06:05:40.878 align:start position:0%
in state legislation could you say again
 
06:05:43.670 --> 06:05:43.680 align:start position:0%
what you said about state uh
 
06:05:46.070 --> 06:05:46.080 align:start position:0%
state laws that apply to this i i'm
 
06:05:49.030 --> 06:05:49.040 align:start position:0%
sorry i just didn't get all of that
 
06:05:49.040 --> 06:05:50.070 align:start position:0%
sorry i just didn't get all of that
well

06:05:50.070 --> 06:05:50.080 align:start position:0%
well
 
06:05:53.510 --> 06:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
presently no state law addresses this
 
06:05:56.390 --> 06:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
that's why this is being introduced
 
06:05:59.670 --> 06:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
federal law 42 u.s code subsection 300
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
double a attack 22
 
06:06:03.830 --> 06:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
says that no manufacturer no vaccine
 
06:06:07.110 --> 06:06:07.120 align:start position:0%
manufacturer shall be liable in a civil
 
06:06:09.190 --> 06:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
action for damages arising from a
 
06:06:11.590 --> 06:06:11.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine-related injury or death
 
06:06:13.590 --> 06:06:13.600 align:start position:0%
associated with the administration of a
 
06:06:17.830 --> 06:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
vaccine after october 1st 1988
 
06:06:19.190 --> 06:06:19.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:06:22.070 --> 06:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
the the fact that they cannot be held
 
06:06:23.990 --> 06:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
liable in a civil action
 
06:06:26.470 --> 06:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
if you go in and look at the national
 
06:06:29.590 --> 06:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
vaccine injury compensation program
 
06:06:32.390 --> 06:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
it does actually allow
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
that if the special master's decision
 
06:06:36.310 --> 06:06:36.320 align:start position:0%
may be appealed and petitioners who
 
06:06:38.708 --> 06:06:38.718 align:start position:0%
reject the decision of the court or
 
06:06:40.628 --> 06:06:40.638 align:start position:0%
withdraw their petitions within certain
 
06:06:40.638 --> 06:06:41.910 align:start position:0%
withdraw their petitions within certain
timeliness

06:06:41.910 --> 06:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
timeliness
 
06:06:44.070 --> 06:06:44.080 align:start position:0%
they may file a claim in civil court
 
06:06:46.390 --> 06:06:46.400 align:start position:0%
against the vaccine company and or
 
06:06:48.310 --> 06:06:48.320 align:start position:0%
health care provider who administered
 
06:06:49.670 --> 06:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
the vaccine
 
06:06:52.628 --> 06:06:52.638 align:start position:0%
so the federal law actually does allow
 
06:06:52.638 --> 06:06:53.430 align:start position:0%
so the federal law actually does allow
for

06:06:53.430 --> 06:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:06:56.708 --> 06:06:56.718 align:start position:0%
at some point in time a vaccine company
 
06:07:01.190 --> 06:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
to be a civil action against them and or
 
06:07:02.708 --> 06:07:02.718 align:start position:0%
the health care provider who
 
06:07:05.030 --> 06:07:05.040 align:start position:0%
administered the vaccine to be held
 
06:07:05.040 --> 06:07:06.548 align:start position:0%
administered the vaccine to be held
accountable

06:07:06.548 --> 06:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
accountable
 
06:07:10.390 --> 06:07:10.400 align:start position:0%
so that's where the federal law allows
 
06:07:13.910 --> 06:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
but that process is hugely cumbersome
 
06:07:15.270 --> 06:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
could this be
 
06:07:18.548 --> 06:07:18.558 align:start position:0%
taken at the at the at the federal level
 
06:07:20.548 --> 06:07:20.558 align:start position:0%
i suppose if you vote for me for u.s
 
06:07:23.590 --> 06:07:23.600 align:start position:0%
senate in 2022 uh i could present it at
 
06:07:26.070 --> 06:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
that level uh but as it stands right now
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just little old me at uh
 
06:07:30.390 --> 06:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
representative greeson from grafton 16
 
06:07:31.830 --> 06:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
and putting it before the state of new
 
06:07:34.390 --> 06:07:34.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire house of representatives
 
06:07:37.510 --> 06:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh follow up please another question yep
 
06:07:41.750 --> 06:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:44.948 --> 06:07:44.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:46.470 --> 06:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
that mouse is really
 
06:07:48.868 --> 06:07:48.878 align:start position:0%
i know this mouse this mouse is alive
 
06:07:50.070 --> 06:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
how's track
 
06:07:54.230 --> 06:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:57.270 --> 06:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that
 
06:07:58.830 --> 06:07:58.840 align:start position:0%
when the state
 
06:08:01.750 --> 06:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
law and federal law
 
06:08:04.070 --> 06:08:04.080 align:start position:0%
uh may differ
 
06:08:05.590 --> 06:08:05.600 align:start position:0%
or contradict
 
06:08:07.350 --> 06:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
uh one another
 
06:08:11.270 --> 06:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
that state that federal law has
 
06:08:13.430 --> 06:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
takes the fir you know takes the higher
 
06:08:13.440 --> 06:08:15.270 align:start position:0%
takes the fir you know takes the higher
uh

06:08:15.270 --> 06:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:16.708 --> 06:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
higher position
 
06:08:16.718 --> 06:08:19.350 align:start position:0%
higher position
um

06:08:19.350 --> 06:08:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:08:19.360 --> 06:08:20.548 align:start position:0%
 
and

06:08:20.548 --> 06:08:20.558 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:08:22.548 --> 06:08:22.558 align:start position:0%
so i i'm just
 
06:08:24.470 --> 06:08:24.480 align:start position:0%
again i'm just questioning
 
06:08:29.190 --> 06:08:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh whether uh a state law to this effect
 
06:08:30.708 --> 06:08:30.718 align:start position:0%
would would
 
06:08:30.718 --> 06:08:31.590 align:start position:0%
would would
uh

06:08:31.590 --> 06:08:31.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:08:33.510 --> 06:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
would have any
 
06:08:36.628 --> 06:08:36.638 align:start position:0%
any value um
 
06:08:38.948 --> 06:08:38.958 align:start position:0%
would you would you try to persuade me
 
06:08:40.948 --> 06:08:40.958 align:start position:0%
that it does
 
06:08:43.110 --> 06:08:43.120 align:start position:0%
well this is not a lawsuit
 
06:08:45.190 --> 06:08:45.200 align:start position:0%
this is not civil action
 
06:08:47.270 --> 06:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
there's no court involved this is
 
06:08:49.030 --> 06:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
legislation saying
 
06:08:51.590 --> 06:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
that we we are going to establish this
 
06:08:54.548 --> 06:08:54.558 align:start position:0%
uh uh the ability to compensate those
 
06:08:57.190 --> 06:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
who have been injured and
 
06:08:59.910 --> 06:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
the the source of funding for that
 
06:09:02.470 --> 06:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
compensation because it's specifically
 
06:09:05.270 --> 06:09:05.280 align:start position:0%
two people injured by vaccines
 
06:09:07.430 --> 06:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
the source of funding would come put up
 
06:09:10.948 --> 06:09:10.958 align:start position:0%
by the vaccine manufacturers
 
06:09:12.868 --> 06:09:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
06:09:15.030 --> 06:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's this is not civil suit this is
 
06:09:17.270 --> 06:09:17.280 align:start position:0%
not litigation in any way this is just
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
this is we're establishing a fund and
 
06:09:21.830 --> 06:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
you're gonna pony up
 
06:09:21.840 --> 06:09:23.110 align:start position:0%
you're gonna pony up
okay

06:09:23.110 --> 06:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:09:27.030 --> 06:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
uh see representative uh
 
06:09:28.948 --> 06:09:28.958 align:start position:0%
fargo is next
 
06:09:30.948 --> 06:09:30.958 align:start position:0%
um yes thank you mr chair
 
06:09:33.350 --> 06:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
um i guess i'm struggling with this a
 
06:09:35.830 --> 06:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
little bit japan and i understand where
 
06:09:37.510 --> 06:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
you're coming from but i know as an
 
06:09:40.310 --> 06:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
individual when i get a vaccine i go to
 
06:09:41.670 --> 06:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
my physician
 
06:09:41.680 --> 06:09:43.110 align:start position:0%
my physician
i

06:09:43.110 --> 06:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
i
 
06:09:45.430 --> 06:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
he tells me what my risks are i signed a
 
06:09:47.990 --> 06:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
paper that said i accept those risks and
 
06:09:50.788 --> 06:09:50.798 align:start position:0%
i choose to have that vaccine
 
06:09:54.070 --> 06:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
so on an individual level um i'm
 
06:09:56.628 --> 06:09:56.638 align:start position:0%
accepting that risk i can understand i
 
06:09:58.868 --> 06:09:58.878 align:start position:0%
guess if if
 
06:10:01.510 --> 06:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
a large group of people had an adverse
 
06:10:03.270 --> 06:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
reaction to a vaccine that there would
 
06:10:06.230 --> 06:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
be a full you know one suit of a lot of
 
06:10:08.390 --> 06:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
people but i don't understand on an
 
06:10:10.150 --> 06:10:10.160 align:start position:0%
individual basis
 
06:10:12.868 --> 06:10:12.878 align:start position:0%
um if i'm if i'm signing that i accept
 
06:10:17.350 --> 06:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
the risk why uh why this is necessary
 
06:10:19.590 --> 06:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
well any uh anytime you sign a risk
 
06:10:22.070 --> 06:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
waiver does not necessarily mean that
 
06:10:24.310 --> 06:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
the person uh
 
06:10:25.350 --> 06:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
that that
 
06:10:28.150 --> 06:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's still not some means of
 
06:10:32.390 --> 06:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:34.548 --> 06:10:34.558 align:start position:0%
as bizarre as it sounds do you have
 
06:10:36.390 --> 06:10:36.400 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance
 
06:10:36.400 --> 06:10:37.590 align:start position:0%
homeowners insurance
sure

06:10:37.590 --> 06:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
sure
 
06:10:39.030 --> 06:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
well did you know that somebody can
 
06:10:40.788 --> 06:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
break into your home in the in the
 
06:10:43.270 --> 06:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
process of committing a crime
 
06:10:45.830 --> 06:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
injure themselves in your home while
 
06:10:47.430 --> 06:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
committing a crime
 
06:10:50.628 --> 06:10:50.638 align:start position:0%
and then sue your homeowner's insurance
 
06:10:52.470 --> 06:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
policy you could you could file a claim
 
06:10:55.830 --> 06:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:57.510 --> 06:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
they would be compensated it's happened
 
06:10:58.628 --> 06:10:58.638 align:start position:0%
before you're shaking your head miss
 
06:11:00.868 --> 06:11:00.878 align:start position:0%
barley i'm new hampshire
 
06:11:04.230 --> 06:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
and yes and so um signing signing
 
06:11:06.788 --> 06:11:06.798 align:start position:0%
waivers does not necessarily mean uh
 
06:11:10.310 --> 06:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
that there's no avenue uh to be taken uh
 
06:11:11.430 --> 06:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
and so
 
06:11:11.440 --> 06:11:13.190 align:start position:0%
and so
uh

06:11:13.190 --> 06:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:11:15.110 --> 06:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
i understand you're accepting the risks
 
06:11:16.548 --> 06:11:16.558 align:start position:0%
we all accept those risks but there's
 
06:11:19.830 --> 06:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
still something that can be done
 
06:11:21.590 --> 06:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you okay you're all set and
 
06:11:23.030 --> 06:11:23.040 align:start position:0%

06:11:34.470 --> 06:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
i i hope are you aware of like or
 
06:11:37.030 --> 06:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
similar efforts being introduced in any
 
06:11:40.708 --> 06:11:40.718 align:start position:0%
other of the state legislatures
 
06:11:42.708 --> 06:11:42.718 align:start position:0%
yes it's the solo effort
 
06:11:44.868 --> 06:11:44.878 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anything in any other
 
06:11:44.878 --> 06:11:46.788 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anything in any other
state

06:11:46.788 --> 06:11:46.798 align:start position:0%
state

are you i if you are then then we could
 
06:11:50.868 --> 06:11:50.878 align:start position:0%
certainly uh that was that was not a
 
06:11:54.628 --> 06:11:54.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:57.110 --> 06:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
no i'm not aware of anything
 
06:11:57.120 --> 06:11:59.190 align:start position:0%

06:12:14.070 --> 06:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
clarify this issue for us
 
06:12:18.310 --> 06:12:18.320 align:start position:0%

so my name is nick doherty i'm the
 
06:13:12.628 --> 06:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
director of policy pharma for the new
 
06:13:14.548 --> 06:13:14.558 align:start position:0%
england region and i am based out of
 
06:13:14.558 --> 06:13:16.470 align:start position:0%
england region and i am based out of
boston

06:13:16.470 --> 06:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
boston
 
06:13:18.470 --> 06:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
pharma is the pharmaceutical research
 
06:13:21.030 --> 06:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
and manufacturers of america and we
 
06:13:22.390 --> 06:13:22.400 align:start position:0%
represent the country's leading
 
06:13:24.548 --> 06:13:24.558 align:start position:0%
innovative biopharmaceutical research
 
06:13:26.628 --> 06:13:26.638 align:start position:0%
companies which are devoted
 
06:13:28.390 --> 06:13:28.400 align:start position:0%
to discovering and developing medicines
 
06:13:30.708 --> 06:13:30.718 align:start position:0%
that enable patients to live longer
 
06:13:32.788 --> 06:13:32.798 align:start position:0%
healthier and more productive lives and
 
06:13:35.110 --> 06:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
since 2000 farm remember companies have
 
06:13:37.750 --> 06:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
invested nearly one trillion dollars
 
06:13:40.230 --> 06:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
in search for new treatment and cures
 
06:13:42.310 --> 06:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
including an estimated 83 billion in
 
06:13:44.470 --> 06:13:44.480 align:start position:0%
2019 alone
 
06:13:46.390 --> 06:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
now as mentioned i'm here to testify on
 
06:13:48.470 --> 06:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
house bill 592.
 
06:13:50.548 --> 06:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
i i believe we've had a pretty spirited
 
06:13:52.150 --> 06:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
conversation up to this point don't need
 
06:13:53.910 --> 06:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
to rehash
 
06:13:56.150 --> 06:13:56.160 align:start position:0%
the contents of the bill but pharma is
 
06:13:58.470 --> 06:13:58.480 align:start position:0%
opposed for two reasons
 
06:14:00.628 --> 06:14:00.638 align:start position:0%
first the legislation is preempted by
 
06:14:03.030 --> 06:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
existing federal law and second the
 
06:14:05.590 --> 06:14:05.600 align:start position:0%
language raises due process concerns for
 
06:14:07.750 --> 06:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine manufacturers
 
06:14:09.430 --> 06:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
now the statement that we did submit to
 
06:14:11.830 --> 06:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
the committee provides more detail about
 
06:14:14.310 --> 06:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
the federal laws already in place and
 
06:14:16.230 --> 06:14:16.240 align:start position:0%
that do address the compensation for
 
06:14:16.240 --> 06:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
that do address the compensation for
individuals

06:14:17.430 --> 06:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
06:14:19.190 --> 06:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
and for the sake of time i'll i'll
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
address the general ideas here i think
 
06:14:24.070 --> 06:14:24.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of good coverage so far
 
06:14:26.948 --> 06:14:26.958 align:start position:0%
but do want to point out there's two
 
06:14:28.548 --> 06:14:28.558 align:start position:0%
programs that are established in
 
06:14:30.470 --> 06:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
existing federal law that specifically
 
06:14:33.430 --> 06:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
address compensation related to vaccine
 
06:14:33.440 --> 06:14:34.470 align:start position:0%
address compensation related to vaccine
injuries

06:14:34.470 --> 06:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
06:14:35.990 --> 06:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
now the first one is the public
 
06:14:39.430 --> 06:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
readiness and emergency preparedness act
 
06:14:41.110 --> 06:14:41.120 align:start position:0%
now the prepped act as it's called is
 
06:14:43.270 --> 06:14:43.280 align:start position:0%
used during public health emergencies
 
06:14:44.868 --> 06:14:44.878 align:start position:0%
such as the one we're in right now with
 
06:14:44.878 --> 06:14:46.628 align:start position:0%
such as the one we're in right now with
covid19

06:14:46.628 --> 06:14:46.638 align:start position:0%
covid19
 
06:14:49.270 --> 06:14:49.280 align:start position:0%
and this gives the secretary of hhs the
 
06:14:51.830 --> 06:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
authority to limit legal liability for
 
06:14:51.840 --> 06:14:52.868 align:start position:0%
authority to limit legal liability for
losses

06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
losses
 
06:14:54.230 --> 06:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
relating to the administration of
 
06:14:55.910 --> 06:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
countermeasures such as
 
06:14:58.628 --> 06:14:58.638 align:start position:0%
diagnosis treatment and vaccines
 
06:15:00.948 --> 06:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
related to the emergency now should an
 
06:15:02.868 --> 06:15:02.878 align:start position:0%
individual be harmed by one of those
 
06:15:02.878 --> 06:15:04.150 align:start position:0%
individual be harmed by one of those
countermeasures

06:15:04.150 --> 06:15:04.160 align:start position:0%
countermeasures
 
06:15:06.230 --> 06:15:06.240 align:start position:0%
that individual may pursue a claim from
 
06:15:09.110 --> 06:15:09.120 align:start position:0%
the covered counter-measure process fund
 
06:15:10.708 --> 06:15:10.718 align:start position:0%
and that's a fund that's authorized
 
06:15:12.868 --> 06:15:12.878 align:start position:0%
under the prepped act
 
06:15:15.430 --> 06:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the second one which uh the sponsor
 
06:15:17.510 --> 06:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
of the bill did cover is the national
 
06:15:19.590 --> 06:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
childhood vaccine injury act
 
06:15:21.910 --> 06:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
and this covers many if not most of
 
06:15:24.548 --> 06:15:24.558 align:start position:0%
other vaccines and does include a
 
06:15:26.310 --> 06:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
federally administered compensation
 
06:15:28.868 --> 06:15:28.878 align:start position:0%
system for individuals that are injured
 
06:15:30.708 --> 06:15:30.718 align:start position:0%
after receiving a vaccine from one of
 
06:15:33.430 --> 06:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
the drugs covered under the act
 
06:15:35.590 --> 06:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
now both of these federal statutes
 
06:15:38.708 --> 06:15:38.718 align:start position:0%
expressly preempt state law claims
 
06:15:41.110 --> 06:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
that would result in inconsistencies
 
06:15:42.470 --> 06:15:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the federal law
 
06:15:44.948 --> 06:15:44.958 align:start position:0%
so rep able to ask that question
 
06:15:48.310 --> 06:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
the federal law does uh is explicit that
 
06:15:51.030 --> 06:15:51.040 align:start position:0%
it has the ultimate authority on um
 
06:15:51.040 --> 06:15:52.310 align:start position:0%
it has the ultimate authority on um
overseeing

06:15:52.310 --> 06:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
overseeing
 
06:15:54.390 --> 06:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
these compensation programs
 
06:15:56.390 --> 06:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
and and the final point we bring up is
 
06:15:58.390 --> 06:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
that the bill does raise due process
 
06:16:00.628 --> 06:16:00.638 align:start position:0%
concerns under both the united states
 
06:16:02.708 --> 06:16:02.718 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire constitutions because
 
06:16:05.030 --> 06:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
it does not provide procedural
 
06:16:07.750 --> 06:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
protections for vaccine manufacturers
 
06:16:10.070 --> 06:16:10.080 align:start position:0%
such as a mechanism for challenging a
 
06:16:12.150 --> 06:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
physician's claim
 
06:16:13.430 --> 06:16:13.440 align:start position:0%
based upon
 
06:16:15.190 --> 06:16:15.200 align:start position:0%
as as drafted
 
06:16:16.788 --> 06:16:16.798 align:start position:0%
so very quickly those are the the
 
06:16:18.628 --> 06:16:18.638 align:start position:0%
reasons outlined
 
06:16:20.548 --> 06:16:20.558 align:start position:0%
that we would respectfully urge the
 
06:16:22.470 --> 06:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
legislators on this committee to to
 
06:16:25.670 --> 06:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
oppose house bill 592 and happy to try
 
06:16:29.910 --> 06:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:31.670 --> 06:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
06:16:34.628 --> 06:16:34.638 align:start position:0%
don't see any questions from the members
 
06:16:35.830 --> 06:16:35.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your
 
06:16:35.840 --> 06:16:37.030 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much for your
testimony

06:16:37.030 --> 06:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um and i do see two hands up
 
06:16:44.230 --> 06:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
in attendees um

so i guess we'll let i will
 
06:16:49.270 --> 06:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
the nice guy that i am i'll let them

06:17:00.628 --> 06:17:00.638 align:start position:0%
these testifiers did um
 
06:17:02.788 --> 06:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
register late you know after we printed
 
06:17:03.910 --> 06:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
the list
 
06:17:05.270 --> 06:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know i was thinking that we should
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
probably do the afternoon ones at you
 
06:17:09.430 --> 06:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
know at lunchtime maybe we should be
 
06:17:11.430 --> 06:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
doing that i know yeah we did that some
 
06:17:13.590 --> 06:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
days or maybe last week and and today i
 
06:17:14.788 --> 06:17:14.798 align:start position:0%
did them all
 
06:17:17.670 --> 06:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:20.230 --> 06:17:20.240 align:start position:0%

and thank you for hearing my testimony
 
06:17:51.030 --> 06:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
mr chairman in america today vaccine
 
06:17:53.030 --> 06:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
injury is a serious problem that has
 
06:17:55.670 --> 06:17:55.680 align:start position:0%
touched an increasing number of citizens
 
06:17:56.948 --> 06:17:56.958 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and throughout the
 
06:17:56.958 --> 06:17:58.390 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and throughout the
country

06:17:58.390 --> 06:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
country
 
06:18:00.708 --> 06:18:00.718 align:start position:0%
before the present pandemic vaccine
 
06:18:03.110 --> 06:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
injury was primarily a concern of
 
06:18:05.030 --> 06:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
parents of younger children
 
06:18:07.510 --> 06:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
who continue to face tremendous medical
 
06:18:09.990 --> 06:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
and legal obstacles to recognition
 
06:18:13.750 --> 06:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
treatment and compensation of injuries
 
06:18:15.510 --> 06:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
to children too young to speak for
 
06:18:15.520 --> 06:18:17.110 align:start position:0%
to children too young to speak for
themselves

06:18:17.110 --> 06:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
06:18:20.150 --> 06:18:20.160 align:start position:0%
these parents have routinely faced
 
06:18:22.708 --> 06:18:22.718 align:start position:0%
denial from medical professionals and
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
unjust criticism in the media
 
06:18:27.030 --> 06:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
however since the advent of the
 
06:18:29.190 --> 06:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
coronavirus vaccine
 
06:18:31.990 --> 06:18:32.000 align:start position:0%
adults too are experiencing
 
06:18:34.470 --> 06:18:34.480 align:start position:0%
injuries and they are able to speak from
 
06:18:37.270 --> 06:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
them for themselves as we have seen in
 
06:18:39.830 --> 06:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
recent widespread media coverage of
 
06:18:43.350 --> 06:18:43.360 align:start position:0%
adverse reactions to the pfizer vaccine
 
06:18:44.548 --> 06:18:44.558 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
06:18:47.110 --> 06:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
federal law currently does preempt state
 
06:18:49.030 --> 06:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
courts from hearing product liability
 
06:18:50.470 --> 06:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
claims against
 
06:18:53.750 --> 06:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine manufacturers since the
 
06:18:56.070 --> 06:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
national childhood vaccine injury act
 
06:18:57.990 --> 06:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
first shielded pharmaceutical companies
 
06:19:01.510 --> 06:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
in 1988 the total number of vaccines
 
06:19:03.590 --> 06:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
recommended for children has increased
 
06:19:05.910 --> 06:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
from five vaccines for nine diseases to
 
06:19:09.430 --> 06:19:09.440 align:start position:0%
currently 12 vaccines for 16 diseases
 
06:19:11.030 --> 06:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
not including any upcoming
 
06:19:12.868 --> 06:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the coronavirus
 
06:19:12.878 --> 06:19:14.548 align:start position:0%
recommendation for the coronavirus
vaccine

06:19:14.548 --> 06:19:14.558 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
06:19:17.510 --> 06:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
as of 2020 the total compensation of
 
06:19:19.510 --> 06:19:19.520 align:start position:0%
injury and death that the federal
 
06:19:21.350 --> 06:19:21.360 align:start position:0%
vaccine court has awarded is
 
06:19:25.110 --> 06:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
approximately 4.9 billion dollars
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
parents must sue the federal government
 
06:19:28.948 --> 06:19:28.958 align:start position:0%
in the special court to have any hope of
 
06:19:28.958 --> 06:19:30.708 align:start position:0%
in the special court to have any hope of
compensation

06:19:30.708 --> 06:19:30.718 align:start position:0%
compensation
 
06:19:33.590 --> 06:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
awards come from a fund based on
 
06:19:36.310 --> 06:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
a vaccine excise tax and not from the
 
06:19:39.110 --> 06:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
vaccine manufacturers themselves
 
06:19:41.430 --> 06:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
due to procedural and jurisdictional
 
06:19:43.670 --> 06:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
impediments less than 10 percent of
 
06:19:46.470 --> 06:19:46.480 align:start position:0%
injuries ever come before the court
 
06:19:49.110 --> 06:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
even then compensation can take 10 years
 
06:19:50.070 --> 06:19:50.080 align:start position:0%
or more
 
06:19:53.350 --> 06:19:53.360 align:start position:0%
placing tremendous burden on families
 
06:19:56.470 --> 06:19:56.480 align:start position:0%
as burdensome as this process is for
 
06:19:58.948 --> 06:19:58.958 align:start position:0%
the recommended childhood vaccines any
 
06:20:01.670 --> 06:20:01.680 align:start position:0%
coronavirus vaccine adverse event cannot
 
06:20:03.430 --> 06:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
come before this court
 
06:20:05.670 --> 06:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
borough law designates all so-called
 
06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
coven 19 vaccines as quote emergency
 
06:20:11.750 --> 06:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
countermeasures quote and thus such
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
adverse results are essentially exempt
 
06:20:16.548 --> 06:20:16.558 align:start position:0%
from compensation under the federal prep
 
06:20:16.558 --> 06:20:18.230 align:start position:0%
from compensation under the federal prep
act

06:20:18.230 --> 06:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
act
 
06:20:20.708 --> 06:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
to respond briefly to previous testimony
 
06:20:23.350 --> 06:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
on the liability of manufacturers
 
06:20:25.750 --> 06:20:25.760 align:start position:0%
though the 1986
 
06:20:28.470 --> 06:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
national childhood vaccine injury act
 
06:20:30.310 --> 06:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
does appear to provide
 
06:20:32.390 --> 06:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
an avenue to the courts
 
06:20:35.350 --> 06:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
the holding of the 2012 u.s supreme
 
06:20:37.110 --> 06:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
court decision in bristol where it's
 
06:20:40.070 --> 06:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
bertha wyeth essentially bars all claims
 
06:20:42.230 --> 06:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
against manufacturers for the design
 
06:20:42.240 --> 06:20:43.430 align:start position:0%
against manufacturers for the design
defects

06:20:43.430 --> 06:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
defects
 
06:20:46.470 --> 06:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
in the pro product liability case
 
06:20:48.948 --> 06:20:48.958 align:start position:0%
uh mr chairman i logged the intent
 
06:20:50.788 --> 06:20:50.798 align:start position:0%
behind this bill to return some
 
06:20:52.948 --> 06:20:52.958 align:start position:0%
liability for injuries back to where it
 
06:20:55.030 --> 06:20:55.040 align:start position:0%
squarely belongs
 
06:20:57.510 --> 06:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
that is the manufacturers themselves and
 
06:20:59.750 --> 06:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
i commend the sponsor representative
 
06:21:02.070 --> 06:21:02.080 align:start position:0%
greeson for his courage in bringing
 
06:21:04.390 --> 06:21:04.400 align:start position:0%
forth an attempt to proactively address
 
06:21:05.590 --> 06:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
one of the most
 
06:21:08.230 --> 06:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
intractable and divisive issues of our
 
06:21:08.240 --> 06:21:09.190 align:start position:0%
intractable and divisive issues of our
time

06:21:09.190 --> 06:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
time
 
06:21:11.030 --> 06:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
however i fear this
 
06:21:13.350 --> 06:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
specific approach of this bill
 
06:21:15.830 --> 06:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
the compensation out of a manufacturer's
 
06:21:17.830 --> 06:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
bond would face immediate challenge
 
06:21:19.830 --> 06:21:19.840 align:start position:0%
based on federal preemption
 
06:21:22.868 --> 06:21:22.878 align:start position:0%
and thus provide a false sense of hope
 
06:21:25.110 --> 06:21:25.120 align:start position:0%
uh to the injureds and their grieving
 
06:21:27.510 --> 06:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
families furthermore the bill
 
06:21:29.510 --> 06:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
charges physicians with determining the
 
06:21:31.670 --> 06:21:31.680 align:start position:0%
existence of an adverse reaction but
 
06:21:34.150 --> 06:21:34.160 align:start position:0%
provides no standard by which to make
 
06:21:36.150 --> 06:21:36.160 align:start position:0%
such a determination
 
06:21:38.150 --> 06:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
for these reasons i urge further study
 
06:21:40.788 --> 06:21:40.798 align:start position:0%
of this approach and neither support nor
 
06:21:43.590 --> 06:21:43.600 align:start position:0%

06:22:06.160 --> 06:22:07.030 align:start position:0%
the federal preemption does that prevent
uh

06:22:07.030 --> 06:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:22:09.430 --> 06:22:09.440 align:start position:0%

uh requiring insurance or
or

06:22:12.548 --> 06:22:12.558 align:start position:0%
or
 
06:22:16.470 --> 06:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
posting a bond or other other measures
 
06:22:17.670 --> 06:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
the acts
 
06:22:20.390 --> 06:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
explicitly prevents
 
06:22:20.400 --> 06:22:21.430 align:start position:0%
explicitly prevents
state

06:22:21.430 --> 06:22:21.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:22:23.990 --> 06:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
product liability claims uh product
 
06:22:27.270 --> 06:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
liability claims in state court as to
 
06:22:28.868 --> 06:22:28.878 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
06:22:31.990 --> 06:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism of payment out of a bond it i
 
06:22:34.628 --> 06:22:34.638 align:start position:0%
don't think it's directly addressed
 
06:22:37.190 --> 06:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
but um my
 
06:22:37.200 --> 06:22:37.910 align:start position:0%
but um my
uh

06:22:37.910 --> 06:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
06:22:39.910 --> 06:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
opinion at this time without having
 
06:22:42.788 --> 06:22:42.798 align:start position:0%
thoroughly studied it is that
 
06:22:45.110 --> 06:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
the act would
 
06:22:47.670 --> 06:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
constructively preempt
 
06:22:49.350 --> 06:22:49.360 align:start position:0%
this type of arrangement
 
06:22:53.910 --> 06:22:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:55.990 --> 06:22:56.000 align:start position:0%

and

06:23:15.110 --> 06:23:15.120 align:start position:0%

cameron you can hear me yes we can very
 
06:23:21.590 --> 06:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
good i thank you my name is john martin
 
06:23:23.270 --> 06:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
i'm the deputy chief legal counsel for
 
06:23:25.750 --> 06:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
the department of health human services
 
06:23:27.990 --> 06:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
the department has not taken a position
 
06:23:30.868 --> 06:23:30.878 align:start position:0%
on house bill 592 but it has identified
 
06:23:33.190 --> 06:23:33.200 align:start position:0%
a couple of concerns that i wanted to
 
06:23:35.350 --> 06:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
bring to your attention under the bill
 
06:23:37.270 --> 06:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
claims against the bond would be filed
 
06:23:38.868 --> 06:23:38.878 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner of the department
 
06:23:41.030 --> 06:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
of health human services and this
 
06:23:42.708 --> 06:23:42.718 align:start position:0%
department doesn't believe that it is
 
06:23:44.948 --> 06:23:44.958 align:start position:0%
the appropriate entity to hear these
 
06:23:44.958 --> 06:23:45.910 align:start position:0%
the appropriate entity to hear these
claims

06:23:45.910 --> 06:23:45.920 align:start position:0%
claims
 
06:23:47.670 --> 06:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
believes that these types of liability
 
06:23:49.430 --> 06:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
claims are more appropriate for a court
 
06:23:49.440 --> 06:23:50.830 align:start position:0%
claims are more appropriate for a court
of

06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:23:53.350 --> 06:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
law also we're concerned about the
 
06:23:56.230 --> 06:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
potential for a fraud this bill requires
 
06:23:58.390 --> 06:23:58.400 align:start position:0%
only that a physician state that a
 
06:24:00.230 --> 06:24:00.240 align:start position:0%
patient became ill as a result of
 
06:24:02.868 --> 06:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
receiving a vaccine it's unclear under
 
06:24:05.430 --> 06:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
the bill how these claims would actually
 
06:24:07.030 --> 06:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
be verified
 
06:24:08.708 --> 06:24:08.718 align:start position:0%
moreover there's a pretty quick
 
06:24:10.628 --> 06:24:10.638 align:start position:0%
turnaround time for the commissioner to
 
06:24:11.990 --> 06:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
pay the patient a patient's
 
06:24:14.150 --> 06:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative once a claim has been
 
06:24:16.548 --> 06:24:16.558 align:start position:0%
filed which we're concerned doesn't
 
06:24:19.110 --> 06:24:19.120 align:start position:0%
allow sufficient time for the claim to
 
06:24:22.230 --> 06:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
be looked into and and verified
 
06:24:24.390 --> 06:24:24.400 align:start position:0%
so those are our concerns and i just
 
06:24:36.470 --> 06:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:37.990 --> 06:24:38.000 align:start position:0%
i muted myself
 
06:24:40.070 --> 06:24:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay so is there anybody else would like
 
06:24:42.230 --> 06:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
to uh oh we have a couple of questions
 
06:24:46.830 --> 06:24:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:49.830 --> 06:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
ahead sorry let's try taking that down
 
06:24:52.310 --> 06:24:52.320 align:start position:0%
okay so uh jeff unfortunately it's you
 
06:24:54.548 --> 06:24:54.558 align:start position:0%
testified you can't ask ask a question
 
06:24:56.708 --> 06:24:56.718 align:start position:0%
in a public heart so
 
06:24:58.070 --> 06:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
all righty
 
06:25:00.708 --> 06:25:00.718 align:start position:0%
i guess that's it and i have no more
 
06:25:03.830 --> 06:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
hands up so we're all set
 
06:25:07.190 --> 06:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
so i will close the the public hearing
 
06:25:07.200 --> 06:25:08.070 align:start position:0%
so i will close the the public hearing
and

06:25:08.070 --> 06:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:25:11.190 --> 06:25:11.200 align:start position:0%
i would say that uh there were um in
 
06:25:13.110 --> 06:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
this bill there were two opposition and
 
06:25:15.270 --> 06:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
11 members of the public that were in
 
06:25:17.750 --> 06:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
support of the bill
 
06:25:21.110 --> 06:25:21.120 align:start position:0%
and with that um i will
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
end our session today and see you all oh
