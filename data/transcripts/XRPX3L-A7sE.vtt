representative qualey is in charge of
 
00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 align:start position:0%
scheduling that it was noticed I think
 
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 align:start position:0%
honestly two weeks ago but at least now
 
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's on the public record all right and
 
00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 align:start position:0%
with that we will open up the public
 
00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
hearing on how a Senate bill there's one
 
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:16.260 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 156 uh Senator gray it's
 
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
good to see you thank you very much I am
 
00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 align:start position:0%
James Gray I represent Senate District
 
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
Six which starts up on Route 11 in Alton
 
00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 align:start position:0%
gilmanson comes down towards Rochester
 
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
and uh all the little towns that pretty
 
00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
much butt up against that uh
 
00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill uh 156 does a couple of
 
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
things uh certainly there was a
 
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
different procedure that we had for
 
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 align:start position:0%
people who registered within 30 days
 
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 align:start position:0%
that would sound unconstitutional so
 
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
most of the stuff that you see in the
 
00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
bill is stuff that takes out the things
 
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
that we couldn't do anymore
 
00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
the other things that I'm going to
 
00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
paraphrase them kind of briefly because
 
00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
I I am going to try to make most of my
 
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 align:start position:0%
finance earrings today I'll be back with
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
you when I need to be for introduction
 
00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 align:start position:0%
to bills
 
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it easier for
 
00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.290 align:start position:0%
we're trying to make it easier for
people

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 align:start position:0%
in the state both the Attorney General's
 
00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.410 align:start position:0%
in the state both the Attorney General's
office

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
office
 
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 align:start position:0%
Etc to check on people who come in
 
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
without a identity you know without
 
00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 align:start position:0%
anything that proves no driver's license
 
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 align:start position:0%
no whatever and right now the procedure
 
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 align:start position:0%
is that they they're supposed to get
 
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 align:start position:0%
investigated and we do we investigate
 
00:02:40.369 --> 00:02:40.379 align:start position:0%
them to the best of our ability but
 
00:02:43.369 --> 00:02:43.379 align:start position:0%
there are things that when I met with
 
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 align:start position:0%
Dick Tracy who is the investigator for
 
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office the things
 
00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 align:start position:0%
that we can do that help him out okay if
 
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 align:start position:0%
we add a voluntary
 
00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.110 align:start position:0%
we add a voluntary
um

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 align:start position:0%
section in the the registration form uh
 
00:03:03.369 --> 00:03:03.379 align:start position:0%
when they come in with no ID
 
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 align:start position:0%
if they've got a social media account
 
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
and that social media account has been
 
00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
around for four years I'm pretty sure
 
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 align:start position:0%
that I can find them okay and that's big
 
00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
criteria for Mr Tracy uh if they give me
 
00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 align:start position:0%
a social media account other than that
 
00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 align:start position:0%
if they give me a telephone number if
 
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
they give me all of these things help
 
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office in doing
 
00:03:32.149 --> 00:03:32.159 align:start position:0%
the investigations and narrowing this
 
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
may be the problem that we're looking
 
00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
for and not just people who
 
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 align:start position:0%
um have a reason not to uh to be able to
 
00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
uh to provide an ID so again those are
 
00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
the things uh we allow in here uh right
 
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
now if you are a moderator or really
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
clerk you can and you know the person
 
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:01.620 align:start position:0%
that's coming in you can certify for
 
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:02.589 align:start position:0%
that's coming in you can certify for
them

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:02.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 align:start position:0%
if if a voter comes in with someone who
 
00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
is already on the checklist before the
 
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 align:start position:0%
beginning of the day
 
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 align:start position:0%
and has somebody that they'll be able to
 
00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:18.859 align:start position:0%
verify for at least two of those people
 
00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
again what we're trying to do is to to
 
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 align:start position:0%
cut down on the people that we are
 
00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 align:start position:0%
investigating such that that we're
 
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
concentrating on the ones that that
 
00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 align:start position:0%
really matter
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
so there's other things in there I'm
 
00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
sure you'll have questions on
 
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
um if you don't ask them now you can I
 
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.220 align:start position:0%
think you know my phone number so you
 
00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:44.699 align:start position:0%
know an email address if thank you Mr
 
00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
chair okay questions from the committee
 
00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you thank you Mr
 
00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:53.930 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
so on page seven under Roman numeral
 
00:04:59.450 --> 00:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
five it lists
 
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:01.860 align:start position:0%
some of the things uh some of the
 
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
additional information
 
00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 align:start position:0%
that can be used such as phone numbers
 
00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 align:start position:0%
email addresses employer information
 
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
vehicle license plate number or state of
 
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 align:start position:0%
registration social media account
 
00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
so I um I didn't realize the Secretary
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
of State didn't have access to these
 
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:23.100 align:start position:0%
things now
 
00:05:26.689 --> 00:05:26.699 align:start position:0%
so uh what is the
 
00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:27.290 align:start position:0%
so uh what is the
um

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 align:start position:0%
state law is very particular on when it
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
allows us to use databases from other
 
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:35.460 align:start position:0%
departments and if you go into the
 
00:05:39.189 --> 00:05:39.199 align:start position:0%
statute right now we can share
 
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 align:start position:0%
information about a voter and someone
 
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
who has a driver's license for the
 
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
purposes of uh finding people to be on
 
00:05:51.529 --> 00:05:51.539 align:start position:0%
juries and there is limited amount of
 
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:55.560 align:start position:0%
other information that you can share
 
00:05:59.090 --> 00:05:59.100 align:start position:0%
last year we had a bill that would allow
 
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
them to share the last four digits of
 
00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:03.419 align:start position:0%
the social security number but the house
 
00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 align:start position:0%
didn't like that as much as the Senate
 
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
did and we'll probably run that by you
 
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
again soon but not today so
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
uh okay thank you
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
 
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.969 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions from the
committee

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 align:start position:0%

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you Mr
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
question how does a voter
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
um voluntarily allow this information to
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
be collected by the secretary of state
 
00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:31.139 align:start position:0%
is that something that's on on the
 
00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539 align:start position:0%
registration form or affidavit form that
 
00:06:34.909 --> 00:06:34.919 align:start position:0%
indicates that they can volunteer
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
they're going to they're going to modify
 
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
the form to have a block that allows
 
00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
them to collect it
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:06:44.629 --> 00:06:44.639 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative wood
 
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 align:start position:0%
taking my question do you know how many
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
um people show up on Election Day
 
00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:57.780 align:start position:0%
typically without an ID
 
00:07:01.790 --> 00:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
um if it's a town election or municipal
 
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
election there's very very few
 
00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:06.060 align:start position:0%
um right now
 
00:07:08.809 --> 00:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
we had a special election for state
 
00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 align:start position:0%
representative in Rochester after the
 
00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:14.400 align:start position:0%
start of the new procedure for affidavit
 
00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
voting and there was no one who showed
 
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
up to register uh that day in Rochester
 
00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:23.039 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State could probably
 
00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
tell you how many for the town meetings
 
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:28.560 align:start position:0%
that have already been held how many you
 
00:07:31.010 --> 00:07:31.020 align:start position:0%
know fell into the new procedure it's
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
not many in my time for being on
 
00:07:36.249 --> 00:07:36.259 align:start position:0%
Election law
 
00:07:38.990 --> 00:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
you know we do take the pictures and I
 
00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
have never heard of anyone that came in
 
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
and complained that they had duplicate
 
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:47.400 align:start position:0%
pictures of an individual in two
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
different towns that registered on the
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
same day so that's a good thing too so
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
again what we're trying to do is if
 
00:07:56.689 --> 00:07:56.699 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend the money to
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
investigate the people we want to do it
 
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:03.000 align:start position:0%
as efficiently as we can and help the
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
the inspector out gathering this type of
 
00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:07.870 align:start position:0%
the inspector out gathering this type of
information

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:07.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:11.160 align:start position:0%
certainly in the inspector's mind it may
 
00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:13.440 align:start position:0%
be that if you don't provide anyone any
 
00:08:15.589 --> 00:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
of that information it may be somebody
 
00:08:17.390 --> 00:08:17.400 align:start position:0%
that he wants to start with and not
 
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
finish with and when he's doing the
 
00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:21.660 align:start position:0%
investigation but that's uh that'll be
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
up to him
 
00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
further questions representative wood
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up please thank you
 
00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:28.670 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up please thank you
um

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:31.189 --> 00:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
it sounds after reading this this is
 
00:08:33.769 --> 00:08:33.779 align:start position:0%
going to be voluntary correct
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
uh if this passes will the
 
00:08:39.469 --> 00:08:39.479 align:start position:0%
um Secretary of State have the option I
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
mean he has a name to run that name
 
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
across databases to make uh our job
 
00:08:44.580 --> 00:08:45.650 align:start position:0%
across databases to make uh our job
easier

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
easier
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
is he going to be able to do that if
 
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
this passes or does he need them to
 
00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
basically give up that right or whatever
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
if you look at the state law right now
 
00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
the the Secretary of State doesn't do
 
00:08:58.910 --> 00:08:58.920 align:start position:0%
any of the investigations that's all
 
00:09:00.850 --> 00:09:00.860 align:start position:0%
passed to the Attorney General's office
 
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:03.300 align:start position:0%
because he he really doesn't have any
 
00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:05.940 align:start position:0%
Authority in doing any of that that that
 
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:08.820 align:start position:0%
I know of if he wants to correct me then
 
00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:11.820 align:start position:0%
somebody from the office can
 
00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:14.459 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
all right well seeing none um Senator
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
gray I believe we'll see you back at 1
 
00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:20.700 align:start position:0%
30. Maybe
 
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740 align:start position:0%
um I do not have anyone else signed up
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
to order pink cards uh Ms tantarelli you
 
00:09:28.009 --> 00:09:28.019 align:start position:0%
want to come on up but fill me out a
 
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:29.220 align:start position:0%
pink card when you get up you have one
 
00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:32.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
you can do it after your testimony it's
 
00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
all right Miss chance Riley we can
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
just make sure you get it to me it's a
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
homework assignment
 
00:09:44.930 --> 00:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for this opportunity my name
 
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:49.140 align:start position:0%
is Liz tentarelli I'm president of the
 
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
League of Women Voters of New Hampshire
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
and I didn't prepare written testimony
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
on this because my testimony is very
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
simple it's time to clear up some of the
 
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:01.980 align:start position:0%
language of our voting laws and it's
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
that part of the bill in particular that
 
00:10:06.590 --> 00:10:06.600 align:start position:0%
I want to address some of this language
 
00:10:10.550 --> 00:10:10.560 align:start position:0%
is a remainder from sb3 which was
 
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
declared unconstitutional in July of
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
2021 and it's time to get that language
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
out of there because all it does is
 
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:21.060 align:start position:0%
confuse people so I'm just speaking in
 
00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
support of it from that point of view
 
00:10:25.610 --> 00:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
and I will fill out my card okay will
 
00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
you be taking questions are you also
 
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
certainly if there are any all right are
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the committee
 
00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:31.620 align:start position:0%

00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:36.420 align:start position:0%
my question are you comfortable that
 
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.060 align:start position:0%
they took out what you needed in here I
 
00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
think so okay
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was that was a hard
 
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:44.630 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that was that was a hard
ball

00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
ball
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
um any other questions from the
 
00:10:47.449 --> 00:10:47.459 align:start position:0%
committee all right
 
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
um that being said now I definitely
 
00:10:50.090 --> 00:10:50.100 align:start position:0%
don't have any more pink cards um
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
representative can you grab me the
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
sign-in sheet for this
 
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:55.500 align:start position:0%
so we can close this committee and hang
 
00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:57.180 align:start position:0%
out for 15 minutes because apparently I
 
00:10:59.810 --> 00:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
can't I underestimated people's interest
 
00:11:05.870 --> 00:11:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

hearing on sb157 I recognize Senator

gray to introduce his bill uh thank you
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
Mr chair my name is James Gray I
 
00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District Six which
 
00:30:06.649 --> 00:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
starts in Alton and Gilmanton comes down
 
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:08.720 align:start position:0%
Route 11 to Rochester
 
00:30:13.570 --> 00:30:13.580 align:start position:0%
uh SB 157
 
00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
needs to uh to pass to continue the
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
audits that we are doing right now
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
um when I was back in the house uh there
 
00:30:27.409 --> 00:30:27.419 align:start position:0%
was the election uh Integrity commission
 
00:30:30.169 --> 00:30:30.179 align:start position:0%
or whatever it is down in Washington uh
 
00:30:31.870 --> 00:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
had two big gripes about New Hampshire
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
they said that we didn't have Audits and
 
00:30:37.370 --> 00:30:37.380 align:start position:0%
we weren't using machines that they had
 
00:30:40.490 --> 00:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
certified well we haven't changed the
 
00:30:43.610 --> 00:30:43.620 align:start position:0%
machines that we used and they didn't go
 
00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
back and certify anything that it was
 
00:30:48.529 --> 00:30:48.539 align:start position:0%
already out there so it was impossible
 
00:30:51.370 --> 00:30:51.380 align:start position:0%
for us to have a certified machine
 
00:30:55.070 --> 00:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
and this Vision here was how can we
 
00:30:56.990 --> 00:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
audit the machines that we have we don't
 
00:30:59.210 --> 00:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
have pictures of the ballots we can't
 
00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
distinguish the count in the machine uh
 
00:31:05.330 --> 00:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
one ballot for another one because of
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
the ways the machines do it and so we
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
came up with a procedure where we use a
 
00:31:12.769 --> 00:31:12.779 align:start position:0%
high speed scanner we run all the
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
ballots through there compare the
 
00:31:18.169 --> 00:31:18.179 align:start position:0%
accounts from the election night with
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
those counts then we actually do a
 
00:31:25.909 --> 00:31:25.919 align:start position:0%
sample of the ballots because the
 
00:31:28.730 --> 00:31:28.740 align:start position:0%
machine takes picture the top and the
 
00:31:32.029 --> 00:31:32.039 align:start position:0%
bottom and records that against the
 
00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:35.700 align:start position:0%
number that is assigns so that we can
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
pull a ballot up and then look at what
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
the actual picture shows us and what was
 
00:31:46.370 --> 00:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
recorded in the vote it has worked well
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
in my opinion you've got the audit
 
00:31:53.230 --> 00:31:53.240 align:start position:0%
reports that you can go look at this
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the Secretary of
 
00:31:57.769 --> 00:31:57.779 align:start position:0%
State's office just asked me about was
 
00:32:00.169 --> 00:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
how about taking out the words accuvote
 
00:32:03.409 --> 00:32:03.419 align:start position:0%
okay well this procedure was written
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
just for the accuvote machines if you
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
take and certify some of these newer
 
00:32:11.510 --> 00:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
machines and the Machine already scans
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
the ballots and assigns the serial
 
00:32:16.549 --> 00:32:16.559 align:start position:0%
number to them you may want to start in
 
00:32:18.830 --> 00:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
a different place the other thing they
 
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:20.640 align:start position:0%
wanted me to make sure that I clarified
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
is that we're not looking at doing more
 
00:32:27.950 --> 00:32:27.960 align:start position:0%
than one machine in locality okay that
 
00:32:30.830 --> 00:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're doing just a very few machines and
 
00:32:34.669 --> 00:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
if you do multiple machines in one town
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
then you're uh
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
not going to be as effective as you can
 
00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:43.620 align:start position:0%
be in this this random uh audit that
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
that we're doing by selecting the towns
 
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:49.500 align:start position:0%
so that the Secretary of State's office
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
that they want you know word changed
 
00:32:54.230 --> 00:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
here or there to uh to make sure that
 
00:32:57.049 --> 00:32:57.059 align:start position:0%
it's clear that we're not trying to do
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
multiple machines in the town uh that's
 
00:33:04.610 --> 00:33:04.620 align:start position:0%
fine with me but remember that my vision
 
00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:07.740 align:start position:0%
and hopefully your vision is that as new
 
00:33:10.730 --> 00:33:10.740 align:start position:0%
machines are certified that a plan to
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
audit those machines will be developed
 
00:33:18.529 --> 00:33:18.539 align:start position:0%
and and implemented at the same time and
 
00:33:22.070 --> 00:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
I do not anticipate that that be the
 
00:33:23.210 --> 00:33:23.220 align:start position:0%
same thing that we're doing with the
 
00:33:25.850 --> 00:33:25.860 align:start position:0%
accuvote machines because I needed a
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
starting point I needed a place to start
 
00:33:30.049 --> 00:33:30.059 align:start position:0%
and that was the high-speed scanner
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
taking the picture of both sides of the
 
00:33:33.649 --> 00:33:33.659 align:start position:0%
ballot and assigning it a serial number
 
00:33:37.009 --> 00:33:37.019 align:start position:0%
so that that can happen the only reason
 
00:33:39.409 --> 00:33:39.419 align:start position:0%
that uh we do two machines in the
 
00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
primary is so that when we get to the
 
00:33:44.210 --> 00:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
general election the Secretary of State
 
00:33:47.149 --> 00:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
can't come to me and say oh gee we don't
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
have the equipment to do it any longer
 
00:33:51.710 --> 00:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
you know we got rid of those a while ago
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
or or any other reason so we work out
 
00:33:58.610 --> 00:33:58.620 align:start position:0%
our problems in the primary uh we're not
 
00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
really trying to audit the primary of
 
00:34:02.990 --> 00:34:03.000 align:start position:0%
trying to make sure that that they've
 
00:34:04.370 --> 00:34:04.380 align:start position:0%
practiced the procedure that they're
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
going to use on Election Day or I should
 
00:34:08.990 --> 00:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
say right after the election to uh to
 
00:34:10.970 --> 00:34:10.980 align:start position:0%
audit the machines be happy to answer
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
any question you have questions from the
 
00:34:13.379 --> 00:34:15.169 align:start position:0%
any question you have questions from the
committee

00:34:15.169 --> 00:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:34:15.179 --> 00:34:20.230 align:start position:0%
committee
representative

00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you thank you Senator
 
00:34:26.089 --> 00:34:26.099 align:start position:0%
gray for taking my question
 
00:34:26.099 --> 00:34:26.810 align:start position:0%
gray for taking my question
um

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:26.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:29.570 --> 00:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
I just was looking at the fiscal
 
00:34:31.690 --> 00:34:31.700 align:start position:0%
um schedule and I was just wondering why
 
00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:36.889 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:36.889 --> 00:34:36.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:36.899 --> 00:34:38.329 align:start position:0%
um
I haven't

00:34:38.329 --> 00:34:38.339 align:start position:0%
I haven't
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
looked at the the physical note in a
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
while I don't
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
I know that
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
in a lot of the election law bills that
 
00:34:49.730 --> 00:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
came out and certainly check with
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
secretary's office that they did not
 
00:34:54.649 --> 00:34:54.659 align:start position:0%
include in the fiscal notes the added
 
00:34:56.570 --> 00:34:56.580 align:start position:0%
people that they would need to do these
 
00:34:57.670 --> 00:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
various things
 
00:35:00.230 --> 00:35:00.240 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
you know as in my other hat and chair of
 
00:35:05.930 --> 00:35:05.940 align:start position:0%
Senate Finance I told him to make sure
 
00:35:07.250 --> 00:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
that when they come in and do their
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
budget presentation in front of us uh
 
00:35:12.170 --> 00:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
that they tell me about all those little
 
00:35:13.849 --> 00:35:13.859 align:start position:0%
things that I've done in all these
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
election law bills uh that they haven't
 
00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:19.680 align:start position:0%
asked for a person and you know added
 
00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:21.170 align:start position:0%
asked for a person and you know added
together

00:35:21.170 --> 00:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
um you know we they probably do need a
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
little bit more of Assistance or a
 
00:35:27.890 --> 00:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
little bit more in their budget but
 
00:35:30.770 --> 00:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
again I direct you to there since uh
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
they would have been the ones that
 
00:35:34.430 --> 00:35:34.440 align:start position:0%
filled out their
 
00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:38.510 align:start position:0%
filled out their
follow-up

00:35:38.510 --> 00:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:40.490 --> 00:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
It's actually an additional question if
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
you don't mind so when conducting the
 
00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:44.030 align:start position:0%
you don't mind so when conducting the
audits

00:35:44.030 --> 00:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
audits
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
um just to clarify are the audits going
 
00:35:50.450 --> 00:35:50.460 align:start position:0%
to be on all machines in that one
 
00:35:52.609 --> 00:35:52.619 align:start position:0%
polling location or you're just picking
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
and choosing which one and that location
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
and then randomly going to another town
 
00:36:00.170 --> 00:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
or city if we are going to do
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
four to six machines in the time limit
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
that were provided
 
00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:06.950 align:start position:0%
that were provided
um

00:36:06.950 --> 00:36:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
what we want is that secretary of state
 
00:36:12.410 --> 00:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
will get there around noon time before
 
00:36:14.270 --> 00:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
any of the ballots are taken out of the
 
00:36:17.510 --> 00:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
machines make sure that the any ballots
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
that went through a particular machine
 
00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
or segregated so that the tape for those
 
00:36:26.569 --> 00:36:26.579 align:start position:0%
ballots will match the tape running them
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
through the high-speed machine I hope
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
that answers your question
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
it does thank you uh question my mom
 
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:36:42.050 --> 00:36:42.060 align:start position:0%
all of this says about
 
00:36:45.230 --> 00:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
auditing accuvote ballots and vacuum
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
boat machines yep
 
00:36:50.030 --> 00:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
when shouldn't it be something about
 
00:36:53.329 --> 00:36:53.339 align:start position:0%
saying reading state Secretary of State
 
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
approved the machines
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
I mean we're stuck with this and then
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to be changed
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future absolutely
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
the my again the things that I've talked
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
about in the Senate is that as they
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
approve a new machine okay be it
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
Whatever Manufacturing is that they
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
should approve an audit plan for that
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
machine because there can be subtle
 
00:37:20.329 --> 00:37:20.339 align:start position:0%
differences in one Machine versus
 
00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
another that will change the way you
 
00:37:25.550 --> 00:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
want to conduct the audit in the case of
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
the accuvote machines I don't have a
 
00:37:30.410 --> 00:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
starting point of a scanned ballot that
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
I can identify two particular portion of
 
00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
the database so I needed to do that
 
00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
scanning to begin with I don't Envision
 
00:37:40.730 --> 00:37:40.740 align:start position:0%
that happening on a newer machine
 
00:37:43.849 --> 00:37:43.859 align:start position:0%
follow-up follow-up also number of
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
machines and I've been doing this a lot
 
00:37:51.410 --> 00:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
in a long time the problem is is one
 
00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:53.540 align:start position:0%
machine out of two or three or four
 
00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
sometimes what happens is when the
 
00:37:58.609 --> 00:37:58.619 align:start position:0%
machines goes down and they take all
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
those ballots
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
and stick them in another machine just
 
00:38:05.630 --> 00:38:05.640 align:start position:0%
for get a completely accurate account so
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
couldn't that be a problem
 
00:38:10.609 --> 00:38:10.619 align:start position:0%
that's certainly you know anything can
 
00:38:12.829 --> 00:38:12.839 align:start position:0%
be a problem okay
 
00:38:16.069 --> 00:38:16.079 align:start position:0%
um what we've done in the past is that
 
00:38:19.069 --> 00:38:19.079 align:start position:0%
if a machine goes down we there's a
 
00:38:21.770 --> 00:38:21.780 align:start position:0%
decision made whether or not we need to
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
rescan all the ballots that went through
 
00:38:26.510 --> 00:38:26.520 align:start position:0%
that machine or to take a different
 
00:38:29.510 --> 00:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
machine put it in place use the tape
 
00:38:31.790 --> 00:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
from the first machine and then make a
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
tape for the second machine again the
 
00:38:37.550 --> 00:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State you know is going to
 
00:38:41.210 --> 00:38:41.220 align:start position:0%
have to to to do this on the Fly uh and
 
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
make the right decision for the state
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:38:47.150 --> 00:38:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead
 
00:38:48.829 --> 00:38:48.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:38:48.839 --> 00:38:49.730 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

00:38:49.730 --> 00:38:49.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
I I guess in the ideal I'd love to see
 
00:38:56.089 --> 00:38:56.099 align:start position:0%
an audit regimen that would apply to the
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
machines where the state's using now and
 
00:39:00.230 --> 00:39:00.240 align:start position:0%
any machines that the state might use in
 
00:39:03.109 --> 00:39:03.119 align:start position:0%
the future without having the you know
 
00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:05.460 align:start position:0%
without having to write new new laws to
 
00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:07.980 align:start position:0%
accommodate future machines so one
 
00:39:09.290 --> 00:39:09.300 align:start position:0%
question is do you think it is possible
 
00:39:11.569 --> 00:39:11.579 align:start position:0%
to write a law describing an audit
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
regimen that that would apply to any and
 
00:39:16.069 --> 00:39:16.079 align:start position:0%
all machines that are in use and might
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
be in use in in the foreseeable future
 
00:39:20.089 --> 00:39:20.099 align:start position:0%
and related to that
 
00:39:22.250 --> 00:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
could would you be friendly to an
 
00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that would expand the audit
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
regime to include
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
um you know Wards or localities that are
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
hand counted
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
um there is already a procedure for hand
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
count talents
 
00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:37.460 align:start position:0%
um in fact
 
00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:39.660 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
all of the ballots no matter what if
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
there is a race that is a state
 
00:39:47.710 --> 00:39:47.720 align:start position:0%
representative race requires a recount
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh then up to 10 of those towns are hand
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
counted uh and that is regardless of
 
00:39:56.450 --> 00:39:56.460 align:start position:0%
whether they're using the accuvote
 
00:39:59.710 --> 00:39:59.720 align:start position:0%
machines or you know hand counting them
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
so that that is part of of what we do
 
00:40:08.089 --> 00:40:08.099 align:start position:0%
already would I put into law or think it
 
00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:10.920 align:start position:0%
was a friendly Amendment uh putting a
 
00:40:13.970 --> 00:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
procedure that would go forever I don't
 
00:40:15.950 --> 00:40:15.960 align:start position:0%
think that the
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
procedure for auditing new machines
 
00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
should be in law at all I think it
 
00:40:22.970 --> 00:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
should be part of the approval process
 
00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
from the ballot law commission and this
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
should be specified you know there if
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
you disagree with me then you know
 
00:40:32.650 --> 00:40:32.660 align:start position:0%
you're free to do what you want you want
 
00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:36.900 align:start position:0%
but I believe that that audit because I
 
00:40:39.230 --> 00:40:39.240 align:start position:0%
don't know the intricacies of the
 
00:40:42.470 --> 00:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
machine that it is very difficult to do
 
00:40:44.569 --> 00:40:44.579 align:start position:0%
that and if I have the ballot law
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
commission already looking at that and
 
00:40:49.370 --> 00:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
saying well this would be a good way to
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
audit it I'm willing to accept that
 
00:40:56.030 --> 00:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:41:00.109 --> 00:41:00.119 align:start position:0%
president Brennan do you have a question
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:41:03.230 --> 00:41:03.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:41:03.240 --> 00:41:05.390 align:start position:0%
taking my question
if

00:41:05.390 --> 00:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
00:41:08.329 --> 00:41:08.339 align:start position:0%
election audits are
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
important for election Integrity in
 
00:41:12.890 --> 00:41:12.900 align:start position:0%
building voter confidence in our
 
00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:14.450 align:start position:0%
building voter confidence in our
elections

00:41:14.450 --> 00:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
elections
 
00:41:14.460 --> 00:41:15.109 align:start position:0%
elections
um

00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:17.540 align:start position:0%
does a temporary
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
Bill like this temporary legislation
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
fulfill that
 
00:41:27.470 --> 00:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
um need to increase voter confidence and
 
00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:29.820 align:start position:0%
election and integrity through an audit
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
process and is it fiscally responsible
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
to have such a temporary
 
00:41:38.339 --> 00:41:40.310 align:start position:0%
to have such a temporary
fix

00:41:40.310 --> 00:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
fix
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
um to be putting in additional software
 
00:41:46.490 --> 00:41:46.500 align:start position:0%
and scanning capabilities for this very
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
limited time since we are very hopeful
 
00:41:51.530 --> 00:41:51.540 align:start position:0%
that we'll have new machines for 2024.
 
00:41:51.540 --> 00:41:52.750 align:start position:0%
that we'll have new machines for 2024.
and

00:41:52.750 --> 00:41:52.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
we'll speak to the temporariness of this
 
00:42:00.770 --> 00:42:00.780 align:start position:0%
right now is that in in this bill
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
um when it was originally written I had
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
a lot more audits being done than are
 
00:42:08.829 --> 00:42:08.839 align:start position:0%
done right now are in the bill right now
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
my preference would be that there would
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
be two machines running four audits a
 
00:42:20.270 --> 00:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
day for the two days and so that there
 
00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:23.700 align:start position:0%
would be a total of like 16 machines but
 
00:42:25.370 --> 00:42:25.380 align:start position:0%
that would have had the Secretary of
 
00:42:27.290 --> 00:42:27.300 align:start position:0%
State go out and buy another scanner
 
00:42:30.849 --> 00:42:30.859 align:start position:0%
another computer system another whatever
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
remembering that the contract that we
 
00:42:37.069 --> 00:42:37.079 align:start position:0%
have with LHS about the machines being
 
00:42:38.770 --> 00:42:38.780 align:start position:0%
serviceable for relax
 
00:42:41.510 --> 00:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
pretty much runs out with the next state
 
00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:42.470 align:start position:0%
pretty much runs out with the next state
election

00:42:42.470 --> 00:42:42.480 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
that there is no guarantee and that is
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
why we've tested several machines here
 
00:42:51.530 --> 00:42:51.540 align:start position:0%
during this the spring session with the
 
00:42:54.130 --> 00:42:54.140 align:start position:0%
town meetings we tested a few last year
 
00:42:58.490 --> 00:42:58.500 align:start position:0%
all of that and again yes it is going to
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
be temporary because the accuvote
 
00:43:02.450 --> 00:43:02.460 align:start position:0%
machines are not going to be in use
 
00:43:04.970 --> 00:43:04.980 align:start position:0%
after this and
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
I should say more than likely won't be
 
00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:09.140 align:start position:0%
in use
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
but again we have to certify a new
 
00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:14.940 align:start position:0%
machine or we have to do hand counts if
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
we're doing hand counts then I'll go
 
00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:19.980 align:start position:0%
back to the testimony about if there's a
 
00:43:22.370 --> 00:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
State Rep race that's being recounted
 
00:43:25.130 --> 00:43:25.140 align:start position:0%
that current law right now says that we
 
00:43:28.609 --> 00:43:28.619 align:start position:0%
will we will hand count at least uh you
 
00:43:32.210 --> 00:43:32.220 align:start position:0%
know 10 races higher level races
 
00:43:36.290 --> 00:43:36.300 align:start position:0%
um you know from those ballots so you
 
00:43:39.290 --> 00:43:39.300 align:start position:0%
know we are we're miles ahead of where
 
00:43:42.290 --> 00:43:42.300 align:start position:0%
we used to be when I was sitting you
 
00:43:43.609 --> 00:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
know in the same seats that you're
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
sitting now or 10 years ago so we're
 
00:43:49.730 --> 00:43:49.740 align:start position:0%
getting there and we just need to keep
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative way
 
00:43:56.630 --> 00:43:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Senator
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
gray um for taking my question uh just a
 
00:44:02.089 --> 00:44:02.099 align:start position:0%
clarification uh on page two it talks
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
about the odd team she'll scan all the
 
00:44:05.329 --> 00:44:05.339 align:start position:0%
ballots which we're cast so I'm assuming
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
that's in one machine all the ballots
 
00:44:09.829 --> 00:44:09.839 align:start position:0%
that were cast in that individual
 
00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
machine correct and then you could
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
ostensibly compare that with the results
 
00:44:17.329 --> 00:44:17.339 align:start position:0%
from that machine to show the valid or
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
validate that uh scan image
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
was consistent between when the voter
 
00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
first submitted and then this recheck
 
00:44:30.890 --> 00:44:30.900 align:start position:0%
then down in section 7 on line 10 you
 
00:44:32.870 --> 00:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
then say a random sample of not less
 
00:44:34.309 --> 00:44:34.319 align:start position:0%
than four percent of the ballot scan
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
shall be selected and then images shall
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
be compared with the voter choices
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's intended to be a hand count at
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.550 align:start position:0%
that point
well

00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
um of that four percent sampling so so
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
let me go back to the beginning okay
 
00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:49.550 align:start position:0%
let me go back to the beginning okay
okay

00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
the you notice that in there there is
 
00:44:55.609 --> 00:44:55.619 align:start position:0%
nothing in there that says you know this
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
is good and this is bad okay and the
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
reason that we do it that way is so that
 
00:45:04.309 --> 00:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
the information will be available to the
 
00:45:07.790 --> 00:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
uh individual candidates in time for
 
00:45:10.370 --> 00:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
them to request a recount so if they
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
believe that that one or two vote
 
00:45:15.170 --> 00:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
difference that you see between tape 1
 
00:45:18.109 --> 00:45:18.119 align:start position:0%
and tape two is enough that they want to
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
recount then they'll go request a
 
00:45:23.329 --> 00:45:23.339 align:start position:0%
recount in accordance with statute the
 
00:45:27.309 --> 00:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
way it is okay so now
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
how do you one of the the big things
 
00:45:33.109 --> 00:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
that people said is you can't use a
 
00:45:35.150 --> 00:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
machine to check a machine
 
00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:37.380 align:start position:0%
okay and there's some mathematicians
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
that would argue with you because they
 
00:45:42.829 --> 00:45:42.839 align:start position:0%
they were ready to provide me with all
 
00:45:45.829 --> 00:45:45.839 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff but so how do you check
 
00:45:49.430 --> 00:45:49.440 align:start position:0%
that second machine well if I had that
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
machine to start with that already
 
00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:53.940 align:start position:0%
scanned abouts and assigned a serial
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
number that I could pull up the ballot
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
and the way the ballot was counted that
 
00:46:03.170 --> 00:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
is how in the state of Vermont and a few
 
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.220 align:start position:0%
of the other states that's how they do
 
00:46:07.490 --> 00:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
their audits is they look at that
 
00:46:10.010 --> 00:46:10.020 align:start position:0%
scanned image and they look at what was
 
00:46:13.010 --> 00:46:13.020 align:start position:0%
recorded in their database and say yep
 
00:46:15.250 --> 00:46:15.260 align:start position:0%
that was read the way it was supposed to
 
00:46:17.930 --> 00:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
the capability that we have in the
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
machines that we are using for this
 
00:46:23.210 --> 00:46:23.220 align:start position:0%
audit can actually go in and tell you
 
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
you know how much of the oval was filled
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
in you know and allow you to pick if you
 
00:46:32.630 --> 00:46:32.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to you know then we're not
 
00:46:35.150 --> 00:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
getting into all of that right now if we
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
want to look at that when we look at a
 
00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:40.020 align:start position:0%
new machine God love you you know have a
 
00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:40.940 align:start position:0%
good time
 
00:46:43.730 --> 00:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
but again what we're trying to do is the
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
accuvote machines and and have the
 
00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:49.740 align:start position:0%
voters be able to say yep that voter
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
that machine was operating properly on
 
00:46:53.990 --> 00:46:54.000 align:start position:0%
Election Day
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you
 
00:46:58.190 --> 00:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
um then you'd you'd leave it up to the
 
00:47:02.990 --> 00:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office or to
 
00:47:04.609 --> 00:47:04.619 align:start position:0%
clarify the guidelines for
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
implementation of section seven if there
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
is confusion in their mind about whether
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
we're talking about one machine in a
 
00:47:14.870 --> 00:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
polling place or more uh remember that
 
00:47:20.569 --> 00:47:20.579 align:start position:0%
if the moderator has or if the control
 
00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:23.940 align:start position:0%
of the ballots has been lost by the time
 
00:47:25.809 --> 00:47:25.819 align:start position:0%
they get there at noon time or whatever
 
00:47:29.210 --> 00:47:29.220 align:start position:0%
and it's a place that uses two or more
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
machines you may be in a condition where
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
you have to do all of the ballots at
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
that polling place to regain control
 
00:47:40.970 --> 00:47:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay but that is not the intent the
 
00:47:43.490 --> 00:47:43.500 align:start position:0%
intent is to control those ballots make
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
sure that I only am worried about you
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
know the ballots that went through a
 
00:47:50.270 --> 00:47:50.280 align:start position:0%
particular machine at that voting
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
location and then comparing that tape
 
00:47:56.569 --> 00:47:56.579 align:start position:0%
with another one again you know if I
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
always when I when I took statistics in
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
college I called it sadistics but you
 
00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740 align:start position:0%
know you can call it what you want but
 
00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:07.640 align:start position:0%
that you know
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
the the percentages that we're using are
 
00:48:12.589 --> 00:48:12.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to give us a a confidence
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
factor and it's not as high as I would
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
like it because I would have done more
 
00:48:20.150 --> 00:48:20.160 align:start position:0%
but I think it's sufficient to to prove
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
our point
 
00:48:23.210 --> 00:48:23.220 align:start position:0%
I enjoy statistics representative weary
 
00:48:25.609 --> 00:48:25.619 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah uh when my graduate are
 
00:48:28.190 --> 00:48:28.200 align:start position:0%
you an N or an N plus one guy oh I'm an
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
M plus one sample so
 
00:48:33.770 --> 00:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
n plus 1 is a sample instead of N and
 
00:48:37.309 --> 00:48:37.319 align:start position:0%
we're with a total population when my
 
00:48:39.109 --> 00:48:39.119 align:start position:0%
grandfather taught statistics they
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
called it the mystery hour so okay
 
00:48:44.809 --> 00:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
so uh just uh follow up to that section
 
00:48:47.150 --> 00:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
seven how is the four percent arrived at
 
00:48:48.410 --> 00:48:48.420 align:start position:0%
was there any
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
it was a wild guess you know picked from
 
00:48:54.730 --> 00:48:54.740 align:start position:0%
a dark place you know uh statistic
 
00:48:58.010 --> 00:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
statistician's brain possibly so and
 
00:49:01.730 --> 00:49:01.740 align:start position:0%
we did look at you know n n plus one you
 
00:49:04.309 --> 00:49:04.319 align:start position:0%
know standard deviations how many you
 
00:49:06.370 --> 00:49:06.380 align:start position:0%
know and all of that but
 
00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
when it went through the committee the
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
last time uh two years ago
 
00:49:14.210 --> 00:49:14.220 align:start position:0%
um it was easier to say we're going to
 
00:49:16.609 --> 00:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
pick X number of machines or
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
and they understood it much better that
 
00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:21.890 align:start position:0%
and they understood it much better that
way

00:49:21.890 --> 00:49:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:23.930 --> 00:49:23.940 align:start position:0%
further questions and I'm sure we'll
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
enjoy some statistics conversations
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
later uh thank you uh Senator gray we'll
 
00:49:29.450 --> 00:49:29.460 align:start position:0%
see you back here in I guess 10 minutes
 
00:49:31.670 --> 00:49:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh probably not you may be able to spend
 
00:49:32.990 --> 00:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
a little time in the hallway
 
00:49:34.609 --> 00:49:34.619 align:start position:0%
um next up is going to be Michael
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
O'Brien from Auburn representing America
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
votes and the Brennan Center
 
00:49:40.910 --> 00:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh and uh Mr Brian when you get up here
 
00:49:42.290 --> 00:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
you got to tell us if you support or
 
00:49:45.609 --> 00:49:45.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.690 --> 00:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
support it all right we'll write that on
 
00:49:50.030 --> 00:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
your pink card support ish
 
00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:52.849 align:start position:0%
your pink card support ish
foreign

00:49:52.849 --> 00:49:52.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.230 --> 00:49:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
00:49:56.089 --> 00:49:56.099 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael O'Brien I
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
am a lobbyist of pretty strategies here
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
representing America votes and reading
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
testimony on behalf of Lisa danich from
 
00:50:02.750 --> 00:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
the Brennan Center I'm passing a
 
00:50:04.130 --> 00:50:04.140 align:start position:0%
testimony around so I won't read it
 
00:50:06.410 --> 00:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
verbatim and there are people behind me
 
00:50:07.849 --> 00:50:07.859 align:start position:0%
who may be able to better answer some
 
00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
questions but I'll do my best to try
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
um we want to thank Senator gray for
 
00:50:14.030 --> 00:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
bringing this bill forward but it's some
 
00:50:15.710 --> 00:50:15.720 align:start position:0%
questions have indicated I think we're
 
00:50:17.809 --> 00:50:17.819 align:start position:0%
looking for a sort of longer term
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
solution to the audits that we think can
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
be used both for accuvotes and other
 
00:50:24.170 --> 00:50:24.180 align:start position:0%
machines so just a few of the points
 
00:50:26.270 --> 00:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
from from Lisa who could not be here
 
00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
today because I think she's in a place
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
that's warmer in some year even though
 
00:50:31.550 --> 00:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
it's pretty nice out today but Italy is
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
also maybe better food I don't really
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
know what's going on but
 
00:50:36.470 --> 00:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
um first and most importantly she
 
00:50:37.670 --> 00:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
recommends this bill should require a
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
manual review of some ballots to check
 
00:50:41.030 --> 00:50:41.040 align:start position:0%
that the ballots were counted accurately
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
so the point here is that through the
 
00:50:46.370 --> 00:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
scanner if
 
00:50:48.049 --> 00:50:48.059 align:start position:0%
um to explain this recommendation I'll
 
00:50:49.549 --> 00:50:49.559 align:start position:0%
read let me backtrack for a moment and
 
00:50:51.770 --> 00:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
describe how the proposed audit Works in
 
00:50:53.630 --> 00:50:53.640 align:start position:0%
step one paper ballots from selected
 
00:50:55.010 --> 00:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
towns and City Wards are scanned into
 
00:50:56.870 --> 00:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
the audit device and recounted the
 
00:50:58.430 --> 00:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
totals from the audit devices compared
 
00:50:59.630 --> 00:50:59.640 align:start position:0%
with the totals counted during the
 
00:51:00.770 --> 00:51:00.780 align:start position:0%
election to make sure they match so
 
00:51:02.630 --> 00:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
that's obviously the first step step two
 
00:51:04.010 --> 00:51:04.020 align:start position:0%
of the audit is then the process that
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
ensures the audit device itself works
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
properly and has not been comprised in
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
any way in step two there should be a
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
comparison of a random sample of
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
auto-day paper ballots with the ballot
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
interpretations for those recorded by
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
um because voters ballots provide the
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
most trustworthy record of Voters
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
intentions New Hampshire's Auto process
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
should incorporate use of that
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
authoritative device so you want to look
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
at not just a scan ballot but then a
 
00:51:28.910 --> 00:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
sub-sample of actual ballots to make
 
00:51:30.290 --> 00:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
sure it's then matching the device that
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
is scanning them
 
00:51:33.710 --> 00:51:33.720 align:start position:0%
uh Second and also quite importantly New
 
00:51:35.030 --> 00:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire audits should not be limited
 
00:51:36.589 --> 00:51:36.599 align:start position:0%
to ballots counted by accuvote devices
 
00:51:39.230 --> 00:51:39.240 align:start position:0%
this was just discussed instead all the
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
states battles should be within the
 
00:51:41.630 --> 00:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
audit scope to assure a broad
 
00:51:43.370 --> 00:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
representation of New Hampshire voters
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
this assures that voters of the audit
 
00:51:46.970 --> 00:51:46.980 align:start position:0%
procedure hasn't been favored or
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
cherry-picked some places or machines
 
00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
while avoiding others by making explicit
 
00:51:53.329 --> 00:51:53.339 align:start position:0%
reference to an audit of the accuvote
 
00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
electronic ballot accounting devices SB
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
157 excludes the audit scope
 
00:51:59.030 --> 00:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions that could use hand counts
 
00:52:00.829 --> 00:52:00.839 align:start position:0%
and also those that replace their active
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
volt machines again hopefully sooner
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
than later third we recommend
 
00:52:07.730 --> 00:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
modifications related to the selection
 
00:52:10.250 --> 00:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
of towns and City Wards subject to the
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
audit there should be an increase in the
 
00:52:13.069 --> 00:52:13.079 align:start position:0%
number of towns and City Awards selected
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
to be part of the audit since a graded
 
00:52:16.609 --> 00:52:16.619 align:start position:0%
number of batches in an audit improves
 
00:52:18.950 --> 00:52:18.960 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the audit since we
 
00:52:20.569 --> 00:52:20.579 align:start position:0%
recommend a comparison of smaller number
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
of paper ballots so they're recommending
 
00:52:24.049 --> 00:52:24.059 align:start position:0%
that you compare 100 paper ballots as
 
00:52:26.809 --> 00:52:26.819 align:start position:0%
opposed to the four percent it should
 
00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
not increase the workload tremendously
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
to then add in some more Awards or towns
 
00:52:34.849 --> 00:52:34.859 align:start position:0%
to choose from fourth we recommend
 
00:52:35.990 --> 00:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
expanding the legislation to cover
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
presidential primaries it doesn't
 
00:52:40.250 --> 00:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
currently do that and if folks have
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
concern over the accuracy of Elections
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
it feels like the presidential primary
 
00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
would be a good place for folks to go so
 
00:52:46.490 --> 00:52:46.500 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that's covered as well
 
00:52:48.290 --> 00:52:48.300 align:start position:0%
to make sure folks feel confident in all
 
00:52:50.569 --> 00:52:50.579 align:start position:0%
of our elections and Fifth and finally
 
00:52:52.549 --> 00:52:52.559 align:start position:0%
we recommend including within the bill
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
language regarding a process to file if
 
00:52:55.970 --> 00:52:55.980 align:start position:0%
an audit uncovers differences in the
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
count which this bill currently does not
 
00:53:00.109 --> 00:53:00.119 align:start position:0%
do so those are the recommendations from
 
00:53:02.210 --> 00:53:02.220 align:start position:0%
Lisa dance who is a member from this
 
00:53:03.829 --> 00:53:03.839 align:start position:0%
committee is much smarter than I but I
 
00:53:05.150 --> 00:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
will do my best to try to answer any
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
questions or leave it to the people
 
00:53:11.930 --> 00:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
okay questions from the committee
 
00:53:16.970 --> 00:53:16.980 align:start position:0%
you're getting off easy oh no remember
 
00:53:19.849 --> 00:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question
 
00:53:22.370 --> 00:53:22.380 align:start position:0%
just a quick one thank you Mr chair and
 
00:53:25.309 --> 00:53:25.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:53:25.319 --> 00:53:25.970 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
um

00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:28.250 --> 00:53:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that the new
 
00:53:30.589 --> 00:53:30.599 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines that are being
 
00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:32.520 align:start position:0%
considered have the scanning
 
00:53:35.510 --> 00:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
capabilities already built in and would
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
be able to easily provide scanned images
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
for an audit
 
00:53:45.470 --> 00:53:45.480 align:start position:0%
um in the testimony that is provided
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
here from Lisa Dennis would it also be
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
her testimony and your testimony that in
 
00:53:56.809 --> 00:53:56.819 align:start position:0%
if the committee were to reword this uh
 
00:54:00.049 --> 00:54:00.059 align:start position:0%
make an amendment to this bill
 
00:54:00.059 --> 00:54:02.809 align:start position:0%
make an amendment to this bill
that

00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
we make sure we're really capturing
 
00:54:06.660 --> 00:54:08.990 align:start position:0%
we make sure we're really capturing
um

00:54:08.990 --> 00:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:12.230 --> 00:54:12.240 align:start position:0%
the needs for the future and not just
 
00:54:16.549 --> 00:54:16.559 align:start position:0%
the temporary with the Accu active vote
 
00:54:18.770 --> 00:54:18.780 align:start position:0%
yeah so I think that's right I think the
 
00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
recommendations here I'm from the
 
00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:22.220 align:start position:0%
Running Center from Lisa are
 
00:54:23.930 --> 00:54:23.940 align:start position:0%
recommendations that have been best
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
practices from other states that do
 
00:54:27.170 --> 00:54:27.180 align:start position:0%
Audits and most other states at this
 
00:54:28.910 --> 00:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
point do audit and so regardless of
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
almost no one else who's in the acne
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
vote machine right so it's not like this
 
00:54:33.650 --> 00:54:33.660 align:start position:0%
wouldn't apply to some of the newer
 
00:54:35.329 --> 00:54:35.339 align:start position:0%
machines that exist
 
00:54:37.370 --> 00:54:37.380 align:start position:0%
um I you know I won't speak to what the
 
00:54:38.870 --> 00:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
new technologies of the machines can do
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
especially because that state hasn't
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
actually chosen one yet and so we're
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
still in the process and I bet different
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
things do different ones but I think
 
00:54:45.290 --> 00:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
it's safe to say the recommendations
 
00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:46.549 align:start position:0%
it's safe to say the recommendations
that

00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
she brought forward here apply writ
 
00:54:51.650 --> 00:54:51.660 align:start position:0%
large to you know any machine that the
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
state might might choose
 
00:54:56.329 --> 00:54:56.339 align:start position:0%
okay now further questions all right now
 
00:54:59.510 --> 00:54:59.520 align:start position:0%
you get off easy uh next up is uh deputy
 
00:55:05.030 --> 00:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:10.309 --> 00:55:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
00:55:10.319 --> 00:55:11.329 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
committee

00:55:11.329 --> 00:55:11.339 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:55:13.549 --> 00:55:13.559 align:start position:0%
um I am here representing the Secretary
 
00:55:15.890 --> 00:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
of State and I wanted to let you know
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we do support this bill
 
00:55:21.530 --> 00:55:21.540 align:start position:0%
um the audits that we did in 2022 were
 
00:55:22.910 --> 00:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
very effective
 
00:55:26.450 --> 00:55:26.460 align:start position:0%
um and and to Senator Gray's point you
 
00:55:28.089 --> 00:55:28.099 align:start position:0%
can go on our website and read those
 
00:55:31.250 --> 00:55:31.260 align:start position:0%
reports that we've done uh initially
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
Senator gray had had more devices that
 
00:55:37.609 --> 00:55:37.619 align:start position:0%
were to be audited and at a higher
 
00:55:41.950 --> 00:55:41.960 align:start position:0%
percentage and we had asked him to
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
reduce that to someone had asked the
 
00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:46.920 align:start position:0%
where did the numbers come from we'd
 
00:55:48.829 --> 00:55:48.839 align:start position:0%
asked them to reduce that number on the
 
00:55:51.890 --> 00:55:51.900 align:start position:0%
Senate side because of timing
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
we do the audits after the election but
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
before the deadline to request a recount
 
00:55:59.990 --> 00:56:00.000 align:start position:0%
so that if the audit turns up anything
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
where a candidate would question
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
something they have the um the option of
 
00:56:07.010 --> 00:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
using that information in their decision
 
00:56:07.020 --> 00:56:08.809 align:start position:0%
using that information in their decision
process

00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:56:08.819 --> 00:56:09.470 align:start position:0%
process
um

00:56:09.470 --> 00:56:09.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:11.270 --> 00:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
we are also
 
00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:11.990 align:start position:0%
we are also
um

00:56:11.990 --> 00:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:14.630 --> 00:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
as you know looking at different ballot
 
00:56:19.910 --> 00:56:19.920 align:start position:0%
counting devices and we do a an audit of
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
those devices every ballot that's gone
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
through those devices after they've been
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
used so somebody can also have the
 
00:56:27.650 --> 00:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
option to request a recount if
 
00:56:29.569 --> 00:56:29.579 align:start position:0%
information comes out of that so there's
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
a fine timeline of when
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
um after an election and before the
 
00:56:36.670 --> 00:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
recount deadline for us to
 
00:56:40.790 --> 00:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
actually get audits done and the other
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
thing to someone else's point had asked
 
00:56:45.290 --> 00:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
about uh the fiscal note
 
00:56:48.770 --> 00:56:48.780 align:start position:0%
so we this um
 
00:56:50.930 --> 00:56:50.940 align:start position:0%
Bill had already been in effect but
 
00:56:54.650 --> 00:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
sunsetted and for that bill we purchased
 
00:56:57.230 --> 00:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
about a high span skin high speed
 
00:57:00.170 --> 00:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
scanner in order to perform that audit
 
00:57:01.910 --> 00:57:01.920 align:start position:0%
we still have that scanner which is
 
00:57:05.270 --> 00:57:05.280 align:start position:0%
great but there is an annual maintenance
 
00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
cost for that scanner of thirty seven
 
00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:09.660 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars whether you use it or
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
not and
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and then there is a ballot
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
programming fee of approximately two
 
00:57:18.829 --> 00:57:18.839 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars per ballot so that's
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
why you see a different cost in odd
 
00:57:22.970 --> 00:57:22.980 align:start position:0%
years versus even years
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal note
 
00:57:25.140 --> 00:57:26.210 align:start position:0%
on the fiscal note
yeah

00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh sorry Mr chairman do you have a
 
00:57:29.750 --> 00:57:29.760 align:start position:0%
question no I'm sorry I'm just appalled
 
00:57:30.890 --> 00:57:30.900 align:start position:0%
by those numbers
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
um that's I was I should have poker face
 
00:57:35.329 --> 00:57:35.339 align:start position:0%
a little better
 
00:57:35.339 --> 00:57:36.349 align:start position:0%
a little better
um

00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:39.170 --> 00:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
uh to the um Senators
 
00:57:42.710 --> 00:57:42.720 align:start position:0%
um point of the of the um the number of
 
00:57:44.690 --> 00:57:44.700 align:start position:0%
devices that we're counting poor per
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
town or city Ward when we had reviewed
 
00:57:49.609 --> 00:57:49.619 align:start position:0%
this for our 2022 elections in the
 
00:57:51.109 --> 00:57:51.119 align:start position:0%
post-election audits that we did we
 
00:57:53.750 --> 00:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
reviews this reviewed this with the AG's
 
00:57:55.730 --> 00:57:55.740 align:start position:0%
office and although we knew it was
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray's intent to just count one
 
00:58:00.290 --> 00:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
device the wording wasn't clear to us
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
that we could only just count one device
 
00:58:05.870 --> 00:58:05.880 align:start position:0%
in a polling location so just to make it
 
00:58:07.790 --> 00:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely clear about what the intent
 
00:58:09.950 --> 00:58:09.960 align:start position:0%
is we would like to add some language to
 
00:58:11.809 --> 00:58:11.819 align:start position:0%
line 26.
 
00:58:14.569 --> 00:58:14.579 align:start position:0%
that says and not more than one device
 
00:58:18.250 --> 00:58:18.260 align:start position:0%
from a town or city Ward
 
00:58:22.609 --> 00:58:22.619 align:start position:0%
and also to the sponsors point if when
 
00:58:25.430 --> 00:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
we arrive at noon if something were to
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
happen to that device that we
 
00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.910 align:start position:0%
happen to that device that we
um

00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:32.170 --> 00:58:32.180 align:start position:0%
that we had randomly selected to audit
 
00:58:35.329 --> 00:58:35.339 align:start position:0%
or if the ballots had been commingled
 
00:58:37.970 --> 00:58:37.980 align:start position:0%
into a box if say that machine had
 
00:58:39.349 --> 00:58:39.359 align:start position:0%
gotten full and another machine had
 
00:58:41.150 --> 00:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
gotten full and they co-mingled those
 
00:58:41.160 --> 00:58:42.470 align:start position:0%
gotten full and they co-mingled those
ballots

00:58:42.470 --> 00:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
um we would then count
 
00:58:47.569 --> 00:58:47.579 align:start position:0%
um do the audit on any of the commingled
 
00:58:50.030 --> 00:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
devices so we would expand that out to
 
00:58:52.130 --> 00:58:52.140 align:start position:0%
whatever devices had been commingled
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
together the point I believe of the 12
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
p.m on Election Day is just to not not
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
give anybody a heads up that they're
 
00:59:01.970 --> 00:59:01.980 align:start position:0%
going to be audited
 
00:59:04.490 --> 00:59:04.500 align:start position:0%
um let's see I think that
 
00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:06.119 align:start position:0%
is all that I have for you today I'm
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
happy to answer questions okay questions
 
00:59:11.930 --> 00:59:11.940 align:start position:0%
yes representative weary thank you Mr
 
00:59:16.970 --> 00:59:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:21.349 --> 00:59:21.359 align:start position:0%
uh so for the if you find a problem
 
00:59:24.530 --> 00:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
what's this Secretary of State's ought
 
00:59:28.010 --> 00:59:28.020 align:start position:0%
would you expand the audit in if there
 
00:59:30.770 --> 00:59:30.780 align:start position:0%
was a problem found so you know
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
traditionally if an audit
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
is performed in a sample is taken and
 
00:59:38.329 --> 00:59:38.339 align:start position:0%
you find issues generally audits are
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
expanded as as there been any thought
 
00:59:42.470 --> 00:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
along those lines
 
00:59:44.210 --> 00:59:44.220 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so if you're
 
00:59:47.089 --> 00:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
saying if what one device if with one
 
00:59:49.490 --> 00:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
device we find an issue would we expand
 
00:59:53.390 --> 00:59:53.400 align:start position:0%
our sample size is that your question
 
00:59:56.510 --> 00:59:56.520 align:start position:0%
um we have not encountered that
 
00:59:58.849 --> 00:59:58.859 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the locations only have one
 
01:00:01.430 --> 01:00:01.440 align:start position:0%
device so so would we expand our sample
 
01:00:02.829 --> 01:00:02.839 align:start position:0%
size Beyond
 
01:00:06.049 --> 01:00:06.059 align:start position:0%
a town that we're counting or is your
 
01:00:09.530 --> 01:00:09.540 align:start position:0%
question more towards if say a large
 
01:00:11.210 --> 01:00:11.220 align:start position:0%
polling location that has multiple
 
01:00:11.220 --> 01:00:14.630 align:start position:0%
polling location that has multiple
devices

01:00:14.630 --> 01:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.970 --> 01:00:16.980 align:start position:0%
so I think I think it can actually be
 
01:00:21.230 --> 01:00:21.240 align:start position:0%
two-fold in that you
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
if you find that there is a problem in a
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
particular Ward or town with multiple
 
01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:29.210 align:start position:0%
particular Ward or town with multiple
devices

01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
devices
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
um you know is there a systemic problem
 
01:00:36.710 --> 01:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
in that Locale or conversely is you know
 
01:00:39.289 --> 01:00:39.299 align:start position:0%
is there a systemic problem in a broader
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
range for similar devices that are
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the state so I think it's
 
01:00:47.870 --> 01:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
it's really to to both questions because
 
01:00:50.809 --> 01:00:50.819 align:start position:0%
the handling locally can be different
 
01:00:53.150 --> 01:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
that may have led to those issues or the
 
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:55.260 align:start position:0%
handling or the
 
01:00:57.710 --> 01:00:57.720 align:start position:0%
if there are if there are broader kind
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
of larger Regional Statewide issues that
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
may be a more systemic issue from LHS or
 
01:01:08.030 --> 01:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
whomever you know whatever system is
 
01:01:09.650 --> 01:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
handling that so
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
so thank you I think I think that's
 
01:01:14.750 --> 01:01:14.760 align:start position:0%
to your Quit Line of questioning I think
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why we do the
 
01:01:19.849 --> 01:01:19.859 align:start position:0%
audits is just to show the public that
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
they can have
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
um confidence in their elections if we
 
01:01:26.630 --> 01:01:26.640 align:start position:0%
were to encounter an issue that we could
 
01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:28.980 align:start position:0%
not easily explain like
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
the moderator comes to us and say oh you
 
01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:33.000 align:start position:0%
know what I think
 
01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.789 align:start position:0%
know what I think
I

01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:01:37.130 --> 01:01:37.140 align:start position:0%
did before you got there co-mingle
 
01:01:39.349 --> 01:01:39.359 align:start position:0%
ballots or something along those lines
 
01:01:40.910 --> 01:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
um if we cannot come up with an answer
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
then we would get the Attorney General's
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
office involved and have to figure it
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
out from there
 
01:01:46.319 --> 01:01:47.750 align:start position:0%
out from there
um

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:49.490 --> 01:01:49.500 align:start position:0%
we love it when the ages office gets
 
01:01:50.569 --> 01:01:50.579 align:start position:0%
involved representative you have a
 
01:01:50.579 --> 01:01:52.670 align:start position:0%
involved representative you have a
question

01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:01:56.390 --> 01:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
my question
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
going back to the fiscal note and the
 
01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
cost of the of conducting the audits
 
01:02:05.510 --> 01:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
using the the specific software that is
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
the 37 000 per year for the high-speed
 
01:02:10.490 --> 01:02:10.500 align:start position:0%
scanner software
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
with the new
 
01:02:14.750 --> 01:02:14.760 align:start position:0%
ballot counting machines that this
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office and ballot
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
commission are considering
 
01:02:18.420 --> 01:02:19.370 align:start position:0%
commission are considering
um

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
it's my understanding that they have
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
high-speed scanners within them and
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate software for scanning
 
01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:28.250 align:start position:0%
appropriate software for scanning
would

01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:02:30.650 --> 01:02:30.660 align:start position:0%
approving those devices and getting
 
01:02:34.910 --> 01:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
those devices online ASAP reduce the
 
01:02:38.329 --> 01:02:38.339 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact of the audit as we see
 
01:02:42.170 --> 01:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
here in this bill or is there an
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
additional would we be paying an
 
01:02:46.609 --> 01:02:46.619 align:start position:0%
additional cost for high-speed scan it
 
01:02:50.030 --> 01:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
scanning audits regardless
 
01:02:50.990 --> 01:02:51.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:02:53.690 --> 01:02:53.700 align:start position:0%
representative I I don't see
 
01:02:56.569 --> 01:02:56.579 align:start position:0%
unless the population were to change I
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
don't see the audit price changing
 
01:03:00.410 --> 01:03:00.420 align:start position:0%
whether you had
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
um one type of device or two type of
 
01:03:05.809 --> 01:03:05.819 align:start position:0%
device the the new ballot electronic
 
01:03:07.549 --> 01:03:07.559 align:start position:0%
ballot accounting devices that are being
 
01:03:09.890 --> 01:03:09.900 align:start position:0%
looked at do have the scanning
 
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:12.599 align:start position:0%
capability but none of the ones that we
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
are currently looking at
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
they are not they are not high speed
 
01:03:19.069 --> 01:03:19.079 align:start position:0%
scanners because we don't have big
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
Central locations where we high-seed
 
01:03:24.170 --> 01:03:24.180 align:start position:0%
scan all of our ballots so they're a
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
little bit different than the actual
 
01:03:28.370 --> 01:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
scanning machine that we use for our
 
01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.650 align:start position:0%
scanning machine that we use for our
audits

01:03:30.650 --> 01:03:30.660 align:start position:0%
audits
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up please yep thank you
 
01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:34.069 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up please yep thank you
um

01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:37.069 --> 01:03:37.079 align:start position:0%
the new machines they do scan those
 
01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
images and so
 
01:03:41.930 --> 01:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
um doing an audit based on those images
 
01:03:45.289 --> 01:03:45.299 align:start position:0%
scanned would that be less of a cost
 
01:03:48.109 --> 01:03:48.119 align:start position:0%
than using the high-speed scanners and
 
01:03:51.170 --> 01:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
be able to speed up the process even
 
01:03:53.809 --> 01:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
without using the high speed scanners
 
01:03:56.750 --> 01:03:56.760 align:start position:0%
great question I think depending on what
 
01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:57.710 align:start position:0%
great question I think depending on what
the

01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
um the rules of the audit are and how
 
01:04:03.650 --> 01:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
um who writes them and and how they're
 
01:04:06.530 --> 01:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
written it could possibly be less time
 
01:04:06.540 --> 01:04:08.930 align:start position:0%
written it could possibly be less time
and

01:04:08.930 --> 01:04:08.940 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:10.730 --> 01:04:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I don't think there'd be
 
01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:13.020 align:start position:0%
it would not be less expensive because
 
01:04:14.809 --> 01:04:14.819 align:start position:0%
you would still have to pay for the
 
01:04:18.349 --> 01:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
software and the reading of the ballot
 
01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
01:04:24.470 --> 01:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:04:25.789 --> 01:04:25.799 align:start position:0%
my call
 
01:04:25.799 --> 01:04:26.630 align:start position:0%
my call
um

01:04:26.630 --> 01:04:26.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:28.390 --> 01:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
because I haven't looked at the website
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
uh I'd like to ask the high-speed
 
01:04:33.770 --> 01:04:33.780 align:start position:0%
scanner that you refer to does it
 
01:04:36.490 --> 01:04:36.500 align:start position:0%
specify in the website the the
 
01:04:38.809 --> 01:04:38.819 align:start position:0%
manufacturer the model number and all
 
01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
that kind of information and uh
 
01:04:44.930 --> 01:04:44.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I believe in
 
01:04:47.150 --> 01:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
the report it does reference what it is
 
01:04:49.250 --> 01:04:49.260 align:start position:0%
I don't know if it does the model number
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
but it is a clear ballot high-speed
 
01:04:54.829 --> 01:04:54.839 align:start position:0%
scanning device clear ballot is the
 
01:04:56.270 --> 01:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but I can get you that
 
01:04:56.280 --> 01:04:58.970 align:start position:0%
manufacturer but I can get you that
information

01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:02.329 --> 01:05:02.339 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh follow up um this is
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
also specify the the software
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
um that's used to uh read the votes and
 
01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:13.260 align:start position:0%
uh the manufacturer and the or whoever
 
01:05:15.049 --> 01:05:15.059 align:start position:0%
is the company that publishes the
 
01:05:15.059 --> 01:05:16.609 align:start position:0%
is the company that publishes the
software

01:05:16.609 --> 01:05:16.619 align:start position:0%
software
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
thank you so clear ballot has their own
 
01:05:20.930 --> 01:05:20.940 align:start position:0%
software and proprietary it's not open
 
01:05:20.940 --> 01:05:22.430 align:start position:0%
software and proprietary it's not open
sourced

01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
sourced
 
01:05:24.589 --> 01:05:24.599 align:start position:0%
um all of the devices that we're looking
 
01:05:26.630 --> 01:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
at all of the
 
01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
devices that were looking ballot
 
01:05:30.289 --> 01:05:30.299 align:start position:0%
counting devices we're looking at are
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
proprietary software except for one
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
that's an open source software thank you
 
01:05:36.650 --> 01:05:36.660 align:start position:0%
okay and the deputy secretary is under
 
01:05:37.849 --> 01:05:37.859 align:start position:0%
time constraints so I'm gonna take one
 
01:05:39.470 --> 01:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
last question here representative
 
01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:40.730 align:start position:0%
last question here representative
Burnham

01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
Burnham
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Deputy
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
Hennessy I was wondering
 
01:05:48.530 --> 01:05:48.540 align:start position:0%
when the audit is being conducted it
 
01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:51.059 align:start position:0%
says in the public is that right next to
 
01:05:53.390 --> 01:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
where the machines are or is this in a
 
01:05:55.010 --> 01:05:55.020 align:start position:0%
different location open to the public
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
will they be transferring those ballots
 
01:06:00.650 --> 01:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
go to another location thank you for the
 
01:06:04.250 --> 01:06:04.260 align:start position:0%
question so the um when um noon comes
 
01:06:06.470 --> 01:06:06.480 align:start position:0%
around a person from the Secretary of
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
State's office is at the polling
 
01:06:10.130 --> 01:06:10.140 align:start position:0%
location to inform the moderator that
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
they are been luckily chosen to have an
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
audit done of their machine and we are
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
there until the close of polls when they
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
seal that box so we can see that no
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
ballots have been commingled the next
 
01:06:23.950 --> 01:06:23.960 align:start position:0%
morning the Secretary of State's office
 
01:06:26.510 --> 01:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
comes and picks up those
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
those boxes are box for that machine and
 
01:06:32.329 --> 01:06:32.339 align:start position:0%
the town signs them over to us on their
 
01:06:35.390 --> 01:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
logs they are then transferred to the
 
01:06:37.010 --> 01:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
archives building Secretary of State's
 
01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
archives building and the audits are
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
held at The Archives building I believe
 
01:06:42.770 --> 01:06:42.780 align:start position:0%
that's where we'll do them in the future
 
01:06:44.510 --> 01:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
it's worked out very well it's the same
 
01:06:46.490 --> 01:06:46.500 align:start position:0%
place if you've ever attended a recount
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
that's where we do our recounts as well
 
01:06:49.789 --> 01:06:49.799 align:start position:0%
and they are definitely open to the
 
01:06:49.799 --> 01:06:50.569 align:start position:0%
and they are definitely open to the
public

01:06:50.569 --> 01:06:50.579 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
okay thank you secretary I believe you I

on behalf of secure democracy secure
 
01:07:23.390 --> 01:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
democracy is a nonpartisan non-profit
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
organization that works to improve
 
01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:27.720 align:start position:0%
election integrity and ensure all
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%

01:07:32.690 --> 01:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
vote how they choose from the creation
 
01:07:34.370 --> 01:07:34.380 align:start position:0%
and printing of the ballots to the
 
01:07:36.109 --> 01:07:36.119 align:start position:0%
actual programming of the voting machine
 
01:07:39.410 --> 01:07:39.420 align:start position:0%
the voting process is a human process as
 
01:07:41.870 --> 01:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
a result human errors can cause mistakes
 
01:07:43.970 --> 01:07:43.980 align:start position:0%
in the tabulation process
 
01:07:46.309 --> 01:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
a post-election audit checks that the
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
voting equipment and procedures used to
 
01:07:50.450 --> 01:07:50.460 align:start position:0%
count votes function properly and that
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
the reported election outcome was
 
01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
correct additionally post-election
 
01:07:55.970 --> 01:07:55.980 align:start position:0%
audits are recommended by election
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
Security Experts as a method to protect
 
01:08:02.450 --> 01:08:02.460 align:start position:0%
election Integrity the 2023 report
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
issued by the New Hampshire special
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
committee on voter confidence found that
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
election audits increased voter
 
01:08:11.329 --> 01:08:11.339 align:start position:0%
confidence public comment from voters
 
01:08:13.130 --> 01:08:13.140 align:start position:0%
across the state showed that New
 
01:08:15.170 --> 01:08:15.180 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should have a robust audit
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
process this bill is a measured step to
 
01:08:20.630 --> 01:08:20.640 align:start position:0%
cultivating and implementing an audit
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
process that will increase voters trust
 
01:08:25.789 --> 01:08:25.799 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire electoral system we
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
see this as a practical Common Sense
 
01:08:29.930 --> 01:08:29.940 align:start position:0%
step forward for New Hampshire's
 
01:08:32.450 --> 01:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
electoral system secure democracy
 
01:08:34.849 --> 01:08:34.859 align:start position:0%
supports the bill and encourages all
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
members of the committee to support its
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
passage okay will you be taking
 
01:08:40.970 --> 01:08:40.980 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee I hope I'll
 
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
be able to answer them okay well we'll
 
01:08:43.970 --> 01:08:43.980 align:start position:0%
see if there are any
 
01:08:45.590 --> 01:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
it doesn't appear so you get you you
 
01:08:47.450 --> 01:08:47.460 align:start position:0%
answered every question that you were
 
01:08:50.269 --> 01:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
asked wonderfully thank you all
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
um next up is Mark lindman from
 
01:09:05.510 --> 01:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:07.550 --> 01:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
if you could press that uh button there
 
01:09:09.289 --> 01:09:09.299 align:start position:0%
there you go one more there you go I'm

um I have written testimony I'll
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
distribute it but I won't read it now
 
01:09:16.789 --> 01:09:16.799 align:start position:0%
um uh I'm Mark Lindemann I'm policy and
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
strategy director at verified voting and
 
01:09:21.709 --> 01:09:21.719 align:start position:0%
national uh non-partisan non-profit that
 
01:09:23.870 --> 01:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
basically works at the intersection of
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
technology and elections to make sure
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
that technology is used appropriately
 
01:09:29.870 --> 01:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
for Justified public confidence and
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
outcomes and some of you may know my
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
name from the Windham audit I was the
 
01:09:37.309 --> 01:09:37.319 align:start position:0%
town of windham's Representative to that
 
01:09:40.370 --> 01:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
audit team so I've spent a lot of
 
01:09:43.309 --> 01:09:43.319 align:start position:0%
quality time with both state and local
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
election officials here in New Hampshire
 
01:09:47.030 --> 01:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
and I really do feel like I have skin in
 
01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
the game
 
01:09:50.329 --> 01:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
I've also been working on routine
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
post-election audits like the one
 
01:09:56.750 --> 01:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
proposed here since 2007. so
 
01:09:58.970 --> 01:09:58.980 align:start position:0%
I know some stuff some of it may be
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
wrong to know what I want to emphasize
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
is that tabulation audits of the type
 
01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
we're describing here to check the
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
accuracy of votabulations
 
01:10:11.930 --> 01:10:11.940 align:start position:0%
ultimately always should refer back to
 
01:10:14.030 --> 01:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
paper ballots they should not rely on
 
01:10:16.189 --> 01:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
ballot images whether those ballot
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
images are captured by the original
 
01:10:21.669 --> 01:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
voting machine as we were discussing yes
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
or captured by a secondary scanner such
 
01:10:26.630 --> 01:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
as the clear ballot system we're
 
01:10:29.030 --> 01:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
describing in this why is that well
 
01:10:31.790 --> 01:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
plain and simple voters can verify their
 
01:10:34.490 --> 01:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
own ballots voters have no way to verify
 
01:10:38.890 --> 01:10:38.900 align:start position:0%
ballot images and in fact there is no
 
01:10:41.990 --> 01:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
authoritative reason to trust digital
 
01:10:44.209 --> 01:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
ballot images they are hardware and
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
software artifacts they can be erroneous
 
01:10:49.790 --> 01:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
in any number of ways potentially they
 
01:10:52.250 --> 01:10:52.260 align:start position:0%
could be subverted by malicious software
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
which could actually undetectably swap
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
votes in the images now I mean no I did
 
01:10:59.750 --> 01:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
not come here today to tell you that I
 
01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
think that's likely what I'm here to
 
01:11:04.189 --> 01:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
tell you today is that you should take
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
that question off the table by having
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
the audit refer back to individual
 
01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:10.130 align:start position:0%
the audit refer back to individual
ballots

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:10.140 align:start position:0%
ballots
 
01:11:13.010 --> 01:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
so the way I would go about doing that
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
uh the ideal way first of all is when
 
01:11:19.250 --> 01:11:19.260 align:start position:0%
the ballots are rescanned to imprint
 
01:11:21.050 --> 01:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
them in the margins with a serial number
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
and then you can authoritatively link
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
each ballot to how the audit system
 
01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:30.420 align:start position:0%
interpreted that ballot okay so uh
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative wary we're not really
 
01:11:34.370 --> 01:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
talking about a hand count here exactly
 
01:11:36.410 --> 01:11:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're talking about individual points of
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
comparison so in the bill as it comes to
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
you as I understand it the intention is
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
individual points of comparison between
 
01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080 align:start position:0%
the ballot images and how the audit
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
system interpreted those but since I
 
01:11:49.729 --> 01:11:49.739 align:start position:0%
don't want to refer to the ballot images
 
01:11:52.729 --> 01:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
I want to go back to the ballots I would
 
01:11:56.590 --> 01:11:56.600 align:start position:0%
suggest uh randomly sampling 100 ballots
 
01:11:58.970 --> 01:11:58.980 align:start position:0%
and seeing how the audit system
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
interpreted each of those
 
01:12:04.910 --> 01:12:04.920 align:start position:0%
um you can use the fixed sample size no
 
01:12:06.770 --> 01:12:06.780 align:start position:0%
matter how many ballots are rescanned
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
it's the same Principle as a national
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
public opinion poll of a thousand people
 
01:12:14.630 --> 01:12:14.640 align:start position:0%
having the same margin of error whether
 
01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
it's a national pool as I just said or
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's a up all of a mayoral
 
01:12:20.149 --> 01:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
contest from the margin of error really
 
01:12:21.770 --> 01:12:21.780 align:start position:0%
depends on the sample size right that's
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
the end and the N minus one all that
 
01:12:25.970 --> 01:12:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh so
 
01:12:29.570 --> 01:12:29.580 align:start position:0%
with that by limiting uh the check on
 
01:12:31.729 --> 01:12:31.739 align:start position:0%
the system to a hundred paper ballots
 
01:12:33.169 --> 01:12:33.179 align:start position:0%
first of all you're getting a more
 
01:12:35.750 --> 01:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
trustworthy uh check
 
01:12:37.669 --> 01:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
um second you're probably making
 
01:12:41.030 --> 01:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
yourself some time to uh scan it and
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
audit a few more machines because that's
 
01:12:45.130 --> 01:12:45.140 align:start position:0%
that sample does not have to increase
 
01:12:47.810 --> 01:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
and you also have a system that is
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
adaptable to hand counts and uh to other
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
machines that they come online I agree
 
01:12:55.070 --> 01:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
that this committee this legislature
 
01:12:57.649 --> 01:12:57.659 align:start position:0%
will be revisiting the audit statute but
 
01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
I don't think you have to uh pass a
 
01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
statute that's kind of used once and
 
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
throw away so I have other comments I'll
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
distribute them but those are my
 
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
highlights and I'm here if there are
 
01:13:07.739 --> 01:13:08.750 align:start position:0%
highlights and I'm here if there are
questions

01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:13:12.110 --> 01:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:14.270 --> 01:13:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Meerhead just with
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
respect thank you Mr chairs that just
 
01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
the respect to those other comments you
 
01:13:19.130 --> 01:13:19.140 align:start position:0%
will be sending us
 
01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:20.470 align:start position:0%
will be sending us
um

01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:23.750 --> 01:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
I I read the advice not to hand out the
 
01:13:25.130 --> 01:13:25.140 align:start position:0%
the testimony because people will be
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
reading it instead of listening so I'm
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
try I'm working really hard to be
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
engaging here especially representative
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
mirror has known for that you have a
 
01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:33.649 align:start position:0%
mirror has known for that you have a
follow-up

01:13:33.649 --> 01:13:33.659 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking just to note that I'm
 
01:13:37.070 --> 01:13:37.080 align:start position:0%
looking forward to reading those I'm
 
01:13:38.990 --> 01:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
sure you are
 
01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:40.669 align:start position:0%
sure you are
foreign

01:13:40.669 --> 01:13:40.679 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:13:46.010 --> 01:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
um last up is Liz Aya kabuchi did I get
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
that close
 
01:13:48.950 --> 01:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
uh we need to know what town you're from
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
Miss Ian kabuchi
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:59.209 --> 01:13:59.219 align:start position:0%
excellent what what town do you live in
 
01:14:06.970 --> 01:14:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
make sure you press that silver button
 
01:14:10.850 --> 01:14:10.860 align:start position:0%
in front of you there you go I
 
01:14:12.229 --> 01:14:12.239 align:start position:0%
I'll have written testimony that I'll
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
pass out afterward
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
um basically I just wanted to say that
 
01:14:18.169 --> 01:14:18.179 align:start position:0%
we are actually sensitive to the
 
01:14:20.390 --> 01:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
challenges of trying to audit elections
 
01:14:24.110 --> 01:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
here in the granite state you have lots
 
01:14:25.310 --> 01:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
and lots of individual small
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions so it's a different
 
01:14:29.689 --> 01:14:29.699 align:start position:0%
environment than in trying to audit in
 
01:14:31.370 --> 01:14:31.380 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
um but with that said we really do want
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
you to please include at least some
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
paper ballots as you're auditing you'll
 
01:14:41.810 --> 01:14:41.820 align:start position:0%
see in my handout that images can be
 
01:14:45.169 --> 01:14:45.179 align:start position:0%
hacked and as Mark said you don't want
 
01:14:48.410 --> 01:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
to introduce that uncertainty into a
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
process that's intended to reassure
 
01:14:51.649 --> 01:14:51.659 align:start position:0%
people about the validity of the
 
01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
election results
 
01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
um also I'm going to Echo the request to
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
eliminate the current references to
 
01:15:00.890 --> 01:15:00.900 align:start position:0%
accuvote and to broaden the spectrum of
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
what's covered again you don't want to
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
throw away statute that's you're already
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
beginning to use non-aggy vote machines
 
01:15:09.659 --> 01:15:10.310 align:start position:0%
beginning to use non-aggy vote machines
um

01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:12.290 --> 01:15:12.300 align:start position:0%
I would also like to ask that you
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
include the presidential primary in your
 
01:15:17.689 --> 01:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
scheme here we've been talking with
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
Federal uh yes we've been talking with
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
federal election security folks and they
 
01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:28.080 align:start position:0%
are actually warning us that um the 2024
 
01:15:31.130 --> 01:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
election is already a target of both
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
foreign and domestic interference and
 
01:15:35.870 --> 01:15:35.880 align:start position:0%
first in the nation primary
 
01:15:37.970 --> 01:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a responsibility to
 
01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:39.530 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has a responsibility to
produce

01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
produce
 
01:15:42.410 --> 01:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
trustworthy results and so I strongly
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
recommend that you extend this I know
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
it's a short turnaround time but I
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
strongly recommend that you audit the
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
presidential primary last one is I will
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
ask you suggest that you increase the
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
number of town or city Wards that's the
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
language currently in the bill you've
 
01:15:58.270 --> 01:15:58.280 align:start position:0%
got more than 300 polling places
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
234 municipalities if you're only
 
01:16:02.630 --> 01:16:02.640 align:start position:0%
auditing four that's not going to give
 
01:16:05.870 --> 01:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
folks very much confidence in the audit
 
01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:06.830 align:start position:0%
folks very much confidence in the audit
results

01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
results
 
01:16:08.209 --> 01:16:08.219 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take questions
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
representative you have a question
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
no okay uh no I think that's it
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
um representative what can you grab that
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
blue sheet for me um I don't have anyone
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
else signed up at least in pink cards
 
01:16:26.810 --> 01:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.010 --> 01:16:28.020 align:start position:0%
and then we are running a little bit
 
01:16:32.570 --> 01:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
because we've already had lunch as you
 
01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:38.750 align:start position:0%
because we've already had lunch as you
know

01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.930 --> 01:16:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:43.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
um there was one person signed up in
 
01:16:47.450 --> 01:16:47.460 align:start position:0%
support of who did not speak uh and with
 
01:16:49.970 --> 01:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
that I will close the
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
um public hearing on Senate Bill 158 I
 
01:16:55.430 --> 01:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
will immediately open up the public
 
01:16:59.930 --> 01:16:59.940 align:start position:0%
hearing on S B where is my list I think
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
it's 70 but I want to trust me
 
01:17:04.970 --> 01:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
157 I meant I meant to close 157 I mean
 
01:17:07.070 --> 01:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
to open 158 how about that
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
um we're opening up Senate Bill 158
 
01:17:16.310 --> 01:17:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:24.729 --> 01:17:24.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:31.070 --> 01:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:33.649 --> 01:17:33.659 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is James Gray I
 
01:17:36.649 --> 01:17:36.659 align:start position:0%
represent Senate District Six which just
 
01:17:39.649 --> 01:17:39.659 align:start position:0%
starts up in all gimmonton and goes down
 
01:17:42.229 --> 01:17:42.239 align:start position:0%
Route 11 into Rochester
 
01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:49.070 --> 01:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
um absentee powder a ballot outer
 
01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.390 align:start position:0%
um absentee powder a ballot outer
envelopes

01:17:50.390 --> 01:17:50.400 align:start position:0%
envelopes
 
01:17:53.209 --> 01:17:53.219 align:start position:0%
they're not needed except to put stamps
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
on and addresses on and we need to get
 
01:17:57.410 --> 01:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
rid of them
 
01:18:00.890 --> 01:18:00.900 align:start position:0%
if you go to the state of Maine they
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
have one envelope and they do their
 
01:18:05.810 --> 01:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
affidavits and they do their mailing
 
01:18:07.729 --> 01:18:07.739 align:start position:0%
addresses and they do all of that stuff
 
01:18:08.870 --> 01:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
in one
 
01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:10.310 align:start position:0%
in one
uh

01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:14.209 --> 01:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
the people who have fought this uh
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
particular legislation the hardest are
 
01:18:19.669 --> 01:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
the clerks saying that it's going to
 
01:18:21.250 --> 01:18:21.260 align:start position:0%
cause them
 
01:18:23.810 --> 01:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
amounts of time that they don't have
 
01:18:27.770 --> 01:18:27.780 align:start position:0%
when it comes to election day
 
01:18:31.630 --> 01:18:31.640 align:start position:0%
if a person comes in votes
 
01:18:34.850 --> 01:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
and doesn't need to put it in an outer
 
01:18:38.090 --> 01:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
envelope I kind of doubt that there's a
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
whole lot of extra time and it's going
 
01:18:42.350 --> 01:18:42.360 align:start position:0%
to take them to look and make sure that
 
01:18:44.290 --> 01:18:44.300 align:start position:0%
the affidavit is signed
 
01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
that the ones that are coming in in the
 
01:18:46.860 --> 01:18:47.689 align:start position:0%
that the ones that are coming in in the
mail

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:47.699 align:start position:0%
mail
 
01:18:52.570 --> 01:18:52.580 align:start position:0%
uh that if you mail one in
 
01:18:55.250 --> 01:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
the clerks should be able to open that
 
01:18:58.189 --> 01:18:58.199 align:start position:0%
outer envelope and then look at the
 
01:19:01.610 --> 01:19:01.620 align:start position:0%
affidavits to make sure it's signed if
 
01:19:03.890 --> 01:19:03.900 align:start position:0%
they were to wait until the last day
 
01:19:06.649 --> 01:19:06.659 align:start position:0%
before the election whether it's you're
 
01:19:09.530 --> 01:19:09.540 align:start position:0%
in Florida or wherever else there's not
 
01:19:11.209 --> 01:19:11.219 align:start position:0%
the ability that would have been there
 
01:19:13.030 --> 01:19:13.040 align:start position:0%
to cure
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
these same people are the ones that ask
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
us to do all the same things that we did
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
during covid when we allowed them to
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
open the auto envelopes on Saturday
 
01:19:27.649 --> 01:19:27.659 align:start position:0%
Sunday or Monday before the election and
 
01:19:30.290 --> 01:19:30.300 align:start position:0%
mark up the checklist
 
01:19:33.709 --> 01:19:33.719 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do it then it should
 
01:19:36.890 --> 01:19:36.900 align:start position:0%
be even easier to do if there's no outer
 
01:19:39.649 --> 01:19:39.659 align:start position:0%
envelope involved in the first place uh
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
the the outer envelope doesn't do
 
01:19:45.770 --> 01:19:45.780 align:start position:0%
anything right now the statute says that
 
01:19:47.990 --> 01:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know you'll maintain it in the outer
 
01:19:51.410 --> 01:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
envelope until election day and then the
 
01:19:54.770 --> 01:19:54.780 align:start position:0%
moderator starts the process and the
 
01:19:56.930 --> 01:19:56.940 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots he opens the outer
 
01:20:00.770 --> 01:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
level openspects them for Signature Etc
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh since we brought up signature there
 
01:20:07.130 --> 01:20:07.140 align:start position:0%
was Court decision that precludes Us in
 
01:20:10.430 --> 01:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from comparing signatures
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
on the application with the signature on
 
01:20:14.830 --> 01:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
the affidavit
 
01:20:17.990 --> 01:20:18.000 align:start position:0%
but that decision had two things in it
 
01:20:20.229 --> 01:20:20.239 align:start position:0%
it said that
 
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
you would be able to compare the
 
01:20:26.270 --> 01:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
signatures if there were a way to cure
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
in other words fix a mistake they didn't
 
01:20:32.810 --> 01:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
sign it they printed instead of signing
 
01:20:35.570 --> 01:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
they did whatever and the other thing
 
01:20:38.630 --> 01:20:38.640 align:start position:0%
that they wanted is that the people who
 
01:20:41.990 --> 01:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
were comparing the signature be trained
 
01:20:43.610 --> 01:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
um certainly the Secretary of State's
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
office has told me several times that
 
01:20:48.490 --> 01:20:48.500 align:start position:0%
they would provide the training
 
01:20:54.229 --> 01:20:54.239 align:start position:0%
and the last part is the ability to cure
 
01:20:56.330 --> 01:20:56.340 align:start position:0%
if they they're not in the outer
 
01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.370 align:start position:0%
if they they're not in the outer
envelope

01:20:57.370 --> 01:20:57.380 align:start position:0%
envelope
 
01:21:00.709 --> 01:21:00.719 align:start position:0%
certainly the clerks will be able to to
 
01:21:02.689 --> 01:21:02.699 align:start position:0%
at least look at the signatures to make
 
01:21:04.630 --> 01:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
sure it is signed
 
01:21:09.530 --> 01:21:09.540 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it says John James
 
01:21:13.070 --> 01:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
instead of Jane Doe that would be
 
01:21:15.229 --> 01:21:15.239 align:start position:0%
another reason that we right now we
 
01:21:18.610 --> 01:21:18.620 align:start position:0%
could reject it if it was the wrong name
 
01:21:21.290 --> 01:21:21.300 align:start position:0%
but with some of those signatures you
 
01:21:23.630 --> 01:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
can't tell one squiggly line from
 
01:21:26.630 --> 01:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
another squiggly line because a lot of
 
01:21:29.390 --> 01:21:29.400 align:start position:0%
our our students aren't taught in in
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
school anymore to uh to actually sign
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
anything they're taught how to make the
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
first initial I'm told and then a
 
01:21:39.470 --> 01:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
squiggle after that that kind of looks
 
01:21:42.130 --> 01:21:42.140 align:start position:0%
like something but again
 
01:21:45.410 --> 01:21:45.420 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this is to to take away
 
01:21:48.110 --> 01:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
work from the clerks to take away work
 
01:21:51.950 --> 01:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
from the others right now like I say
 
01:21:54.250 --> 01:21:54.260 align:start position:0%
that if
 
01:21:58.610 --> 01:21:58.620 align:start position:0%
you for some reason uh stuck at your
 
01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:01.560 align:start position:0%
ballot in an envelope it would not be
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
noticed until election day and there'd
 
01:22:08.149 --> 01:22:08.159 align:start position:0%
be no way for you to be notified to come
 
01:22:11.750 --> 01:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
back on Election Day so this would would
 
01:22:14.649 --> 01:22:14.659 align:start position:0%
do that would give the ability to cure
 
01:22:18.830 --> 01:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
and the only other thing that's really
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
missing from this uh that they had
 
01:22:25.130 --> 01:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
during the covid when they were doing
 
01:22:28.250 --> 01:22:28.260 align:start position:0%
the bounce is that they were allowed at
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
that point to uh to actually highlight
 
01:22:33.890 --> 01:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
sections of the checklist there's
 
01:22:35.990 --> 01:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
nothing in state law right now that says
 
01:22:38.229 --> 01:22:38.239 align:start position:0%
they couldn't highlight the checklist
 
01:22:40.370 --> 01:22:40.380 align:start position:0%
the only things they would not be
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
allowed to do and they were not allowed
 
01:22:45.890 --> 01:22:45.900 align:start position:0%
to do it during covid is put the red AV
 
01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:49.260 align:start position:0%
next to their name because that in state
 
01:22:51.310 --> 01:22:51.320 align:start position:0%
law says that they have already voted
 
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
and you would not be able to accept
 
01:22:56.750 --> 01:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
ballot if they came in and voted in
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
person which they are allowed to do
 
01:23:01.750 --> 01:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
especially during those first two hours
 
01:23:05.090 --> 01:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
when we we say you can't process your
 
01:23:08.330 --> 01:23:08.340 align:start position:0%
absentee balance until after that but if
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
you haven't processed it by the time
 
01:23:11.830 --> 01:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
somebody comes in
 
01:23:14.510 --> 01:23:14.520 align:start position:0%
and they decide they wanted to vote in
 
01:23:18.050 --> 01:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
person that is perfectly in fact it's
 
01:23:21.350 --> 01:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
the preferred thing to do but I'll be
 
01:23:23.870 --> 01:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
quiet and hopefully we'll get to onto
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
the next bill and I can get out and back
 
01:23:28.430 --> 01:23:28.440 align:start position:0%
to my committee can only be so lucky are
 
01:23:31.070 --> 01:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
there questions from the committee
 
01:23:32.810 --> 01:23:32.820 align:start position:0%
all right see look at that if you
 
01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
preface it with don't ask me questions
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
next up is Nash graze from Concord New
 
01:23:40.090 --> 01:23:40.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the New Hampshire
 
01:23:47.510 --> 01:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and it's crazy with
 
01:23:51.590 --> 01:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association we do support
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
Senate bill 158. it provides greater
 
01:23:57.050 --> 01:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
flexibility in processing absentee
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
ballots and we believe makes the process
 
01:24:00.590 --> 01:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
somewhat simpler
 
01:24:02.510 --> 01:24:02.520 align:start position:0%
because it eliminates the need to place
 
01:24:05.090 --> 01:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots a return to the clerk
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
in person in the outer Envelope as well
 
01:24:10.850 --> 01:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
as allows pre-processing of
 
01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:11.689 align:start position:0%
as allows pre-processing of
um

01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:13.850 --> 01:24:13.860 align:start position:0%
AKA opening the outer envelopes for
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
those that are actually mailed and this
 
01:24:18.350 --> 01:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
is something that our members have asked
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
uh us to support and we are supporting
 
01:24:23.149 --> 01:24:23.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions the
 
01:24:24.709 --> 01:24:24.719 align:start position:0%
committee may have questions from the
 
01:24:24.719 --> 01:24:26.270 align:start position:0%
committee may have questions from the
committee

01:24:26.270 --> 01:24:26.280 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:24:27.470 --> 01:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
all right we're trying to get cloud back
 
01:24:29.570 --> 01:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
up thank you Nate thank you
 
01:24:31.010 --> 01:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
Mr Graves I should say a little more
 
01:24:34.070 --> 01:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
formal uh last up Susan paschell from
 
01:24:35.390 --> 01:24:35.400 align:start position:0%
Concord New Hampshire with secure
 
01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:38.390 align:start position:0%
Concord New Hampshire with secure
democracy

01:24:38.390 --> 01:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:40.970 --> 01:24:40.980 align:start position:0%
hi again and thank you Susan paschell
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
from the DuPont group here for secure
 
01:24:45.890 --> 01:24:45.900 align:start position:0%
democracy I'll just read part of my
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
written statement so I'll even be
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
quicker than two minutes that is that to
 
01:24:53.149 --> 01:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
Echo what Senator gray said uh this will
 
01:24:55.729 --> 01:24:55.739 align:start position:0%
cut down on work for Clarks because
 
01:24:58.910 --> 01:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
during the 2020 presidential election 31
 
01:25:00.709 --> 01:25:00.719 align:start position:0%
percent of total votes cast in New
 
01:25:02.630 --> 01:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire were cast through an absentee
 
01:25:06.470 --> 01:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
ballot over 250 000 voters equates to a
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
significant amount of administrative
 
01:25:10.550 --> 01:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
electoral work for Town and City Clerks
 
01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.020 align:start position:0%
particularly in smaller localities that
 
01:25:14.630 --> 01:25:14.640 align:start position:0%
may only have a small staff and
 
01:25:16.090 --> 01:25:16.100 align:start position:0%
volunteer pool
 
01:25:19.070 --> 01:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 158 is a practical and
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible method to make
 
01:25:23.990 --> 01:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
processing absentee bad balance faster
 
01:25:26.810 --> 01:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
and more efficient we strongly urge you
 
01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
to pass this bill
 
01:25:30.830 --> 01:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay will you be taking questions I will
 
01:25:32.930 --> 01:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
I will try Okay are there any questions
 
01:25:34.250 --> 01:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
and there you go you did it uh I don't
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
have anyone else sign up to speak uh
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
representative gray I almost called you
 
01:25:42.590 --> 01:25:42.600 align:start position:0%
I mean gray representative wood
 
01:25:44.689 --> 01:25:44.699 align:start position:0%
um if you could grab that uh blue sheet
 
01:25:52.810 --> 01:25:52.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
almost back on time thank you all right
 
01:25:59.510 --> 01:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
uh there were two people uh signed up in
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
favor who did not speak uh and with that
 
01:26:03.530 --> 01:26:03.540 align:start position:0%
I will close the public hearing on SB
 
01:26:05.689 --> 01:26:05.699 align:start position:0%
158 the committee will stand in recess
 
01:26:07.790 --> 01:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
for about four minutes until uh 2 30
 
01:28:09.410 --> 01:28:09.420 align:start position:0%

01:30:09.050 --> 01:30:09.060 align:start position:0%
okay it's 2 30.

01:31:13.729 --> 01:31:13.739 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire primary is important
 
01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
for several reasons and not just for the
 
01:31:18.050 --> 01:31:18.060 align:start position:0%
health of our state New Hampshire voters
 
01:31:19.910 --> 01:31:19.920 align:start position:0%

winning in New Hampshire or having a

candidates secure their party's
 
01:31:34.430 --> 01:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
nomination but a poor showing in New
 
01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:36.120 align:start position:0%

um so I am going to enforce a time limit
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
I think there's well over a dozen
 
02:00:40.729 --> 02:00:40.739 align:start position:0%
um so we are going to limit testimony to
 
02:00:42.890 --> 02:00:42.900 align:start position:0%
three minutes peace including Senator
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%

have to apply that to you but don't be
 
02:00:51.709 --> 02:00:51.719 align:start position:0%
mad at me be mad at the person who's not
 
02:00:54.229 --> 02:00:54.239 align:start position:0%
here it's way easier to blame her
 
02:00:57.470 --> 02:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm ready
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
um my name is James Gray I'm a senator
 
02:01:02.030 --> 02:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
from District Six which starts up in
 
02:01:04.490 --> 02:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
Alton goingson goes down Route 11 to
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh this bill has back again
 
02:01:09.599 --> 02:01:10.330 align:start position:0%
Rochester uh this bill has back again
um

02:01:10.330 --> 02:01:10.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:13.550 --> 02:01:13.560 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of what was written
 
02:01:13.560 --> 02:01:14.709 align:start position:0%
the interpretation of what was written
before

02:01:14.709 --> 02:01:14.719 align:start position:0%
before
 
02:01:18.070 --> 02:01:18.080 align:start position:0%
had a lot more computer work in there
 
02:01:22.010 --> 02:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
what's envisioned is that a person will
 
02:01:23.810 --> 02:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
be able to go to the portal they'll be
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
able to request a name change and
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
address change a
 
02:01:32.450 --> 02:01:32.460 align:start position:0%
whatever else party affiliation change
 
02:01:35.390 --> 02:01:35.400 align:start position:0%
Etc and then that information through
 
02:01:38.390 --> 02:01:38.400 align:start position:0%
election net or its successor will be
 
02:01:42.290 --> 02:01:42.300 align:start position:0%
transferred to the uh Clerk or the
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist and they
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
will be able to assist you in in
 
02:01:49.850 --> 02:01:49.860 align:start position:0%
accomplishing that certainly the vision
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
for the future is that if you're
 
02:01:55.010 --> 02:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
standing there in line uh waiting to
 
02:01:55.020 --> 02:01:55.930 align:start position:0%

02:02:00.649 --> 02:02:00.659 align:start position:0%
that in some distant distant you know
 
02:02:03.410 --> 02:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
not even thought of yet that you'd be
 
02:02:05.510 --> 02:02:05.520 align:start position:0%
able to electronically fill out the form
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
hit a button when you get up there you'd
 
02:02:10.850 --> 02:02:10.860 align:start position:0%
say oh I just sent this and it gave me
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%

good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
02:03:17.570 --> 02:03:17.580 align:start position:0%
house election law
 
02:03:20.689 --> 02:03:20.699 align:start position:0%
I'm Linda Bundy and I'm from Antrim I
 
02:03:23.990 --> 02:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
support sb70 and election information
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
portal and will provide others with
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
voters with increased accessibility to
 
02:03:32.390 --> 02:03:32.400 align:start position:0%
the registration process and updating of
 
02:03:32.400 --> 02:03:33.830 align:start position:0%
the registration process and updating of
information

02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
information
 
02:03:37.189 --> 02:03:37.199 align:start position:0%
residents of Rural and low socioeconomic
 
02:03:39.950 --> 02:03:39.960 align:start position:0%
communities as well as individuals with
 
02:03:41.930 --> 02:03:41.940 align:start position:0%
medical conditions or physical
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
disabilities face specific challenges to
 
02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:46.729 align:start position:0%
disabilities face specific challenges to
registration

02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
being able to submit an application
 
02:03:52.149 --> 02:03:52.159 align:start position:0%
electronically at their own convenience
 
02:03:55.729 --> 02:03:55.739 align:start position:0%
mitigates those obstacles
 
02:03:57.770 --> 02:03:57.780 align:start position:0%
making it easier to register before
 
02:04:00.350 --> 02:04:00.360 align:start position:0%
election day can reduce long lines and
 
02:04:02.870 --> 02:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
waiting at the polls I have worked at
 
02:04:05.209 --> 02:04:05.219 align:start position:0%
the past three elections as a ballot
 
02:04:07.729 --> 02:04:07.739 align:start position:0%
Clerk and I can see the benefits of the
 
02:04:10.850 --> 02:04:10.860 align:start position:0%
portal based on my experience
 
02:04:13.250 --> 02:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
and election information portal will
 
02:04:15.410 --> 02:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
increase the efficiency of the work of
 
02:04:17.330 --> 02:04:17.340 align:start position:0%
the supervisors of the checklists
 
02:04:19.970 --> 02:04:19.980 align:start position:0%
elimination of a physical paper document
 
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
will reduce errors due to handwriting
 
02:04:25.669 --> 02:04:25.679 align:start position:0%
data entry or missing information and
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
remove the additional step of having to
 
02:04:30.830 --> 02:04:30.840 align:start position:0%
spend time inputting information into
 
02:04:32.209 --> 02:04:32.219 align:start position:0%
the system
 
02:04:34.550 --> 02:04:34.560 align:start position:0%
the local municipal clerk will still
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
verify that the information provided is
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
accurate and meets all requirements
 
02:04:42.169 --> 02:04:42.179 align:start position:0%
prior to registration
 
02:04:45.109 --> 02:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
the reduction in printing mailing and
 
02:04:47.450 --> 02:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
staff time will reduce costs for the
 
02:04:49.550 --> 02:04:49.560 align:start position:0%
local municipality
 
02:04:51.649 --> 02:04:51.659 align:start position:0%
many members of the public who testified
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
before the special committee on voter
 
02:04:56.209 --> 02:04:56.219 align:start position:0%
confidence cited the importance of
 
02:04:59.209 --> 02:04:59.219 align:start position:0%
modernizing our elections and in its
 
02:05:01.550 --> 02:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
final report the committee said there is
 
02:05:04.010 --> 02:05:04.020 align:start position:0%
a need to have updated checklist
 
02:05:06.830 --> 02:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
verification an election information
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
portal would be an important improvement
 
02:05:11.390 --> 02:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
in our elections that will increase
 
02:05:14.390 --> 02:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
accessibility and accuracy while
 
02:05:17.390 --> 02:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
maintaining security and integrity
 
02:05:19.669 --> 02:05:19.679 align:start position:0%
now is the right time to make the
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
sensible step forward of establishing an
 
02:05:25.430 --> 02:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
election information portal I ask that
 
02:05:27.770 --> 02:05:27.780 align:start position:0%
the committee vote ought to pass on SB
 
02:05:30.950 --> 02:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
70. thank you for your time will you be
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%

good afternoon chairman Berry committee
 
02:05:52.070 --> 02:05:52.080 align:start position:0%
members thank you so much for your time
 
02:05:57.350 --> 02:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
today uh I too am in support of sb70 uh
 
02:05:59.270 --> 02:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
I am very pleased to see this portal
 
02:06:01.129 --> 02:06:01.139 align:start position:0%
making its way through our legislator
 
02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:04.500 align:start position:0%
this Tuesday it's going to allow uh for
 
02:06:07.129 --> 02:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
creation of a new voter application uh
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
requesting an absentee ballot an
 
02:06:13.070 --> 02:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
updating of demographic information
 
02:06:16.430 --> 02:06:16.440 align:start position:0%
the portal will also allow our voter
 
02:06:19.310 --> 02:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
roles to remain current with up-to-date
 
02:06:21.890 --> 02:06:21.900 align:start position:0%
information and allow for less of a
 
02:06:25.370 --> 02:06:25.380 align:start position:0%
burden on our town clerks I am a ballot
 
02:06:27.850 --> 02:06:27.860 align:start position:0%
Clerk and have been for several years
 
02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
and I am witness to the great deal of
 
02:06:31.619 --> 02:06:33.109 align:start position:0%
and I am witness to the great deal of
lines

02:06:33.109 --> 02:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
lines
 
02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
um at the polls to provide updated
 
02:06:38.689 --> 02:06:38.699 align:start position:0%
information this allows that to be done
 
02:06:42.950 --> 02:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
ahead of time but does not sacrifice the
 
02:06:45.370 --> 02:06:45.380 align:start position:0%
requirement of any form of identity
 
02:06:48.830 --> 02:06:48.840 align:start position:0%
confirmation so we are not
 
02:06:48.840 --> 02:06:49.629 align:start position:0%
confirmation so we are not
um

02:06:49.629 --> 02:06:49.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:52.850 --> 02:06:52.860 align:start position:0%
compromising that integrity
 
02:06:56.629 --> 02:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
today 40 States in Washington DC use
 
02:06:59.209 --> 02:06:59.219 align:start position:0%
portals they describe a significant
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
reduction in omitted information and
 
02:07:04.070 --> 02:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
paper forms
 
02:07:08.149 --> 02:07:08.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire spends 1.5 million dollars
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
to 4 million dollars depending on the
 
02:07:14.030 --> 02:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
election year to process paper forms
 
02:07:16.370 --> 02:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
this bill is a common sense step towards
 
02:07:19.250 --> 02:07:19.260 align:start position:0%
making our elections more efficient we
 
02:07:21.229 --> 02:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
should be working to make voting as
 
02:07:24.050 --> 02:07:24.060 align:start position:0%
accessible as possible for voters to
 
02:07:27.290 --> 02:07:27.300 align:start position:0%
have their turn in participation in
 
02:07:29.510 --> 02:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
their democracy and this moves the ball
 
02:07:30.890 --> 02:07:30.900 align:start position:0%
forward a bit
 
02:07:32.570 --> 02:07:32.580 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
02:07:34.729 --> 02:07:34.739 align:start position:0%
um it's a modest cost it's under a half
 
02:07:37.490 --> 02:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh nationally it's
 
02:07:40.310 --> 02:07:40.320 align:start position:0%
reported between 250 000 and 600
 
02:07:43.490 --> 02:07:43.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is the cost to
 
02:07:45.950 --> 02:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
implement the portal and we're right
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
about in the middle of that so
 
02:07:50.510 --> 02:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
um we seem to be in in a better place
 
02:07:53.510 --> 02:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
than last year's estimate the municipal
 
02:07:56.810 --> 02:07:56.820 align:start position:0%
Savings of a large portion of the 10
 
02:07:59.209 --> 02:07:59.219 align:start position:0%
million dollars in paper processing that
 
02:08:02.330 --> 02:08:02.340 align:start position:0%
we've spent since 2014 seems to be
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
making that a very well investment
 
02:08:10.550 --> 02:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:14.510 --> 02:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
a significant uh relief
 
02:08:14.520 --> 02:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
a significant uh relief
to

02:08:15.830 --> 02:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:19.189 --> 02:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
election officials it is a significant
 
02:08:22.010 --> 02:08:22.020 align:start position:0%
Improvement in data Integrity of our
 
02:08:25.550 --> 02:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
voter rolls so I would strongly urge you
 
02:08:27.649 --> 02:08:27.659 align:start position:0%
to support this
 
02:08:28.810 --> 02:08:28.820 align:start position:0%
ought to pass
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%

02:10:28.970 --> 02:10:28.980 align:start position:0%
process to update our roles voting rules
 
02:10:32.410 --> 02:10:32.420 align:start position:0%
holes and would increase efficiency
 
02:10:35.770 --> 02:10:35.780 align:start position:0%
while still honoring the New Hampshire
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
tradition the valued tradition of having
 
02:10:42.350 --> 02:10:42.360 align:start position:0%
local officials be the final
 
02:10:44.689 --> 02:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
determinants of who's qualified to vote
 
02:10:47.330 --> 02:10:47.340 align:start position:0%
I think that's a really important aspect
 
02:10:48.729 --> 02:10:48.739 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:10:53.689 --> 02:10:53.699 align:start position:0%
I just want to say that my husband now
 
02:10:58.030 --> 02:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
retired is a physician and
 
02:11:02.450 --> 02:11:02.460 align:start position:0%
his handwriting is terrible really awful
 
02:11:05.330 --> 02:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
and in the early days all the
 
02:11:09.189 --> 02:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
prescriptions were handwritten and as
 
02:11:11.390 --> 02:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records were
 
02:11:15.050 --> 02:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
developed those got transferred into an
 
02:11:17.050 --> 02:11:17.060 align:start position:0%
electronic format
 
02:11:20.870 --> 02:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
Studies have shown that there have been
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
up to 35 40 percent reduction in errors
 
02:11:29.089 --> 02:11:29.099 align:start position:0%
for prescriptions since the adoption of
 
02:11:32.270 --> 02:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
electronic medical records so if you saw
 
02:11:34.310 --> 02:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
my husband's handwriting you would
 
02:11:36.050 --> 02:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
understand how that is a possible
 
02:11:38.390 --> 02:11:38.400 align:start position:0%
statistic so
 
02:11:41.570 --> 02:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I've also attended a good number of
 
02:11:43.490 --> 02:11:43.500 align:start position:0%
Supervisors of the checklist meetings
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
and have seen where they've had to hold
 
02:11:50.149 --> 02:11:50.159 align:start position:0%
up and pass around a registration to
 
02:11:54.410 --> 02:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
determine is that a j or a k or is this
 
02:11:57.430 --> 02:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
named Maria or Marin
 
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes also having to go back
 
02:12:00.900 --> 02:12:02.830 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes also having to go back
into

02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
into
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
electionnet to update information that's
 
02:12:09.109 --> 02:12:09.119 align:start position:0%
already there and what is a very time
 
02:12:11.629 --> 02:12:11.639 align:start position:0%
consuming process so if people are
 
02:12:14.649 --> 02:12:14.659 align:start position:0%
entering their own information correctly
 
02:12:19.910 --> 02:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
that will greatly reduce errors and so
 
02:12:23.390 --> 02:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
is another reason why I believe that
 
02:12:26.870 --> 02:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
this this is a very strong bill that
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
gives us time to see you know it's a
 
02:12:33.290 --> 02:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
step forward as Senator gray said and
 
02:12:35.390 --> 02:12:35.400 align:start position:0%
and so for that reason I urge out to
 
02:12:37.189 --> 02:12:37.199 align:start position:0%
pass okay will you be taking questions
 
02:12:38.930 --> 02:12:38.940 align:start position:0%
from the committee sure another
 
02:12:40.790 --> 02:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee all right
 
02:12:42.229 --> 02:12:42.239 align:start position:0%
easy enough thank you thanks so much
 
02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
next up Sue
 
02:12:49.490 --> 02:12:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:51.470 --> 02:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't even close all right from
 
02:12:59.750 --> 02:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
all right well thank you uh chair Ross
 
02:13:06.050 --> 02:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
Berry the election law committee and
 
02:13:09.109 --> 02:13:09.119 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for being the prime sponsor
 
02:13:13.250 --> 02:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
of the bill SB 70. as a voter learning
 
02:13:16.370 --> 02:13:16.380 align:start position:0%
of sb70 and what the bill would do if it
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
became law my my reaction is yes what a
 
02:13:22.790 --> 02:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
great idea to be able to adjust a home
 
02:13:25.970 --> 02:13:25.980 align:start position:0%
or a domicile or a mailing address
 
02:13:29.930 --> 02:13:29.940 align:start position:0%
or a party affiliation plus request an
 
02:13:31.550 --> 02:13:31.560 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
02:13:33.770 --> 02:13:33.780 align:start position:0%
a new neighbor with hours difficult to
 
02:13:36.290 --> 02:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
go to town hall can start the voter
 
02:13:38.149 --> 02:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
application online
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
again as a voter and and they'll retired
 
02:13:43.250 --> 02:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
I always have to check what are the
 
02:13:45.109 --> 02:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
current Town Hall hours
 
02:13:47.450 --> 02:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
of course you realize that during covid
 
02:13:50.450 --> 02:13:50.460 align:start position:0%
and the ease of guidelines hours kept
 
02:13:53.330 --> 02:13:53.340 align:start position:0%
changing at different town halls
 
02:13:55.370 --> 02:13:55.380 align:start position:0%
but you know at least parking is always
 
02:13:57.109 --> 02:13:57.119 align:start position:0%
easy in Rollinsford
 
02:14:01.609 --> 02:14:01.619 align:start position:0%
but a nearby Dover can be limited
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
second I'm one of the three supervisors
 
02:14:07.370 --> 02:14:07.380 align:start position:0%
of the checklist for Rollinsford love
 
02:14:10.550 --> 02:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
the job the work involved and I look at
 
02:14:13.609 --> 02:14:13.619 align:start position:0%
the duties to service the voters on an
 
02:14:15.530 --> 02:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
election day plus keeping the towns
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
checklist of Voters accurate throughout
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
the year as rewarding
 
02:14:23.089 --> 02:14:23.099 align:start position:0%
staying current with policies and
 
02:14:25.850 --> 02:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
whatever changes we are told by Trisha
 
02:14:28.970 --> 02:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
of the Secretary of State's office we
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
learn adjust and know as part of the
 
02:14:33.950 --> 02:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
supervisor's job
 
02:14:36.589 --> 02:14:36.599 align:start position:0%
earlier in my work life I've serve as
 
02:14:39.410 --> 02:14:39.420 align:start position:0%
the public maybe in retail or a medical
 
02:14:39.420 --> 02:14:40.810 align:start position:0%
the public maybe in retail or a medical
practice

02:14:40.810 --> 02:14:40.820 align:start position:0%
practice
 
02:14:45.050 --> 02:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
and it's a good advantage to you know be
 
02:14:46.750 --> 02:14:46.760 align:start position:0%
used to
 
02:14:49.490 --> 02:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
servicing the public being able to speak
 
02:14:52.609 --> 02:14:52.619 align:start position:0%
to the public and I also looked at as
 
02:14:52.619 --> 02:14:53.830 align:start position:0%
to the public and I also looked at as
being

02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
being
 
02:14:56.810 --> 02:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
can be lapped over even to be
 
02:14:56.820 --> 02:14:58.550 align:start position:0%
can be lapped over even to be
nonpartisan

02:14:58.550 --> 02:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan
 
02:15:00.709 --> 02:15:00.719 align:start position:0%
as a supervisor
 
02:15:05.569 --> 02:15:05.579 align:start position:0%
I see advantage to SB 70. a new voter or
 
02:15:08.149 --> 02:15:08.159 align:start position:0%
a voter change in an address or changing
 
02:15:11.450 --> 02:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
their last name there is flexibility and
 
02:15:14.270 --> 02:15:14.280 align:start position:0%
ease for the voter Plus for supervisors
 
02:15:16.129 --> 02:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
reading penmanship
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
has been a challenge
 
02:15:20.990 --> 02:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
time has been used to make Corrections
 
02:15:23.510 --> 02:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
due to a spelling error which then
 
02:15:26.510 --> 02:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
causes a combining of files Within
 
02:15:30.050 --> 02:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
electionnet for example there can be a
 
02:15:34.609 --> 02:15:34.619 align:start position:0%
file of Jack and another file of jock
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
and then learn it's the same voter
 
02:15:41.330 --> 02:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
so this is like a combining deleting
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
files and
 
02:15:45.410 --> 02:15:45.420 align:start position:0%
can be interesting
 
02:15:45.420 --> 02:15:46.250 align:start position:0%
can be interesting
um

02:15:46.250 --> 02:15:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:50.149 --> 02:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
third as illegal mem voters member I
 
02:15:52.129 --> 02:15:52.139 align:start position:0%
support sb70.
 
02:15:55.069 --> 02:15:55.079 align:start position:0%
an election information portal supports
 
02:15:58.550 --> 02:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
voter registration which supports voters
 
02:16:00.609 --> 02:16:00.619 align:start position:0%
casting their ballot on Election Day
 
02:16:03.830 --> 02:16:03.840 align:start position:0%
this increases flexibility and ease for
 
02:16:08.030 --> 02:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
voting and also an encouragement to vote
 
02:16:10.850 --> 02:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
the league is nonpartisan and the lead
 
02:16:13.490 --> 02:16:13.500 align:start position:0%
educates the public on a nonpartisan
 
02:16:13.500 --> 02:16:14.629 align:start position:0%
educates the public on a nonpartisan
basis

02:16:14.629 --> 02:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:16:17.569 --> 02:16:17.579 align:start position:0%
the more voters are informed and with
 
02:16:21.010 --> 02:16:21.020 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they have adjusted online
 
02:16:24.290 --> 02:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
their status all the better on Election
 
02:16:24.300 --> 02:16:25.669 align:start position:0%
their status all the better on Election
Day

02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
Day
 
02:16:28.430 --> 02:16:28.440 align:start position:0%
happy please voter excellent you nailed

thank you for this opportunity to speak
 
02:17:11.810 --> 02:17:11.820 align:start position:0%
to this bill I've been doing this oh
 
02:17:13.969 --> 02:17:13.979 align:start position:0%
sorry Liz tantarelli president of the
 
02:17:15.490 --> 02:17:15.500 align:start position:0%
League of Women Voters of New Hampshire
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
and I've been testifying on in favor of
 
02:17:21.110 --> 02:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
this bill for the last three years when
 
02:17:23.690 --> 02:17:23.700 align:start position:0%
Senator gray first introduced it in his
 
02:17:26.629 --> 02:17:26.639 align:start position:0%
committee I publicly stated you're my
 
02:17:28.129 --> 02:17:28.139 align:start position:0%
new BFF
 
02:17:30.709 --> 02:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
to my eternal embarrassment since then
 
02:17:33.230 --> 02:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
but you know I'm glad that I've lived
 
02:17:35.690 --> 02:17:35.700 align:start position:0%
long enough to be in the 21st century
 
02:17:37.790 --> 02:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
and this bill brings voting rights into
 
02:17:39.770 --> 02:17:39.780 align:start position:0%
the 21st century
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
my written testimony references two
 
02:17:44.929 --> 02:17:44.939 align:start position:0%
reports one by the Brennan Center one by
 
02:17:48.169 --> 02:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
the legal defense fund that this kind of
 
02:17:50.570 --> 02:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
information portal will in the long run
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
save money and the ballot clerks and
 
02:17:56.209 --> 02:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
supervisors who have testified have
 
02:17:58.250 --> 02:17:58.260 align:start position:0%
indicated that already
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
at last count that I could find there
 
02:18:03.650 --> 02:18:03.660 align:start position:0%
are only eight states that don't do some
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
form of online voter registration so
 
02:18:08.810 --> 02:18:08.820 align:start position:0%
it's about time we join the rest of the
 
02:18:08.820 --> 02:18:09.770 align:start position:0%
it's about time we join the rest of the
country

02:18:09.770 --> 02:18:09.780 align:start position:0%
country
 
02:18:12.169 --> 02:18:12.179 align:start position:0%
when we talk to younger people about
 
02:18:15.110 --> 02:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
voting they sometimes look at me very
 
02:18:18.770 --> 02:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
peculiar peculiarly when I say you have
 
02:18:21.070 --> 02:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
to do this at your town clerk's office
 
02:18:23.929 --> 02:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
like why should they do that the rest of
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
their lives are online why would they do
 
02:18:29.450 --> 02:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
that and people scoff when I say go to
 
02:18:31.129 --> 02:18:31.139 align:start position:0%
your town clerk's office and they say
 
02:18:33.889 --> 02:18:33.899 align:start position:0%
they're open eight minutes a week now I
 
02:18:36.009 --> 02:18:36.019 align:start position:0%
realize that's an exaggeration
 
02:18:39.169 --> 02:18:39.179 align:start position:0%
but it does indicate that for some
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
voters it's just not convenient to
 
02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
register that way to go there and do a
 
02:18:47.629 --> 02:18:47.639 align:start position:0%
simple change of address and so on
 
02:18:50.570 --> 02:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
so it is for those reasons that I
 
02:18:52.849 --> 02:18:52.859 align:start position:0%
strongly support this bill it will help
 
02:18:56.270 --> 02:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
us in our work to empower voters and I
 
02:18:58.310 --> 02:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
urge you to support it I will take
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any are there any
 
02:19:01.730 --> 02:19:01.740 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee you
 
02:19:06.110 --> 02:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
preempted me all right thank you next up
 
02:19:08.450 --> 02:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
nature Grays with the from Concord New
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire with the New Hampshire
 
02:19:14.389 --> 02:19:14.399 align:start position:0%

02:19:21.230 --> 02:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
support this bill uh we love bills that
 
02:19:23.570 --> 02:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
try to make voting processes simpler and
 
02:19:25.370 --> 02:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
more efficient I think the rest of my
 
02:19:26.929 --> 02:19:26.939 align:start position:0%
testimony would be repetitive of what
 
02:19:28.310 --> 02:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
you've already heard so I'm happy to
 
02:19:30.469 --> 02:19:30.479 align:start position:0%
take any questions if committee has some
 
02:19:32.810 --> 02:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
okay let's see everybody take notes this
 
02:19:33.950 --> 02:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
is how I know
 
02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%

02:19:35.519 --> 02:19:37.070 align:start position:0%
um doesn't have any questions for the
committee

02:19:37.070 --> 02:19:37.080 align:start position:0%

it all right thank you thank you Mr
 
02:19:56.750 --> 02:19:56.760 align:start position:0%

02:20:03.710 --> 02:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
democracy and we strongly support this
 
02:20:05.450 --> 02:20:05.460 align:start position:0%
bill I won't repeat all the points
 
02:20:07.670 --> 02:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
you've heard before but I'll just cover
 
02:20:10.250 --> 02:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
a few creating this information portal
 
02:20:11.870 --> 02:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
will help voters in local election
 
02:20:14.570 --> 02:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
administrators as you've heard at its
 
02:20:17.030 --> 02:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
core the online information portal
 
02:20:19.190 --> 02:20:19.200 align:start position:0%
simply permits eligible residents to
 
02:20:21.010 --> 02:20:21.020 align:start position:0%
fill out and submit an application
 
02:20:23.450 --> 02:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
electronically it'll improve election
 
02:20:25.670 --> 02:20:25.680 align:start position:0%
Integrity by helping New Hampshire keep
 
02:20:28.310 --> 02:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
more accurate voting roles being able to
 
02:20:30.050 --> 02:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
submit applications online would
 
02:20:31.969 --> 02:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
increase accuracy of the voter checklist
 
02:20:34.730 --> 02:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
because it becomes more convenient for a
 
02:20:37.130 --> 02:20:37.140 align:start position:0%
voter to update so we see it as a
 
02:20:38.929 --> 02:20:38.939 align:start position:0%
practical step forward for New
 
02:20:40.969 --> 02:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's electoral system and we hope
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
you will vote up to pass thanks for your
 
02:20:44.990 --> 02:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
consideration will you be taking
 
02:20:47.750 --> 02:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
questions no okay that's easy enough all
 
02:20:50.510 --> 02:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
right next up is Sarah Lobdell from
 
02:21:02.450 --> 02:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon thank you for taking
 
02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
my testimony I'll hand around copies
 
02:21:06.479 --> 02:21:08.150 align:start position:0%
my testimony I'll hand around copies
afterward

02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
afterward
 
02:21:10.070 --> 02:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
um my name is Sarah Lobdell I'm a voter
 
02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
and poll worker in Keene and program
 
02:21:13.969 --> 02:21:13.979 align:start position:0%
coordinator of open democracy we're a
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
non-partisan non-profit representing 36
 
02:21:18.349 --> 02:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
000 voters across New Hampshire
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
um and we are urging on to pass on sb70
 
02:21:24.050 --> 02:21:24.060 align:start position:0%
most of what is in my testimony is
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
already said but I would just highlight
 
02:21:28.370 --> 02:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
two things one is that this portal would
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
make it easier for voters to register if
 
02:21:34.190 --> 02:21:34.200 align:start position:0%
they can't get to their clerk when it's
 
02:21:37.429 --> 02:21:37.439 align:start position:0%
open eight minutes a week such as people
 
02:21:39.650 --> 02:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
who work people who might be going to
 
02:21:42.530 --> 02:21:42.540 align:start position:0%
school full-time people who just can't
 
02:21:43.790 --> 02:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
get out of their house for various
 
02:21:46.250 --> 02:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
reasons so this would really be very
 
02:21:48.190 --> 02:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
much helpful for these voters
 
02:21:51.710 --> 02:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
and second of all as a as a poll worker
 
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
last election I worked the checklist
 
02:21:56.090 --> 02:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
addendum table and that's where people
 
02:21:57.889 --> 02:21:57.899 align:start position:0%
who register same day come and you put
 
02:22:00.770 --> 02:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
them on the checklist and I would say a
 
02:22:02.870 --> 02:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
vast majority of the folks that we saw
 
02:22:05.630 --> 02:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
were either simply changing an address
 
02:22:09.650 --> 02:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
from like one number to the next or new
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
voters who were younger and more likely
 
02:22:14.530 --> 02:22:14.540 align:start position:0%
to access and use such a portal as this
 
02:22:16.910 --> 02:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
and for people simply changing an
 
02:22:18.770 --> 02:22:18.780 align:start position:0%
address or name this would make it a
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
whole lot easier so
 
02:22:23.389 --> 02:22:23.399 align:start position:0%
urging out pass on sb70 and happy to
 
02:22:25.070 --> 02:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
take any questions are there questions
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
02:22:29.030 --> 02:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you next
 
02:22:34.969 --> 02:22:34.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:36.889 --> 02:22:36.899 align:start position:0%
okay from Franklin New Hampshire we're
 
02:22:42.830 --> 02:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
committee and my name is Olivia Zink
 
02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
executive director of open democracy
 
02:22:48.410 --> 02:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
action and nonpartisan nonprofit I live
 
02:22:50.809 --> 02:22:50.819 align:start position:0%
in Franklin and I also have testimony
 
02:22:53.210 --> 02:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
from Judith Ackerson who is the ward 3
 
02:22:55.010 --> 02:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
supervisor of the checklist in Franklin
 
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so I'll quickly cover both
 
02:22:58.849 --> 02:22:58.859 align:start position:0%
things I want to thank this committee
 
02:23:00.950 --> 02:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
for all the work that you have done to
 
02:23:03.410 --> 02:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
modernize applications the application
 
02:23:07.910 --> 02:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
process voter registration forms and and
 
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's really important that we begin to
 
02:23:13.670 --> 02:23:13.680 align:start position:0%
modernize elections last year I had the
 
02:23:15.889 --> 02:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
privilege and honor to serve on the
 
02:23:17.809 --> 02:23:17.819 align:start position:0%
voter confidence committee and I spent
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
37 hours traveling around or 37 hours of
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
meetings traveling around the state
 
02:23:25.730 --> 02:23:25.740 align:start position:0%
listening to voters and many believed
 
02:23:27.830 --> 02:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
that having clean checklists would
 
02:23:29.929 --> 02:23:29.939 align:start position:0%
increase confidence in our election
 
02:23:33.650 --> 02:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
process and modernization would also
 
02:23:36.349 --> 02:23:36.359 align:start position:0%
create voter confidence it's an
 
02:23:38.750 --> 02:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
important step in supporting local poll
 
02:23:38.760 --> 02:23:40.010 align:start position:0%
important step in supporting local poll
workers

02:23:40.010 --> 02:23:40.020 align:start position:0%
workers
 
02:23:42.590 --> 02:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
I serve as a selectman or city councilor
 
02:23:45.410 --> 02:23:45.420 align:start position:0%
in my community and so I have a role on
 
02:23:48.110 --> 02:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
Election Day and I just want to tell one
 
02:23:51.650 --> 02:23:51.660 align:start position:0%
story a voter came to check in and their
 
02:23:53.389 --> 02:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
name was not on the checklist when they
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
handed me their ID
 
02:23:57.410 --> 02:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
lo and behold they did register to vote
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
but their last name was spelled
 
02:24:01.910 --> 02:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
incorrectly on the checklist their last
 
02:24:04.309 --> 02:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
name the second letter was an O instead
 
02:24:07.070 --> 02:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
of an a I was lucky to flip the page and
 
02:24:08.809 --> 02:24:08.819 align:start position:0%
just double check like maybe it got
 
02:24:10.910 --> 02:24:10.920 align:start position:0%
misspelled because they swore they were
 
02:24:13.610 --> 02:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
already registered and I think that this
 
02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:14.690 align:start position:0%
already registered and I think that this
um

02:24:14.690 --> 02:24:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:17.750 --> 02:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
portal will help make these Corrections
 
02:24:20.929 --> 02:24:20.939 align:start position:0%
so that accurate names are on a voter
 
02:24:20.939 --> 02:24:21.910 align:start position:0%
so that accurate names are on a voter
checklist

02:24:21.910 --> 02:24:21.920 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
02:24:24.950 --> 02:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
Judith uh ward 3 supervisor of the
 
02:24:28.130 --> 02:24:28.140 align:start position:0%
checklist says she was elected to A
 
02:24:32.450 --> 02:24:32.460 align:start position:0%
system that is is Antiquated we need to
 
02:24:35.090 --> 02:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
This Crew the current system of paper
 
02:24:37.550 --> 02:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
forms creates a lot of work for
 
02:24:40.730 --> 02:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist and she has
 
02:24:44.450 --> 02:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
no hesitancy in modernizes modernizing
 
02:24:46.190 --> 02:24:46.200 align:start position:0%
Judith wanted to point out that this is
 
02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan bill that has support from
 
02:24:50.270 --> 02:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
both parties and that we need
 
02:24:53.630 --> 02:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
legislation with bipartisan support
 
02:24:55.790 --> 02:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
and that this will continue to keep our
 
02:24:58.809 --> 02:24:58.819 align:start position:0%
election system safe while we modernize
 
02:25:01.790 --> 02:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
election volunteers and especially
 
02:25:03.770 --> 02:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
supervisors of the checklist give an
 
02:25:06.950 --> 02:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
enormous hours for training for showing
 
02:25:09.170 --> 02:25:09.180 align:start position:0%
up at town halls for the re for meetings
 
02:25:12.590 --> 02:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
and their polling places and um Judith
 
02:25:15.410 --> 02:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
hopes that this system can pass to make
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
a more efficient in the duties for her
 
02:25:20.330 --> 02:25:20.340 align:start position:0%

02:25:31.250 --> 02:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
all right next up Jordan Applewhite from
 
02:25:35.870 --> 02:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
Sugar Hill New Hampshire
 
02:25:37.250 --> 02:25:37.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't get you in there
 
02:25:38.570 --> 02:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
earlier I should have I didn't realize
 
02:25:39.950 --> 02:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
you were in the bottom I should have
 
02:25:41.030 --> 02:25:41.040 align:start position:0%
moved it Forward I'll try to do the
 
02:25:44.570 --> 02:25:44.580 align:start position:0%
non-lobbyists up front and apologize
 
02:25:46.370 --> 02:25:46.380 align:start position:0%

front of you right there like that okay
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely uh hello my name is Jordan
 
02:25:51.770 --> 02:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
Applewhite I'm a supervisor of the
 
02:25:53.570 --> 02:25:53.580 align:start position:0%
checklist in Sugar Hill and I'm here
 
02:25:55.969 --> 02:25:55.979 align:start position:0%
today to testify in sport of sb70 I
 
02:25:57.290 --> 02:25:57.300 align:start position:0%
lived in three other states before
 
02:25:59.210 --> 02:25:59.220 align:start position:0%
making New Hampshire my home and all
 
02:26:00.889 --> 02:26:00.899 align:start position:0%
three of those States enjoy the modern
 
02:26:03.050 --> 02:26:03.060 align:start position:0%
conveniences laid out in this bill
 
02:26:04.670 --> 02:26:04.680 align:start position:0%
when I moved here I was surprised to
 
02:26:06.170 --> 02:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
discover that registering to vote
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
required visiting my town clerk at an
 
02:26:10.370 --> 02:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
office it's only open for 10 hours a
 
02:26:12.110 --> 02:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
week in the middle of the work day
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
opponents of sb70 may say even if
 
02:26:16.250 --> 02:26:16.260 align:start position:0%
registering at the town clerk's office
 
02:26:18.530 --> 02:26:18.540 align:start position:0%
is inconvenient why not just register on
 
02:26:19.550 --> 02:26:19.560 align:start position:0%
Election Day
 
02:26:21.469 --> 02:26:21.479 align:start position:0%
for starters not everyone has the
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
privilege to take off work so they can
 
02:26:25.309 --> 02:26:25.319 align:start position:0%
vote workers with a long commute can't
 
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
simply pop over to town building on
 
02:26:28.250 --> 02:26:28.260 align:start position:0%
their lunch break
 
02:26:30.530 --> 02:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
also I'm sure most of their supervisors
 
02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
and election officials would agree that
 
02:26:33.650 --> 02:26:33.660 align:start position:0%
we prefer to minimize the number of
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
same-day registrations
 
02:26:37.670 --> 02:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
not only does it create a bottleneck at
 
02:26:39.469 --> 02:26:39.479 align:start position:0%
our table when we receive an influx of
 
02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
new applicants all at once but perfectly
 
02:26:43.849 --> 02:26:43.859 align:start position:0%
eligible voters often bring inadequate
 
02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
documentation to verify their Identity
 
02:26:47.270 --> 02:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
or domicile
 
02:26:49.490 --> 02:26:49.500 align:start position:0%
in these cases we resort to the use of
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
Legally binding affidavits to make sure
 
02:26:53.090 --> 02:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
our residents are not disenfranchised
 
02:26:55.670 --> 02:26:55.680 align:start position:0%
Justice session however we saw some of
 
02:26:57.110 --> 02:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
the legislature fighting to remove this
 
02:26:59.389 --> 02:26:59.399 align:start position:0%
affidavit system that allowed 3 500
 
02:27:01.370 --> 02:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
eligible Granite Staters to vote last
 
02:27:01.380 --> 02:27:02.330 align:start position:0%
eligible Granite Staters to vote last
fall

02:27:02.330 --> 02:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
fall
 
02:27:04.370 --> 02:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
in light of ongoing efforts to make
 
02:27:06.170 --> 02:27:06.180 align:start position:0%
same-day registration more difficult
 
02:27:07.969 --> 02:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
it's only prudent to allow convenient
 
02:27:09.830 --> 02:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
options for registering and fixing
 
02:27:11.870 --> 02:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
problems ahead of election day
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
sb70 is a needed step in that direction
 
02:27:16.969 --> 02:27:16.979 align:start position:0%
ultimately there are two increasingly
 
02:27:18.410 --> 02:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
polarized points of view when it comes
 
02:27:21.170 --> 02:27:21.180 align:start position:0%
to election reform one says that despite
 
02:27:23.210 --> 02:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
no evidence of fraud we must tighten and
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
restrict our voting systems it alleges
 
02:27:26.990 --> 02:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
wrongdoing among the hard-working
 
02:27:29.090 --> 02:27:29.100 align:start position:0%
volunteers who spend long days clerking
 
02:27:31.010 --> 02:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
and filing and counting to make sure our
 
02:27:33.110 --> 02:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
Democratic exercise is possible
 
02:27:35.090 --> 02:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
myself and the other election officials
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
of all political Persuasions who I'm
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
proud to call my friends we feel
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
differently we believe our democracy is
 
02:27:42.830 --> 02:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
most secure when every eligible voice is
 
02:27:45.110 --> 02:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
heard when every voter feels that their
 
02:27:47.870 --> 02:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
contribution is honored sb70 might just
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
look like a common sense modernization
 
02:27:52.010 --> 02:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
of a few paper forms but it's also a
 
02:27:53.690 --> 02:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
show of respect and understanding to
 
02:27:55.849 --> 02:27:55.859 align:start position:0%
working Granite Staters it takes nothing
 
02:27:57.410 --> 02:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
away from those who prefer to register
 
02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
and vote in person but for some sb70
 
02:28:01.429 --> 02:28:01.439 align:start position:0%
will make the difference between whether
 
02:28:03.230 --> 02:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
they're able to vote at all thanks very
 
02:28:03.240 --> 02:28:03.950 align:start position:0%
they're able to vote at all thanks very
much

02:28:03.950 --> 02:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:28:05.510 --> 02:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
will you be taking questions uh no
 
02:28:07.730 --> 02:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
thanks all right that's fine next up is
 
02:28:10.670 --> 02:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
Matt mushin from Claremont New Hampshire

02:28:14.210 --> 02:28:14.220 align:start position:0%

02:28:26.690 --> 02:28:26.700 align:start position:0%
um but my name is Matt musian I live in
 
02:28:28.190 --> 02:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
Claremont where I serve as a city
 
02:28:29.990 --> 02:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
councilor and today I'm here
 
02:28:32.290 --> 02:28:32.300 align:start position:0%
representing 603 Ford
 
02:28:34.670 --> 02:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
non-partisan non-profit organization

dedicated to educating activating and
 
02:28:40.450 --> 02:28:40.460 align:start position:0%
empowering young people in New Hampshire
 
02:28:44.510 --> 02:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
and we support Senate Bill 70 for the
 
02:28:45.950 --> 02:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
reasons you've heard today because we
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
believe that by allowing voters to
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
easily and safely access an online
 
02:28:52.610 --> 02:28:52.620 align:start position:0%
election information portal for their
 
02:28:55.849 --> 02:28:55.859 align:start position:0%
voting needs folks will be more likely
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
to register before election day and
 
02:29:00.590 --> 02:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
it'll in turn help reduce lines or
 
02:29:03.110 --> 02:29:03.120 align:start position:0%
potential confusion at the polls which
 
02:29:04.730 --> 02:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
as you heard will help granted State
 
02:29:06.830 --> 02:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
voters and our hard-working election
 
02:29:06.840 --> 02:29:08.710 align:start position:0%
voters and our hard-working election
officials

02:29:08.710 --> 02:29:08.720 align:start position:0%
officials
 
02:29:12.050 --> 02:29:12.060 align:start position:0%
and ultimately by providing photos with
 
02:29:13.490 --> 02:29:13.500 align:start position:0%
accessible and up-to-date information
 
02:29:15.770 --> 02:29:15.780 align:start position:0%
about the voting process it'll make it
 
02:29:18.530 --> 02:29:18.540 align:start position:0%
easier for young working age people in
 
02:29:20.570 --> 02:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to exercise the right to
 
02:29:23.870 --> 02:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
vote so we are due to vote ought to pass
 
02:29:25.910 --> 02:29:25.920 align:start position:0%
on this bill and I would take any
 
02:29:27.410 --> 02:29:27.420 align:start position:0%
questions you have all right other
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee

they are quiet all right last up is
 
02:29:32.809 --> 02:29:32.819 align:start position:0%

um I am from Lincoln Massachusetts but
 
02:29:54.170 --> 02:29:54.180 align:start position:0%
it's a point of Pride to say that I was
 
02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
born and raised in Auburn New Hampshire
 
02:29:57.770 --> 02:29:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I'm a newly minted Massachusetts
 
02:30:01.550 --> 02:30:01.560 align:start position:0%
resident and but so I am the election
 
02:30:04.190 --> 02:30:04.200 align:start position:0%
official program manager with the New
 
02:30:05.630 --> 02:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire campaign for voting rights
 
02:30:08.330 --> 02:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
which is a non-partisan coalition of
 
02:30:10.550 --> 02:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
organizations working in support of
 
02:30:12.770 --> 02:30:12.780 align:start position:0%
voting rights and healthy democracy and
 
02:30:14.389 --> 02:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
is a project of America votes New
 
02:30:17.090 --> 02:30:17.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today in support of
 
02:30:17.100 --> 02:30:18.610 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm here today in support of
sb70

02:30:18.610 --> 02:30:18.620 align:start position:0%
sb70
 
02:30:20.450 --> 02:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
establishing an election information
 
02:30:22.370 --> 02:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
portal would benefit both our election
 
02:30:23.809 --> 02:30:23.819 align:start position:0%
officials as we've heard a lot about
 
02:30:26.510 --> 02:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
today and voters by allowing voters to
 
02:30:28.550 --> 02:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
complete a new voter application request
 
02:30:30.950 --> 02:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
an absentee ballot or make updates to
 
02:30:32.809 --> 02:30:32.819 align:start position:0%
their registration quickly and easily
 
02:30:35.090 --> 02:30:35.100 align:start position:0%
online many people are already
 
02:30:37.070 --> 02:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
comfortable handling their banking their
 
02:30:38.809 --> 02:30:38.819 align:start position:0%
bill payments and car registrations
 
02:30:41.389 --> 02:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
online and a safe and secure way and
 
02:30:42.950 --> 02:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
it's a common sense decision to give
 
02:30:45.110 --> 02:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
voters that same option for their voter
 
02:30:45.120 --> 02:30:46.969 align:start position:0%
voters that same option for their voter
registration

02:30:46.969 --> 02:30:46.979 align:start position:0%
registration
 
02:30:48.950 --> 02:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
with the ease of completing a voter
 
02:30:50.510 --> 02:30:50.520 align:start position:0%
application or updating their info
 
02:30:52.429 --> 02:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
through a portal we can also reduce the
 
02:30:54.170 --> 02:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
number of Voters registering for the
 
02:30:56.510 --> 02:30:56.520 align:start position:0%
first time on Election Day which can
 
02:30:58.130 --> 02:30:58.140 align:start position:0%
lead to long lines at many polling
 
02:30:59.929 --> 02:30:59.939 align:start position:0%
places especially during presidential
 
02:30:59.939 --> 02:31:01.250 align:start position:0%
places especially during presidential
elections

02:31:01.250 --> 02:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
elections
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%
voters would also be able to immediately
 
02:31:05.690 --> 02:31:05.700 align:start position:0%
update their address upon moving helping
 
02:31:07.790 --> 02:31:07.800 align:start position:0%
to keep the voter voter rolls updated
 
02:31:09.590 --> 02:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
and accurate something we know can
 
02:31:12.590 --> 02:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
increase voter competence
 
02:31:15.290 --> 02:31:15.300 align:start position:0%
an election information portal will also
 
02:31:17.090 --> 02:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
support our supervisors of the checklist
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
cutting back on the amount of data entry
 
02:31:20.990 --> 02:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
and difficulty of reading handwriting
 
02:31:23.570 --> 02:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
again reducing potential errors with
 
02:31:25.130 --> 02:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
this legislation voter registration
 
02:31:26.929 --> 02:31:26.939 align:start position:0%
applications will go to local election
 
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
officials to be processed meaning they
 
02:31:30.830 --> 02:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
still have oversight and are at the
 
02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
heart of the registration process
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
we've been very glad to hear that the
 
02:31:37.969 --> 02:31:37.979 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State mentioned an updated
 
02:31:40.670 --> 02:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
election net system would be compatible
 
02:31:42.110 --> 02:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
with the potential election information
 
02:31:42.120 --> 02:31:43.610 align:start position:0%
with the potential election information
portal

02:31:43.610 --> 02:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
portal
 
02:31:46.250 --> 02:31:46.260 align:start position:0%
with 42 States in Washington DC
 
02:31:49.070 --> 02:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
utilizing online systems now is the time
 
02:31:50.510 --> 02:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire to utilize this
 
02:31:52.190 --> 02:31:52.200 align:start position:0%
upgrade and create an election
 
02:31:54.170 --> 02:31:54.180 align:start position:0%
information portal that works with our
 
02:31:56.330 --> 02:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
elections I thank you for your time I
 
02:31:58.490 --> 02:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
will say our campaign director Mackenzie
 
02:32:00.110 --> 02:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
St Germain is out of town and is usually
 
02:32:02.150 --> 02:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
here testifying so if you have questions
 
02:32:04.130 --> 02:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
I would urge you to direct them to her
 
02:32:05.990 --> 02:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
and I will not be taking questions
 
02:32:07.550 --> 02:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
awesome would anyone else like to speak
 
02:32:10.370 --> 02:32:10.380 align:start position:0%
to this bill sb70 uh representative wood
 
02:32:21.469 --> 02:32:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
so now we'll see when you set the limit
 
02:32:26.690 --> 02:32:26.700 align:start position:0%
you're fast okay
 
02:32:26.700 --> 02:32:27.469 align:start position:0%
you're fast okay
um

02:32:27.469 --> 02:32:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:29.030 --> 02:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
there was there was one person signed in
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
not speaking and they were signed up in
 
02:32:33.469 --> 02:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
favor with that I'm willing to close the
 
02:32:37.550 --> 02:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
um uh public hearing on sb70 and I'm
 
02:32:39.469 --> 02:32:39.479 align:start position:0%

my Amendment so I'm going to do the
 
02:32:47.690 --> 02:32:47.700 align:start position:0%
thing that I hate the most which is
 
02:32:49.309 --> 02:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
distribute paperwork in the middle of my
 
02:32:51.050 --> 02:32:51.060 align:start position:0%

02:33:08.990 --> 02:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
close the public hearing entirely I just
 
02:33:10.070 --> 02:33:10.080 align:start position:0%

02:33:12.950 --> 02:33:12.960 align:start position:0%

okay

02:33:49.490 --> 02:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:53.570 --> 02:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
a hearing for amendment to sb70 and
 
02:33:55.610 --> 02:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
and I recognize
 
02:33:58.010 --> 02:33:58.020 align:start position:0%
representative Ross Berry who written
 
02:33:58.020 --> 02:33:59.270 align:start position:0%
representative Ross Berry who written
input

02:33:59.270 --> 02:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
input
 
02:34:00.889 --> 02:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:34:02.510 --> 02:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
um fellow committee members I'm here to
 
02:34:05.929 --> 02:34:05.939 align:start position:0%
introduce house Amendment 2023 1280h
 
02:34:08.570 --> 02:34:08.580 align:start position:0%
which is amendment to sb70 uh it does
 
02:34:11.090 --> 02:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
two things it takes uh deals with the
 
02:34:12.770 --> 02:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
bill we just heard
 
02:34:14.809 --> 02:34:14.819 align:start position:0%
um about the election not portal and it
 
02:34:17.389 --> 02:34:17.399 align:start position:0%
takes the um bill regarding the Hava
 
02:34:19.490 --> 02:34:19.500 align:start position:0%
money um for which bill it was um but
 
02:34:21.410 --> 02:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
the bill that where we would fund half
 
02:34:22.849 --> 02:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
of the machine purchase with the Hava
 
02:34:25.490 --> 02:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
money it takes that bill and attaches it
 
02:34:28.849 --> 02:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of hb70 and then changes
 
02:34:31.670 --> 02:34:31.680 align:start position:0%
one thing about hb70 which is right now
 
02:34:35.570 --> 02:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
HP 7 sb70 excuse me sb70 draws I believe
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
from the general fund this would change
 
02:34:41.210 --> 02:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism to for sb70 to the
 
02:34:44.510 --> 02:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
Haba funds so a couple reasons uh why I
 
02:34:45.770 --> 02:34:45.780 align:start position:0%
did that
 
02:34:48.170 --> 02:34:48.180 align:start position:0%
um so when we were hearing the
 
02:34:53.870 --> 02:34:53.880 align:start position:0%
information about the machine bill
 
02:34:55.910 --> 02:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
um I've never seen the Hava money table
 
02:34:57.170 --> 02:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
before I think you guys probably all
 
02:34:58.969 --> 02:34:58.979 align:start position:0%
remember that holla money table
 
02:35:00.250 --> 02:35:00.260 align:start position:0%
um and I looked at the Hava money table
 
02:35:02.990 --> 02:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
and I understood the Secretary of
 
02:35:04.790 --> 02:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
State's concerns with not drawing those
 
02:35:06.110 --> 02:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
funds down
 
02:35:08.809 --> 02:35:08.819 align:start position:0%
um I didn't uh Express those concerns at
 
02:35:10.010 --> 02:35:10.020 align:start position:0%
the time especially from the chair
 
02:35:12.170 --> 02:35:12.180 align:start position:0%
because that would be inappropriate but
 
02:35:13.969 --> 02:35:13.979 align:start position:0%
the way the money is being managed the
 
02:35:15.770 --> 02:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
argument of protecting the fund is kind
 
02:35:17.330 --> 02:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
of moot with me
 
02:35:19.130 --> 02:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
um the money is already not being
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
protected in that if there was if the
 
02:35:24.050 --> 02:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
state was acting as a proper fiduciary
 
02:35:27.590 --> 02:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
on the Hava money they would be taking
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
the interest earned backfilling it into
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
the principal to offset inflation and
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
then spending whatever was left right so
 
02:35:36.230 --> 02:35:36.240 align:start position:0%
in a regular year we'd see three percent
 
02:35:38.210 --> 02:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
inflation right if they got a seven
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
percent return on the money they take
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
the three percent they'd shove it back
 
02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
in and they spend the four percent which
 
02:35:44.630 --> 02:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
is not nothing four percent of 12
 
02:35:45.770 --> 02:35:45.780 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
02:35:48.050 --> 02:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
um that would that interest would end up
 
02:35:49.969 --> 02:35:49.979 align:start position:0%
being several hundreds of thousands of
 
02:35:51.410 --> 02:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
dollars that we could spend on
 
02:35:53.630 --> 02:35:53.640 align:start position:0%
effectively anything related to to
 
02:35:55.670 --> 02:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
helping people vote and it would
 
02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
continue to grow so we'd have that same
 
02:35:59.690 --> 02:35:59.700 align:start position:0%
value modern day value going forward the
 
02:36:00.770 --> 02:36:00.780 align:start position:0%
state's not doing that they're not
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
getting that
 
02:36:03.770 --> 02:36:03.780 align:start position:0%
um I I'm kind of like baffled how the
 
02:36:05.330 --> 02:36:05.340 align:start position:0%
state's not getting that just for
 
02:36:07.370 --> 02:36:07.380 align:start position:0%
reference over the last 30 years the S P
 
02:36:11.330 --> 02:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
500 has averaged a 9.88 interest rate
 
02:36:14.210 --> 02:36:14.220 align:start position:0%
return on investment so the fact that I
 
02:36:15.710 --> 02:36:15.720 align:start position:0%
think we're kidding like less than six
 
02:36:17.990 --> 02:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
or something and then spending it so
 
02:36:19.490 --> 02:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not investing it back
 
02:36:21.290 --> 02:36:21.300 align:start position:0%
into the principal we're just spending
 
02:36:23.270 --> 02:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
the money so every year while we're
 
02:36:25.010 --> 02:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
spending the same amount of money in
 
02:36:26.270 --> 02:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
principle we're actually spending less
 
02:36:28.070 --> 02:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
because inflation it's not a political
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
statement about inflation inflation
 
02:36:31.370 --> 02:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
exists every single year regardless of
 
02:36:32.570 --> 02:36:32.580 align:start position:0%
who's in the White House regardless of
 
02:36:34.309 --> 02:36:34.319 align:start position:0%
who controls Congress it averages about
 
02:36:35.990 --> 02:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
three percent a year so once I kind of
 
02:36:37.130 --> 02:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
looked at that and realized all right
 
02:36:39.349 --> 02:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
the argument about
 
02:36:41.090 --> 02:36:41.100 align:start position:0%
um protecting this fund is moot because
 
02:36:42.469 --> 02:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
you're already not protecting this fund
 
02:36:45.230 --> 02:36:45.240 align:start position:0%
uh it then said all right well how can
 
02:36:47.510 --> 02:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
we actually get what we want so we know
 
02:36:48.770 --> 02:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
that our College on the other side of
 
02:36:51.710 --> 02:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
the wall I really love the portal we
 
02:36:53.750 --> 02:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
probably want the Hava money is being
 
02:36:55.610 --> 02:36:55.620 align:start position:0%
spent on the machines and I said well
 
02:36:56.870 --> 02:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
here's a great opportunity to marry the
 
02:36:59.090 --> 02:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
two and get we can have our cake and eat
 
02:37:00.370 --> 02:37:00.380 align:start position:0%
it too
 
02:37:03.889 --> 02:37:03.899 align:start position:0%
so it's that's what the build does I'm
 
02:37:05.450 --> 02:37:05.460 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions we've
 
02:37:07.550 --> 02:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
already heard testimony on both bills I
 
02:37:09.110 --> 02:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
rolled them I rolled the my own
 
02:37:10.910 --> 02:37:10.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment non-germaine just so nobody
 
02:37:13.010 --> 02:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
could say that I didn't but I actually
 
02:37:15.250 --> 02:37:15.260 align:start position:0%
probably could have just
 
02:37:16.849 --> 02:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
administered this because we've already
 
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
had a hearing on the bill that it is
 
02:37:21.290 --> 02:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
based off of so I'm happy to answer any
 
02:37:22.610 --> 02:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure I've missed something
 
02:37:25.309 --> 02:37:25.319 align:start position:0%
in my testimony but I'm happy to answer
 
02:37:26.630 --> 02:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
any questions and I'm sure they're
 
02:37:31.250 --> 02:37:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:33.650 --> 02:37:33.660 align:start position:0%
any questions in the committee
 
02:37:33.660 --> 02:37:34.969 align:start position:0%
any questions in the committee
representative

02:37:34.969 --> 02:37:34.979 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:37:37.130 --> 02:37:37.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:37:40.130 --> 02:37:40.140 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking the question
 
02:37:43.010 --> 02:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
um this committee has heard a bill that
 
02:37:46.010 --> 02:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
talks about your what you have in your
 
02:37:49.370 --> 02:37:49.380 align:start position:0%
Amendment which was each B 447 I believe
 
02:37:51.349 --> 02:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
correct and I'm pretty sure this
 
02:37:54.230 --> 02:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
committee retained that bill and I'm
 
02:37:58.090 --> 02:37:58.100 align:start position:0%
wondering if as chair you might consider
 
02:38:01.010 --> 02:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
you know creating a subcommittee to
 
02:38:05.110 --> 02:38:05.120 align:start position:0%
bring that bill back and look at
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
details in that bill as opposed to
 
02:38:11.870 --> 02:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
applying this amendment to a bill that
 
02:38:14.630 --> 02:38:14.640 align:start position:0%
is largely unrelated yeah
 
02:38:16.309 --> 02:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
um so the Senate's already killed the
 
02:38:18.170 --> 02:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
Hava money the for the machines they
 
02:38:19.910 --> 02:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
already did it so if you want a position
 
02:38:21.650 --> 02:38:21.660 align:start position:0%
to negotiate you have to bring something
 
02:38:24.530 --> 02:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
to the table if you catch my drift
 
02:38:26.750 --> 02:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we can form all the subcommittees we
 
02:38:26.760 --> 02:38:28.550 align:start position:0%
so we can form all the subcommittees we
want

02:38:28.550 --> 02:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
want
 
02:38:30.650 --> 02:38:30.660 align:start position:0%
when you go to the table you got to get
 
02:38:30.660 --> 02:38:35.929 align:start position:0%
when you go to the table you got to get
something

02:38:35.929 --> 02:38:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:42.050 --> 02:38:42.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:43.849 --> 02:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
um I will say uh and this was actually
 
02:38:45.469 --> 02:38:45.479 align:start position:0%
announced what I was going to make
 
02:38:48.469 --> 02:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
um at the end of it um uh represent a
 
02:38:50.330 --> 02:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
ranking member Lane and I co-signed a
 
02:38:52.610 --> 02:38:52.620 align:start position:0%
letter to the about law commission I'm
 
02:38:53.690 --> 02:38:53.700 align:start position:0%
happy to make copy of the letters
 
02:38:53.700 --> 02:38:55.190 align:start position:0%
happy to make copy of the letters
available

02:38:55.190 --> 02:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
available
 
02:38:57.410 --> 02:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
um about to the backlog commission
 
02:39:00.830 --> 02:39:00.840 align:start position:0%
basically saying like hurry it up so if
 
02:39:03.530 --> 02:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
they do hurry it up we need this now
 
02:39:07.849 --> 02:39:07.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:11.450 --> 02:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
any further questions yeah
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you
 
02:39:15.950 --> 02:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
um given that this Senate has already
 
02:39:19.010 --> 02:39:19.020 align:start position:0%
killed the Java funds bill
 
02:39:21.530 --> 02:39:21.540 align:start position:0%
if this committee were to adopt this
 
02:39:25.429 --> 02:39:25.439 align:start position:0%
amendment to SV 70 would it not make it
 
02:39:27.650 --> 02:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
more difficult to pass the election
 
02:39:31.190 --> 02:39:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
um overall so historically this body has
 
02:39:37.010 --> 02:39:37.020 align:start position:0%
killed the portal bill so this is you
 
02:39:38.809 --> 02:39:38.819 align:start position:0%
get something you want and we get
 
02:39:41.330 --> 02:39:41.340 align:start position:0%
something we want historically we
 
02:39:42.590 --> 02:39:42.600 align:start position:0%
obviously have not voted on the portal
 
02:39:45.110 --> 02:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
Bill we won't until later but
 
02:39:46.429 --> 02:39:46.439 align:start position:0%
historically it has gone down because
 
02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
it's a million dollar website by the way
 
02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
another reason I want to go into the
 
02:39:52.130 --> 02:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
Hava money is I get these distinct
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
feeling that if the secretary of state
 
02:39:55.309 --> 02:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
is controlling it with Hava money then
 
02:39:57.830 --> 02:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
it won't be a million dollar website if
 
02:39:59.690 --> 02:39:59.700 align:start position:0%
you were you weren't uh for those of you
 
02:40:01.730 --> 02:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
who are around last year it was a four
 
02:40:03.770 --> 02:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
million dollar website last year so the
 
02:40:05.809 --> 02:40:05.819 align:start position:0%
price has come down 75 percent in a year
 
02:40:08.030 --> 02:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
which is impressive but I somehow get
 
02:40:09.290 --> 02:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
the feeling that if there's a little
 
02:40:11.870 --> 02:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
more oversight not an open warrant that
 
02:40:13.610 --> 02:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
it won't be a million dollar boondoggle
 
02:40:15.050 --> 02:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
and you won't have to hear that word
 
02:40:17.150 --> 02:40:17.160 align:start position:0%
from me anymore it'll be a more
 
02:40:18.770 --> 02:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
reasonable maybe thirty thousand dollar
 
02:40:18.780 --> 02:40:20.090 align:start position:0%
reasonable maybe thirty thousand dollar
boondoggle

02:40:20.090 --> 02:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
boondoggle
 
02:40:21.410 --> 02:40:21.420 align:start position:0%
which is probably what it should
 
02:40:24.050 --> 02:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
actually cost but neither here nor there
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
million dollar website's insane may I
 
02:40:28.309 --> 02:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
ask another fellow
 
02:40:29.630 --> 02:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't have the amendment in front
 
02:40:32.030 --> 02:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
of me so I can't look at the details of
 
02:40:33.950 --> 02:40:33.960 align:start position:0%
what you have in the amendment
 
02:40:37.309 --> 02:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
um but from what I gather there's a
 
02:40:40.250 --> 02:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
grant program in the amendment is that
 
02:40:41.750 --> 02:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
what you're proposing a grant program
 
02:40:44.270 --> 02:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
for municipalities to receive Hava funds
 
02:40:47.510 --> 02:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
for uh election counting machines
 
02:40:49.309 --> 02:40:49.319 align:start position:0%
correct it's that program yeah it's the
 
02:40:51.050 --> 02:40:51.060 align:start position:0%
Java it's the Java program money Bill I
 
02:40:52.550 --> 02:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
forget the number you know I don't I
 
02:40:53.809 --> 02:40:53.819 align:start position:0%
can't remember Bill numbers I can't
 
02:40:55.730 --> 02:40:55.740 align:start position:0%
remember when I'm there in front of me
 
02:40:58.070 --> 02:40:58.080 align:start position:0%
um but it's the Java it's the Hava bill
 
02:41:01.490 --> 02:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
money the Hava money Bill that we heard
 
02:41:01.500 --> 02:41:02.510 align:start position:0%
money the Hava money Bill that we heard
um

02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:05.630 --> 02:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
shoved shoved onto the back of sb70 and
 
02:41:08.030 --> 02:41:08.040 align:start position:0%
then changing the funding mechanism for
 
02:41:08.040 --> 02:41:12.830 align:start position:0%
then changing the funding mechanism for
sp70.

02:41:12.830 --> 02:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:14.450 --> 02:41:14.460 align:start position:0%
which by the way sb70 probably should be
 
02:41:16.550 --> 02:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
funded with Hava money anyways just in
 
02:41:17.870 --> 02:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
general it should be funded with other
 
02:41:20.770 --> 02:41:20.780 align:start position:0%
it's literally about helping people vote
 
02:41:24.290 --> 02:41:24.300 align:start position:0%
if in your Amendment does this allow for
 
02:41:27.950 --> 02:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities to purchase the ballot
 
02:41:29.690 --> 02:41:29.700 align:start position:0%
counting machines that they would all
 
02:41:31.610 --> 02:41:31.620 align:start position:0%
municipalities to purchase the ballot
 
02:41:33.410 --> 02:41:33.420 align:start position:0%
counting machines they would need to run
 
02:41:35.510 --> 02:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
their elections efficiently with new
 
02:41:37.309 --> 02:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
machines correct it's the language is
 
02:41:39.290 --> 02:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
identical it didn't change the word of
 
02:41:42.230 --> 02:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
the actu of the of the machine part of
 
02:41:43.730 --> 02:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
the language it went right on I told us
 
02:41:46.130 --> 02:41:46.140 align:start position:0%
I told all us take it verbatim put it in
 
02:41:48.230 --> 02:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
and change the funding mechanism for the
 
02:41:51.170 --> 02:41:51.180 align:start position:0%
whole bill which included sb70 to have a
 
02:41:51.180 --> 02:41:52.550 align:start position:0%
whole bill which included sb70 to have a
money

02:41:52.550 --> 02:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
02:41:55.010 --> 02:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
so one small change to sp70 and then
 
02:41:56.330 --> 02:41:56.340 align:start position:0%
something that I think that the house
 
02:42:03.770 --> 02:42:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other questions
 
02:42:10.010 --> 02:42:10.020 align:start position:0%
yeah all right I'm gonna go hang out in
 
02:42:29.450 --> 02:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:32.210 --> 02:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
 
02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
they have my mic on thank you uh my name
 
02:42:37.790 --> 02:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
is James Gray I represent Senate
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
District Six which starts up in Gilman
 
02:42:44.389 --> 02:42:44.399 align:start position:0%
and Alton down Route 11 to Rochester
 
02:42:49.309 --> 02:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
um I oppose the amendment uh
 
02:42:51.290 --> 02:42:51.300 align:start position:0%
certainly the Senate has taken a
 
02:42:51.300 --> 02:42:52.270 align:start position:0%
certainly the Senate has taken a
position

02:42:52.270 --> 02:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
position
 
02:42:55.870 --> 02:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
on using Java funds for this
 
02:42:58.550 --> 02:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
a lot of people don't know that I'm also
 
02:43:01.190 --> 02:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
a city councilman in Rochester and
 
02:43:03.050 --> 02:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
certainly I'm not speaking for the city
 
02:43:05.469 --> 02:43:05.479 align:start position:0%
council for Rochester but for myself
 
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
that if you're going to give me money
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
don't give me it with strings attached
 
02:43:13.190 --> 02:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
to it give me the cash and I'll decide
 
02:43:16.190 --> 02:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
whether I need to fix potholes or
 
02:43:18.410 --> 02:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
whether I need additional funds for the
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
school whether I need to buy voting
 
02:43:27.370 --> 02:43:27.380 align:start position:0%
machines or poll books or other devices
 
02:43:30.170 --> 02:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
certainly the reason that you still have
 
02:43:33.889 --> 02:43:33.899 align:start position:0%
Java funds is that the section law that
 
02:43:35.290 --> 02:43:35.300 align:start position:0%
is being modified
 
02:43:35.300 --> 02:43:37.929 align:start position:0%
is being modified
and

02:43:37.929 --> 02:43:37.939 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:43:42.110 --> 02:43:42.120 align:start position:0%
requires that right now that we retain a
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
certain amount of that Java money I
 
02:43:48.190 --> 02:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
think it's 12 times the annual cost
 
02:43:54.070 --> 02:43:54.080 align:start position:0%
for for this purpose and
 
02:43:59.210 --> 02:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
the money that we got in 2002 I believe
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
it was we have received additional money
 
02:44:04.190 --> 02:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
throughout the years so that they have
 
02:44:07.550 --> 02:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
been able to maintain that uh that 12
 
02:44:11.510 --> 02:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
000 or 12 times the annual cost what is
 
02:44:13.429 --> 02:44:13.439 align:start position:0%
it spent for now it's spent for the
 
02:44:16.670 --> 02:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
training it's spent for uh upgrades in
 
02:44:19.790 --> 02:44:19.800 align:start position:0%
the system that we use for accessible
 
02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:20.830 align:start position:0%
the system that we use for accessible
voting

02:44:20.830 --> 02:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:44:23.570 --> 02:44:23.580 align:start position:0%
many of you if you're as old as I am
 
02:44:25.790 --> 02:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
we've actually had three accessible
 
02:44:28.969 --> 02:44:28.979 align:start position:0%
voting machines or revisions to the
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
accessible voting machines in the last
 
02:44:33.130 --> 02:44:33.140 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
02:44:35.870 --> 02:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
which is significant because we have
 
02:44:38.750 --> 02:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
included more and more and more voters
 
02:44:41.349 --> 02:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
in the ability to vote
 
02:44:45.469 --> 02:44:45.479 align:start position:0%
at the polls on a regular ballot now a
 
02:44:47.090 --> 02:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
ballot that goes into the accounting
 
02:44:50.929 --> 02:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
devices it is a fallacy to think that if
 
02:44:53.690 --> 02:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
we take the money and spend the Hava
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
money on something else because all of
 
02:44:59.389 --> 02:44:59.399 align:start position:0%
that money that you're doing now I would
 
02:45:00.650 --> 02:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
then have to come out of the general
 
02:45:03.889 --> 02:45:03.899 align:start position:0%
fund so you know we don't create money
 
02:45:06.349 --> 02:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
we don't destroy money
 
02:45:09.309 --> 02:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
um you know we we tax people
 
02:45:12.710 --> 02:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
so to think that you know if I say well
 
02:45:15.650 --> 02:45:15.660 align:start position:0%
I'm going to go spend this money on
 
02:45:18.710 --> 02:45:18.720 align:start position:0%
these devices that it's going to save
 
02:45:20.990 --> 02:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
the people it's just going to come out
 
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
of a different pocket
 
02:45:25.370 --> 02:45:25.380 align:start position:0%
why you know don't I want to spend the
 
02:45:28.490 --> 02:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
money on the voting machines well I I
 
02:45:30.830 --> 02:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
don't want a community out there that
 
02:45:32.870 --> 02:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
says well gee
 
02:45:35.389 --> 02:45:35.399 align:start position:0%
I just bought new voting machines two
 
02:45:38.330 --> 02:45:38.340 align:start position:0%
years ago five years ago six years ago
 
02:45:41.030 --> 02:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
and now because I don't like them or the
 
02:45:44.330 --> 02:45:44.340 align:start position:0%
the new machines are out there and gee
 
02:45:46.670 --> 02:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
it does this and that'll be so much
 
02:45:49.190 --> 02:45:49.200 align:start position:0%
better you know hey if you want to go
 
02:45:52.490 --> 02:45:52.500 align:start position:0%
buy new machines buy new machines spend
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
your money okay spend your tax dollars
 
02:45:56.690 --> 02:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
the ones that you collected through
 
02:45:58.610 --> 02:45:58.620 align:start position:0%
property tax or whatever
 
02:46:01.790 --> 02:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
uh but you know leave the general fund
 
02:46:05.150 --> 02:46:05.160 align:start position:0%
alone let the general fund you know when
 
02:46:07.550 --> 02:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State presented this
 
02:46:09.770 --> 02:46:09.780 align:start position:0%
budget and it was at two o'clock to the
 
02:46:12.110 --> 02:46:12.120 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee I was
 
02:46:13.969 --> 02:46:13.979 align:start position:0%
unfortunately over here instead of just
 
02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
chairing that committee at the time but
 
02:46:19.910 --> 02:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
they are going to come and they are
 
02:46:22.309 --> 02:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
going to say I no longer have the Java
 
02:46:24.410 --> 02:46:24.420 align:start position:0%
money if we're going to do these
 
02:46:26.750 --> 02:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
pre-election trainings like we do every
 
02:46:29.630 --> 02:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
year and if I'm going to do the election
 
02:46:32.210 --> 02:46:32.220 align:start position:0%
manual which if they do every two years
 
02:46:35.510 --> 02:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
if I am going to do all of these other
 
02:46:37.849 --> 02:46:37.859 align:start position:0%
things including the accessible voting
 
02:46:40.730 --> 02:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
machines that it's either got to come
 
02:46:42.650 --> 02:46:42.660 align:start position:0%
out of Hava funds which it does now
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
because the funds are there and haven't
 
02:46:47.690 --> 02:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
been touched or it's got to come out of
 
02:46:50.270 --> 02:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
General funds so
 
02:46:53.750 --> 02:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know I would rather it be the way
 
02:46:56.090 --> 02:46:56.100 align:start position:0%
the system is right now I would rather
 
02:46:57.830 --> 02:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
02:47:00.170 --> 02:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
if they want to use a a voting machine
 
02:47:03.429 --> 02:47:03.439 align:start position:0%
or a poll book they're certainly able to
 
02:47:06.889 --> 02:47:06.899 align:start position:0%
Rochester decided to use poll books and
 
02:47:11.210 --> 02:47:11.220 align:start position:0%
and does fund that and I'm sure that the
 
02:47:13.910 --> 02:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
money that we've set aside for replacing
 
02:47:16.070 --> 02:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
the voting machines as soon as there's
 
02:47:20.150 --> 02:47:20.160 align:start position:0%
one approved that they believe is going
 
02:47:23.570 --> 02:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
to be the useful one that we will go out
 
02:47:26.330 --> 02:47:26.340 align:start position:0%
and do that so I'll let the communities
 
02:47:28.429 --> 02:47:28.439 align:start position:0%
decide whether they're going to count by
 
02:47:33.230 --> 02:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
hand count by uh you know machine use
 
02:47:36.650 --> 02:47:36.660 align:start position:0%
pull books not use poll books let them
 
02:47:39.710 --> 02:47:39.720 align:start position:0%
make that decision and they would fund
 
02:47:41.809 --> 02:47:41.819 align:start position:0%
their own on that decision
 
02:47:43.550 --> 02:47:43.560 align:start position:0%
but glad to take any questions any
 
02:47:43.560 --> 02:47:45.349 align:start position:0%
but glad to take any questions any
questions

02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
remember that I'm Howard
 
02:47:49.190 --> 02:47:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh thank you
 
02:47:51.230 --> 02:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for taking my question uh
 
02:47:53.690 --> 02:47:53.700 align:start position:0%
how many municipalities have purchased
 
02:47:57.410 --> 02:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:00.110 --> 02:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
um if you understand the history of the
 
02:48:01.870 --> 02:48:01.880 align:start position:0%
accuvote machines
 
02:48:04.910 --> 02:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
there haven't been any new machines
 
02:48:06.670 --> 02:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
really purchased
 
02:48:09.110 --> 02:48:09.120 align:start position:0%
LHS along with some of the other
 
02:48:11.510 --> 02:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
companies have actually gone out to
 
02:48:14.690 --> 02:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
other communities that have had the
 
02:48:17.630 --> 02:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
accuvote machine or there was a similar
 
02:48:17.640 --> 02:48:18.670 align:start position:0%
accuvote machine or there was a similar
machine

02:48:18.670 --> 02:48:18.680 align:start position:0%
machine
 
02:48:22.190 --> 02:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
that has a lot of replacement parts that
 
02:48:25.610 --> 02:48:25.620 align:start position:0%
are used in the Accu votes and those are
 
02:48:28.730 --> 02:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
the parts that are out there that
 
02:48:31.010 --> 02:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
they're using to maintain machines they
 
02:48:34.250 --> 02:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
include rollers they include include the
 
02:48:38.450 --> 02:48:38.460 align:start position:0%
the motors in there even the Reed heads
 
02:48:40.969 --> 02:48:40.979 align:start position:0%
and different things the guts of the
 
02:48:43.309 --> 02:48:43.319 align:start position:0%
machine though the counting devices the
 
02:48:48.010 --> 02:48:48.020 align:start position:0%
chips that are in there are all
 
02:48:52.809 --> 02:48:52.819 align:start position:0%
dictated by the law commission so
 
02:48:55.130 --> 02:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
except for some
 
02:48:58.010 --> 02:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
New Old Stock or old new stock I forget
 
02:49:00.650 --> 02:49:00.660 align:start position:0%
which way I'm supposed to say that uh
 
02:49:03.050 --> 02:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
there there were some machines that that
 
02:49:05.090 --> 02:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
you know they were able to purchase from
 
02:49:08.929 --> 02:49:08.939 align:start position:0%
other communities but most likely they
 
02:49:11.570 --> 02:49:11.580 align:start position:0%
were not accuvote machines they were the
 
02:49:14.990 --> 02:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
sister machine that contained those uh
 
02:49:18.889 --> 02:49:18.899 align:start position:0%
repair parts that have been serving the
 
02:49:23.150 --> 02:49:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:27.230 --> 02:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you uh so I guess uh to
 
02:49:31.309 --> 02:49:31.319 align:start position:0%
rephrase it how much uh money have these
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities spent over the past
 
02:49:36.349 --> 02:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
decade on their election processes
 
02:49:40.670 --> 02:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
the communities including Rochester I
 
02:49:42.010 --> 02:49:42.020 align:start position:0%
have a contract
 
02:49:44.690 --> 02:49:44.700 align:start position:0%
and I believe the state is part of that
 
02:49:47.870 --> 02:49:47.880 align:start position:0%
contract with LHS to maintain the
 
02:49:51.730 --> 02:49:51.740 align:start position:0%
machines and to have them ready uh the
 
02:49:55.270 --> 02:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
communities also can have the machines
 
02:49:59.030 --> 02:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
serviced one of the things about the
 
02:50:01.490 --> 02:50:01.500 align:start position:0%
Windham machines is that the window
 
02:50:02.990 --> 02:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
machine that came from the school
 
02:50:05.750 --> 02:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
district hadn't been serviced in a
 
02:50:08.630 --> 02:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
number of years and contained a lot of
 
02:50:12.530 --> 02:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
paper residue that's that was built up
 
02:50:15.950 --> 02:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
in the machine which was a concern for
 
02:50:19.969 --> 02:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
the Auditors because of that but you'd
 
02:50:21.590 --> 02:50:21.600 align:start position:0%
have to go to the each individual
 
02:50:21.600 --> 02:50:23.050 align:start position:0%
have to go to the each individual
community

02:50:23.050 --> 02:50:23.060 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:50:26.090 --> 02:50:26.100 align:start position:0%
and because there's ballot counting in
 
02:50:29.630 --> 02:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
there that could also skew your number
 
02:50:31.550 --> 02:50:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:50:33.770 --> 02:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative Brennan thank you thank
 
02:50:35.990 --> 02:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question this
 
02:50:37.429 --> 02:50:37.439 align:start position:0%
committee heard testimony from the
 
02:50:39.170 --> 02:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that the
 
02:50:43.130 --> 02:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
Hava funds balance is in at least 12.9
 
02:50:46.849 --> 02:50:46.859 align:start position:0%
million dollars and that purchasing
 
02:50:52.190 --> 02:50:52.200 align:start position:0%
a new ballot counting machines would
 
02:50:54.349 --> 02:50:54.359 align:start position:0%
be estimated to be around three million
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
dollars if every municipality were to
 
02:51:00.950 --> 02:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
request a new machine as opposed to hand
 
02:51:03.290 --> 02:51:03.300 align:start position:0%
counting which they may do can still
 
02:51:05.270 --> 02:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
continue to do when those new machines
 
02:51:08.330 --> 02:51:08.340 align:start position:0%
are online
 
02:51:08.340 --> 02:51:09.410 align:start position:0%
are online
um

02:51:09.410 --> 02:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:12.790 --> 02:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
would it be your testimony that the
 
02:51:15.889 --> 02:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
municipalities should foot the bill for
 
02:51:18.050 --> 02:51:18.060 align:start position:0%
the new machines
 
02:51:22.130 --> 02:51:22.140 align:start position:0%
even with the excess of java funds that
 
02:51:25.010 --> 02:51:25.020 align:start position:0%
are available to municipalities through
 
02:51:27.469 --> 02:51:27.479 align:start position:0%
a grant program that would save
 
02:51:29.330 --> 02:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
taxpayers dollars
 
02:51:33.170 --> 02:51:33.180 align:start position:0%
well part of the reason that you do this
 
02:51:36.650 --> 02:51:36.660 align:start position:0%
machine you know this is if you look in
 
02:51:38.990 --> 02:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
the crossed out sections in here of what
 
02:51:41.210 --> 02:51:41.220 align:start position:0%
the the current Java money is supposed
 
02:51:43.730 --> 02:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
to do one of the things it's supposed to
 
02:51:45.770 --> 02:51:45.780 align:start position:0%
do is maintain the system that we use
 
02:51:49.030 --> 02:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
well part of that system is the
 
02:51:52.010 --> 02:51:52.020 align:start position:0%
electionnet software right now the
 
02:51:54.590 --> 02:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is in negotiation
 
02:51:58.670 --> 02:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
with a company to replace the election
 
02:52:01.250 --> 02:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
that software with something more modern
 
02:52:04.010 --> 02:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
and I think that if you take that amount
 
02:52:06.110 --> 02:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
of money and say I'm going to use that
 
02:52:08.750 --> 02:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
for all the money I'm going to update
 
02:52:12.230 --> 02:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
the portal you know from have a money
 
02:52:15.490 --> 02:52:15.500 align:start position:0%
I'm going to use these machines from
 
02:52:20.750 --> 02:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
ahava money I'm going to use the uh poll
 
02:52:22.490 --> 02:52:22.500 align:start position:0%
books and I'm going to take that out of
 
02:52:25.550 --> 02:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hava money uh very quickly that 12
 
02:52:28.370 --> 02:52:28.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars that you talked about uh
 
02:52:32.809 --> 02:52:32.819 align:start position:0%
is gone so again you're you're making a
 
02:52:34.429 --> 02:52:34.439 align:start position:0%
choice for now or you're making the
 
02:52:37.929 --> 02:52:37.939 align:start position:0%
choice so later uh the past legislatures
 
02:52:41.450 --> 02:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
have decided that we would rather have
 
02:52:44.030 --> 02:52:44.040 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State have that money
 
02:52:46.730 --> 02:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
to be able to do these different
 
02:52:49.550 --> 02:52:49.560 align:start position:0%
trainings and upgrades for software Etc
 
02:52:53.690 --> 02:52:53.700 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned earlier that we've had
 
02:52:56.330 --> 02:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
actually three different accessible
 
02:52:59.650 --> 02:52:59.660 align:start position:0%
voting machines in the last 20 years
 
02:53:02.290 --> 02:53:02.300 align:start position:0%
that have been available
 
02:53:06.349 --> 02:53:06.359 align:start position:0%
the last one the one we have now will
 
02:53:08.990 --> 02:53:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually print on a regular ballot and
 
02:53:11.269 --> 02:53:11.279 align:start position:0%
therefore will be able to be read buy
 
02:53:13.429 --> 02:53:13.439 align:start position:0%
the accuvote machines the one
 
02:53:16.790 --> 02:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
immediately prior to that had to be hand
 
02:53:19.429 --> 02:53:19.439 align:start position:0%
counted because you used a blank sheet
 
02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
of paper to put into the machine
 
02:53:24.950 --> 02:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
and and get the ballot out so again it's
 
02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's choices it's uh but if you are
 
02:53:33.170 --> 02:53:33.180 align:start position:0%
short on any of that money and you've
 
02:53:37.130 --> 02:53:37.140 align:start position:0%
depleted the uh have a money then the
 
02:53:38.990 --> 02:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is going to have to
 
02:53:41.510 --> 02:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
to come back through youth fiscal or
 
02:53:45.290 --> 02:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
through other means and ask for money to
 
02:53:48.830 --> 02:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
be transferred into or out of various
 
02:53:48.840 --> 02:53:50.570 align:start position:0%
be transferred into or out of various
accounts

02:53:50.570 --> 02:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
accounts
 
02:53:53.290 --> 02:53:53.300 align:start position:0%
um I would just assume from what I know
 
02:53:56.389 --> 02:53:56.399 align:start position:0%
being the vice chair fiscal and the
 
02:53:58.610 --> 02:53:58.620 align:start position:0%
chair of Senate Finance I would rather
 
02:54:02.450 --> 02:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
have the money available to them through
 
02:54:06.530 --> 02:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
the Hava funds on hand so that he has it
 
02:54:11.090 --> 02:54:11.100 align:start position:0%
and ready to spend to best help the
 
02:54:12.889 --> 02:54:12.899 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire to be able to
 
02:54:12.899 --> 02:54:14.090 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire to be able to
vote

02:54:14.090 --> 02:54:14.100 align:start position:0%
vote
 
02:54:15.889 --> 02:54:15.899 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
02:54:15.899 --> 02:54:16.730 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
um

02:54:16.730 --> 02:54:16.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:18.830 --> 02:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
my understanding that with a grant
 
02:54:18.840 --> 02:54:20.570 align:start position:0%
my understanding that with a grant
program

02:54:20.570 --> 02:54:20.580 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:54:23.690 --> 02:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
this amendment outlines that the
 
02:54:25.910 --> 02:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
secretary of state would have to approve
 
02:54:28.969 --> 02:54:28.979 align:start position:0%
the grant funds to municipalities which
 
02:54:30.769 --> 02:54:30.779 align:start position:0%
would provide the secretary of state
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
with management of these funds to make
 
02:54:34.269 --> 02:54:34.279 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
02:54:37.969 --> 02:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
the Java funds are not depleted
 
02:54:42.710 --> 02:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
um is am I misunderstanding this or do
 
02:54:44.630 --> 02:54:44.640 align:start position:0%
you have a similar understanding of this
 
02:54:47.090 --> 02:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
well you haven't defined in this
 
02:54:49.309 --> 02:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
amendment you know all of the things
 
02:54:50.809 --> 02:54:50.819 align:start position:0%
that are going to come out of there how
 
02:54:53.389 --> 02:54:53.399 align:start position:0%
how people qualify for these grants how
 
02:54:55.969 --> 02:54:55.979 align:start position:0%
how much you know
 
02:54:58.370 --> 02:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
um how long it would be between one
 
02:55:00.650 --> 02:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
Grant and the next Grant and you've also
 
02:55:02.929 --> 02:55:02.939 align:start position:0%
got testimony of the author of the
 
02:55:05.269 --> 02:55:05.279 align:start position:0%
amendment uh that he wants to make a
 
02:55:09.290 --> 02:55:09.300 align:start position:0%
change to Senate Bill 70 so that the
 
02:55:12.950 --> 02:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
portal funds would be paid for out of
 
02:55:16.550 --> 02:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
the Hava money again you know if
 
02:55:20.690 --> 02:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
the more you change this okay and make
 
02:55:23.690 --> 02:55:23.700 align:start position:0%
it uh include things that the the Senate
 
02:55:27.530 --> 02:55:27.540 align:start position:0%
has already voted on on other issues
 
02:55:30.349 --> 02:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
um the less chance it has and you know
 
02:55:32.710 --> 02:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
just as you've got the ability to put
 
02:55:36.410 --> 02:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
this language you know into Senate Bill
 
02:55:39.110 --> 02:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
70. I've got the option of putting
 
02:55:42.429 --> 02:55:42.439 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 70 on all kinds of things
 
02:55:46.250 --> 02:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
that the house would like to get done uh
 
02:55:48.969 --> 02:55:48.979 align:start position:0%
and you know playing tit for chat just
 
02:55:51.889 --> 02:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
doesn't suit me well but you know I do
 
02:55:53.929 --> 02:55:53.939 align:start position:0%
know how to play
 
02:55:55.910 --> 02:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair thank
 
02:56:01.070 --> 02:56:01.080 align:start position:0%
you Senator gray for taking my question
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
I was just wondering do you know how
 
02:56:04.309 --> 02:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
much is spent from the Hava funds every
 
02:56:08.450 --> 02:56:08.460 align:start position:0%
year uh no because the Secretary of
 
02:56:11.809 --> 02:56:11.819 align:start position:0%
State as you look at the the crossed out
 
02:56:14.809 --> 02:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
part of this bill says that he needs to
 
02:56:18.050 --> 02:56:18.060 align:start position:0%
keep 12 times the annual maintenance
 
02:56:21.469 --> 02:56:21.479 align:start position:0%
costs that he does in there and uh
 
02:56:25.010 --> 02:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
uh that would get audited through you
 
02:56:26.990 --> 02:56:27.000 align:start position:0%
know the Departments and presented to
 
02:56:29.870 --> 02:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal but I haven't been on physical
 
02:56:32.349 --> 02:56:32.359 align:start position:0%
long enough that that his Department
 
02:56:35.570 --> 02:56:35.580 align:start position:0%
audit has come forward so okay I have
 
02:56:38.570 --> 02:56:38.580 align:start position:0%
not looked thank you
 
02:56:40.969 --> 02:56:40.979 align:start position:0%
any anybody else questions because I
 
02:56:43.309 --> 02:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
have one now one of the things we've
 
02:56:43.319 --> 02:56:44.330 align:start position:0%
have one now one of the things we've
heard

02:56:44.330 --> 02:56:44.340 align:start position:0%
heard
 
02:56:47.929 --> 02:56:47.939 align:start position:0%
in our testimony on other things is that
 
02:56:51.110 --> 02:56:51.120 align:start position:0%
the accuvoke machines the company that
 
02:56:53.030 --> 02:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
makes them is no more no longer
 
02:56:55.429 --> 02:56:55.439 align:start position:0%
servicing them they are not making Parts
 
02:56:57.230 --> 02:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
you mentioned other places you can get
 
02:57:00.170 --> 02:57:00.180 align:start position:0%
parts but not not through accuvote and
 
02:57:02.330 --> 02:57:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons the
 
02:57:04.550 --> 02:57:04.560 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is looking at and
 
02:57:07.910 --> 02:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
other machines now if that's true which
 
02:57:12.410 --> 02:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
I believe it is why then are we going to
 
02:57:16.150 --> 02:57:16.160 align:start position:0%
force towns to spend money on machines
 
02:57:19.309 --> 02:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
that they may only have spent five years
 
02:57:19.319 --> 02:57:20.389 align:start position:0%
that they may only have spent five years
ago

02:57:20.389 --> 02:57:20.399 align:start position:0%
ago
 
02:57:22.969 --> 02:57:22.979 align:start position:0%
some maybe 20 years ago but some maybe
 
02:57:24.950 --> 02:57:24.960 align:start position:0%
just recently have bought an extra
 
02:57:27.050 --> 02:57:27.060 align:start position:0%
machine and what they already paid for
 
02:57:28.790 --> 02:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
now they're going to have to pay more
 
02:57:31.610 --> 02:57:31.620 align:start position:0%
money because the second machines have
 
02:57:34.490 --> 02:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
changed when we have the harbor money
 
02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
the way I understand the contract with
 
02:57:41.330 --> 02:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
the LHS is that they are guaranteeing
 
02:57:42.830 --> 02:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
that the machines will be available
 
02:57:47.150 --> 02:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
through the 2024 election cycle
 
02:57:49.849 --> 02:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
um I don't know of any Community other
 
02:57:49.859 --> 02:57:51.590 align:start position:0%
um I don't know of any Community other
than

02:57:51.590 --> 02:57:51.600 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:57:53.870 --> 02:57:53.880 align:start position:0%
um you know buying
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
used machines from somewhere that has
 
02:57:59.929 --> 02:57:59.939 align:start position:0%
actually spent any you know new money on
 
02:58:03.710 --> 02:58:03.720 align:start position:0%
machines it has been a service of the
 
02:58:06.130 --> 02:58:06.140 align:start position:0%
machines that are out there
 
02:58:08.750 --> 02:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
certainly uh
 
02:58:12.110 --> 02:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
if you look back in history the state of
 
02:58:14.570 --> 02:58:14.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has not bought any of
 
02:58:16.849 --> 02:58:16.859 align:start position:0%
those machines as the community wants to
 
02:58:19.730 --> 02:58:19.740 align:start position:0%
do the machine count then they have the
 
02:58:22.910 --> 02:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
ability to do it and they have the uh
 
02:58:25.429 --> 02:58:25.439 align:start position:0%
they would have the responsibility of
 
02:58:27.849 --> 02:58:27.859 align:start position:0%
buying that machine
 
02:58:31.610 --> 02:58:31.620 align:start position:0%
that if I I'm not forcing them to do it
 
02:58:33.730 --> 02:58:33.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not forcing them not to do it
 
02:58:36.969 --> 02:58:36.979 align:start position:0%
certainly I believe that there are
 
02:58:40.190 --> 02:58:40.200 align:start position:0%
machines out there that we will find
 
02:58:40.200 --> 02:58:41.590 align:start position:0%
machines out there that we will find
satisfactory

02:58:41.590 --> 02:58:41.600 align:start position:0%
satisfactory
 
02:58:45.790 --> 02:58:45.800 align:start position:0%
and that in the next year and a half
 
02:58:47.870 --> 02:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
I guess it's a little more than a year
 
02:58:50.030 --> 02:58:50.040 align:start position:0%
and a half because it's uh the machines
 
02:58:52.630 --> 02:58:52.640 align:start position:0%
would have to be ready for
 
02:58:56.269 --> 02:58:56.279 align:start position:0%
a election the town elections in 2025
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
would be the time and if it were not
 
02:59:04.030 --> 02:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
ready many of these towns
 
02:59:08.330 --> 02:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
are not the the large towns that would
 
02:59:12.650 --> 02:59:12.660 align:start position:0%
be needing to do this and by other towns
 
02:59:15.710 --> 02:59:15.720 align:start position:0%
not needing as many machines it would
 
02:59:19.190 --> 02:59:19.200 align:start position:0%
also leave more machines to be able to
 
02:59:23.030 --> 02:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
to be used for the larger Towns now part
 
02:59:25.370 --> 02:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
of this when we talk about the servicing
 
02:59:27.650 --> 02:59:27.660 align:start position:0%
of the machines remember that the card
 
02:59:29.870 --> 02:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
that goes in those machines also has to
 
02:59:32.830 --> 02:59:32.840 align:start position:0%
be programmed and the current software
 
02:59:36.410 --> 02:59:36.420 align:start position:0%
that's available for that is I think
 
02:59:39.650 --> 02:59:39.660 align:start position:0%
it's Windows 95 which hasn't been
 
02:59:42.530 --> 02:59:42.540 align:start position:0%
serviced for a long time that has
 
02:59:45.590 --> 02:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
advantages and disadvantages nobody's
 
02:59:48.830 --> 02:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
writing hacks to to go into those
 
02:59:50.809 --> 02:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
machines anymore because nobody has them
 
02:59:53.889 --> 02:59:53.899 align:start position:0%
okay and for the machines that we have
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
that are doing that are not connected to
 
02:59:59.269 --> 02:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
the internet so there's good and bad
 
03:00:02.090 --> 03:00:02.100 align:start position:0%
about it being and if you want to see
 
03:00:04.429 --> 03:00:04.439 align:start position:0%
that you can go into the window audit
 
03:00:07.730 --> 03:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
and where they talked about uh part of
 
03:00:09.830 --> 03:00:09.840 align:start position:0%
the the reason that we week our
 
03:00:12.230 --> 03:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
elections are secure as they are is
 
03:00:14.650 --> 03:00:14.660 align:start position:0%
because the equipment is as old as it is
 
03:00:17.630 --> 03:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
and that there's not a lot of people out
 
03:00:19.849 --> 03:00:19.859 align:start position:0%
there that that would bother doing
 
03:00:22.070 --> 03:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
anything with it
 
03:00:25.490 --> 03:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
okay not seeing any more
 
03:00:28.969 --> 03:00:28.979 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you and I like to
 
03:00:28.979 --> 03:00:30.050 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you and I like to
call

03:00:30.050 --> 03:00:30.060 align:start position:0%
call
 
03:00:40.250 --> 03:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:41.870 --> 03:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:00:44.269 --> 03:00:44.279 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Michael O'Brien
 
03:00:46.190 --> 03:00:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I put a support and a pose on the
 
03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
card I come up here confused for the
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
second time today
 
03:00:50.990 --> 03:00:51.000 align:start position:0%
um really just torn for the second time
 
03:00:51.000 --> 03:00:52.010 align:start position:0%
um really just torn for the second time
today

03:00:52.010 --> 03:00:52.020 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:00:52.020 --> 03:00:52.790 align:start position:0%
today
um

03:00:52.790 --> 03:00:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:55.550 --> 03:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
America votes supports uh both these
 
03:00:57.830 --> 03:00:57.840 align:start position:0%
bills individually
 
03:00:59.630 --> 03:00:59.640 align:start position:0%
um and have supported both the portal
 
03:01:02.030 --> 03:01:02.040 align:start position:0%
today and the use of hollow funds before
 
03:01:02.040 --> 03:01:04.490 align:start position:0%
today and the use of hollow funds before
we

03:01:04.490 --> 03:01:04.500 align:start position:0%
we
 
03:01:06.830 --> 03:01:06.840 align:start position:0%
would love a deal to be reached where
 
03:01:08.030 --> 03:01:08.040 align:start position:0%
both of these things could move forward
 
03:01:09.469 --> 03:01:09.479 align:start position:0%
I will say the Secretary of State's
 
03:01:09.479 --> 03:01:10.610 align:start position:0%
I will say the Secretary of State's
position

03:01:10.610 --> 03:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
position
 
03:01:13.790 --> 03:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
um when he uh from when they spoke here
 
03:01:16.670 --> 03:01:16.680 align:start position:0%
um earlier to now seems to have softened
 
03:01:18.769 --> 03:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
a little bit in front of house finance
 
03:01:20.090 --> 03:01:20.100 align:start position:0%
they mentioned that they would be
 
03:01:21.590 --> 03:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
willing to use a certain portion of
 
03:01:24.050 --> 03:01:24.060 align:start position:0%
money to help Townsend the machines also
 
03:01:26.330 --> 03:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
in a Globe article the secretary of
 
03:01:27.710 --> 03:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
state was quoted as saying we know these
 
03:01:29.210 --> 03:01:29.220 align:start position:0%
machines are on their last legs so
 
03:01:30.530 --> 03:01:30.540 align:start position:0%
they're a little more forthright and
 
03:01:32.330 --> 03:01:32.340 align:start position:0%
hope to have machines approved before
 
03:01:35.510 --> 03:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
2024 if towns or cities want to use them
 
03:01:38.530 --> 03:01:38.540 align:start position:0%
and so knowing the timeline
 
03:01:41.870 --> 03:01:41.880 align:start position:0%
and that it is coming up again we it is
 
03:01:43.490 --> 03:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
I think a good thing it would would be
 
03:01:46.190 --> 03:01:46.200 align:start position:0%
good for the state to allow for
 
03:01:48.110 --> 03:01:48.120 align:start position:0%
purchases to help at least to at least
 
03:01:49.790 --> 03:01:49.800 align:start position:0%
help with some of the purchase of the
 
03:01:52.190 --> 03:01:52.200 align:start position:0%
machine so that towns aren't stuck using
 
03:01:53.389 --> 03:01:53.399 align:start position:0%
machines that may or may not work
 
03:01:56.750 --> 03:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
however again uh we won't want it we
 
03:01:58.490 --> 03:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose both by trying to
 
03:02:00.349 --> 03:02:00.359 align:start position:0%
combine them together so
 
03:02:01.670 --> 03:02:01.680 align:start position:0%
um if there's a deal can be reached
 
03:02:03.650 --> 03:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
let's I would certainly encourage that
 
03:02:07.490 --> 03:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
and love to see that but also recognize
 
03:02:09.469 --> 03:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
that if that can't happen I wouldn't
 
03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
don't want to lose both bills in an
 
03:02:13.910 --> 03:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
effort that might not go there so that's
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
basically testimony and happy to take
 
03:02:18.349 --> 03:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
any questions any questions
 
03:02:20.510 --> 03:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:02:25.070 --> 03:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
now our last speaker is nature
 
03:02:30.290 --> 03:02:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:32.210 --> 03:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:02:34.910 --> 03:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
um it appears there's there's a lot more
 
03:02:37.010 --> 03:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
legislative negotiating here than I
 
03:02:40.190 --> 03:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
recognized at first we do support this
 
03:02:40.200 --> 03:02:41.150 align:start position:0%
recognized at first we do support this
amendment

03:02:41.150 --> 03:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:02:42.590 --> 03:02:42.600 align:start position:0%
um nature Grace for the municipal
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
Association sorry if I didn't say that
 
03:02:47.450 --> 03:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
um as as identified by the committee
 
03:02:50.570 --> 03:02:50.580 align:start position:0%
this is uh identical to House Bill 447
 
03:02:53.450 --> 03:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
we testified in support of that bill
 
03:02:56.929 --> 03:02:56.939 align:start position:0%
um as Mr O'Brien noted uh the security
 
03:02:59.030 --> 03:02:59.040 align:start position:0%
State's office has spoken about the need
 
03:03:00.889 --> 03:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
to replace the accuvote machine several
 
03:03:04.910 --> 03:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
times since uh we heard that bill in
 
03:03:07.250 --> 03:03:07.260 align:start position:0%
this committee and I'd also just like to
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
add for the committee's information
 
03:03:12.830 --> 03:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
that uh if you haven't read the Concord
 
03:03:15.110 --> 03:03:15.120 align:start position:0%
Monitor a few days ago David Brooks
 
03:03:16.969 --> 03:03:16.979 align:start position:0%
reported that
 
03:03:19.190 --> 03:03:19.200 align:start position:0%
um the three different machines uh three
 
03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:20.030 align:start position:0%
um the three different machines uh three
different

03:03:20.030 --> 03:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
03:03:22.010 --> 03:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
three different types of machines were
 
03:03:24.010 --> 03:03:24.020 align:start position:0%
used in three different town meetings
 
03:03:26.570 --> 03:03:26.580 align:start position:0%
during the march Town meetings all
 
03:03:29.630 --> 03:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
handled the ballots correctly there are
 
03:03:31.250 --> 03:03:31.260 align:start position:0%
two more that are being tested in the
 
03:03:35.690 --> 03:03:35.700 align:start position:0%
Maytown meetings so I anticipate that we
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
should expect the ballot law commission
 
03:03:39.349 --> 03:03:39.359 align:start position:0%
to be able to make some kind of judgment
 
03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
about what if any of those machines
 
03:03:45.230 --> 03:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
should be certified and we could be on
 
03:03:47.570 --> 03:03:47.580 align:start position:0%
the path to getting these uh very old
 
03:03:49.429 --> 03:03:49.439 align:start position:0%
old machines the accuvote machines
 
03:03:52.490 --> 03:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
replaced and that's really our focus is
 
03:03:55.070 --> 03:03:55.080 align:start position:0%
try to have a smooth replacement smooth
 
03:03:57.710 --> 03:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
roll out with as minimal cost as
 
03:04:01.190 --> 03:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
possible to the local taxpayers I'm
 
03:04:03.110 --> 03:04:03.120 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions that the
 
03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
committee may have
 
03:04:06.590 --> 03:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
03:04:18.110 --> 03:04:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:21.349 --> 03:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
did you guys miss me uh representative
 
03:04:23.090 --> 03:04:23.100 align:start position:0%
wood can we grab the uh
 
03:04:27.769 --> 03:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:27.779 --> 03:04:29.269 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:04:29.269 --> 03:04:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:31.070 --> 03:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
just so the committee knows uh I'm
 
03:04:33.490 --> 03:04:33.500 align:start position:0%
probably going to schedule
 
03:04:35.870 --> 03:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
the votes for everything that we did
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
today next Tuesday in the morning
 
03:04:40.010 --> 03:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
um I have not come to that final
 
03:04:42.290 --> 03:04:42.300 align:start position:0%
discussion you'll obviously know when I
 
03:04:44.570 --> 03:04:44.580 align:start position:0%
schedule it um but that is my current um
 
03:04:46.550 --> 03:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
what's called inclination
 
03:04:48.650 --> 03:04:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so you know I I'm chair of two
 
03:04:50.870 --> 03:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
committees nobody signed in to support
 
03:04:52.910 --> 03:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
or against this uh and I'm closing the
 
03:04:55.370 --> 03:04:55.380 align:start position:0%
public hearing on uh the not the
 
03:04:58.370 --> 03:04:58.380 align:start position:0%
amendment 2023 1280 H uh sorry about
 
03:05:01.790 --> 03:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
that um so everybody knows um I'm doing
 
03:05:03.110 --> 03:05:03.120 align:start position:0%

03:05:10.859 --> 03:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
um I said I announced during my
testimony

provide anyone copies with that who
 
03:05:20.570 --> 03:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
would like to see it
 
03:05:23.450 --> 03:05:23.460 align:start position:0%
um and with that I will probably see you
 
03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
next week thank you guys so much I'm
 
03:05:26.630 --> 03:05:26.640 align:start position:0%
