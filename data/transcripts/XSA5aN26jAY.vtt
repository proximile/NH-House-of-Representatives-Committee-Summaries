00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
represent peter corrosion but open the
 
00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 align:start position:0%
hearing um
 
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
conference continuation of house bill
 
00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.270 align:start position:0%
conference continuation of house bill
291

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:09.280 align:start position:0%
291
 
00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 align:start position:0%
many of the things that are back in here
 
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 align:start position:0%
are things
 
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
that the senate was not happy with in
 
00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
the original version of the house bill
 
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:46.000 align:start position:0%
we did not want the data going to
 
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
the representatives for the senator
 
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
we wanted to go to the you know the
 
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
secretary of state to produce it and the
 
00:00:58.389 --> 00:00:58.399 align:start position:0%
ag being the one who
 
00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 align:start position:0%
reviews it because they could get data
 
00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 align:start position:0%
that would not be appropriate to give to
 
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
the representatives of the senators
 
00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 align:start position:0%
and that generated a
 
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal note well i guess the whole
 
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
senate amendment
 
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
generated a fiscal note from the
 
00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
ag's office that said that implementing
 
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 align:start position:0%
uh what was in there was going to cost
 
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
at least a half a million dollars
 
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
um i explained to the representative the
 
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
ag that
 
00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 align:start position:0%
was not our intent but speaking directly
 
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
to the amendment
 
00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not happy about lunch
 
00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
24th and 27th i want don't want the
 
00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
report to go
 
00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 align:start position:0%
to anyone other than secretary of state
 
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
the ag
 
00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 align:start position:0%
the number of absentee ballots
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
that were requested by any community
 
00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 align:start position:0%
isn't as important to me
 
00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 align:start position:0%
as the percentage that you know of
 
00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
voters because
 
00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
you know if i have
 
00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
you know a request from a community you
 
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
know that's
 
00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 align:start position:0%
two percent even though it may be a
 
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
large number
 
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 align:start position:0%
it makes a difference on the numbers and
 
00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:23.990 align:start position:0%
it makes a difference on the numbers and
stuff

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i think that the three could
 
00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:30.879 align:start position:0%
go up to five could go up to ten on
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
the number of ballots sent because we
 
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
really are
 
00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
looking for some kind of nefarious act
 
00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
d the 20 most common addresses if you
 
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 align:start position:0%
send all the data to them
 
00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
and they have the ability to sort it
 
00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:50.319 align:start position:0%
they can sort it any way they want
 
00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 align:start position:0%
and further information secretary of
 
00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:53.350 align:start position:0%
and further information secretary of
state

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
working together under what they already
 
00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.030 align:start position:0%
working together under what they already
have

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
the ability to do so again
 
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
i think we're just too far apart on this
 
00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 align:start position:0%
and trying to
 
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
to come up with a resolution uh in
 
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 align:start position:0%
the bills that are already passed we did
 
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.670 align:start position:0%
the bills that are already passed we did
add

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 align:start position:0%
in the feature where people are supposed
 
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
to supply one of the three things
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
and that was the last four digits social
 
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 align:start position:0%
security number
 
00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
the driver's license number of state or
 
00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.869 align:start position:0%
the driver's license number of state or
other

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:22.879 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
information that the clerk
 
00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
can verify and if you don't like my
 
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.070 align:start position:0%
can verify and if you don't like my
language

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.080 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
i don't like your language and
 
00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 align:start position:0%
i don't see that that we've got time to
 
00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 align:start position:0%
get there
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
speaking for myself personally i don't
 
00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
want this the data going to
 
00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:50.959 align:start position:0%
the senators or the representatives it's
 
00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
the wrong place to go
 
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 align:start position:0%
limits the data that you can send it
 
00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
limits the data that they
 
00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
pag would have a chance to look at and
 
00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 align:start position:0%
would cause the
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
review of that data to take a lot longer
 
00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
we're not looking at ones or twos you
 
00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
know we're looking at something that
 
00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:11.270 align:start position:0%
know we're looking at something that
would

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
would impact an election so
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
i'll let any of the other senators that
 
00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
want to speak
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
speak but i can't do you remember
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
i did speak i also spoke with the ag's
 
00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
office yesterday and
 
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
they have something that they have some
 
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.110 align:start position:0%
they have something that they have some
concerns

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
um on the language
 
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
actually both from the house and the
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
senate um and i have really concerns
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note that we
 
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 align:start position:0%
we have on it now what i would
 
00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
um what i would propose
 
00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 align:start position:0%
because i do think this this piece of
 
00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:02.080 align:start position:0%
legislation is needed
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
um i think that
 
00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
i would work with uh representative
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
griffin and representative um
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
hill this summer to try and put
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
something together that would work for
 
00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.390 align:start position:0%
something together that would work for
both

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:05:22.629 --> 00:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
um and and with the ag's office because
 
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
i want to get that one of them in the
 
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 align:start position:0%
secretary of state
 
00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 align:start position:0%
so that's something that both sides can
 
00:05:29.029 --> 00:05:29.039 align:start position:0%
look at and
 
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 align:start position:0%
um not have to worry about the community
 
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 align:start position:0%
of conferences i think both
 
00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 align:start position:0%
both have some issues but i'd rather
 
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
work on work on it over the summer with
 
00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:43.919 align:start position:0%
the representatives and get something
 
00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:45.110 align:start position:0%
the representatives and get something
through

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:53.919 align:start position:0%
i would just echo many of the same uh
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
comments of my colleagues
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
what we got for us is workable they
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
certainly don't think there's time here
 
00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:00.469 align:start position:0%
certainly don't think there's time here
to

00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:37.029 align:start position:0%
 
great

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
again in my opinion if we go back to the
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
sentence version
 
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 align:start position:0%
i can support that we may want to add a
 
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 align:start position:0%
word or two in there for the
 
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
attorney general to say that you know
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
the scope is limited you know uh that
 
00:06:57.189 --> 00:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
you know this is a review of a report
 
00:06:59.270 --> 00:06:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's not the investigation
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
because if something in that report
 
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
leads them to believe
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
that there is some nefarious act that's
 
00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:06.720 align:start position:0%
going on
 
00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
they've already got under rsa
 
00:07:13.749 --> 00:07:13.759 align:start position:0%
7c6 i believe it is all the authority
 
00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 align:start position:0%
that they need to go investigate that
 
00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:20.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know that's
 
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
that's as far as i'm willing to go i
 
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
don't know that senator burksell is
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
willing to go there
 
00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
and i don't know whether senator
 
00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
christie didn't want to get there
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
either i think that worksmithingnet at
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
this point i
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
again i think we need we need a lot more
 
00:07:37.029 --> 00:07:37.039 align:start position:0%
time and
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
we have by three o'clock this afternoon
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
that's why you know i'm more than
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
willing to work with
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
the representatives to get something
 
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:48.720 align:start position:0%
through that we can
 
00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:52.479 align:start position:0%
work on i agree with senator hertzell
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
that we
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
it if you don't look you're never gonna
 
00:07:56.479 --> 00:07:57.029 align:start position:0%
it if you don't look you're never gonna
find

00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
okay and so we have taken some action
 
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:00.790 align:start position:0%
okay and so we have taken some action
this

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
this year uh in putting in
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
some form of identification that doesn't
 
00:08:09.909 --> 00:08:09.919 align:start position:0%
uh mean that somebody has to have a
 
00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
camera have a phone
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
have a whatever uh to be able to prove
 
00:08:16.950 --> 00:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
something i mean how many people know
 
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
who the efficient
 
00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
the person who actually married you is
 
00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
if you were married to the state of new
 
00:08:22.479 --> 00:08:23.670 align:start position:0%
if you were married to the state of new
hampshire

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
i mean you put that on the forum i was
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
married by
 
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
they can go look up your marriage
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
certificate in the clerk's office
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
that's pretty good you know information
 
00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
to me okay
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
it's not going to be that person that's
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
out stealing things off of the list or
 
00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:41.190 align:start position:0%
out stealing things off of the list or
whatever

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
00:08:43.029 --> 00:08:43.039 align:start position:0%
and there's a myriad of things that they
 
00:08:46.470 --> 00:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
can do so we have taken action
 
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.360 align:start position:0%
but not this action and if we're going
 
00:08:50.790 --> 00:08:50.800 align:start position:0%
to do this action
 
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
i want to keep it small i want to keep
 
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
looking at the high points
 
00:08:58.550 --> 00:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
and i want to make it so that
 
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
we're not limiting the information that
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
we can give to the ag
 
00:09:05.590 --> 00:09:05.600 align:start position:0%
because we're also giving it to the
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
general court
 
00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:09.990 align:start position:0%
general court
person

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.269 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:16.470 align:start position:0%
 
outside

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm happy to work on the
 
00:09:20.150 --> 00:09:20.160 align:start position:0%
bill over the summer i have to tell i'm
 
00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:21.760 align:start position:0%
surprised about the fiscal note
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
so first i've heard about a fiscal note
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
and as when it came over to
 
00:09:28.870 --> 00:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
us we didn't get that exactly and that's
 
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:31.110 align:start position:0%
us we didn't get that exactly and that's
um

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
nick had contacted me yesterday
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
i saw the um apparently he had
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
sent it no we didn't get it i don't know
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
where it went
 
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
um and he kind of triggered
 
00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
me to call him and that's when i looked
 
00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:49.990 align:start position:0%
me to call him and that's when i looked
at

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
it and i didn't i'm sorry i didn't make
 
00:09:53.190 --> 00:09:53.200 align:start position:0%
a copy of it but it's close to
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
half a million dollars well i think but
 
00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
i think the original scope of what was
 
00:09:58.949 --> 00:09:58.959 align:start position:0%
sent over right
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
right i think um that's that's what
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
generated me thinking that
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
what he was thinking the bill was doing
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
is not what we had
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
what we had um
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
intended so i realized there's
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
a really a lack of communication between
 
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
the ag's office
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
and and us that we need to get them
 
00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:22.150 align:start position:0%
and and us that we need to get them
involved

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
involved
 
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:24.560 align:start position:0%
to realize what actually we're asking
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
them to do
 
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:26.880 align:start position:0%
i i don't think there's much
 
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:28.480 align:start position:0%
communication that's
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:57.430 --> 00:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand how that
 
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.990 align:start position:0%
i guess i don't understand how that
compromises

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
compromises
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
the information you've got the address
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
that it's sent to in here
 
00:11:09.509 --> 00:11:09.519 align:start position:0%
i think that's an open question is
 
00:11:12.870 --> 00:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
whether that is releasable under rsa91a
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
i think that age especially in these
 
00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:18.160 align:start position:0%
where we're going to have multiple
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
valves into a single address
 
00:11:22.630 --> 00:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
i think that that is a very important
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
piece of information
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
and could very much limit the number of
 
00:11:26.399 --> 00:11:27.750 align:start position:0%
and could very much limit the number of
investigations

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
investigations
 
00:11:29.750 --> 00:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
that you could do you know if it's all
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
19 20 year old
 
00:11:33.829 --> 00:11:33.839 align:start position:0%
it's in the community that is known for
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
colleges like boston
 
00:11:38.710 --> 00:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
or whatever you know that that would
 
00:11:40.949 --> 00:11:40.959 align:start position:0%
be things that we we wouldn't want them
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
to spend any more time on
 
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh and there's other things in there
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
that that could be useful to that
 
00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
that that could be useful to that
investigator

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
investigator
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
that could be put into those reports and
 
00:11:51.839 --> 00:11:52.550 align:start position:0%
that could be put into those reports and
again

00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
it is not the legislator's job to go
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
do all of that and
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
i can't i can't get there i guess i what
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
i'm seeing here is more that we're
 
00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
saying that's the secretary of state's
 
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:16.710 align:start position:0%
saying that's the secretary of state's
job

00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:18.389 --> 00:12:18.399 align:start position:0%
and i think some of this comes back to
 
00:12:19.750 --> 00:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
your comment about
 
00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing on this and making it clear
 
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think in all of this we have
 
00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
some goals but we don't have the right
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
words to get to those goals
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
but the goal is one of the goals as i
 
00:12:32.790 --> 00:12:32.800 align:start position:0%
would see it is that the secretary of
 
00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:33.190 align:start position:0%
would see it is that the secretary of
state

00:12:33.190 --> 00:12:33.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
secretary of state is routinely
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
evaluating these things
 
00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
and if everything is clean yet he's
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
never involved
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
it's just the secretary of state if he's
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
in charge of election
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
law the ag will never be involved if
 
00:12:50.470 --> 00:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
there are issues that
 
00:12:57.430 --> 00:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
it's clear that i do agree that
 
00:13:32.949 --> 00:13:32.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
agreement that the premise of the bill
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
was a good idea or something that we
 
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
should go forward
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
i absolutely think so um based on the
 
00:13:42.710 --> 00:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
information that representative
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
brought in the last session um
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
and i mean i can expound on that
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
you know privately but i i think
 
00:13:57.509 --> 00:13:57.519 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns on um if there
 
00:13:57.519 --> 00:13:58.710 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns on um if there
are

00:13:58.710 --> 00:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots going to address
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
more absolute balance that go into
 
00:14:05.750 --> 00:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
addresses i think you really need to
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
find out
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
i agree i don't care if they're college
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
age or otherwise
 
00:14:21.509 --> 00:14:21.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
the only reason i brought up the college
 
00:14:23.839 --> 00:14:24.629 align:start position:0%
the only reason i brought up the college
age

00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
age
 
00:14:27.030 --> 00:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
is that when representative hill
 
00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:27.670 align:start position:0%
is that when representative hill
presented

00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
presented
 
00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee last year as you know
 
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
senator suspect on the committee at that
 
00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:33.829 align:start position:0%
senator suspect on the committee at that
time

00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
that that was one of the explanations
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
that was used that some of these
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
are not problems because they are and
 
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
speaking personally my granddaughter who
 
00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:47.910 align:start position:0%
speaking personally my granddaughter who
just

00:14:47.910 --> 00:14:47.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
graduated from quinnipiac you know they
 
00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
rented an apartment building okay
 
00:14:57.269 --> 00:14:57.279 align:start position:0%
uh you know probably 50 or 60 apartments
 
00:14:58.069 --> 00:14:58.079 align:start position:0%

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
and the kids instead of sending the
 
00:15:05.350 --> 00:15:05.360 align:start position:0%
mail to the campus address because they
 
00:15:07.430 --> 00:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
had to walk an extra half a mile
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
had their emails sent to the actual post
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
