get us into a friendly mood would be HB
 
00:41:57.420 --> 00:41:59.810 align:start position:0%

00:42:07.870 --> 00:42:07.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I would move

00:42:18.170 --> 00:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
Amy we're not going to be doing anything
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
for a little bit here yeah uh we have a
 
00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
motion to retain 637 made by
 
00:42:27.250 --> 00:42:27.260 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli and second by
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:34.310 --> 00:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
Adam clerk we're just going to let you
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%

is there a discussion from uh represent
cordelli

00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
cordelli
 
00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
um I I think that there have been issues
 
00:42:45.730 --> 00:42:45.740 align:start position:0%
erased about some of the terminology
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
and expansion from just High School into
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
the lower grades
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
I have been in contact this morning with
 
00:42:59.569 --> 00:42:59.579 align:start position:0%
the department and they also believe it
 
00:43:02.990 --> 00:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
could use some additional looking at
 
00:43:06.650 --> 00:43:06.660 align:start position:0%
um so uh therefore my motion to retain
 
00:43:09.250 --> 00:43:09.260 align:start position:0%
represent Myler
 
00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:11.520 align:start position:0%

no bills which we
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
uh discussed in the other room and uh
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
what we're going to do in these bills
 
00:44:14.390 --> 00:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow discussion uh one
 
00:44:16.490 --> 00:44:16.500 align:start position:0%
person from each party
 
00:44:18.309 --> 00:44:18.319 align:start position:0%
because we know where we're going
 
00:44:20.750 --> 00:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh so the first one we're going to take
 
00:44:33.349 --> 00:44:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:37.309 --> 00:44:37.319 align:start position:0%
okay 603 uh
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
is an EFA uh bill of deals deals with
 
00:44:42.230 --> 00:44:42.240 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
00:44:45.950 --> 00:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:46.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
look to representative Lexus for a
 
00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:52.370 align:start position:0%
look to representative Lexus for a
motion

00:44:52.370 --> 00:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.370 --> 00:44:54.380 align:start position:0%
I move
 
00:44:58.270 --> 00:44:58.280 align:start position:0%
hb603 in expedient to legislate
 
00:45:03.910 --> 00:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
okay representative seconds that so the
 
00:45:10.309 --> 00:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
motion is made by represent electus and
 
00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
second by
 
00:45:15.710 --> 00:45:15.720 align:start position:0%
um representative uh
 
00:45:17.990 --> 00:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
pedernal yeah
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
too much snow shoveling yesterday one
 
00:45:22.010 --> 00:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
and a half inches in a land
 
00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
that's enough
 
00:45:26.690 --> 00:45:26.700 align:start position:0%
um so uh remember I said we're gonna
 
00:45:29.329 --> 00:45:29.339 align:start position:0%
down to about one person's speak on this
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh represent Lucas would you like to
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion thank you
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
um there are a number of issues with
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
this one is being in operation for a
 
00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
minimum of one year prior to
 
00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:42.950 align:start position:0%
minimum of one year prior to
participation

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
participation
 
00:45:46.670 --> 00:45:46.680 align:start position:0%
and that really prevents
 
00:45:46.680 --> 00:45:47.569 align:start position:0%
and that really prevents
um

00:45:47.569 --> 00:45:47.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
places with good ideas or people with
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
good ideas for how to work with
 
00:45:57.770 --> 00:45:57.780 align:start position:0%
the esa students it prevents them the
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to even get started doing
 
00:45:59.940 --> 00:46:02.270 align:start position:0%
opportunity to even get started doing
that

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:04.910 --> 00:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
um but bigger than that is being an
 
00:46:06.890 --> 00:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
approved non-public school education
 
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:07.930 align:start position:0%
approved non-public school education
program

00:46:07.930 --> 00:46:07.940 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
and there are a lot of people who are
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
tutors and other
 
00:46:16.970 --> 00:46:16.980 align:start position:0%
programs that are not
 
00:46:16.980 --> 00:46:18.710 align:start position:0%
programs that are not
um

00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:21.050 --> 00:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
they're not actually
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
Schools they're individuals providing
 
00:46:27.770 --> 00:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
dyslexic you know
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
teaching for the dyslexic or just
 
00:46:37.790 --> 00:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
somebody coming in and teaching as I did
 
00:46:40.370 --> 00:46:40.380 align:start position:0%
for years math
 
00:46:43.370 --> 00:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
I was not a school I was a tutor but I
 
00:46:45.890 --> 00:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
was the math teacher for many homeschool
 
00:46:45.900 --> 00:46:46.910 align:start position:0%
was the math teacher for many homeschool
students

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:46:46.920 --> 00:46:51.109 align:start position:0%
students
so

00:46:51.109 --> 00:46:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
so basically I see a number and there
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
are other issues besides that but those
 
00:46:59.150 --> 00:46:59.160 align:start position:0%
really stand out right off the top so
 
00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:01.980 align:start position:0%
therefore I recommend it out thank you
 
00:47:04.550 --> 00:47:04.560 align:start position:0%
thank you uh further discussion
 
00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
represent Tanner
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:11.390 --> 00:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
I would just like to say that um
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're trying to put some
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
guard rails on on what's happening with
 
00:47:18.290 --> 00:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
all the things that are going on out
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
there in the EFA world and I I go back
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
to Croydon where
 
00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:27.540 align:start position:0%
um all of a sudden they were faced with
 
00:47:29.329 --> 00:47:29.339 align:start position:0%
the the parents in the community were
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
faced with Brenda that was sponsored by
 
00:47:33.890 --> 00:47:33.900 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:47:35.930 --> 00:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
State Department of Education
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
and prenda is led by guides
 
00:47:42.530 --> 00:47:42.540 align:start position:0%
and the qualification for the guides
 
00:47:45.589 --> 00:47:45.599 align:start position:0%
are to be 18 years of age or older and
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
have CPR training
 
00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:50.870 align:start position:0%
have CPR training
period

00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:52.430 --> 00:47:52.440 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:47:55.130 --> 00:47:55.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know about you but
 
00:47:58.430 --> 00:47:58.440 align:start position:0%
um that seems awfully awfully weak
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
to me for
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
um taxpayer resourced funds
 
00:48:07.010 --> 00:48:07.020 align:start position:0%
for accountability
 
00:48:09.349 --> 00:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
so I think these these things that were
 
00:48:11.510 --> 00:48:11.520 align:start position:0%
offered in this bill
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
um were to try to put some guard rails
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
that that at least something had to be
 
00:48:21.230 --> 00:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
in uh like Apprentice organization had
 
00:48:24.290 --> 00:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
to be in business for a year I think
 
00:48:27.170 --> 00:48:27.180 align:start position:0%
that that's not a huge huge
 
00:48:30.470 --> 00:48:30.480 align:start position:0%
um ask and I think it's not a huge ask
 
00:48:31.930 --> 00:48:31.940 align:start position:0%
to ask that
 
00:48:35.710 --> 00:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
other places that are whether they are
 
00:48:39.309 --> 00:48:39.319 align:start position:0%
schools or they are quotation schools
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
not only need to comply with all state
 
00:48:44.089 --> 00:48:44.099 align:start position:0%
and federal anti-discrimination laws but
 
00:48:45.950 --> 00:48:45.960 align:start position:0%
they need to have meet the health and
 
00:48:50.870 --> 00:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
safety standards and codes and also the
 
00:48:53.210 --> 00:48:53.220 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks which I have
 
00:48:56.150 --> 00:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
pushed on several other bills as well so

representative Damon yes chairman Ladd
no

00:51:14.710 --> 00:51:14.720 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.670 align:start position:0%
no
is

00:51:16.670 --> 00:51:16.680 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:51:18.829 --> 00:51:18.839 align:start position:0%
all right so I'm assuming that
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner you will write on
 
00:51:24.290 --> 00:51:24.300 align:start position:0%
behalf of the OTP and represent leckis
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
you will write on behalf of the itl
 
00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:30.420 align:start position:0%
the next bill we're going to do is
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
similar and so we'll have a similar
 
00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:34.250 align:start position:0%
similar and so we'll have a similar
structure

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
structure
 
00:51:41.930 --> 00:51:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
and that's a bill that deals with the uh
 
00:51:47.329 --> 00:51:47.339 align:start position:0%
upon termination of an account the money
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
immediately goes back to the uh
 
00:51:52.250 --> 00:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
um that's it and a nutshell
 
00:51:56.329 --> 00:51:56.339 align:start position:0%
um so with that I'd look to
 
00:51:59.450 --> 00:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli for a motion
 
00:52:01.510 --> 00:52:01.520 align:start position:0%
uh yes I move
 
00:52:07.370 --> 00:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
itl on House Bill 621. is there a second
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on the floor put forth
 
00:52:11.930 --> 00:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
by representative cordelli itl and
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
second by representative Belcher
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
representative Cardella you recognize
 
00:52:19.730 --> 00:52:19.740 align:start position:0%
her discussion uh thank you
 
00:52:25.730 --> 00:52:25.740 align:start position:0%
um I believe that uh parts of this bill
 
00:52:28.790 --> 00:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
um were Incorporated in a previous Bill
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
the May to shall for instance
 
00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.030 align:start position:0%
the May to shall for instance
um

00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:38.890 --> 00:52:38.900 align:start position:0%
I think the problem for many of us
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
was with the section about students
 
00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:45.420 align:start position:0%
enrolling in a resident District public
 
00:52:47.390 --> 00:52:47.400 align:start position:0%
school and the immediate termination of
 
00:52:51.170 --> 00:52:51.180 align:start position:0%
the EFA and remaining funds being
 
00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
transferred right back to the education
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund and the possibility that
 
00:52:58.690 --> 00:52:58.700 align:start position:0%
there are outstanding
 
00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:00.920 align:start position:0%
payments in process
 
00:53:06.530 --> 00:53:06.540 align:start position:0%
that would be uh problematic if the EFA
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
further discussion from yes representing
 
00:53:16.309 --> 00:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh Luna sure thank you thank you very
 
00:53:19.490 --> 00:53:19.500 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and um and you know unlike
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
the the last bill in fact unlike all of
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
the um the the bills with respect to um
 
00:53:27.650 --> 00:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts this is a
 
00:53:30.890 --> 00:53:30.900 align:start position:0%
bipartisan Bill and um or has bipartisan
 
00:53:34.849 --> 00:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
sponsorship and um and this bill is
 
00:53:37.490 --> 00:53:37.500 align:start position:0%
actually word for word the same as a
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
bill that was um that was introduced uh
 
00:53:43.430 --> 00:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
by um uh by a member of the Republican
 
00:53:48.290 --> 00:53:48.300 align:start position:0%
caucus uh two years ago and um and had
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
um again had in fact it was all
 
00:53:54.530 --> 00:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
Republican sponsorship on um uh on that
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm not quite sure why the
 
00:54:00.710 --> 00:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
language had um
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
had uh uh Republican support
 
00:54:07.730 --> 00:54:07.740 align:start position:0%
last year but but at least in the the
 
00:54:10.549 --> 00:54:10.559 align:start position:0%
comments leading up to the the exec on
 
00:54:14.569 --> 00:54:14.579 align:start position:0%
this bill May likely fail to get a
 
00:54:16.190 --> 00:54:16.200 align:start position:0%
republican support at least in this
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
committee this year but um but to to
 
00:54:21.410 --> 00:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
address a couple of the points that
 
00:54:25.809 --> 00:54:25.819 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli made uh this um
 
00:54:29.809 --> 00:54:29.819 align:start position:0%
621 does tighten up on the requirement
 
00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:34.680 align:start position:0%
for um that'd be good the um the private
 
00:54:37.490 --> 00:54:37.500 align:start position:0%
contractor to refer suspected cases of
 
00:54:40.190 --> 00:54:40.200 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds to the attorney general
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
changes the word may to shall yes there
 
00:54:44.809 --> 00:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
is another bill that does that but the
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
other Bill still requires the contractor
 
00:54:51.710 --> 00:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
to determine that the misuse was was uh
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
was uh with intent which is not
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
something that the Department of Justice
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
usually has a contractor do this is
 
00:55:02.329 --> 00:55:02.339 align:start position:0%
something that the Department of Justice
 
00:55:05.089 --> 00:55:05.099 align:start position:0%
does so it does keep the bar for
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
substantial misuse that could be defined
 
00:55:10.010 --> 00:55:10.020 align:start position:0%
in rules but it gets rid of the word
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
intentional uh which uh which we think
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
is um is a barrier
 
00:55:17.339 --> 00:55:19.790 align:start position:0%
is um is a barrier
to

00:55:19.790 --> 00:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
the state determining
 
00:55:25.190 --> 00:55:25.200 align:start position:0%
um if if there's been any Mis fraudulent
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds in this program
 
00:55:27.599 --> 00:55:28.849 align:start position:0%
misuse of funds in this program
so

00:55:28.849 --> 00:55:28.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
so that's a that's a key that's a key
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
different difference and I think a very
 
00:55:36.530 --> 00:55:36.540 align:start position:0%
uh important uh Improvement to put some
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
guard rails on on this program uh and
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
prevent fraud
 
00:55:44.890 --> 00:55:44.900 align:start position:0%
as far as the as far as the other um
 
00:55:48.370 --> 00:55:48.380 align:start position:0%
cases yep it certainly tightens up uh
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
EFA payment Provisions when a student
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
enrolls is a full-time full-time student
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
and again language comes completely from
 
00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
what was presented by um by
 
00:56:03.890 --> 00:56:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative Hamm uh uh last year so
 
00:56:07.309 --> 00:56:07.319 align:start position:0%
um so anyway I'm hoping we can you know
 
00:56:09.950 --> 00:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
see to it and and maybe get some
 
00:56:12.829 --> 00:56:12.839 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for this bill by
 
00:56:15.470 --> 00:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
having some bipartisan support to defeat
 
00:56:18.250 --> 00:56:18.260 align:start position:0%
the itl motion thank you very much
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:58:59.089 --> 00:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
the next bill which I'd like to go to we
 
00:59:01.789 --> 00:59:01.799 align:start position:0%
did just get uh Jennifer Ford brought
 
00:59:04.190 --> 00:59:04.200 align:start position:0%
them to us the Amendments for the
 
00:59:06.349 --> 00:59:06.359 align:start position:0%
amendment for 452.
 
00:59:08.089 --> 00:59:08.099 align:start position:0%
this is a bill dealing with school
 
00:59:10.010 --> 00:59:10.020 align:start position:0%
building aid application process so
 
00:59:11.569 --> 00:59:11.579 align:start position:0%
we're going to hand these things around
 
00:59:11.579 --> 00:59:19.309 align:start position:0%
we're going to hand these things around
here

00:59:19.309 --> 00:59:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.329 --> 00:59:44.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:44.339 --> 01:00:02.089 align:start position:0%
 
nothing

01:00:02.089 --> 01:00:02.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:04.549 --> 01:00:04.559 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy
 
01:00:04.559 --> 01:00:06.130 align:start position:0%
does everybody have a copy
foreign

01:00:06.130 --> 01:00:06.140 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
changes in this as you recall on Friday
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
last week we had a subcommittee working
 
01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799 align:start position:0%
on uh the whole process in which we
 
01:00:20.630 --> 01:00:20.640 align:start position:0%
invited in uh doe to that uh looking at
 
01:00:23.150 --> 01:00:23.160 align:start position:0%
the timeline for submitting applications
 
01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:25.380 align:start position:0%
right through the through to the in
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
completing the process when they're
 
01:00:29.510 --> 01:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
awarded that's been changed and I think
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
we pretty much went over that even when
 
01:00:34.250 --> 01:00:34.260 align:start position:0%
we the bill was introduced in hearing
 
01:00:36.530 --> 01:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
but one of the changes which we had
 
01:00:38.630 --> 01:00:38.640 align:start position:0%
superintendent Taylor I believe from
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
Cobra came down and worked with us on
 
01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.370 align:start position:0%
Cobra came down and worked with us on
Friday

01:00:42.370 --> 01:00:42.380 align:start position:0%
Friday
 
01:00:45.530 --> 01:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
and that as you recall there are three
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
school districts receiving School
 
01:00:49.990 --> 01:00:50.000 align:start position:0%
building a grants in the next biennium
 
01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:52.740 align:start position:0%
depending upon money being allocated in
 
01:00:54.190 --> 01:00:54.200 align:start position:0%
that budget and
 
01:00:58.609 --> 01:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
we hope there is uh the schools
 
01:01:01.309 --> 01:01:01.319 align:start position:0%
receiving them or uh down in the
 
01:01:01.319 --> 01:01:02.890 align:start position:0%
receiving them or uh down in the
Rochester

01:01:02.890 --> 01:01:02.900 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
inadnock and Colebrook not necessarily
 
01:01:07.450 --> 01:01:07.460 align:start position:0%
in that order but those are the three
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
and we were discussing uh superintendent
 
01:01:13.870 --> 01:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
Taylor's District which is Colebrook
 
01:01:17.089 --> 01:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
and they just recently have had to close
 
01:01:18.770 --> 01:01:18.780 align:start position:0%
down their High School the old Academy
 
01:01:23.210 --> 01:01:23.220 align:start position:0%
building was built 100 years ago or so
 
01:01:26.930 --> 01:01:26.940 align:start position:0%
and it became just plain obsolete to
 
01:01:29.030 --> 01:01:29.040 align:start position:0%
provide the types of services which are
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
necessary especially when they're
 
01:01:33.049 --> 01:01:33.059 align:start position:0%
shipping their students across the river
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
to Canaan for Career Technical education
 
01:01:39.890 --> 01:01:39.900 align:start position:0%
and the CTE program over in uh Canaan
 
01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:41.460 align:start position:0%
although it's providing many fine
 
01:01:43.430 --> 01:01:43.440 align:start position:0%
programs it's not providing all the
 
01:01:47.030 --> 01:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
programs necessary in Colebrook and as
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
you know cobrook's way up North on the
 
01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
line and a lot of Industry up there
 
01:01:55.430 --> 01:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
depends upon forestry upon the woods and
 
01:01:58.609 --> 01:01:58.619 align:start position:0%
diesel mechanics and diesel work on
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
these vehicles be it a tractor or be it
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
even a lawnmower and that's one of the
 
01:02:05.750 --> 01:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
programs they they don't offer across in
 
01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
Canaan that they want to bring back
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
across the river to cobra
 
01:02:11.630 --> 01:02:11.640 align:start position:0%
and so they're looking at also
 
01:02:15.049 --> 01:02:15.059 align:start position:0%
incorporating CTE within this school
 
01:02:17.329 --> 01:02:17.339 align:start position:0%
and that's been supported by the
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
department of education but also
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
providing the space for the various high
 
01:02:23.510 --> 01:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
school required courses to be taught
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
properly where you're trying to do it in
 
01:02:27.349 --> 01:02:27.359 align:start position:0%
a school which was designed originally
 
01:02:30.470 --> 01:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
for Apple upper levels of of elementary
 
01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:33.720 align:start position:0%
school middle school and not for the the
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
courses that are now required so the new
 
01:02:39.109 --> 01:02:39.119 align:start position:0%
school is going to be a renovation of
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
the current did everybody get a copy
 
01:02:44.089 --> 01:02:44.099 align:start position:0%
do you have a copy of the amendment okay
 
01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:48.260 align:start position:0%
so what we want to do is ensure that the
 
01:02:50.690 --> 01:02:50.700 align:start position:0%
Cobra doesn't get knocked off the list
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
and why they came down here
 
01:02:55.670 --> 01:02:55.680 align:start position:0%
why superintendent Taylor came here is
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
that there was an indication that the
 
01:02:59.750 --> 01:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
three point something million dollars
 
01:03:02.510 --> 01:03:02.520 align:start position:0%
which they're receiving they've also had
 
01:03:05.329 --> 01:03:05.339 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to receive a private
 
01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
grant money to do this from the
 
01:03:09.109 --> 01:03:09.119 align:start position:0%
charitable people up there over two
 
01:03:10.730 --> 01:03:10.740 align:start position:0%
million dollars is coming in from one
 
01:03:10.740 --> 01:03:12.109 align:start position:0%
million dollars is coming in from one
benefactor

01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
benefactor
 
01:03:14.150 --> 01:03:14.160 align:start position:0%
that's that's two-thirds of that whole
 
01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:15.170 align:start position:0%
that's that's two-thirds of that whole
cost

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:15.180 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:03:17.210 --> 01:03:17.220 align:start position:0%
but we have in legislation if you look
 
01:03:21.530 --> 01:03:21.540 align:start position:0%
on page one on lines three and four
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
funds received from federal grants or
 
01:03:25.849 --> 01:03:25.859 align:start position:0%
grants from other state programs shall
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
be subtracted from the total project
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
costs when Computing grants under this
 
01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
paragraph that's a change
 
01:03:34.789 --> 01:03:34.799 align:start position:0%
but the the ability and the what the law
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
currently says if you get it from
 
01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:38.940 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts or grants such as that
 
01:03:41.690 --> 01:03:41.700 align:start position:0%
from private donations that's subtracted
 
01:03:44.089 --> 01:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
from the amount of the grant
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
and we all looked at that and said wow
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
we don't really understand why that's in
 
01:03:50.329 --> 01:03:50.339 align:start position:0%
there with the charitable trust we
 
01:03:52.250 --> 01:03:52.260 align:start position:0%
understand the state and the federal
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
grants things should be taken off but
 
01:03:58.370 --> 01:03:58.380 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this aspect uh no and
 
01:04:00.950 --> 01:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
so it was a unanimous recommendation
 
01:04:04.370 --> 01:04:04.380 align:start position:0%
from the subcommittee to move forward in
 
01:04:06.650 --> 01:04:06.660 align:start position:0%
in a strike out those four words which
 
01:04:08.809 --> 01:04:08.819 align:start position:0%
were four or five words which would have
 
01:04:11.390 --> 01:04:11.400 align:start position:0%
restricted them from using and using the
 
01:04:14.329 --> 01:04:14.339 align:start position:0%
2 million to uh to disallow the the
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
amount being subtracted from the Grant
 
01:04:17.650 --> 01:04:17.660 align:start position:0%
from the state
 
01:04:21.530 --> 01:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
and secondly there was language in there
 
01:04:22.910 --> 01:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
which dealt with the school building
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
authority and some of the
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the school building
 
01:04:27.770 --> 01:04:27.780 align:start position:0%
authority as you know in school building
 
01:04:29.870 --> 01:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
in statute right now the school building
 
01:04:32.089 --> 01:04:32.099 align:start position:0%
authority is a group that's comprised of
 
01:04:34.910 --> 01:04:34.920 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal State Treasurer
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and three
 
01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:41.040 align:start position:0%
other folks uh appointed by the um uh
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
governor of which uh represent a hill is
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
the chair of that particular group that
 
01:04:50.270 --> 01:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
group is really tasked to ensure that in
 
01:04:52.549 --> 01:04:52.559 align:start position:0%
in the allocation of State dollars out
 
01:04:54.470 --> 01:04:54.480 align:start position:0%
to various functions or cost is that
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
there's enough bonding power available
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
within the local to ensure that the the
 
01:05:00.230 --> 01:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
match is going to occur the financial
 
01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:02.900 align:start position:0%
status is strong
 
01:05:06.349 --> 01:05:06.359 align:start position:0%
and there was language that was put in
 
01:05:08.569 --> 01:05:08.579 align:start position:0%
here initially to ensure that the
 
01:05:11.030 --> 01:05:11.040 align:start position:0%
schools receiving this would also have
 
01:05:12.890 --> 01:05:12.900 align:start position:0%
to uh that would be a responsibility
 
01:05:15.530 --> 01:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
School building authority The Way It Was
 
01:05:17.329 --> 01:05:17.339 align:start position:0%
Written it really didn't make much sense
 
01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
the so the language in your reverts back
 
01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:22.140 align:start position:0%
to exactly how it was in the past that
 
01:05:24.650 --> 01:05:24.660 align:start position:0%
they go in and they verify the ranking
 
01:05:26.870 --> 01:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
that comes to them from the Department
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
of Education if the ranking is then uh
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
seen as similar then their report goes
 
01:05:34.910 --> 01:05:34.920 align:start position:0%
back to do in onto the State Board of
 
01:05:38.089 --> 01:05:38.099 align:start position:0%
Education for approval if there's a
 
01:05:39.710 --> 01:05:39.720 align:start position:0%
difference there then there's a process
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
for hearings which can go on so those
 
01:05:45.109 --> 01:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
are the changes within this amending
 
01:05:47.630 --> 01:05:47.640 align:start position:0%
language that also includes the dates in
 
01:05:51.109 --> 01:05:51.119 align:start position:0%
which you know we must comply in and and
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh looking at uh the applications which
 
01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
come uh in the past the the school
 
01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
districts are notified of a grant on
 
01:06:03.470 --> 01:06:03.480 align:start position:0%
January 15th and that gave very little
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
time for them to get their warrant
 
01:06:07.069 --> 01:06:07.079 align:start position:0%
article put together in confirmation
 
01:06:09.890 --> 01:06:09.900 align:start position:0%
that that you know they it's indicating
 
01:06:12.650 --> 01:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
that they were would also put on the
 
01:06:14.210 --> 01:06:14.220 align:start position:0%
article and say they're going after this
 
01:06:18.230 --> 01:06:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh this grant now is uh released to the
 
01:06:20.569 --> 01:06:20.579 align:start position:0%
public uh in the preceding school year
 
01:06:23.510 --> 01:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
by November 15th I believe the date is
 
01:06:27.010 --> 01:06:27.020 align:start position:0%
and so I give some time for the uh um
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
mechanics of the school district to
 
01:06:31.849 --> 01:06:31.859 align:start position:0%
function in terms of uh going forward
 
01:06:33.890 --> 01:06:33.900 align:start position:0%
with these grants and also allows them
 
01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
to build a warrant article based upon
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
um if if contingency upon money being
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
approved by the local
 
01:06:43.730 --> 01:06:43.740 align:start position:0%
so that's the nature of this
 
01:06:47.089 --> 01:06:47.099 align:start position:0%
um of this uh Amendment which we have
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
which it replaces the entire bill
 
01:06:50.280 --> 01:06:51.950 align:start position:0%
which it replaces the entire bill
so

01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:54.890 --> 01:06:54.900 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to put a motion forward of
 
01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
OTP on this particular I shouldn't have
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
done all the discussion before the
 
01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:01.140 align:start position:0%
motion was put before I apologize trying
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
to get things done quickly today putting
 
01:07:06.170 --> 01:07:06.180 align:start position:0%
a horse the cart ahead of the horse uh
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
so HP 450 452 I hand the gamble over to
 
01:07:11.450 --> 01:07:11.460 align:start position:0%
you represent cordelli and the next
 
01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.289 align:start position:0%
you represent cordelli and the next
OTP

01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
OTP
 
01:07:14.450 --> 01:07:14.460 align:start position:0%
OTP is the motion
 
01:07:16.130 --> 01:07:16.140 align:start position:0%
um is there a second
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
second second by representative Ford
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
um I think you have your discussion I
 
01:07:24.890 --> 01:07:24.900 align:start position:0%
have no further discussion thank you uh
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
yes representative I have a question let
 
01:07:28.730 --> 01:07:28.740 align:start position:0%
me just ask representative Ford first
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
representative Ford did you have
 
01:07:32.029 --> 01:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
anything dead no representative Cornell
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
would this be in time for Colebrook to
 
01:07:36.049 --> 01:07:36.059 align:start position:0%
still get
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
okay yes we looked into that and that's
 
01:07:41.089 --> 01:07:41.099 align:start position:0%
correct because the budget's approved at
 
01:07:42.770 --> 01:07:42.780 align:start position:0%
a certain time and at the same time this
 
01:07:45.529 --> 01:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
is done so it'd be in place in law that
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner
 
01:07:53.930 --> 01:07:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you I have um just a couple of
 
01:07:56.690 --> 01:07:56.700 align:start position:0%
questions or one one comment that it
 
01:07:58.250 --> 01:07:58.260 align:start position:0%
seemed like in a couple of places
 
01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.170 align:start position:0%
seemed like in a couple of places
there's

01:08:00.170 --> 01:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:08:02.510 --> 01:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
um duplication
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
um for example in section one paragraph
 
01:08:08.870 --> 01:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
a is then duplicated again down in line
 
01:08:11.809 --> 01:08:11.819 align:start position:0%
17 18 and 19.
 
01:08:14.450 --> 01:08:14.460 align:start position:0%
um and there's another spot that as I
 
01:08:15.650 --> 01:08:15.660 align:start position:0%
was reading and I thought I've already
 
01:08:18.169 --> 01:08:18.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:22.849 --> 01:08:22.859 align:start position:0%
um I guess what I'm asking is that uh
 
01:08:25.550 --> 01:08:25.560 align:start position:0%
changed now and it's from from
 
01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
experience that um
 
01:08:30.709 --> 01:08:30.719 align:start position:0%
this a couple of the schools that I was
 
01:08:32.630 --> 01:08:32.640 align:start position:0%
representing in my last term
 
01:08:36.890 --> 01:08:36.900 align:start position:0%
had where uh the initial
 
01:08:36.900 --> 01:08:38.090 align:start position:0%
had where uh the initial
um

01:08:38.090 --> 01:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:39.970 --> 01:08:39.980 align:start position:0%
the initial
 
01:08:44.209 --> 01:08:44.219 align:start position:0%
submission of the project uh it seems
 
01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:45.050 align:start position:0%
submission of the project uh it seems
like

01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:08:48.410 --> 01:08:48.420 align:start position:0%
is not reviewed by anyone else other
 
01:08:52.010 --> 01:08:52.020 align:start position:0%
than the commissioner and that
 
01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.689 align:start position:0%
than the commissioner and that
um

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:57.169 --> 01:08:57.179 align:start position:0%
and there's another spot where uh if if
 
01:08:59.209 --> 01:08:59.219 align:start position:0%
the emergency projects are are
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
recommended by the commissioner so the
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
commissioner seems to be a real big
 
01:09:06.829 --> 01:09:06.839 align:start position:0%
gatekeeper in this and that's where
 
01:09:08.930 --> 01:09:08.940 align:start position:0%
they seem to have a bottleneck the last
 
01:09:11.030 --> 01:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
time they they actually had a lot of
 
01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.769 align:start position:0%
time they they actually had a lot of
confusion

01:09:12.769 --> 01:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
confusion
 
01:09:12.779 --> 01:09:13.370 align:start position:0%
confusion
um

01:09:13.370 --> 01:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:16.249 --> 01:09:16.259 align:start position:0%
project applications were returned to
 
01:09:20.269 --> 01:09:20.279 align:start position:0%
them with new updated requirements that
 
01:09:23.329 --> 01:09:23.339 align:start position:0%
weren't in the original requirements
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
um and they were very frustrated with
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
that and I'm just wondering
 
01:09:29.209 --> 01:09:29.219 align:start position:0%
I see the that you have the
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
Commissioners the gatekeeper before it
 
01:09:34.249 --> 01:09:34.259 align:start position:0%
even gets to the State Building Aid uh
 
01:09:35.689 --> 01:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
Authority and then the State Building
 
01:09:38.570 --> 01:09:38.580 align:start position:0%
Aid Authority there's an overview by the
 
01:09:41.329 --> 01:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
school board the state school board for
 
01:09:43.729 --> 01:09:43.739 align:start position:0%
the ranking I see that kind of division
 
01:09:46.189 --> 01:09:46.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if maybe
 
01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:47.269 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering if maybe
um

01:09:47.269 --> 01:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
should be considered that there's a more
 
01:09:54.980 --> 01:09:54.990 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily oversight but
 
01:09:54.990 --> 01:09:55.430 align:start position:0%
uh not necessarily oversight but
[Music]

01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.209 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:09:56.209 --> 01:09:56.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:59.090 --> 01:09:59.100 align:start position:0%
looking at it looking at projects
 
01:10:01.130 --> 01:10:01.140 align:start position:0%
by a few people other than just the
 
01:10:02.570 --> 01:10:02.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the at the very
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
beginning of the whole process
 
01:10:09.050 --> 01:10:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh I I can respond to that the the word
 
01:10:12.650 --> 01:10:12.660 align:start position:0%
Commissioners used in Prior law as well
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
um it's it's when the commissioner
 
01:10:16.610 --> 01:10:16.620 align:start position:0%
receives these applications that's
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
that's when we talk about the department
 
01:10:19.970 --> 01:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
on grants such as the commissioner
 
01:10:23.450 --> 01:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
receives but on this particular area
 
01:10:26.570 --> 01:10:26.580 align:start position:0%
right here the project all the projects
 
01:10:29.930 --> 01:10:29.940 align:start position:0%
are then reviewed by the by Amy Clark
 
01:10:32.290 --> 01:10:32.300 align:start position:0%
and and Company
 
01:10:36.110 --> 01:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
which is Amy Clark and Amy Clark and and
 
01:10:40.130 --> 01:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh uh it's it's and then they're
 
01:10:42.890 --> 01:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
presented back and they're reviewed by
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
the department and then they're sent to
 
01:10:48.530 --> 01:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
the school building authority
 
01:10:50.870 --> 01:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
um that's the the balance within this
 
01:10:52.910 --> 01:10:52.920 align:start position:0%
whole process in terms of emergency
 
01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.890 align:start position:0%
whole process in terms of emergency
projects

01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:10:57.110 --> 01:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
um I was part of an emergency project
 
01:10:59.450 --> 01:10:59.460 align:start position:0%
when our roof was not good at the Middle
 
01:11:01.490 --> 01:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
School in Haverhill and we were off
 
01:11:03.050 --> 01:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
cycle we couldn't go through the whole
 
01:11:05.450 --> 01:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
building application process to ensure
 
01:11:08.330 --> 01:11:08.340 align:start position:0%
you know all those those steps which are
 
01:11:11.090 --> 01:11:11.100 align:start position:0%
required we needed the money then and
 
01:11:13.250 --> 01:11:13.260 align:start position:0%
there because it was a safety issue we
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
were dealing with mold and everything in
 
01:11:16.970 --> 01:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
the attic and the roof was ready to cave
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
in so that's a responsibility of a
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
commercial the commissioner to and that
 
01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
those emergency projects are then looked
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
at by the engineer At Doe they go out
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
and look at them so
 
01:11:31.910 --> 01:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
Commissioners use but it's basically
 
01:11:34.910 --> 01:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's it's the department within or the
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
and I I had just brought to my attention
 
01:11:44.390 --> 01:11:44.400 align:start position:0%
here that there was another change which
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
didn't get into this I'm glad Amy's here
 
01:11:50.390 --> 01:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
today on line 14 on page one beginning
 
01:11:52.330 --> 01:11:52.340 align:start position:0%
January 1
 
01:11:55.850 --> 01:11:55.860 align:start position:0%
2025. it's not 23.
 
01:11:58.850 --> 01:11:58.860 align:start position:0%
yeah this all goes it starts on in in
 
01:12:02.689 --> 01:12:02.699 align:start position:0%
2025 so I've asked Jen to contact
 
01:12:02.699 --> 01:12:03.770 align:start position:0%
2025 so I've asked Jen to contact
UM

01:12:03.770 --> 01:12:03.780 align:start position:0%
UM
 
01:12:06.350 --> 01:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
and across the street here to get that
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
corrected because we want it that's
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
that's a you know a two-year change but
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
that's the way we had it and discussed
 
01:12:14.270 --> 01:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
it the other day in the work session as
 
01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:15.350 align:start position:0%
it the other day in the work session as
well

01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:12:18.350 --> 01:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
represent Myler yeah I was going to
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
raise the issue the January 1st
 
01:12:23.450 --> 01:12:23.460 align:start position:0%
is that a new date
 
01:12:25.669 --> 01:12:25.679 align:start position:0%
Amy do you have a second come up in in
 
01:12:28.209 --> 01:12:28.219 align:start position:0%
maybe these technical questions
 
01:12:31.610 --> 01:12:31.620 align:start position:0%
should come from the Department answers
 
01:12:34.070 --> 01:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
we've had in the past the problem of the
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
timing of when you've received the
 
01:12:39.290 --> 01:12:39.300 align:start position:0%
reports Etc so there's time to deal with
 
01:12:41.950 --> 01:12:41.960 align:start position:0%
this so that they get it into the spring
 
01:12:45.350 --> 01:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
building cycle Etc so it is the January
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
1st a new day is foreign can you back
 
01:12:50.510 --> 01:12:50.520 align:start position:0%
off just take us right through the whole
 
01:12:51.830 --> 01:12:51.840 align:start position:0%
process because we're backing off at
 
01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:53.400 align:start position:0%
least a half year on top of what you got
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
right now right sure um so for the
 
01:12:56.990 --> 01:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
record my name is Amy Clark with the
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
01:12:59.930 --> 01:12:59.940 align:start position:0%
um which the school building aid program
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
falls under my Bureau so just for the
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
first question is the original language
 
01:13:08.810 --> 01:13:08.820 align:start position:0%
you had in front of you was July of 2025
 
01:13:10.850 --> 01:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
and that presents a problem because
 
01:13:13.310 --> 01:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
later on there's a recommendation of
 
01:13:15.110 --> 01:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
April they have to submit the
 
01:13:17.930 --> 01:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
application in April before so it really
 
01:13:20.270 --> 01:13:20.280 align:start position:0%
has to become effective before July
 
01:13:21.770 --> 01:13:21.780 align:start position:0%
because I need to submit an application
 
01:13:24.169 --> 01:13:24.179 align:start position:0%
in April so the work session talked
 
01:13:25.850 --> 01:13:25.860 align:start position:0%
about changing that to January which is
 
01:13:28.370 --> 01:13:28.380 align:start position:0%
suitable but it would be January 2025
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
because we rank the projects
 
01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
um and so if
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
so the timeline is being changed in this
 
01:13:40.790 --> 01:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
for this proposal instead of application
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
Apple applicants applying a year and a
 
01:13:46.130 --> 01:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
half in advance so right now
 
01:13:47.870 --> 01:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
I think the best way to explain this is
 
01:13:50.570 --> 01:13:50.580 align:start position:0%
if people were applying right now for
 
01:13:52.850 --> 01:13:52.860 align:start position:0%
building aid for today's for the budget
 
01:13:54.950 --> 01:13:54.960 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about right now they
 
01:13:57.649 --> 01:13:57.659 align:start position:0%
currently had to apply last summer and
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
then they wait and then they're trying
 
01:14:01.430 --> 01:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
to go to Warren article but they don't
 
01:14:03.590 --> 01:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
know what the state budget is right now
 
01:14:05.810 --> 01:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
and it causes a lot of problems for
 
01:14:07.850 --> 01:14:07.860 align:start position:0%
schools because they have no idea what
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
the state budget looks like so
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
this bill pushes it up so if we were
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
here two years from now and you all are
 
01:14:16.490 --> 01:14:16.500 align:start position:0%
talking about the state budget those
 
01:14:19.310 --> 01:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
applicants would be applying now
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
um and so that when money comes they get
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
ranked by November and they can go to
 
01:14:26.990 --> 01:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
their voters with the amount of Aid
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
um that the state would be available to
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
them so it doesn't push them back it
 
01:14:35.630 --> 01:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
actually pushes them forward by several
 
01:14:38.810 --> 01:14:38.820 align:start position:0%
months uh so if that was what you were
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
looking for yes go ahead so uh back to
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
to the issue that representative Tanner
 
01:14:43.620 --> 01:14:45.050 align:start position:0%
to the issue that representative Tanner
raised

01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
raised
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
um talk share with us would you how the
 
01:14:52.669 --> 01:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
process is for review and so the the
 
01:14:55.810 --> 01:14:55.820 align:start position:0%
application arrives at the department
 
01:14:59.870 --> 01:14:59.880 align:start position:0%
correct what happens to it so um in the
 
01:15:01.970 --> 01:15:01.980 align:start position:0%
current law applications come to the
 
01:15:04.310 --> 01:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Education in July last
 
01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:06.900 align:start position:0%
summer we've taken those applications
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
we've reviewed them for completeness
 
01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:10.620 align:start position:0%
then the Department of Education my
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
group I have three of us that go in and
 
01:15:14.570 --> 01:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
we review the projects we visit all the
 
01:15:16.490 --> 01:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
schools we rank them according to the
 
01:15:18.229 --> 01:15:18.239 align:start position:0%
criteria that's in the law and the rules
 
01:15:21.050 --> 01:15:21.060 align:start position:0%
and then we present that ranking we
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
score them we present that ranking to
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
the school building authority in
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
December then
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
the school building authority verifies
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
our ranking make sure that we're doing
 
01:15:31.250 --> 01:15:31.260 align:start position:0%
the things that we're supposed to be
 
01:15:33.649 --> 01:15:33.659 align:start position:0%
doing and then they submit that list to
 
01:15:35.930 --> 01:15:35.940 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education in January
 
01:15:38.990 --> 01:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
which would been this last January uh
 
01:15:40.729 --> 01:15:40.739 align:start position:0%
and then the J the State Board of
 
01:15:42.950 --> 01:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
Education publishes that list so that
 
01:15:46.130 --> 01:15:46.140 align:start position:0%
schools know excuse me I should have
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
some water uh schools should know uh
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
where they are on the list by January
 
01:15:52.310 --> 01:15:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then of course they have warrant
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
articles going on right now uh and
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
without knowing what the state budget is
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
they're asking their voters for
 
01:16:00.470 --> 01:16:00.480 align:start position:0%
something that's really difficult to do
 
01:16:01.729 --> 01:16:01.739 align:start position:0%
because they don't know how much money
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to give them and then the
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
state budget is approved hopefully by
 
01:16:08.810 --> 01:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
July 1st okay so just as a follow-up to
 
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
comments so it says in here that the
 
01:16:13.970 --> 01:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall accept so my
 
01:16:17.810 --> 01:16:17.820 align:start position:0%
presumption is I don't mean to be uh so
 
01:16:20.169 --> 01:16:20.179 align:start position:0%
specific here but the application
 
01:16:22.610 --> 01:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
arrives at the department
 
01:16:25.070 --> 01:16:25.080 align:start position:0%
correct now it goes does it go
 
01:16:27.169 --> 01:16:27.179 align:start position:0%
immediately it says application for
 
01:16:29.330 --> 01:16:29.340 align:start position:0%
building Aid doesn't go to immediately
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
to your desk or does it go to the
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner's Nest then to your desk at
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%
what point in time does the commissioner
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
actually see the rankings and ultimately
 
01:16:41.570 --> 01:16:41.580 align:start position:0%
gets involved and is it after you guys
 
01:16:45.590 --> 01:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
your your team has dealt with this right
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
I mean um yeah so
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect to our
 
01:16:50.340 --> 01:16:51.770 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect to our
commissioner

01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
um he's not really involved in the
 
01:16:56.209 --> 01:16:56.219 align:start position:0%
ranking process it comes to my program
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
and we rank the projects correct
 
01:17:01.189 --> 01:17:01.199 align:start position:0%
that's why we have an engineer doing
 
01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
just like you said they're my key
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
process do you have your mic on like
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
representative you said the ranking
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
process what I've what I was under the
 
01:17:21.890 --> 01:17:21.900 align:start position:0%
understanding was it was in the
 
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
accepting process that there was an
 
01:17:24.179 --> 01:17:26.270 align:start position:0%
accepting process that there was an
issue

01:17:26.270 --> 01:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:17:28.250 --> 01:17:28.260 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what applications you're
 
01:17:31.550 --> 01:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
talking about is there do you want to
 
01:17:33.530 --> 01:17:33.540 align:start position:0%
um give that information I can answer a
 
01:17:34.970 --> 01:17:34.980 align:start position:0%
little bit of that what we have in law
 
01:17:36.890 --> 01:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
right now they have to be accepted but
 
01:17:38.570 --> 01:17:38.580 align:start position:0%
they're only going to be accepted if
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
they're complete we don't uh accept
 
01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
parts of an application that's what Amy
 
01:17:47.810 --> 01:17:47.820 align:start position:0%
does so they are going to the department
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
underneath the commissioner's name
 
01:17:51.470 --> 01:17:51.480 align:start position:0%
saying he's the you know the the
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
commissioner of that department but
 
01:17:55.370 --> 01:17:55.380 align:start position:0%
immediately they they funnel directly to
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
this this person right here who will
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
then sort through them to make sure they
 
01:18:02.990 --> 01:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
are complete if they're not complete you
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
know they're the the district's called
 
01:18:05.689 --> 01:18:05.699 align:start position:0%
it and said get your act together get
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
all components all elements filled out
 
01:18:09.410 --> 01:18:09.420 align:start position:0%
on this thing
 
01:18:11.330 --> 01:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
um we have you know I have rejected a
 
01:18:12.530 --> 01:18:12.540 align:start position:0%
couple of applications for
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
incompleteness um usually they're
 
01:18:16.430 --> 01:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
egregious like it says we'll we'll
 
01:18:17.750 --> 01:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
provide information we'll provide
 
01:18:20.149 --> 01:18:20.159 align:start position:0%
information we'll provide information
 
01:18:22.250 --> 01:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
um and we can't we're ready to rank our
 
01:18:24.290 --> 01:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
window is tight they have to be complete
 
01:18:26.510 --> 01:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
applications per the law
 
01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
applications per the law
um

01:18:27.350 --> 01:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:29.630 --> 01:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
that you know they have to be complete
 
01:18:31.610 --> 01:18:31.620 align:start position:0%
applications but I have rejected a
 
01:18:33.649 --> 01:18:33.659 align:start position:0%
couple of applications because they have
 
01:18:35.750 --> 01:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
not been complete again I don't know any
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
other specifics but yes go ahead is
 
01:18:42.770 --> 01:18:42.780 align:start position:0%
um the historical nature of the school
 
01:18:44.630 --> 01:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
building does it have anything to do
 
01:18:46.970 --> 01:18:46.980 align:start position:0%
with the application or
 
01:18:49.669 --> 01:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
um the decision whether to to go with it
 
01:18:53.169 --> 01:18:53.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:55.850 --> 01:18:55.860 align:start position:0%
are you talking about um sorry to sound
 
01:18:57.350 --> 01:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
ignorant here are you talking about like
 
01:18:59.209 --> 01:18:59.219 align:start position:0%
historical like meaning the historic
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
folks like we do do a historic check on
 
01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
those applications well like for
 
01:19:05.870 --> 01:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
resources Colebrook or I think you said
 
01:19:08.330 --> 01:19:08.340 align:start position:0%
was 100 years old and you know some of
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
these other buildings that are over 100
 
01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
years old that may have historic do they
 
01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:16.260 align:start position:0%
need historical
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
review or whatever it is right they do
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
um so I want to just make sure that
 
01:19:22.729 --> 01:19:22.739 align:start position:0%
you're really talking about like um the
 
01:19:24.530 --> 01:19:24.540 align:start position:0%
historical folks so
 
01:19:26.630 --> 01:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
um I wish I could remember their names
 
01:19:28.250 --> 01:19:28.260 align:start position:0%
because they're so important um so
 
01:19:29.570 --> 01:19:29.580 align:start position:0%
there's an organization at the state
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
that reviews
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
um the historical
 
01:19:35.689 --> 01:19:35.699 align:start position:0%
um components of the building because
 
01:19:38.090 --> 01:19:38.100 align:start position:0%
that does play a rank a role in ranking
 
01:19:41.270 --> 01:19:41.280 align:start position:0%
so if your building was so old and they
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
had some
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
um resource there whether it was a a
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
landmark or something then you can get
 
01:19:51.169 --> 01:19:51.179 align:start position:0%
points for the ranking for preserving
 
01:19:53.570 --> 01:19:53.580 align:start position:0%
that Landmark but it doesn't if you
 
01:19:56.209 --> 01:19:56.219 align:start position:0%
don't have anything specific then they
 
01:19:58.550 --> 01:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
just don't get points for that category
 
01:20:00.950 --> 01:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:03.649 --> 01:20:03.659 align:start position:0%
yes represent luno so thank you very
 
01:20:06.470 --> 01:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
much Mr chair and um Amy I was wondering
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
if you could uh talk a little bit about
 
01:20:13.010 --> 01:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
the um the the changes with respect to
 
01:20:17.149 --> 01:20:17.159 align:start position:0%
the um the school building authority and
 
01:20:19.550 --> 01:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
also I noticed there's a
 
01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.149 align:start position:0%
also I noticed there's a
um

01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
the amendment deletes um a statutory
 
01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:27.169 align:start position:0%
the amendment deletes um a statutory
reference

01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:29.450 --> 01:20:29.460 align:start position:0%
um not from yeah I'm just getting this
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean I was there at the work
 
01:20:34.310 --> 01:20:34.320 align:start position:0%
session with you all but um so right
 
01:20:36.110 --> 01:20:36.120 align:start position:0%
where the
 
01:20:38.570 --> 01:20:38.580 align:start position:0%
right where
 
01:20:42.530 --> 01:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
the um in the timeline I'm just trying
 
01:20:44.450 --> 01:20:44.460 align:start position:0%
to find it here
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
are you talking about on page two around
 
01:20:49.370 --> 01:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:54.950 --> 01:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
the amendment yeah it's
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
it's yes it is right at the right at the
 
01:21:11.580 --> 01:21:13.010 align:start position:0%
it's yes it is right at the right at the
top

01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
top
 
01:21:15.649 --> 01:21:15.659 align:start position:0%
um of page two right before the the
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
reference to August 1st each year
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
so it's actually sort of at the bottom
 
01:21:26.870 --> 01:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:31.430 --> 01:21:31.440 align:start position:0%
the school building authority so line 32
 
01:21:34.250 --> 01:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
very bottom of the amendment
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
um where the end of the line goes to the
 
01:21:39.130 --> 01:21:39.140 align:start position:0%
school building authority it used to say
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
established pursuant to RSA 195 C
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
and that part's been removed
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:21:50.990 --> 01:21:51.000 align:start position:0%
the the
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
it you know I'm not I'm not familiar
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
with with I mean I was just looking at
 
01:21:58.209 --> 01:21:58.219 align:start position:0%
the at the text of
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
198.15c which is the section of law that
 
01:22:04.189 --> 01:22:04.199 align:start position:0%
this is in but the school building
 
01:22:07.790 --> 01:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
authority is defined in 195 C so a
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
and I don't know if there's a another
 
01:22:22.010 --> 01:22:22.020 align:start position:0%
statutory reference back to 1 195 C or
 
01:22:25.490 --> 01:22:25.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:29.030 --> 01:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
so is it the reference of 195 C that is
 
01:22:31.490 --> 01:22:31.500 align:start position:0%
no longer there well in this thing in
 
01:22:34.669 --> 01:22:34.679 align:start position:0%
the in the bill in 452 on page three
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
line 22 you've got the reference to RSA
 
01:22:38.159 --> 01:22:40.189 align:start position:0%
line 22 you've got the reference to RSA
195c

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:40.199 align:start position:0%
195c
 
01:22:40.199 --> 01:22:42.169 align:start position:0%
195c
um

01:22:42.169 --> 01:22:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:45.050 --> 01:22:45.060 align:start position:0%
along with the first
 
01:22:47.090 --> 01:22:47.100 align:start position:0%
um refer the first time the school
 
01:22:49.430 --> 01:22:49.440 align:start position:0%
building authority you know as the
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
school building authorities sort of
 
01:22:54.050 --> 01:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
brought into this timeline process
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
um and then that statutory reference is
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
removed in the amendment and I was just
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
wondering if is that was that is there a
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
reason for deleting that reference or
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
not that I not that I know of I mean it
 
01:23:07.430 --> 01:23:07.440 align:start position:0%
may be as good to clarify that the
 
01:23:09.169 --> 01:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
school building authority is defined in
 
01:23:11.810 --> 01:23:11.820 align:start position:0%
195c right so the amendment's missing
 
01:23:11.820 --> 01:23:13.149 align:start position:0%
195c right so the amendment's missing
that

01:23:13.149 --> 01:23:13.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:23:15.649 --> 01:23:15.659 align:start position:0%
I I if again it's the first time I'm
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
seeing it so just now um but uh if it
 
01:23:22.189 --> 01:23:22.199 align:start position:0%
was there before and it's not now uh and
 
01:23:26.149 --> 01:23:26.159 align:start position:0%
it references 195c 195c is the
 
01:23:27.530 --> 01:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
definition of the school building
 
01:23:29.450 --> 01:23:29.460 align:start position:0%
authority and what members are on there
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
so it probably would be
 
01:23:34.070 --> 01:23:34.080 align:start position:0%
um good to have it referencing who that
 
01:23:35.330 --> 01:23:35.340 align:start position:0%
defining who the school building
 
01:23:37.729 --> 01:23:37.739 align:start position:0%
authority is so so I mean we've got to
 
01:23:40.550 --> 01:23:40.560 align:start position:0%
the the amendment's going back to OLS
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
anyway for the effective date right yeah
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
they could be you know pursuant to 195.
 
01:23:46.790 --> 01:23:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah just put just you know just so
 
01:23:48.890 --> 01:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
nothing I know I've I've talked with
 
01:23:50.990 --> 01:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
Jeff about that and where it says School
 
01:23:53.750 --> 01:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
building authority if they get a
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
definition automatically would reference
 
01:23:57.709 --> 01:23:57.719 align:start position:0%
back right but there's no harm in
 
01:24:01.189 --> 01:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
putting in I know that the referencing
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
that statue it says nothing about school
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
building Aid within that just it gives
 
01:24:06.890 --> 01:24:06.900 align:start position:0%
you a definition of what the
 
01:24:08.930 --> 01:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of the school building
 
01:24:11.510 --> 01:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
authority are right we hijacked this
 
01:24:14.330 --> 01:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
terminology we when we initially put
 
01:24:16.970 --> 01:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
together School building Aid knowing
 
01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
that we'd like to have a check and
 
01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:21.900 align:start position:0%
balance in the process and this provides
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
a check and balance
 
01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:25.860 align:start position:0%
um we're on the road to you know trying
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
to look at this whole program which we
 
01:24:29.930 --> 01:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
do need to do
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
um uh seeing that the school building
 
01:24:34.250 --> 01:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
authorities initial
 
01:24:36.350 --> 01:24:36.360 align:start position:0%
um establishment was not for this
 
01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:37.490 align:start position:0%
um establishment was not for this
purpose

01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:24:40.430 --> 01:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
uh it was for other purposes which are
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
established back in that that section of
 
01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:45.480 align:start position:0%
law you're referencing so we were
 
01:24:47.209 --> 01:24:47.219 align:start position:0%
looking at that time a third-party
 
01:24:49.610 --> 01:24:49.620 align:start position:0%
organization that existed and the school
 
01:24:51.649 --> 01:24:51.659 align:start position:0%
building authority has not been very
 
01:24:54.110 --> 01:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
active over the years at all
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
um so um we selected it and used it
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
um so they bring together the treasure
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
the State Fire Marshal and the
 
01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner plus others to do this
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
review all they're doing basically
 
01:25:11.990 --> 01:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
looking at did doe file the procedure
 
01:25:14.930 --> 01:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
that was established with all the
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
criteria and all that
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
um and they verify that's all they're
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
doing it's going almost like in not a
 
01:25:22.850 --> 01:25:22.860 align:start position:0%
rubber stamp but they're supposed to
 
01:25:25.970 --> 01:25:25.980 align:start position:0%
ensure that the process was filed and
 
01:25:27.350 --> 01:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
the school building authority would love
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
to I know to do either more or even less
 
01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh you know depending upon who's
 
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
chairing that organization right now
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
right but I want to you know I think
 
01:25:37.669 --> 01:25:37.679 align:start position:0%
it's important that the school building
 
01:25:40.669 --> 01:25:40.679 align:start position:0%
authority is certainly following its um
 
01:25:43.250 --> 01:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
uh statutory obligations because they're
 
01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
they're critical they're critical
 
01:25:45.600 --> 01:25:46.850 align:start position:0%
they're critical they're critical
um

01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:47.450 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:25:47.450 --> 01:25:47.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:50.630 --> 01:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
you know point in the timeline is there
 
01:25:52.130 --> 01:25:52.140 align:start position:0%
a critical point in the timeline and
 
01:25:54.050 --> 01:25:54.060 align:start position:0%
they do have a critical Mission which
 
01:25:55.610 --> 01:25:55.620 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to be doing as well so
 
01:25:58.550 --> 01:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
I have no objections to pursuant two
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
yeah being injected yeah I just want to
 
01:26:03.770 --> 01:26:03.780 align:start position:0%
make sure 195 and 198 are being sort of
 
01:26:05.810 --> 01:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
connected through this see there was
 
01:26:08.330 --> 01:26:08.340 align:start position:0%
some concern when we met on Friday that
 
01:26:11.390 --> 01:26:11.400 align:start position:0%
the language that we had in the uh many
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
the other previous uh what was the
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
purpose of the school building authority
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
people really didn't understand what it
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
was doing there so we left it supposedly
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
with the same task which we have to
 
01:26:27.110 --> 01:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
verify uh evidently the established
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
person went to what's important well we
 
01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
took we took out the amendment does take
 
01:26:35.330 --> 01:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
out the um the verify the the
 
01:26:37.010 --> 01:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
um the applications
 
01:26:39.890 --> 01:26:39.900 align:start position:0%
um ability to pay debt
 
01:26:41.629 --> 01:26:41.639 align:start position:0%
you know the amount of the borrowing
 
01:26:43.850 --> 01:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
appears to be within the financial means
 
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
and available resources of the school
 
01:26:47.689 --> 01:26:47.699 align:start position:0%
district that's come out right that's
 
01:26:50.570 --> 01:26:50.580 align:start position:0%
that's also ditto from the school that
 
01:26:52.189 --> 01:26:52.199 align:start position:0%
the area we're pursuing right we're
 
01:26:54.229 --> 01:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
seeing pursuant two uh it does say
 
01:26:55.790 --> 01:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
School District but it says everything
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:03.350 --> 01:27:03.360 align:start position:0%
and um let me see if I had any I I mean
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
I think the I think the big the biggest
 
01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
change is the one right up front with as
 
01:27:10.370 --> 01:27:10.380 align:start position:0%
far as um what gets um yeah exactly what
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
what what gets credited against the uh
 
01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:16.199 align:start position:0%
the the the state the school building
 
01:27:18.950 --> 01:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
aid grant so no longer gifts are no
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
longer credited against that so um so
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
and uh only federal and state grants
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
which I think are both are appropriate
 
01:27:28.370 --> 01:27:28.380 align:start position:0%
to be credited against
 
01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
State Grant yeah and you can see in the
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
original bill in line 16 on page one
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
where it says funds received from
 
01:27:40.070 --> 01:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
charitable trust bequest gifts insurance
 
01:27:43.490 --> 01:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
policies that was struck yes result
 
01:27:45.890 --> 01:27:45.900 align:start position:0%
that's the section which was struck and
 
01:27:48.350 --> 01:27:48.360 align:start position:0%
then and then another another section to
 
01:27:51.950 --> 01:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
uh another section as well and I'm
 
01:27:54.530 --> 01:27:54.540 align:start position:0%
trying to see where it refers
 
01:27:56.530 --> 01:27:56.540 align:start position:0%
um on
 
01:28:00.110 --> 01:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
on page three line four
 
01:28:02.570 --> 01:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
you've got a
 
01:28:02.580 --> 01:28:04.550 align:start position:0%
you've got a
uh

01:28:04.550 --> 01:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:28:10.850 --> 01:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:15.370 --> 01:28:15.380 align:start position:0%
that makes a change from
 
01:28:18.169 --> 01:28:18.179 align:start position:0%
applications with substantial
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
deficiencies you know that clearly is is
 
01:28:23.990 --> 01:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:28:27.290 --> 01:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
um screened light strained language
 
01:28:27.300 --> 01:28:27.890 align:start position:0%
um screened light strained language
um

01:28:27.890 --> 01:28:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
whether it's referring to Applications
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
with deficiencies or or facilities with
 
01:28:36.169 --> 01:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and I think it I think D
 
01:28:38.930 --> 01:28:38.940 align:start position:0%
corrects that in the amendment
 
01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
was there anything else that that was
 
01:28:47.270 --> 01:28:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:49.370 --> 01:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
well I think Amy can best you know if
 
01:28:53.030 --> 01:28:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
applications if you have the three that
 
01:28:58.129 --> 01:28:58.139 align:start position:0%
are approved now that leaves 14 other
 
01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:00.900 align:start position:0%
applications which have not been funded
 
01:29:02.810 --> 01:29:02.820 align:start position:0%
now you get into another round of
 
01:29:02.820 --> 01:29:04.550 align:start position:0%
now you get into another round of
applying

01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
applying
 
01:29:07.910 --> 01:29:07.920 align:start position:0%
and where do the 14 are they going to be
 
01:29:10.729 --> 01:29:10.739 align:start position:0%
going forward in that order or if
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
there's another one all of synthesis
 
01:29:15.830 --> 01:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
very severe situation can that jump
 
01:29:18.770 --> 01:29:18.780 align:start position:0%
those other 14 and go to the top because
 
01:29:22.250 --> 01:29:22.260 align:start position:0%
of the severe that's right yes
 
01:29:23.930 --> 01:29:23.940 align:start position:0%
and some of that stuff comes out of
 
01:29:27.470 --> 01:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
building codes and that's why that that
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph D I think is so important yeah
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure it's still doing
 
01:29:32.159 --> 01:29:33.410 align:start position:0%
and I want to make sure it's still doing
its

01:29:33.410 --> 01:29:33.420 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
so so on my end yes I mean the um the
 
01:29:39.410 --> 01:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
just right above that is clearly states
 
01:29:41.030 --> 01:29:41.040 align:start position:0%
that those that were approved on that
 
01:29:44.930 --> 01:29:44.940 align:start position:0%
November 10th uh 2022 list uh which is
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
the list of 17 that you keep hearing
 
01:29:49.729 --> 01:29:49.739 align:start position:0%
about those projects will fall in line
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
first and then this process will take
 
01:29:54.229 --> 01:29:54.239 align:start position:0%
place with all the other applicants that
 
01:29:56.149 --> 01:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
fall behind it so just kind of keeps the
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
order but currently in Rule and we'll
 
01:30:02.810 --> 01:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
have to edit our rules to address a lot
 
01:30:05.330 --> 01:30:05.340 align:start position:0%
of these timeline changes but we
 
01:30:07.850 --> 01:30:07.860 align:start position:0%
currently the way you jump people in
 
01:30:10.250 --> 01:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
line you can jump people in line but you
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
have to meet a higher Life Safety
 
01:30:13.970 --> 01:30:13.980 align:start position:0%
conditions you have to meet more than
 
01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
half of the points plus you also have to
 
01:30:17.629 --> 01:30:17.639 align:start position:0%
have higher points than the people that
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
you jump so there is there wills and
 
01:30:22.010 --> 01:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
probably should still be a way to jump
 
01:30:25.610 --> 01:30:25.620 align:start position:0%
those that are in line uh and also
 
01:30:27.649 --> 01:30:27.659 align:start position:0%
um this Authority allowing us to
 
01:30:29.450 --> 01:30:29.460 align:start position:0%
continue to rule make could further
 
01:30:32.209 --> 01:30:32.219 align:start position:0%
Define what those emergency projects are
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
I think representative Tanner was
 
01:30:36.050 --> 01:30:36.060 align:start position:0%
talking about earlier to more clearly
 
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
Define what is considered a emergency
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
project and the Department of Education
 
01:30:42.890 --> 01:30:42.900 align:start position:0%
right now uses emergency projects that
 
01:30:44.270 --> 01:30:44.280 align:start position:0%
are like defined in the public school
 
01:30:46.149 --> 01:30:46.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund is a clear
 
01:30:48.830 --> 01:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
definition set the State Fire Marshal
 
01:30:52.430 --> 01:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
office uses as imminent danger and
 
01:30:55.129 --> 01:30:55.139 align:start position:0%
Life's a substantial Life Safety risks
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
so there's already definitions in fire
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
code that talk about an emergency it's
 
01:31:03.470 --> 01:31:03.480 align:start position:0%
not an emergency because of
 
01:31:03.480 --> 01:31:04.610 align:start position:0%
not an emergency because of
um

01:31:04.610 --> 01:31:04.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
because your windows have are you know
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
are not well insulated you know it's
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
really very specific life safety danger
 
01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:14.209 align:start position:0%
really very specific life safety danger
issues

01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:18.830 --> 01:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay we're not going to be able to
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
really go much farther with it until we
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
yes please pursuant to the chapter
 
01:31:30.600 --> 01:31:32.229 align:start position:0%
yes please pursuant to the chapter
law

01:31:32.229 --> 01:31:32.239 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
and then 2025 rather than 23
 
01:31:42.410 --> 01:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
yes yes the primary reason why we'd like
 
01:31:44.090 --> 01:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
to see this thing go through is the
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
timeline the time right now is just too
 
01:31:50.270 --> 01:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
much of a pinch on school districts as
 
01:31:52.010 --> 01:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
well as trying to review these
 
01:31:54.350 --> 01:31:54.360 align:start position:0%
applications and we're not giving the
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
department adequate time to really
 
01:31:57.890 --> 01:31:57.900 align:start position:0%
review properly
 
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
and there's a lot more we got to do with
 
01:32:02.450 --> 01:32:02.460 align:start position:0%
school bowling a there's a huge amount
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
that we have to work on in terms of you
 
01:32:07.129 --> 01:32:07.139 align:start position:0%
know some conceptual things you might be
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
considering as that
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
we have a number of projects which are
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
three million dollars and less or
 
01:32:13.980 --> 01:32:16.490 align:start position:0%
three million dollars and less or
thereabouts

01:32:16.490 --> 01:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
thereabouts
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
we have some projects which are huge
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
dollars and they can suck everything out
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
of what we appropriate in one given year
 
01:32:25.129 --> 01:32:25.139 align:start position:0%
and there's no no way we're going to
 
01:32:27.649 --> 01:32:27.659 align:start position:0%
ever get to the other 14 projects
 
01:32:30.530 --> 01:32:30.540 align:start position:0%
and so there's been discussion whether
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
we should have several different pots
 
01:32:35.629 --> 01:32:35.639 align:start position:0%
available for the renovation maybe
 
01:32:37.610 --> 01:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
smaller amounts of reservation maybe
 
01:32:38.629 --> 01:32:38.639 align:start position:0%
even through the public school
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund as a separate pot
 
01:32:44.090 --> 01:32:44.100 align:start position:0%
where we've had upwards to 40.3 million
 
01:32:46.490 --> 01:32:46.500 align:start position:0%
dollars in that fund it if you total all
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
the money we spent
 
01:32:50.689 --> 01:32:50.699 align:start position:0%
so there all these issues have to be
 
01:32:52.669 --> 01:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
discussed there's a lot more to it but
 
01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:54.780 align:start position:0%
it's the feeling of the department I'm
 
01:32:56.450 --> 01:32:56.460 align:start position:0%
not going to speak for Amy but I've
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
heard over and over the timeline has to
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
be changed and that's the primary goal
 
01:33:04.250 --> 01:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
of this right here
 
01:33:08.030 --> 01:33:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.950 --> 01:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
so what we'll do is we'll try it wait
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
until that comes in
 
01:33:12.239 --> 01:33:14.330 align:start position:0%
until that comes in
um

01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.310 --> 01:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the other bills which we
 
01:33:20.149 --> 01:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:21.649 --> 01:33:21.659 align:start position:0%
you still haven't gotten anything back
 
01:33:27.830 --> 01:33:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:31.490 --> 01:33:31.500 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about 6 40.
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
yeah we we had some we had called the
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
department someone
 
01:33:35.880 --> 01:33:39.729 align:start position:0%
department someone
um

01:33:39.729 --> 01:33:39.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
Lisa who was uh here and provided
 
01:33:47.090 --> 01:33:47.100 align:start position:0%
testimony during that okay okay so okay
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
now we do have uh 354 still also
 
01:33:58.260 --> 01:34:02.450 align:start position:0%
now we do have uh 354 still also
um

01:34:02.450 --> 01:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.910 --> 01:34:04.920 align:start position:0%
I know we have differing positions on
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
that but uh maybe what we can do is take
 
01:34:10.129 --> 01:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
advantage of the moment right here and
 
01:34:13.250 --> 01:34:13.260 align:start position:0%
have some discussion on 354 without
 
01:34:15.530 --> 01:34:15.540 align:start position:0%
putting something on on the table here
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
for action
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
and so that's what I'd like to do is
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
jump to that this is um
 
01:34:24.290 --> 01:34:24.300 align:start position:0%
similar topic appropriating School
 
01:34:26.629 --> 01:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
building support for Charter Public
 
01:34:26.639 --> 01:34:30.950 align:start position:0%
building support for Charter Public
Schools

01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
um we have
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
I believe it's somewhere around two
 
01:34:36.590 --> 01:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
charter schools which are owned by the
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
charter school
 
01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:42.420 align:start position:0%
um so those would be eligible for uh Aid
 
01:34:45.890 --> 01:34:45.900 align:start position:0%
based upon the 30 percent that we but
 
01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
there's some that we have in the school
 
01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:49.860 align:start position:0%
building uh construction side here but
 
01:34:53.510 --> 01:34:53.520 align:start position:0%
there's also other issues uh which we
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
have to address on that
 
01:34:57.290 --> 01:34:57.300 align:start position:0%
um they are a public school they are
 
01:34:59.689 --> 01:34:59.699 align:start position:0%
dreadfully in need of fundings to
 
01:34:59.699 --> 01:35:01.250 align:start position:0%
dreadfully in need of fundings to
support

01:35:01.250 --> 01:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
um but there's also the issues that's
 
01:35:05.629 --> 01:35:05.639 align:start position:0%
sort of affiliated with the school
 
01:35:07.250 --> 01:35:07.260 align:start position:0%
building authority is tasked to do
 
01:35:10.129 --> 01:35:10.139 align:start position:0%
that's also with the
 
01:35:12.830 --> 01:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
um the charter school so I'm just going
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:19.850 --> 01:35:19.860 align:start position:0%
let's just discuss this a little bit
 
01:35:21.890 --> 01:35:21.900 align:start position:0%
more representative Tanner
 
01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:26.580 align:start position:0%
thank you um thank you I don't I I would
 
01:35:28.729 --> 01:35:28.739 align:start position:0%
wonder how this actually
 
01:35:33.410 --> 01:35:33.420 align:start position:0%
um is affected or Not by the fact that
 
01:35:35.209 --> 01:35:35.219 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about the dissolution
 
01:35:38.090 --> 01:35:38.100 align:start position:0%
of charter schools and some of the
 
01:35:40.490 --> 01:35:40.500 align:start position:0%
issues with that if they're incurring
 
01:35:40.500 --> 01:35:41.629 align:start position:0%
issues with that if they're incurring
debt

01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
debt
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
um through this building Aid
 
01:35:46.729 --> 01:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
um and we've talked about I there's
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
another bill that that we've reviewed
 
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:49.790 align:start position:0%
another bill that that we've reviewed
about

01:35:49.790 --> 01:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:35:52.370 --> 01:35:52.380 align:start position:0%
um working with the dissolution of
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
property of just how
 
01:35:58.189 --> 01:35:58.199 align:start position:0%
if a charter school incurs that how that
 
01:36:00.890 --> 01:36:00.900 align:start position:0%
when if if and when they have to just
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
dissolve how that actually is
 
01:36:05.149 --> 01:36:05.159 align:start position:0%
accomplished and and what kind of
 
01:36:07.490 --> 01:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
problems might occur with building Aid
 
01:36:09.290 --> 01:36:09.300 align:start position:0%
on that
 
01:36:11.390 --> 01:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's a good topic to be
 
01:36:13.610 --> 01:36:13.620 align:start position:0%
discussing with this uh we do know that
 
01:36:16.490 --> 01:36:16.500 align:start position:0%
in if it's a school district that takes
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
the building Aid and then decides to
 
01:36:21.229 --> 01:36:21.239 align:start position:0%
close the building down five years after
 
01:36:22.910 --> 01:36:22.920 align:start position:0%
they've taken that they're responsible
 
01:36:24.649 --> 01:36:24.659 align:start position:0%
for paying every nickel and dime and
 
01:36:25.910 --> 01:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
Penny back
 
01:36:28.729 --> 01:36:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh to the state that they received in
 
01:36:31.310 --> 01:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
school building Aid they have to have it
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
in place for 20 years
 
01:36:35.689 --> 01:36:35.699 align:start position:0%
and and and then if they close it down
 
01:36:37.850 --> 01:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
in the 21st year they don't of course
 
01:36:40.250 --> 01:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
if the bond stayed off
 
01:36:43.790 --> 01:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
so in terms of a Charter Public School
 
01:36:47.149 --> 01:36:47.159 align:start position:0%
that's an issue which you know has the
 
01:36:49.310 --> 01:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
need for discussion
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
represent miler
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yeah I think I think
 
01:36:57.229 --> 01:36:57.239 align:start position:0%
this uh bill is premature uh
 
01:36:58.850 --> 01:36:58.860 align:start position:0%
because of some of the things
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner to talk about but
 
01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.000 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of the dissolution and
 
01:37:04.310 --> 01:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
there's also a question of what the
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
status of building Aid is in general
 
01:37:08.450 --> 01:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
now we don't know where that's going to
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
go and so it was it would seem to me
 
01:37:12.179 --> 01:37:13.129 align:start position:0%
go and so it was it would seem to me
um

01:37:13.129 --> 01:37:13.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:14.990 --> 01:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
that we should
 
01:37:18.110 --> 01:37:18.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not into italing this but
 
01:37:20.570 --> 01:37:20.580 align:start position:0%
to at least retain the bill
 
01:37:22.910 --> 01:37:22.920 align:start position:0%
and put it into the whole group that
 
01:37:24.350 --> 01:37:24.360 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with when we start talking
 
01:37:26.149 --> 01:37:26.159 align:start position:0%
about Charter Schools when we look at
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
the uh the disposition of charter
 
01:37:31.729 --> 01:37:31.739 align:start position:0%
schools if they should happen to close
 
01:37:32.870 --> 01:37:32.880 align:start position:0%
Etc so
 
01:37:36.229 --> 01:37:36.239 align:start position:0%
to deal this in isolation
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
I think is a mistake and it needs to
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
have more con consideration particularly
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
as it relates to how does this relate
 
01:37:49.790 --> 01:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
how does this fit into all the other
 
01:37:52.189 --> 01:37:52.199 align:start position:0%
requests that we've had I mean we had I
 
01:37:55.610 --> 01:37:55.620 align:start position:0%
think Amy said we had like 15 17 bills
 
01:37:59.209 --> 01:37:59.219 align:start position:0%
this or 17 requests this last year and
 
01:38:01.669 --> 01:38:01.679 align:start position:0%
we only could fund three
 
01:38:02.930 --> 01:38:02.940 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
um it just seems to me Mr chair this is
 
01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:07.739 align:start position:0%
a bit premature and that we if we can
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
just hold this and put this into the
 
01:38:12.350 --> 01:38:12.360 align:start position:0%
conversation as we deal with the other
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
issues that we're dealing with Charter
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
Schools as far as their stability and
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
where they're going to go forward and
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
again I I as I mentioned there are some
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
questions where building age is in
 
01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
general and so to pass this without that
 
01:38:29.930 --> 01:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
knowledge it seems to me to be premature
 
01:38:31.910 --> 01:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
further discussion yes representative
 
01:38:36.830 --> 01:38:36.840 align:start position:0%
luno yeah thank you very much Mr chair
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I I um I agree with what's been
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
been said on this I mean I I don't think
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
um I think I
 
01:38:47.689 --> 01:38:47.699 align:start position:0%
don't think itl is a good message to
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
send on this I think retain is that
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
would actually be a very strong message
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
to send on it that that this committee
 
01:38:56.930 --> 01:38:56.940 align:start position:0%
takes takes this matter very seriously
 
01:38:59.689 --> 01:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
and wants to look into it because you
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
know I think from from from what we've
 
01:39:04.310 --> 01:39:04.320 align:start position:0%
um from what we've learned over the
 
01:39:06.950 --> 01:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
years too is that um Charter Public
 
01:39:10.129 --> 01:39:10.139 align:start position:0%
Schools and and and public schools don't
 
01:39:12.410 --> 01:39:12.420 align:start position:0%
necessarily operate on the same the same
 
01:39:14.570 --> 01:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
way they don't necessarily operate on
 
01:39:17.209 --> 01:39:17.219 align:start position:0%
the same timeline they they certainly
 
01:39:18.590 --> 01:39:18.600 align:start position:0%
have very different
 
01:39:20.030 --> 01:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
um governing
 
01:39:22.610 --> 01:39:22.620 align:start position:0%
um governance to them school board
 
01:39:28.689 --> 01:39:28.699 align:start position:0%
versus a a board of directors and um
 
01:39:32.229 --> 01:39:32.239 align:start position:0%
where's your original and I I
 
01:39:36.530 --> 01:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
and obviously a school District by
 
01:39:40.010 --> 01:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
virtue of its um uh you know taxing
 
01:39:42.830 --> 01:39:42.840 align:start position:0%
Authority has has a different
 
01:39:44.649 --> 01:39:44.659 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:39:47.629 --> 01:39:47.639 align:start position:0%
different ways to stabilize revenues
 
01:39:50.930 --> 01:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
that um and and and meet obligations
 
01:39:54.350 --> 01:39:54.360 align:start position:0%
different than um than than Charter
 
01:39:54.360 --> 01:39:55.790 align:start position:0%
different than um than than Charter
Schools

01:39:55.790 --> 01:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
Schools
 
01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:58.250 align:start position:0%
Schools
um

01:39:58.250 --> 01:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:00.890 --> 01:40:00.900 align:start position:0%
and I guess in in addition I'm not even
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
sure that the um that the provisions
 
01:40:07.430 --> 01:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
that are in uh house bill 452
 
01:40:09.770 --> 01:40:09.780 align:start position:0%
which of course rewrite substantial
 
01:40:14.689 --> 01:40:14.699 align:start position:0%
sections of 354. our um are necessarily
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
adaptable to to Charter Schools uh the
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
way they the way they apply to um to
 
01:40:25.070 --> 01:40:25.080 align:start position:0%
public schools so so I you know I'm I'm
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not against uh you know responsible
 
01:40:31.250 --> 01:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
way of of the state funding Charter
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
School building uh projects but I think
 
01:40:36.649 --> 01:40:36.659 align:start position:0%
we've got to look at it from a from you
 
01:40:38.629 --> 01:40:38.639 align:start position:0%
know how applicable is it for charter
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
schools so the timeline the process and
 
01:40:46.129 --> 01:40:46.139 align:start position:0%
and you know if we can get 452 which
 
01:40:48.830 --> 01:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
again is this exact same section Aloft
 
01:40:48.840 --> 01:40:50.810 align:start position:0%
again is this exact same section Aloft
uh

01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:54.649 --> 01:40:54.659 align:start position:0%
up and uh and running as this moratorium
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
is finally being lifted
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
um and we can we can get cracking on
 
01:41:01.550 --> 01:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
that and then and then work out some of
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
the I think the concerns that
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
representative Tanner and Miler you know
 
01:41:07.370 --> 01:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
talked about with respect to Charter
 
01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:09.659 align:start position:0%
dissolution uh and responsibilities
 
01:41:12.410 --> 01:41:12.420 align:start position:0%
there that um that that we could get
 
01:41:14.570 --> 01:41:14.580 align:start position:0%
something you know meaningful put in
 
01:41:16.910 --> 01:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
this place so you know I'm hoping the
 
01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
committee would would come along with
 
01:41:23.689 --> 01:41:23.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:23.699 --> 01:41:25.129 align:start position:0%
 
action

01:41:25.129 --> 01:41:25.139 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:41:28.250 --> 01:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
01:41:29.689 --> 01:41:29.699 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
01:41:31.129 --> 01:41:31.139 align:start position:0%
highlight that I think the biggest
 
01:41:33.470 --> 01:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
utility that I can see of this kind of
 
01:41:35.570 --> 01:41:35.580 align:start position:0%
program is that
 
01:41:38.270 --> 01:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
when a when a traditional Public School
 
01:41:40.250 --> 01:41:40.260 align:start position:0%
has more students coming in it
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
automatically has the money to do what's
 
01:41:44.090 --> 01:41:44.100 align:start position:0%
necessary to accommodate those students
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
but when I charter school they want more
 
01:41:47.930 --> 01:41:47.940 align:start position:0%
students to come in because they're
 
01:41:50.090 --> 01:41:50.100 align:start position:0%
successful well they still can only take
 
01:41:53.090 --> 01:41:53.100 align:start position:0%
so many because they're kind of hampered
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
by their ability to expand in this
 
01:41:57.590 --> 01:41:57.600 align:start position:0%
manner so I would see this as the
 
01:42:00.890 --> 01:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
ability for a successful Charter School
 
01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
successful being measured by obviously
 
01:42:04.790 --> 01:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
the parents continuing to send their
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
children there to be able to expand to
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
accommodate more students that way the
 
01:42:11.450 --> 01:42:11.460 align:start position:0%
lotteries can become a little bit more
 
01:42:13.250 --> 01:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
of a fair mechanism more people can come
 
01:42:17.689 --> 01:42:17.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:17.699 --> 01:42:21.649 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:42:21.649 --> 01:42:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:24.470 --> 01:42:24.480 align:start position:0%
I just had a question
 
01:42:27.410 --> 01:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's budget in the
 
01:42:31.629 --> 01:42:31.639 align:start position:0%
one-time money did he put money in
 
01:42:35.209 --> 01:42:35.219 align:start position:0%
towards this towards
 
01:42:38.209 --> 01:42:38.219 align:start position:0%
building aid for Charter Public Schools
 
01:42:41.629 --> 01:42:41.639 align:start position:0%
I put building Aid in for all schools
 
01:42:46.490 --> 01:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
all schools and he increased it to 75
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars which paralleled that
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
which we had approved here we had proved
 
01:42:57.290 --> 01:42:57.300 align:start position:0%
a bill where we appropriate 50 million
 
01:43:01.189 --> 01:43:01.199 align:start position:0%
dollars on top of the debt and the debt
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
for each year of the upcoming biennium
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
is approximately 25 million dollars each
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
rounded off
 
01:43:09.410 --> 01:43:09.420 align:start position:0%
uh we're very close so that comes up to
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
the 75 million dollars per year
 
01:43:14.390 --> 01:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
so that's that was put in a very similar
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
type language just written a little
 
01:43:18.350 --> 01:43:18.360 align:start position:0%
differently but no it wasn't earmarked
 
01:43:21.950 --> 01:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
for Charters or for you know this is all
 
01:43:24.830 --> 01:43:24.840 align:start position:0%
School building Aid okay and the issue
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
that we're looking at right now is that
 
01:43:29.330 --> 01:43:29.340 align:start position:0%
we basically
 
01:43:33.050 --> 01:43:33.060 align:start position:0%
um through the department have already
 
01:43:35.570 --> 01:43:35.580 align:start position:0%
it's not appropriated but allocated
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
tentatively that money towards those
 
01:43:40.669 --> 01:43:40.679 align:start position:0%
projects and those projects as you see
 
01:43:43.729 --> 01:43:43.739 align:start position:0%
on that 17 list I have a price tag
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
Associated but that may not be the price
 
01:43:48.530 --> 01:43:48.540 align:start position:0%
tag according to what I hear from Amy
 
01:43:50.990 --> 01:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
Clark that they look more specifically
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
at these and it may you know if they're
 
01:43:56.689 --> 01:43:56.699 align:start position:0%
not really if they're going Beyond some
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
of the areas within building something
 
01:44:00.290 --> 01:44:00.300 align:start position:0%
larger than they have to on the minimum
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
standards it'll be lesser money received
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
so there may be even there might could
 
01:44:08.350 --> 01:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
hypothetically be some left over to
 
01:44:11.390 --> 01:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
fund not maybe the full hole of a next
 
01:44:13.609 --> 01:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
project but some School District in that
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
list of 17 remaining 14 may choose to
 
01:44:18.410 --> 01:44:18.420 align:start position:0%
take you know a million and a half
 
01:44:20.450 --> 01:44:20.460 align:start position:0%
dollars first waiting for their three
 
01:44:22.550 --> 01:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
million dollar Grant maybe sometime in
 
01:44:24.649 --> 01:44:24.659 align:start position:0%
the future coming by either way
 
01:44:24.659 --> 01:44:26.270 align:start position:0%
the future coming by either way
yeah

01:44:26.270 --> 01:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so it wouldn't actually change the
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
timeline that a
 
01:44:37.129 --> 01:44:37.139 align:start position:0%
Charter Public School could get money if
 
01:44:40.510 --> 01:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:43.550 --> 01:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
retaining won't impact the money's not
 
01:44:45.530 --> 01:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
there right and it's not going to be
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
allocated until what uh we have January
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:50.890 align:start position:0%
allocated until what uh we have January
25

01:44:50.890 --> 01:44:50.900 align:start position:0%
25
 
01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
uh where the applications start coming
 
01:44:56.810 --> 01:44:56.820 align:start position:0%
in but we're still we're still in what
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
what fiscal year are we in and what part
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
of the biennium are we in at that time
 
01:45:03.169 --> 01:45:03.179 align:start position:0%
we're still dealing with monies that we
 
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
have we're doing right now that we
 
01:45:08.810 --> 01:45:08.820 align:start position:0%
haven't even approved yet in hb1
 
01:45:11.930 --> 01:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
so uh there is plenty of time
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
for a retention to occur because it's
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
not going to make any difference in
 
01:45:19.430 --> 01:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
terms of uh providing that money to the
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
the charter schools
 
01:45:23.930 --> 01:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
or any other schools for that matter
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
yeah represent my way just to pick up on
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
a point that representative Lino made
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
and one of the things the committee
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
hasn't looked at we've not had anybody
 
01:45:37.550 --> 01:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
come from a charter school to say okay
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
we want to build something
 
01:45:43.250 --> 01:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
they haven't shared with us about what
 
01:45:45.350 --> 01:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
the process they're going to use to get
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
the resources to do the building
 
01:45:50.330 --> 01:45:50.340 align:start position:0%
I mean as this this is this is a whole
 
01:45:53.330 --> 01:45:53.340 align:start position:0%
new territory for this committee and we
 
01:45:56.209 --> 01:45:56.219 align:start position:0%
just haven't had an opportunity to
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
really look at the sources of revenue
 
01:46:00.830 --> 01:46:00.840 align:start position:0%
that one might clearly individual
 
01:46:02.930 --> 01:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
contributions that would come in is one
 
01:46:04.490 --> 01:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
source that they could get for some
 
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
construction costs but we have a look to
 
01:46:09.590 --> 01:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
see we haven't even heard Bankers for
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
example how would the banks deal with uh
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
a charter school that has X number of
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
students they're going to look at their
 
01:46:20.030 --> 01:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
all of the revenue sources they have Etc
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
but we haven't we haven't had a chance
 
01:46:25.490 --> 01:46:25.500 align:start position:0%
to see oh this is how you can do it
 
01:46:27.649 --> 01:46:27.659 align:start position:0%
I mean it may be clear to some folks
 
01:46:29.149 --> 01:46:29.159 align:start position:0%
around the table a service hack isn't
 
01:46:31.669 --> 01:46:31.679 align:start position:0%
clear to me on how that might happen so
 
01:46:35.090 --> 01:46:35.100 align:start position:0%
that they've got a foundation that's uh
 
01:46:36.590 --> 01:46:36.600 align:start position:0%
secure enough that's going to be able to
 
01:46:38.810 --> 01:46:38.820 align:start position:0%
deal with the loan along with whatever
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
the state might so that's why I'm I
 
01:46:44.090 --> 01:46:44.100 align:start position:0%
guess I'm I'm talking myself more here
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
about the need to retain it because
 
01:46:47.990 --> 01:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
there's just so many questions out there
 
01:46:51.050 --> 01:46:51.060 align:start position:0%
before you actually say go forward with
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
this so uh I would hope you would look
 
01:46:54.890 --> 01:46:54.900 align:start position:0%
at that too thank you
 
01:46:57.649 --> 01:46:57.659 align:start position:0%
represent cordelli thank you
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I have been working a little bit with
 
01:47:03.649 --> 01:47:03.659 align:start position:0%
a charter school up uh in our area north
 
01:47:07.070 --> 01:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
star Charter that's been approved
 
01:47:09.250 --> 01:47:09.260 align:start position:0%
um by the state board
 
01:47:13.250 --> 01:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
and they are in the process of buying
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
the Old Courthouse in Ossipee
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire from the county which
 
01:47:25.010 --> 01:47:25.020 align:start position:0%
currently owns it has had been turned
 
01:47:27.770 --> 01:47:27.780 align:start position:0%
over to the local Historical Society for
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
many years they did not do much with the
 
01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:34.010 align:start position:0%
many years they did not do much with the
building

01:47:34.010 --> 01:47:34.020 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:47:34.020 --> 01:47:34.729 align:start position:0%
building
um

01:47:34.729 --> 01:47:34.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:39.050 --> 01:47:39.060 align:start position:0%
and so it is in need of repair the plan
 
01:47:41.270 --> 01:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the charter school
 
01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:42.169 align:start position:0%
of the charter school
um

01:47:42.169 --> 01:47:42.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
well the there I believe were the only
 
01:47:49.790 --> 01:47:49.800 align:start position:0%
bid for the building
 
01:47:49.800 --> 01:47:51.050 align:start position:0%
bid for the building
um

01:47:51.050 --> 01:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
it it is now being reviewed by county
 
01:47:56.930 --> 01:47:56.940 align:start position:0%
legal department as I recall
 
01:48:00.890 --> 01:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
um and uh the intent of the charter
 
01:48:04.729 --> 01:48:04.739 align:start position:0%
school is to they they've had
 
01:48:06.890 --> 01:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
um contractor looking at the building to
 
01:48:09.350 --> 01:48:09.360 align:start position:0%
see the extent of the renovations that
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
are required
 
01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:12.890 align:start position:0%
are required
um

01:48:12.890 --> 01:48:12.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:13.669 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:48:13.669 --> 01:48:13.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:16.609 --> 01:48:16.619 align:start position:0%
and their intent is to take out a
 
01:48:21.109 --> 01:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
mortgage and that is factored into their
 
01:48:23.930 --> 01:48:23.940 align:start position:0%
um their budget the amount of the uh
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
anticipated mortgage
 
01:48:30.950 --> 01:48:30.960 align:start position:0%
um but I I think the uh status right now
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
is waiting on Final uh County approval
 
01:48:41.890 --> 01:48:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.050 --> 01:48:45.060 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
01:48:47.330 --> 01:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair representative
 
01:48:52.310 --> 01:48:52.320 align:start position:0%
cordelli could I just inquire the school
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
that you were just referencing is it
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
currently operating in some other
 
01:49:00.609 --> 01:49:00.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:02.810 --> 01:49:02.820 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:49:05.090 --> 01:49:05.100 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just wondering what if
 
01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:09.719 align:start position:0%
anything is known in that process so far
 
01:49:12.290 --> 01:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
um about how they will get a mortgage I
 
01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:14.159 align:start position:0%
mean how will a bank review their
 
01:49:18.530 --> 01:49:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:23.090 --> 01:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I I don't have all those details
 
01:49:24.649 --> 01:49:24.659 align:start position:0%
I think is the best answer I can give
 
01:49:24.659 --> 01:49:27.290 align:start position:0%
I think is the best answer I can give
you

01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.450 --> 01:49:29.460 align:start position:0%

01:49:31.370 --> 01:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
we're really there's nothing on the
 
01:49:33.350 --> 01:49:33.360 align:start position:0%
table and what I'm going to do is going
 
01:49:35.689 --> 01:49:35.699 align:start position:0%

01:49:37.729 --> 01:49:37.739 align:start position:0%
received them in the back here and I
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
want to hand that out and see if it
 
01:49:43.129 --> 01:49:43.139 align:start position:0%
reflects what we had discussed earlier
 
01:49:44.330 --> 01:49:44.340 align:start position:0%

does
 
02:19:12.190 --> 02:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.570 --> 02:19:17.580 align:start position:0%

02:20:58.429 --> 02:20:58.439 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation director with the
 
02:21:00.889 --> 02:21:00.899 align:start position:0%
Department of Education

02:21:08.510 --> 02:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
sorry um I'm Lisa Henson hats the
 
02:21:10.550 --> 02:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
director for Vocational Rehabilitation
 
02:21:12.950 --> 02:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Education
 
02:21:14.809 --> 02:21:14.819 align:start position:0%
um this was a bill that um the
 
02:21:18.590 --> 02:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
department had wanted to uh move forward
 
02:21:22.190 --> 02:21:22.200 align:start position:0%
we had done some sort of updating of our
 
02:21:26.809 --> 02:21:26.819 align:start position:0%
Statute in 21 in 2021 and this was a
 
02:21:30.050 --> 02:21:30.060 align:start position:0%
part that we simply missed and what this
 
02:21:33.469 --> 02:21:33.479 align:start position:0%
part um spoke to in the old days
 
02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
um probably in the 80s and 90s before
 
02:21:39.230 --> 02:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
the workers compensation system changed
 
02:21:40.630 --> 02:21:40.640 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire
 
02:21:44.570 --> 02:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
if an individual received a workers comp
 
02:21:44.580 --> 02:21:46.670 align:start position:0%
if an individual received a workers comp
settlement

02:21:46.670 --> 02:21:46.680 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:21:48.530 --> 02:21:48.540 align:start position:0%
um then if they had been working with
 
02:21:50.830 --> 02:21:50.840 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation with the state
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
we could collect what we had spent on
 
02:21:56.330 --> 02:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
their case from that settlement
 
02:21:59.270 --> 02:21:59.280 align:start position:0%
and we this is not something that has
 
02:22:03.410 --> 02:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
been utilized at all um as at least in
 
02:22:06.230 --> 02:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
the last 15 years since I've been in
 
02:22:09.710 --> 02:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
leadership positions within the agency
 
02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:10.309 align:start position:0%
leadership positions within the agency
um

02:22:10.309 --> 02:22:10.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:22:13.490 --> 02:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
and the workers compensation system has
 
02:22:15.650 --> 02:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
changed they have their own Vocational
 
02:22:18.650 --> 02:22:18.660 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation team over there that work
 
02:22:20.809 --> 02:22:20.819 align:start position:0%
on anything that that has to do with a
 
02:22:20.819 --> 02:22:22.070 align:start position:0%
on anything that that has to do with a
settlement

02:22:22.070 --> 02:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:22:24.830 --> 02:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
um so so this was for us to really
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
repeal this from our statute so that
 
02:22:30.530 --> 02:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
um you know there's no need for us to be
 
02:22:30.540 --> 02:22:32.090 align:start position:0%
um you know there's no need for us to be
uh

02:22:32.090 --> 02:22:32.100 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:22:33.950 --> 02:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
you know the since they don't come to us
 
02:22:36.410 --> 02:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
in that manner anymore or haven't for a
 
02:22:38.389 --> 02:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
long time we didn't feel that we needed
 
02:22:41.990 --> 02:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
this section in the statute anymore okay
 
02:22:44.990 --> 02:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh any questions from committee members
 
02:22:46.849 --> 02:22:46.859 align:start position:0%
regarding this
 
02:22:49.490 --> 02:22:49.500 align:start position:0%
yes represent Cornell just so if
 
02:22:51.290 --> 02:22:51.300 align:start position:0%
somebody gets a settlement and you have
 
02:22:53.570 --> 02:22:53.580 align:start position:0%
been working with them you don't try to
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
get the money back that's correct okay
 
02:22:58.429 --> 02:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah and and I will say just uh for
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
the record you know Vocational
 
02:23:03.050 --> 02:23:03.060 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation works with uh primarily
 
02:23:05.809 --> 02:23:05.819 align:start position:0%
individuals that are well below
 
02:23:07.610 --> 02:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the poverty levels a lot of
 
02:23:10.610 --> 02:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
individuals on Social Security benefits
 
02:23:13.610 --> 02:23:13.620 align:start position:0%
um we and again since since the
 
02:23:15.110 --> 02:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor has their own
 
02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:18.060 align:start position:0%
workers comp section anything that might
 
02:23:18.060 --> 02:23:19.370 align:start position:0%
workers comp section anything that might
happen

02:23:19.370 --> 02:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:23:21.469 --> 02:23:21.479 align:start position:0%
um that they're getting Services right
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
there within their system so we would
 
02:23:25.790 --> 02:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
not ask for any
 
02:23:30.070 --> 02:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:33.349 --> 02:23:33.359 align:start position:0%
are there further questions from the
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
committee members
 
02:23:39.170 --> 02:23:39.180 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon thank you Mr chair
 
02:23:39.180 --> 02:23:40.370 align:start position:0%
yes represent Damon thank you Mr chair
so

02:23:40.370 --> 02:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:23:42.770 --> 02:23:42.780 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what I think you just
 
02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:44.090 align:start position:0%
just to clarify what I think you just
said

02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:23:46.610 --> 02:23:46.620 align:start position:0%
more of these individuals are serviced
 
02:23:49.490 --> 02:23:49.500 align:start position:0%
through the Departments of labor than
 
02:23:51.950 --> 02:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
through doe
 
02:23:53.570 --> 02:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
um that's right if it would have to do
 
02:23:56.110 --> 02:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
with any kind of a settlement and I did
 
02:24:00.469 --> 02:24:00.479 align:start position:0%
check in with their attorneys before you
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
know we brought this forward uh and they
 
02:24:06.349 --> 02:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
said that that you know this is it's
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
perfectly rational to repeal this given
 
02:24:11.030 --> 02:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
the work that they do in their
 
02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:12.410 align:start position:0%
the work that they do in their
Department

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:12.420 align:start position:0%
Department
 
02:24:15.650 --> 02:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah represent Belcher
 
02:24:17.870 --> 02:24:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair that makes some sense
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
the way you explained it but it seems to
 
02:24:21.290 --> 02:24:21.300 align:start position:0%
me that there might be another side to
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
this as well which is
 
02:24:25.790 --> 02:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
if somebody were injured and they had to
 
02:24:27.950 --> 02:24:27.960 align:start position:0%
go through these services and they
 
02:24:29.750 --> 02:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
receive a third party settlement safe
 
02:24:32.570 --> 02:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
from a lawsuit against some company
 
02:24:34.190 --> 02:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
Corporation or whatever else right
 
02:24:37.490 --> 02:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
usually part of a settlement in an
 
02:24:39.770 --> 02:24:39.780 align:start position:0%
injury case is covering the cost of
 
02:24:42.349 --> 02:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
medical treatment and whatnot so would
 
02:24:44.990 --> 02:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
this not be Shifting the burden for
 
02:24:46.929 --> 02:24:46.939 align:start position:0%
money that they received in a settlement
 
02:24:49.190 --> 02:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
for that
 
02:24:54.110 --> 02:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:56.690 --> 02:24:56.700 align:start position:0%
so let me give you an example of how our
 
02:24:58.969 --> 02:24:58.979 align:start position:0%
financial financial needs test works
 
02:25:00.590 --> 02:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
because I think this might answer your
 
02:25:03.410 --> 02:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
question representative so
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
Vocational Rehabilitation provides let's
 
02:25:07.730 --> 02:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
say two different kinds of services
 
02:25:10.130 --> 02:25:10.140 align:start position:0%
services that are covered by Financial
 
02:25:12.710 --> 02:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
need where we have to look at someone's
 
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
Financial need and then there are
 
02:25:16.730 --> 02:25:16.740 align:start position:0%
services like job development and
 
02:25:18.530 --> 02:25:18.540 align:start position:0%
placement that you would say naturally
 
02:25:20.210 --> 02:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
well why would someone have to pay for
 
02:25:23.030 --> 02:25:23.040 align:start position:0%
that right that's that's a core service
 
02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
that we provide
 
02:25:26.990 --> 02:25:27.000 align:start position:0%
things that would be covered and we
 
02:25:28.370 --> 02:25:28.380 align:start position:0%
would have to look at someone's
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
Financial need include things that are
 
02:25:34.070 --> 02:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
tangible it could be a vehicle
 
02:25:38.690 --> 02:25:38.700 align:start position:0%
modification that we do it could be a
 
02:25:41.570 --> 02:25:41.580 align:start position:0%
computer that we purchase for college if
 
02:25:44.030 --> 02:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
someone so what happens is and this goes
 
02:25:46.190 --> 02:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
for any customer regardless of if they
 
02:25:47.770 --> 02:25:47.780 align:start position:0%
had any kind of settlement or anything
 
02:25:50.389 --> 02:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
if they have a service that requires
 
02:25:52.969 --> 02:25:52.979 align:start position:0%
financial needs assessment we do that
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
and so they would say you know I have
 
02:25:57.770 --> 02:25:57.780 align:start position:0%
this amount of money in my saving would
 
02:26:01.370 --> 02:26:01.380 align:start position:0%
never ask anyone to you know to touch we
 
02:26:03.650 --> 02:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
really just look at liquid assets
 
02:26:06.830 --> 02:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
uh and and let's say they agree okay I
 
02:26:09.950 --> 02:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
can pay 500 of that computer because I
 
02:26:12.349 --> 02:26:12.359 align:start position:0%
have some resources we would never ask
 
02:26:15.830 --> 02:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
for any larger an amount just because
 
02:26:17.750 --> 02:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
someone had received some kind of a
 
02:26:20.050 --> 02:26:20.060 align:start position:0%
settlement it's all based on that
 
02:26:22.490 --> 02:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
Financial need and whether the service
 
02:26:25.010 --> 02:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
would be a part of it or not
 
02:26:27.050 --> 02:26:27.060 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that helps clarify
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying so they may have
 
02:26:32.210 --> 02:26:32.220 align:start position:0%
received a settlement and it may be a
 
02:26:34.429 --> 02:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
part of their assets but just because
 
02:26:35.570 --> 02:26:35.580 align:start position:0%
they have
 
02:26:37.190 --> 02:26:37.200 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean we would ask for
 
02:26:41.389 --> 02:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:43.910 --> 02:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
well if I may just just so I understand
 
02:26:45.770 --> 02:26:45.780 align:start position:0%
I want to make sure I really understand
 
02:26:48.889 --> 02:26:48.899 align:start position:0%
that that part would it be possible
 
02:26:51.230 --> 02:26:51.240 align:start position:0%
would there be any scenario
 
02:26:53.750 --> 02:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
where somebody could be
 
02:26:57.130 --> 02:26:57.140 align:start position:0%
injured on the job all hurt themselves
 
02:27:00.290 --> 02:27:00.300 align:start position:0%
let's say they go in and they receive a
 
02:27:03.170 --> 02:27:03.180 align:start position:0%
you know they there's a lawsuit and they
 
02:27:06.530 --> 02:27:06.540 align:start position:0%
receive a a million dollar settlement on
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
it and they've received Services let's
 
02:27:12.670 --> 02:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
say the state spent ten thousand dollars
 
02:27:15.530 --> 02:27:15.540 align:start position:0%
helping through this process under those
 
02:27:17.510 --> 02:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances if we repeal this law the
 
02:27:20.030 --> 02:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
state could not then go and
 
02:27:23.990 --> 02:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
ask or require that from that million
 
02:27:26.389 --> 02:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
dollar settlement part of which would
 
02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
have been incorporating these costs we
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't we couldn't then look this to
 
02:27:32.690 --> 02:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
receive that back to then be able to
 
02:27:35.210 --> 02:27:35.220 align:start position:0%
provide that service to another person
 
02:27:37.849 --> 02:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
down the road yeah so
 
02:27:37.859 --> 02:27:38.630 align:start position:0%
down the road yeah so
um

02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:40.910 --> 02:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
I think to clarify
 
02:27:43.130 --> 02:27:43.140 align:start position:0%
if we looked at their assets and they
 
02:27:47.450 --> 02:27:47.460 align:start position:0%
had a million dollars in there we would
 
02:27:49.309 --> 02:27:49.319 align:start position:0%
say that you have enough resources to
 
02:27:51.410 --> 02:27:51.420 align:start position:0%
pay for that service let's say it's the
 
02:27:54.290 --> 02:27:54.300 align:start position:0%
computer for twenty five hundred dollars
 
02:27:57.170 --> 02:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
um and it was bound by financial needs
 
02:27:58.849 --> 02:27:58.859 align:start position:0%
assessments so we had to look at their
 
02:27:58.859 --> 02:28:00.590 align:start position:0%
assessments so we had to look at their
assets

02:28:00.590 --> 02:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
assets
 
02:28:03.170 --> 02:28:03.180 align:start position:0%
um so we we would at that point say you
 
02:28:06.530 --> 02:28:06.540 align:start position:0%
do have the resource to pay for this
 
02:28:08.389 --> 02:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
um in the case of let's say if it's a
 
02:28:11.210 --> 02:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
hearing aid what our policy says is that
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
we have to look at financial needs and
 
02:28:17.389 --> 02:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
that we could pay up to 50 of hearing
 
02:28:17.399 --> 02:28:18.290 align:start position:0%
that we could pay up to 50 of hearing
aids

02:28:18.290 --> 02:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
aids
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
so if again that's Bound by financial
 
02:28:22.690 --> 02:28:22.700 align:start position:0%
needs assessment
 
02:28:25.250 --> 02:28:25.260 align:start position:0%
we would look at their resources and say
 
02:28:27.590 --> 02:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
again you have the resources to pay for
 
02:28:29.929 --> 02:28:29.939 align:start position:0%
this so we're going to ask you to pay
 
02:28:32.330 --> 02:28:32.340 align:start position:0%
for this so that we wouldn't like you
 
02:28:35.150 --> 02:28:35.160 align:start position:0%
said be turning that onto the taxpayers
 
02:28:37.790 --> 02:28:37.800 align:start position:0%
to pay when they do in fact have the
 
02:28:40.550 --> 02:28:40.560 align:start position:0%
resources so it's it's it's
 
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
um it's not just a factor of the
 
02:28:44.570 --> 02:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
settlement it's a factor of the service
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
that they're receiving whether it's
 
02:28:49.370 --> 02:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
tangible or something like job
 
02:28:51.170 --> 02:28:51.180 align:start position:0%
development placement and follow-up
 
02:28:54.290 --> 02:28:54.300 align:start position:0%
which is done by individuals right it's
 
02:28:55.969 --> 02:28:55.979 align:start position:0%
done by counselors it's done by
 
02:28:58.969 --> 02:28:58.979 align:start position:0%
Community program providers
 
02:28:58.979 --> 02:29:01.250 align:start position:0%
Community program providers
um

02:29:01.250 --> 02:29:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:03.590 --> 02:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it's really based on that Financial
 
02:29:06.770 --> 02:29:06.780 align:start position:0%
need so if we saw a large amount
 
02:29:09.170 --> 02:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
you know we would we would ask them to
 
02:29:11.270 --> 02:29:11.280 align:start position:0%
pay for that because we'll say you know
 
02:29:13.670 --> 02:29:13.680 align:start position:0%
why can't you if it's liquid assets
 
02:29:17.510 --> 02:29:17.520 align:start position:0%
again if it's locked up in in yeah yeah
 
02:29:20.389 --> 02:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
yes Japan real quick
 
02:29:21.830 --> 02:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
um because the way I'm looking at this
 
02:29:23.030 --> 02:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
is typically somebody's going to be
 
02:29:24.490 --> 02:29:24.500 align:start position:0%
receiving these Services
 
02:29:26.809 --> 02:29:26.819 align:start position:0%
relatively soon after an injury they
 
02:29:29.030 --> 02:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
will they will seek out these things but
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
a settlement from a lawsuit often takes
 
02:29:34.910 --> 02:29:34.920 align:start position:0%
years right to achieve so we would this
 
02:29:36.590 --> 02:29:36.600 align:start position:0%
would be a situation where you you would
 
02:29:38.750 --> 02:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
never and is that always been the policy
 
02:29:39.830 --> 02:29:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the department that they would never
 
02:29:42.889 --> 02:29:42.899 align:start position:0%
go back to look yeah yeah because

02:30:28.190 --> 02:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
um there's really no no high level we've
 
02:30:31.610 --> 02:30:31.620 align:start position:0%
worked with 85 and 90 year olds in our
 
02:30:33.530 --> 02:30:33.540 align:start position:0%
services for blind division impaired
 
02:30:33.540 --> 02:30:34.790 align:start position:0%
services for blind division impaired
unit

02:30:34.790 --> 02:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
unit
 
02:30:38.570 --> 02:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
um uh we you know we do have a high
 
02:30:40.070 --> 02:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
interest in working with students with
 
02:30:42.349 --> 02:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
disabilities but our customers are
 
02:30:44.150 --> 02:30:44.160 align:start position:0%
individuals with any kind of a
 
02:30:46.190 --> 02:30:46.200 align:start position:0%
disability you could imagine it could be
 
02:30:48.170 --> 02:30:48.180 align:start position:0%
a mental health disability it could be a
 
02:30:50.410 --> 02:30:50.420 align:start position:0%
developmental disability developmental
 
02:30:53.570 --> 02:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
or cognitive disability we work very
 
02:30:55.190 --> 02:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
closely with Health and Human Services
 
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
we work with the Bureau of mental health
 
02:31:00.170 --> 02:31:00.180 align:start position:0%
services and we also work with the
 
02:31:02.929 --> 02:31:02.939 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Developmental Services the the
 
02:31:04.490 --> 02:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
DD Council the developmental
 
02:31:07.870 --> 02:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
disabilities Council so we're very uh
 
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
we're we collaborate very highly with
 
02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
those programs as well as the local area
 
02:31:15.170 --> 02:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
agencies that we have in the state and
 
02:31:17.030 --> 02:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
the mental health centers that's where a
 
02:31:19.130 --> 02:31:19.140 align:start position:0%
lot of our referrals come from in fact
 
02:31:21.230 --> 02:31:21.240 align:start position:0%
are those individuals that are working
 
02:31:23.929 --> 02:31:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:27.410 --> 02:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
in in Medicaid services and and they
 
02:31:28.849 --> 02:31:28.859 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily pay for job
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
development and placement College
 
02:31:33.770 --> 02:31:33.780 align:start position:0%
tuition those kinds of things
 
02:31:36.110 --> 02:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
um so that's where we can take over and
 
02:31:38.330 --> 02:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
we can provide any service short of
 
02:31:41.630 --> 02:31:41.640 align:start position:0%
catastrophic surgeries so you know we
 
02:31:43.370 --> 02:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
could pay for work boots for somebody to
 
02:31:45.290 --> 02:31:45.300 align:start position:0%
go and do an internship we could pay for
 
02:31:48.410 --> 02:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
college we could pay for
 
02:31:51.889 --> 02:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
um you know uh a screen for someone so
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
that they can
 
02:31:55.670 --> 02:31:55.680 align:start position:0%
um they call it a CCTV you know to blow
 
02:32:00.410 --> 02:32:00.420 align:start position:0%
up the the words for them magnify it so
 
02:32:03.290 --> 02:32:03.300 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a great program again a
 
02:32:05.809 --> 02:32:05.819 align:start position:0%
state federal program we are 80
 
02:32:10.010 --> 02:32:10.020 align:start position:0%
federally funded and 20 state funded and
 
02:32:12.230 --> 02:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
we have to meet that minimum match to
 
02:32:14.809 --> 02:32:14.819 align:start position:0%
receive our our full Federal award
 
02:32:17.690 --> 02:32:17.700 align:start position:0%
total budgets about 16 million a year
 
02:32:17.700 --> 02:32:19.309 align:start position:0%
total budgets about 16 million a year
so

02:32:19.309 --> 02:32:19.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:32:20.750 --> 02:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps give some
 
02:32:20.760 --> 02:32:23.990 align:start position:0%
hopefully that helps give some
background

02:32:23.990 --> 02:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:26.870 --> 02:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:29.450 --> 02:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
02:32:31.389 --> 02:32:31.399 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure I understand
 
02:32:34.370 --> 02:32:34.380 align:start position:0%
if we pass this
 
02:32:37.250 --> 02:32:37.260 align:start position:0%
the effect will basically be nothing
 
02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:39.170 align:start position:0%
the effect will basically be nothing
right

02:32:39.170 --> 02:32:39.180 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:32:42.050 --> 02:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
yeah I would I would say that that is
 
02:32:43.429 --> 02:32:43.439 align:start position:0%
true because
 
02:32:46.550 --> 02:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
this hasn't really been active if you
 
02:32:46.560 --> 02:32:47.450 align:start position:0%
this hasn't really been active if you
will

02:32:47.450 --> 02:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
um it it hasn't been and I think it's
 
02:32:52.490 --> 02:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
because the workers compensation system
 
02:32:52.500 --> 02:32:54.050 align:start position:0%
because the workers compensation system
changed

02:32:54.050 --> 02:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
changed
 
02:32:56.150 --> 02:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have that
 
02:32:56.160 --> 02:32:57.230 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have that
um

02:32:57.230 --> 02:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:32:59.929 --> 02:32:59.939 align:start position:0%
that collaboration that we have with
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
them prior which I think was in the 80s
 
02:33:05.030 --> 02:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
I wasn't here at that time but I'm
 
02:33:07.490 --> 02:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
pretty sure that's when it happened
 
02:33:10.190 --> 02:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
um for anyone that that was around Doris
 
02:33:12.410 --> 02:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
LaChance was the person that we
 
02:33:16.010 --> 02:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
connected with back in those days but I
 
02:33:16.020 --> 02:33:16.670 align:start position:0%
connected with back in those days but I
don't

02:33:16.670 --> 02:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
don't
 
02:33:19.190 --> 02:33:19.200 align:start position:0%
to me you know Vocational Rehabilitation
 
02:33:21.830 --> 02:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
has plenty of resources to assist all of
 
02:33:24.830 --> 02:33:24.840 align:start position:0%
our customers like I said if they are
 
02:33:26.809 --> 02:33:26.819 align:start position:0%
receiving a service that requires us
 
02:33:30.050 --> 02:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
look at financial needs we do that so
 
02:33:31.670 --> 02:33:31.680 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayer doesn't have to pay
 
02:33:31.680 --> 02:33:32.929 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayer doesn't have to pay
additional

02:33:32.929 --> 02:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
additional
 
02:33:35.870 --> 02:33:35.880 align:start position:0%

03:40:45.590 --> 03:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:49.150 --> 03:40:49.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.650 --> 03:40:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Belcher seconds
 
03:40:55.190 --> 03:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh discussion of the amendment yes uh we
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
had a discussion earlier today on this
 
03:40:59.450 --> 03:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
bill and there were several areas which
 
03:41:02.590 --> 03:41:02.600 align:start position:0%
we noted that needed and required change
 
03:41:07.330 --> 03:41:07.340 align:start position:0%
one of those is on page one on line 14
 
03:41:10.450 --> 03:41:10.460 align:start position:0%
which changed the date from
 
03:41:13.790 --> 03:41:13.800 align:start position:0%
2023 to 2025.
 
03:41:16.610 --> 03:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
so that's now Incorporated in here the
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
other was on the top of page two
 
03:41:20.929 --> 03:41:20.939 align:start position:0%
which dealt with the school building
 
03:41:23.330 --> 03:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
authority and
 
03:41:26.929 --> 03:41:26.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:34.630 --> 03:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:37.729 --> 03:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
you can't be kidding me
 
03:41:39.670 --> 03:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
it's no effective data
 
03:41:43.010 --> 03:41:43.020 align:start position:0%
is replacing section one but it doesn't
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:50.389 --> 03:41:50.399 align:start position:0%
well is it because that's the amendment
 
03:41:52.130 --> 03:41:52.140 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't it uses the one that's in
 
03:41:57.010 --> 03:41:57.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:00.830 --> 03:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
into January 1st 2025.
 
03:42:17.170 --> 03:42:17.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:21.050 --> 03:42:21.060 align:start position:0%
okay so so we got the date right in page
 
03:42:23.090 --> 03:42:23.100 align:start position:0%
two one
 
03:42:25.670 --> 03:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
then we also have the change regarding
 
03:42:28.250 --> 03:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
the school building authority pursuant
 
03:42:30.950 --> 03:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
to RSA 195c
 
03:42:32.809 --> 03:42:32.819 align:start position:0%
in there
 
03:42:35.450 --> 03:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
and those were the two changes we spoke
 
03:42:37.849 --> 03:42:37.859 align:start position:0%
to earlier today as we've gone through
 
03:42:41.870 --> 03:42:41.880 align:start position:0%

I'd just like to say several words here
 
03:44:15.349 --> 03:44:15.359 align:start position:0%
um this is not going to be the entire
 
03:44:18.710 --> 03:44:18.720 align:start position:0%
fix for school building Aid this is a
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
step forward and it makes what we have
 
03:44:24.050 --> 03:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
better it gives a timeline it also
 
03:44:26.750 --> 03:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
provides folks like uh superintendent
 
03:44:28.610 --> 03:44:28.620 align:start position:0%
Taylor the opportunity to go forward
 
03:44:31.250 --> 03:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
with her uh School building Aid project
 
03:44:34.010 --> 03:44:34.020 align:start position:0%
that I hope that they receive here
 
03:44:35.990 --> 03:44:36.000 align:start position:0%
um if if you know depending upon how we
 
03:44:37.729 --> 03:44:37.739 align:start position:0%
fund things here and I think we should
 
03:44:39.469 --> 03:44:39.479 align:start position:0%
at least get 50 million bucks per year
 
03:44:39.479 --> 03:44:40.250 align:start position:0%
at least get 50 million bucks per year
and

03:44:40.250 --> 03:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:44:44.750 --> 03:44:44.760 align:start position:0%

representative lad would you like to
 
03:46:48.590 --> 03:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
make a motion on this I'd like to make a
 
03:46:55.309 --> 03:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:58.849 --> 03:46:58.859 align:start position:0%
sorry second representative miler
 
03:47:02.330 --> 03:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
uh discussion further
 
03:47:06.309 --> 03:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
I think we got it right this time
 
03:47:09.429 --> 03:47:09.439 align:start position:0%
this would be the third try today
 
03:47:13.389 --> 03:47:13.399 align:start position:0%
yeah third time's the charm uh it has
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
the process for
 
03:47:19.490 --> 03:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
um a district that may want to withdraw
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
uh working in conjunction with the
 
03:47:25.429 --> 03:47:25.439 align:start position:0%
Cooperative board as a whole where you
 
03:47:27.769 --> 03:47:27.779 align:start position:0%
need the Three-Fifths majority vote of
 
03:47:31.370 --> 03:47:31.380 align:start position:0%
both sides to attain that desired end
 
03:47:33.830 --> 03:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
so I and as I read it quickly here it
 
03:47:35.630 --> 03:47:35.640 align:start position:0%
looks like that is exactly what we have
 
03:47:36.969 --> 03:47:36.979 align:start position:0%
in front of us
 
03:47:36.979 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
in front of us
and

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:47:41.570 --> 03:47:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to also thank bear Christina
 
03:47:44.389 --> 03:47:44.399 align:start position:0%
for helping us get through this process
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
he was like the the third party that had
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
to come in
 
03:47:50.150 --> 03:47:50.160 align:start position:0%
and and and get this thing squared away
 
03:47:53.389 --> 03:47:53.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.729 --> 03:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
we're going to Myler I think we've
 
03:47:58.729 --> 03:47:58.739 align:start position:0%
talked about this a lot yeah
 
03:48:02.150 --> 03:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
any discussion from the committee
 
03:48:04.750 --> 03:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
uh representative Lakers
 
03:48:07.309 --> 03:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
does this
 
03:48:10.550 --> 03:48:10.560 align:start position:0%
this appears to be identical to the bill
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
the way it started except for maybe
 
03:48:17.690 --> 03:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
I believe that uh Roman 1 and Roman 2
 
03:48:25.670 --> 03:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
um are revised in this amendment does it
 
03:48:27.769 --> 03:48:27.779 align:start position:0%
do anything different or is it just
 
03:48:27.779 --> 03:48:28.910 align:start position:0%
do anything different or is it just
clearer

03:48:28.910 --> 03:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
03:48:32.150 --> 03:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
it it makes the process clearer and that
 
03:48:34.010 --> 03:48:34.020 align:start position:0%
Roman 1
 
03:48:36.290 --> 03:48:36.300 align:start position:0%
um says that uh if the withdrawing
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
District does not vote to withdraw then
 
03:48:42.229 --> 03:48:42.239 align:start position:0%
but the effect is identical it's just
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
the effect is uh identical yes
 
03:48:47.809 --> 03:48:47.819 align:start position:0%
Roman 3
 
03:48:49.550 --> 03:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
um I think is the the major piece of
 
03:48:52.429 --> 03:48:52.439 align:start position:0%
this that super majority vote so then
 
03:48:54.830 --> 03:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
this still does nothing for the small
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
towns who are stuck because they keep
 
03:49:00.410 --> 03:49:00.420 align:start position:0%
getting outvoted
 
03:49:02.870 --> 03:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
well I I
 
03:49:07.969 --> 03:49:07.979 align:start position:0%
think Roman 3 Roman 3 uh does provide
 
03:49:10.010 --> 03:49:10.020 align:start position:0%
some assistance so that if they have a
 
03:49:12.110 --> 03:49:12.120 align:start position:0%
three-fifths vote in the withdrawing
 
03:49:12.120 --> 03:49:13.849 align:start position:0%
three-fifths vote in the withdrawing
District

03:49:13.849 --> 03:49:13.859 align:start position:0%
District
 
03:49:15.769 --> 03:49:15.779 align:start position:0%
um unless there's a three-fifth super
 
03:49:18.769 --> 03:49:18.779 align:start position:0%
majority also in the entire Co-op they
 
03:49:22.190 --> 03:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
can withdraw but we ran the numbers and
 
03:49:24.349 --> 03:49:24.359 align:start position:0%
the small districts it doesn't work
 
03:49:28.490 --> 03:49:28.500 align:start position:0%
there's enough in the major
 
03:49:31.130 --> 03:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
we ran the numbers based on the last
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
vote and
 
03:49:36.110 --> 03:49:36.120 align:start position:0%
this would have done nothing for them
 
03:49:38.090 --> 03:49:38.100 align:start position:0%
that might be the case in some districts
 
03:49:39.950 --> 03:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
depending on size of who wants to
 
03:49:43.969 --> 03:49:43.979 align:start position:0%
withdraw and Etc thank you
 
03:49:47.389 --> 03:49:47.399 align:start position:0%
president Belcher thank you Mr chairman
 
03:49:51.050 --> 03:49:51.060 align:start position:0%
um I I had a question because the we had
 
03:49:52.729 --> 03:49:52.739 align:start position:0%
a bit of a hysterical issue with a with
 
03:49:56.210 --> 03:49:56.220 align:start position:0%
a gum Palma in the in the issues on the
 
03:49:57.950 --> 03:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
other day but it would appear that the
 
03:50:01.250 --> 03:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
comma is in the same location
 
03:50:04.550 --> 03:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
um in this bill that caused some
 
03:50:07.130 --> 03:50:07.140 align:start position:0%
confusion previously I'm looking for it
 
03:50:09.429 --> 03:50:09.439 align:start position:0%
now it is uh
 
03:50:13.010 --> 03:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
yeah line twenty
 
03:50:16.670 --> 03:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:24.889 --> 03:50:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:27.229 --> 03:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
really see that previously
 
03:50:27.239 --> 03:50:29.690 align:start position:0%
really see that previously
yes

03:50:29.690 --> 03:50:29.700 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
I don't shoot a long time I know
 
03:50:35.030 --> 03:50:35.040 align:start position:0%
oh is it is it not uh apologies I
 
03:50:36.349 --> 03:50:36.359 align:start position:0%
withdraw that one
 
03:50:38.090 --> 03:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
um but I did want to also add just
 
03:50:40.429 --> 03:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
briefly because I think the point of
 
03:50:42.410 --> 03:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
trying to do this and I I can appreciate
 
03:50:44.030 --> 03:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
the concept that we want to balance
 
03:50:45.290 --> 03:50:45.300 align:start position:0%
these things
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
but I think ultimately because of the
 
03:50:49.670 --> 03:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
incentives and the way that it works
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
when things become out of balance in
 
03:50:53.030 --> 03:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
these these agreements that these towns
 
03:50:56.269 --> 03:50:56.279 align:start position:0%
go into the worst the worse it becomes
 
03:50:59.570 --> 03:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
for one town the more incentivized the
 
03:51:02.809 --> 03:51:02.819 align:start position:0%
other towns become to keep them in that
 
03:51:05.690 --> 03:51:05.700 align:start position:0%
District so I think if we want to look
 
03:51:08.210 --> 03:51:08.220 align:start position:0%
to help these small towns ultimately be
 
03:51:09.790 --> 03:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
able to go back to the negotiating table
 
03:51:12.530 --> 03:51:12.540 align:start position:0%
I think they need to have
 
03:51:12.540 --> 03:51:13.250 align:start position:0%
I think they need to have
um

03:51:13.250 --> 03:51:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:16.130 --> 03:51:16.140 align:start position:0%
the unilateral determination ultimately
 
03:51:18.530 --> 03:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
by a by a super majority vote that can't
 
03:51:20.809 --> 03:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
be overridden
 
03:51:23.510 --> 03:51:23.520 align:start position:0%
new representative lead
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
this again like the previous Bill we
 
03:51:28.389 --> 03:51:28.399 align:start position:0%
looked at is a part of the puzzle
 
03:51:31.910 --> 03:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh to me the larger issue associated
 
03:51:34.309 --> 03:51:34.319 align:start position:0%
with all this are the articles of
 
03:51:34.319 --> 03:51:35.630 align:start position:0%
with all this are the articles of
agreement

03:51:35.630 --> 03:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
which are 60 years old in many cases or
 
03:51:41.870 --> 03:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
in a couple cases they don't even exist
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
and if we're ever going to be able to
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
really do something which is
 
03:51:50.929 --> 03:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
going to be I think most helpful to the
 
03:51:52.849 --> 03:51:52.859 align:start position:0%
local districts that are part of a co-op
 
03:51:56.510 --> 03:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
is to require that these articles of
 
03:51:58.849 --> 03:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
agreement come up for renewal
 
03:52:02.389 --> 03:52:02.399 align:start position:0%
every X number of years some districts
 
03:52:04.309 --> 03:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
have that in place for example we talk
 
03:52:07.250 --> 03:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
about Bridgewater earlier this year
 
03:52:10.610 --> 03:52:10.620 align:start position:0%
they do have a renegotiating uh no
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
negotiations of their article agreement
 
03:52:16.969 --> 03:52:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
and there's there's an item within those
 
03:52:23.330 --> 03:52:23.340 align:start position:0%
articles which states that if the
 
03:52:26.090 --> 03:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
financial Arrangement I.E the the the
 
03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
the per pupil pop uh tuition payment
 
03:52:33.410 --> 03:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
being a combination of both daily
 
03:52:33.420 --> 03:52:34.610 align:start position:0%
being a combination of both daily
membership

03:52:34.610 --> 03:52:34.620 align:start position:0%
membership
 
03:52:37.610 --> 03:52:37.620 align:start position:0%
and maybe property valuation
 
03:52:40.429 --> 03:52:40.439 align:start position:0%
theirs is based there entirely on
 
03:52:40.439 --> 03:52:42.590 align:start position:0%
theirs is based there entirely on
population

03:52:42.590 --> 03:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
population
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
now if that District tries to change
 
03:52:49.130 --> 03:52:49.140 align:start position:0%
that to 50 of both
 
03:52:52.010 --> 03:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
they have to do so in consent with
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater because it's in those
 
03:52:55.190 --> 03:52:55.200 align:start position:0%
articles of agreement that they agreed
 
03:52:57.410 --> 03:52:57.420 align:start position:0%
to it the last five years that those
 
03:53:00.050 --> 03:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
those articles are changed without our
 
03:53:03.769 --> 03:53:03.779 align:start position:0%
approval we're out of that Co-op
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
and so there's how things are going to
 
03:53:09.590 --> 03:53:09.600 align:start position:0%
happen if there to answer your question
 
03:53:12.410 --> 03:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
about where how do we help those smaller
 
03:53:14.269 --> 03:53:14.279 align:start position:0%
districts if the districts start writing
 
03:53:16.849 --> 03:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
these agreements such that it's going to
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
provide that escape clause or that
 
03:53:21.250 --> 03:53:21.260 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
03:53:24.290 --> 03:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
change the articles in conjunction with
 
03:53:26.450 --> 03:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
you know the population shifts which are
 
03:53:29.510 --> 03:53:29.520 align:start position:0%
going on or the property valuations like
 
03:53:31.429 --> 03:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
up there in Carroll right now where the
 
03:53:33.969 --> 03:53:33.979 align:start position:0%
the property value is really really high
 
03:53:37.030 --> 03:53:37.040 align:start position:0%
poverty rate is also really really high
 
03:53:39.410 --> 03:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
so those those are things that have to
 
03:53:41.450 --> 03:53:41.460 align:start position:0%
be accounted for so I think that and
 
03:53:43.130 --> 03:53:43.140 align:start position:0%
when we look at this in future and this
 
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
is not over there's a lot to it
 
03:53:47.510 --> 03:53:47.520 align:start position:0%
representation at large not at large all
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
these issues of membership those have to
 
03:53:52.309 --> 03:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
be addressed and so as representative
 
03:53:54.469 --> 03:53:54.479 align:start position:0%
Grenier did years ago he looked at a
 
03:53:56.210 --> 03:53:56.220 align:start position:0%
component of it this is a component of
 
03:53:59.330 --> 03:53:59.340 align:start position:0%
it but we now have to really it sounds
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
like we have a group that's really
 
03:54:02.690 --> 03:54:02.700 align:start position:0%
interested in doing that I would suggest
 
03:54:05.030 --> 03:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
during the next you know now next year
 
03:54:07.370 --> 03:54:07.380 align:start position:0%
here that we're working on this and have
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to have groups that we
 
03:54:12.050 --> 03:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
delve into it get all those articles or
 
03:54:13.969 --> 03:54:13.979 align:start position:0%
agreement in again start looking at it
 
03:54:15.830 --> 03:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
and saying how can we help
 
03:54:19.090 --> 03:54:19.100 align:start position:0%
and to move forward I won't
 
03:54:22.550 --> 03:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Lucas
 
03:54:24.769 --> 03:54:24.779 align:start position:0%
I guess my concern
 
03:54:28.309 --> 03:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
this and with what you were saying is
 
03:54:32.630 --> 03:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
for them to get those new agreements in
 
03:54:32.640 --> 03:54:33.349 align:start position:0%
for them to get those new agreements in
um

03:54:33.349 --> 03:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
they have to have a say other than
 
03:54:41.630 --> 03:54:41.640 align:start position:0%
for instance Carol has gone many times
 
03:54:45.050 --> 03:54:45.060 align:start position:0%
and asked for a renegotiation and
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
they've been told no well of course
 
03:54:49.490 --> 03:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
they've been told no because
 
03:54:51.590 --> 03:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
they know they can be out voted each
 
03:54:54.469 --> 03:54:54.479 align:start position:0%
time right and with this three-fifths
 
03:54:57.950 --> 03:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
they were out voted by that much and to
 
03:55:00.170 --> 03:55:00.180 align:start position:0%
me the idea of taking the Three-Fifths
 
03:55:02.809 --> 03:55:02.819 align:start position:0%
out and saying they can leave with a
 
03:55:04.790 --> 03:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
three-fifths on their own
 
03:55:08.510 --> 03:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
now the other people have to sit down at
 
03:55:11.450 --> 03:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
the table and say okay because they know
 
03:55:14.389 --> 03:55:14.399 align:start position:0%
they can leave so what can we do and
 
03:55:17.030 --> 03:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
maybe instead of 60 40 maybe they will
 
03:55:20.750 --> 03:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
agree to 50 50. maybe there'll be I just
 
03:55:23.469 --> 03:55:23.479 align:start position:0%
see them as being more willing to
 
03:55:26.090 --> 03:55:26.100 align:start position:0%
negotiate right now when they have that
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
big of a majority they don't have to
 
03:55:29.929 --> 03:55:29.939 align:start position:0%
negotiate they don't have to agree to
 
03:55:33.050 --> 03:55:33.060 align:start position:0%
the new bylaws if new bylaws come up
 
03:55:35.929 --> 03:55:35.939 align:start position:0%
I I can't see that that we're helping
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
the little guys at all
 
03:55:40.729 --> 03:55:40.739 align:start position:0%
right I'll just do a quick one the the
 
03:55:43.550 --> 03:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
whole uh language and I thought the
 
03:55:46.130 --> 03:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
language but this concept of a two-third
 
03:55:48.590 --> 03:55:48.600 align:start position:0%
super majority did not come from people
 
03:55:50.570 --> 03:55:50.580 align:start position:0%
on this committee here it came from the
 
03:55:54.229 --> 03:55:54.239 align:start position:0%
field it came from a small Cooperative a
 
03:55:57.830 --> 03:55:57.840 align:start position:0%

04:00:06.830 --> 04:00:06.840 align:start position:0%
um the next bill which we have let's
 
04:00:08.809 --> 04:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
take about I don't think we've had a
 
04:00:10.849 --> 04:00:10.859 align:start position:0%
chance to really caucus on this one and
 
04:00:12.889 --> 04:00:12.899 align:start position:0%
I like to have a moment here
 
04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
so uh we have this one build app this is
 
04:00:19.189 --> 04:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
uh 354 Charter School eligibility for
 
04:00:21.229 --> 04:00:21.239 align:start position:0%
school building a
 
04:00:25.250 --> 04:00:25.260 align:start position:0%
so we're going to caucus on that there I
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
don't believe there's any amendments are
 
04:00:28.309 --> 04:00:28.319 align:start position:0%
there any amendments on that bill
 
04:00:30.290 --> 04:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
I think so we're just dealing with the
 
04:00:32.750 --> 04:00:32.760 align:start position:0%
as introduced okay we'll we'll take a
 
04:00:35.389 --> 04:00:35.399 align:start position:0%
very short caucus here and hopefully we
 
04:00:36.769 --> 04:00:36.779 align:start position:0%
get back
 
04:00:36.779 --> 04:00:54.969 align:start position:0%
get back
soon

04:00:54.969 --> 04:00:54.979 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:59.650 --> 04:00:59.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:59.660 --> 04:01:01.210 align:start position:0%
 
right

04:01:01.210 --> 04:01:01.220 align:start position:0%

04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
452 450. no wait a minute we just did
 
04:06:54.590 --> 04:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:54.600 --> 04:37:08.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:37:08.150 --> 04:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:08.160 --> 04:37:14.150 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:37:14.150 --> 04:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:18.349 --> 04:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
the the uh Bill we're dealing with is
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
HP 354 Charter School eligibility School
 
04:37:24.051 --> 04:37:24.061 align:start position:0%
building Aid I like to call upon
 
04:37:27.890 --> 04:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.349 --> 04:37:30.359 align:start position:0%
I move we uh retained
 
04:37:32.449 --> 04:37:32.459 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:37.429 --> 04:37:37.439 align:start position:0%
further discussion from the make of the
 
04:37:39.529 --> 04:37:39.539 align:start position:0%
motion or the second
 
04:37:39.539 --> 04:37:41.150 align:start position:0%
motion or the second
uh

04:37:41.150 --> 04:37:41.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:37:42.949 --> 04:37:42.959 align:start position:0%
I think we talked through this pretty
 
04:37:45.769 --> 04:37:45.779 align:start position:0%
well but it gets down to the point where
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
it's pretty obvious to all of us that
 
04:37:50.990 --> 04:37:51.000 align:start position:0%
this needs more study and until we have
 
04:37:53.929 --> 04:37:53.939 align:start position:0%
more facts and more uh questions
 
04:37:56.750 --> 04:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
answered about how this might work out
 
04:37:59.510 --> 04:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
and who might be impacted in which way
 
04:38:02.390 --> 04:38:02.400 align:start position:0%
and who finally is the recipient if this
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
does occur uh I think we need to set
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
that worked out in considerable detail
 
04:38:10.250 --> 04:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
before we can make it a legitimate
 
04:38:10.260 --> 04:38:11.570 align:start position:0%
before we can make it a legitimate
decision

04:38:11.570 --> 04:38:11.580 align:start position:0%
decision
 
04:38:14.150 --> 04:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
represent Belcher you you are the second
 
04:38:16.970 --> 04:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair yes I I think just to
 
04:38:19.070 --> 04:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
you know to follow on that I think we
 
04:38:21.349 --> 04:38:21.359 align:start position:0%
had a few small things we need to look
 
04:38:24.529 --> 04:38:24.539 align:start position:0%
at things like local school board
 
04:38:27.051 --> 04:38:27.061 align:start position:0%
um issues with this and I think I think
 
04:38:28.429 --> 04:38:28.439 align:start position:0%
it would be worth you know taking a real
 
04:38:29.869 --> 04:38:29.879 align:start position:0%
hard look at this maybe getting a little
 
04:38:31.250 --> 04:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
study committee or something like that
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
together and um seeing if we can't
 
04:38:36.410 --> 04:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:39.051 --> 04:38:39.061 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:38:39.061 --> 04:38:39.650 align:start position:0%
further discussion
um

04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:42.410 --> 04:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to Echo the the need for a
 
04:38:42.420 --> 04:38:43.849 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to Echo the the need for a
retain

04:38:43.849 --> 04:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
retain
 
04:38:47.029 --> 04:38:47.039 align:start position:0%
um this is just a it's uh really an
 
04:38:48.529 --> 04:38:48.539 align:start position:0%
extension of our school building aid
 
04:38:48.539 --> 04:38:49.369 align:start position:0%
extension of our school building aid
program

04:38:49.369 --> 04:38:49.379 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:38:52.490 --> 04:38:52.500 align:start position:0%
but also one that's very important
 
04:38:56.330 --> 04:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
um and the Charter Public Schools their
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
their uh a form of public education has
 
04:39:01.070 --> 04:39:01.080 align:start position:0%
been around now for a while
 
04:39:02.929 --> 04:39:02.939 align:start position:0%
we know there may be a couple of them
 
04:39:04.490 --> 04:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
that are owning their own buildings
 
04:39:07.131 --> 04:39:07.141 align:start position:0%
right now uh and looking at the charter
 
04:39:11.090 --> 04:39:11.100 align:start position:0%
school law uh there's uh several error
 
04:39:14.390 --> 04:39:14.400 align:start position:0%
issues that if something happens and the
 
04:39:17.689 --> 04:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
trustees give it up and it's now going
 
04:39:21.410 --> 04:39:21.420 align:start position:0%
into uh default or into a fiscal
 
04:39:24.650 --> 04:39:24.660 align:start position:0%
situation which they can't afford then
 
04:39:26.689 --> 04:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
is the resident District going to have
 
04:39:30.289 --> 04:39:30.299 align:start position:0%
to pick up the the the debt on this
 
04:39:33.170 --> 04:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
um or how's that going to be handled and
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
does the school building Aid money
 
04:39:37.070 --> 04:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
that's been used for the upgrades come
 
04:39:40.430 --> 04:39:40.440 align:start position:0%
back to the state if it's available how
 
04:39:43.010 --> 04:39:43.020 align:start position:0%
do you get that and there's a lot of
 
04:39:45.708 --> 04:39:45.718 align:start position:0%
other issues criteria
 
04:39:45.718 --> 04:39:46.750 align:start position:0%
other issues criteria
um

04:39:46.750 --> 04:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:39:50.390 --> 04:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
541a ruler making to establish what
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
we've done for the school building a and
 
04:39:53.930 --> 04:39:53.940 align:start position:0%
even within School building aid program
 
04:39:55.368 --> 04:39:55.378 align:start position:0%
now we know that there are a lot of
 
04:39:58.250 --> 04:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
issues which need resolution and I see
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
this as a vehicle for us to do both
 
04:40:04.550 --> 04:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
look at our total formula and they'll
 
04:40:07.310 --> 04:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
look at how we integrate charter schools
 
04:40:10.670 --> 04:40:10.680 align:start position:0%
into that formula I am certainly a
 
04:40:13.550 --> 04:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
proponent of charter schools but when it
 
04:40:15.170 --> 04:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
gets to the school buildings I think we
 
04:40:17.090 --> 04:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful how we we move
 
04:40:17.100 --> 04:40:19.430 align:start position:0%
have to be very careful how we we move
forward

04:40:19.430 --> 04:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:22.510 --> 04:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
04:40:25.490 --> 04:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
not seeing anything we have a motion on
 
04:40:27.288 --> 04:40:27.298 align:start position:0%

17 years three days
 
04:41:29.470 --> 04:41:29.480 align:start position:0%
his app bill is retained
 
04:41:33.230 --> 04:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
there will be a committee appointed the
 
04:41:35.690 --> 04:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
way this works is that
 
04:41:38.208 --> 04:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
if you talk to our our clerk here in the
 
04:41:41.270 --> 04:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
house they we do set up subcommittees
 
04:41:42.708 --> 04:41:42.718 align:start position:0%
but we don't like to get a lot of
 
04:41:45.590 --> 04:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittees going prior to you're
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
getting are unloading all the Senate
 
04:41:49.250 --> 04:41:49.260 align:start position:0%
bills which might come at us this
 
04:41:50.690 --> 04:41:50.700 align:start position:0%
committee doesn't have a whole lot of
 
04:41:52.550 --> 04:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
Senate bills coming at us I understand
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
it's either 20 or less and that's a
 
04:41:59.270 --> 04:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
piece of cake for us and so um I think
 
04:42:00.890 --> 04:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to get a subcommittee
 
04:42:04.970 --> 04:42:04.980 align:start position:0%
going uh quickly other words and uh I'd
 
04:42:06.708 --> 04:42:06.718 align:start position:0%
be really interested in knowing if there
 
04:42:09.708 --> 04:42:09.718 align:start position:0%
are folks which like to be on that it's
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
something that I think we could really
 
04:42:14.110 --> 04:42:14.120 align:start position:0%
come out with some positive uh results
 
04:42:19.010 --> 04:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
uh by the the middle of the Fall so we
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
can get legislation proposed to move
 
04:42:25.090 --> 04:42:25.100 align:start position:0%
forward with something which might be
 
04:42:27.410 --> 04:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
taking in account some of the cause and
 
04:42:29.330 --> 04:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
effect that we might have if we had put
 
04:42:32.090 --> 04:42:32.100 align:start position:0%
this thing forward right now so
 
04:42:34.310 --> 04:42:34.320 align:start position:0%
um if anybody's interested please let me
 
04:42:38.090 --> 04:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
know or let them who's ranking uh
 
04:42:41.690 --> 04:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
representative and and we'll try and get
 
04:42:43.550 --> 04:42:43.560 align:start position:0%
this thing going as soon as we can in
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
the past when we've had committees like
 
04:42:47.810 --> 04:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
this I've spoken to leadership and we
 
04:42:50.810 --> 04:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
have had permission to move forward on a
 
04:42:53.750 --> 04:42:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee immediately and that's you
 
04:42:54.948 --> 04:42:54.958 align:start position:0%
know something which we could do in
 
04:42:56.448 --> 04:42:56.458 align:start position:0%
regard to this one as well
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
representative Myler thank you Mr chair
 
04:43:04.070 --> 04:43:04.080 align:start position:0%
now that we have concluded uh our uh uh
 
04:43:07.250 --> 04:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
our marathon here is it possible to have
 
04:43:11.390 --> 04:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh Jen give us there was a form that
 
04:43:12.890 --> 04:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
we used to get
 
04:43:15.708 --> 04:43:15.718 align:start position:0%
that indicated all of the bills that
 
04:43:18.410 --> 04:43:18.420 align:start position:0%
we've dealt with and it stated and their
 
04:43:20.810 --> 04:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
respective status yes something like
 
04:43:20.820 --> 04:43:21.670 align:start position:0%
respective status yes something like
that

04:43:21.670 --> 04:43:21.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:43:24.590 --> 04:43:24.600 align:start position:0%
the work path so we can all have a
 
04:43:26.868 --> 04:43:26.878 align:start position:0%
chance to see that and yeah do that yeah
 
04:43:28.610 --> 04:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see it too I haven't asked
 
04:43:30.230 --> 04:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
her for one lately in the last month and
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
a half so now that we're done yeah that
 
04:43:36.170 --> 04:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
works uh another comment for everybody
 
04:43:38.448 --> 04:43:38.458 align:start position:0%
we now that we have gone through these
 
04:43:41.570 --> 04:43:41.580 align:start position:0%
we do need to have all the uh committee
 
04:43:43.970 --> 04:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
reports completed if you retain
 
04:43:45.410 --> 04:43:45.420 align:start position:0%
something we don't need a convenient
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
committee report uh however it's OTP itl
 
04:43:52.190 --> 04:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
no recommendation we need those reports
 
04:43:54.470 --> 04:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
so you have report you need reports from
 
04:44:02.270 --> 04:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:05.390 --> 04:44:05.400 align:start position:0%
from just today yes yeah and there's a
 
04:44:07.430 --> 04:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
few still coming in that I haven't
 
04:44:09.170 --> 04:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
opened up anything here in the last
 
04:44:12.470 --> 04:44:12.480 align:start position:0%
couple hours that may be a result of the
 
04:44:12.480 --> 04:44:13.610 align:start position:0%
couple hours that may be a result of the
13th

04:44:13.610 --> 04:44:13.620 align:start position:0%
13th
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh of this month that I still don't have
 
04:44:20.810 --> 04:44:20.820 align:start position:0%
we need to get all those in so we can
 
04:44:25.430 --> 04:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:28.070 --> 04:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
any other comments now another thing
 
04:44:31.368 --> 04:44:31.378 align:start position:0%
which I I talked with representative
 
04:44:33.050 --> 04:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
Cornell there about going down and
 
04:44:34.970 --> 04:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
having a field trip
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh to you know to uh Hudson to look at
 
04:44:40.430 --> 04:44:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Career Technical education center
 
04:44:42.830 --> 04:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
down there and then making a stop here
 
04:44:45.530 --> 04:44:45.540 align:start position:0%
in Concord on the way or on the way back
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
either way whatever fits in their
 
04:44:48.650 --> 04:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
schedules and I think that'd be really
 
04:44:51.310 --> 04:44:51.320 align:start position:0%
enlightening for people
 
04:44:54.050 --> 04:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
Albert you're talking about and and Mr
 
04:44:55.788 --> 04:44:55.798 align:start position:0%
Frog worth down there it used to be the
 
04:44:58.128 --> 04:44:58.138 align:start position:0%
director of queer Tech education in the
 
04:45:00.110 --> 04:45:00.120 align:start position:0%
state here and he's really on top of
 
04:45:02.330 --> 04:45:02.340 align:start position:0%
things and and I have a lot of respect
 
04:45:05.090 --> 04:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
for the the the Concord CTE Center too
 
04:45:06.948 --> 04:45:06.958 align:start position:0%
it may be a little older but they have
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
some wonderful instruction going on in
 
04:45:11.570 --> 04:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
that facility and I think you'd be
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
amazed to see what can be done Career
 
04:45:15.890 --> 04:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
Technical education today it's just
 
04:45:19.430 --> 04:45:19.440 align:start position:0%
fantastic I wish my own kids had gone
 
04:45:22.128 --> 04:45:22.138 align:start position:0%
through this process and one of them
 
04:45:24.230 --> 04:45:24.240 align:start position:0%
would have a job right now instead of
 
04:45:27.470 --> 04:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
living off of Papa here
 
04:45:27.480 --> 04:45:44.530 align:start position:0%
living off of Papa here
foreign

04:45:44.530 --> 04:45:44.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:47.150 --> 04:45:47.160 align:start position:0%
I just told a granddaughter last night
 
04:45:49.490 --> 04:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
if you'd gone to the CTE Center just
 
04:45:51.110 --> 04:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
across from Bradford you know how to fix
 
04:45:53.090 --> 04:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
a compressor that way I wouldn't have to
 
04:45:54.970 --> 04:45:54.980 align:start position:0%
buy a new one for your Volkswagen Beetle
 
04:45:57.590 --> 04:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
and and that which is about two thousand
 
04:45:59.150 --> 04:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
dollars for installation and all and
 
04:46:00.650 --> 04:46:00.660 align:start position:0%
that's just you know not the time of the
 
04:46:02.448 --> 04:46:02.458 align:start position:0%
year to be doing that
 
04:46:05.690 --> 04:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
so so thank you very much everybody for
 
04:46:07.670 --> 04:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
hanging there and 93 bills this is just
 
04:46:09.530 --> 04:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
a marathon you've completed and we did
 
04:46:11.448 --> 04:46:11.458 align:start position:0%
it well we finished on time there's
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
others not done yet with fewer bills
 
04:46:21.910 --> 04:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.920 --> 04:46:31.330 align:start position:0%

04:46:41.930 --> 04:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
now before all the Republicans hit the
 
04:46:44.330 --> 04:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
road here we'd like to sit and talk for
 
04:46:45.650 --> 04:46:45.660 align:start position:0%
a second about how we're going to handle
 
04:46:47.990 --> 04:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I know the Democrats probably
 
04:46:51.110 --> 04:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
that all designed and ready to go yeah
