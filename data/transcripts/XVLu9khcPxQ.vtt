to forget the pledge this time so we'll
 
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 align:start position:0%
start off with the pledge
 
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 align:start position:0%

hearing on the executive executive law

representative Lane will be introducing
 
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 align:start position:0%
for representative Muirhead who is not
 
00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
with us today that's correct and I think
 
00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
we're doing a public hearing not an
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
public hearing I got the pledge right
 
00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 align:start position:0%

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 align:start position:0%

um which is known as Merrimack District
 
00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
16. so I'm here in place of uh
 
00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Muirhead because he's out
 
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
of town to introduce his bill HB 324
 
00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
which proposes public financing for
 
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.130 align:start position:0%
which proposes public financing for
campaigns

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 align:start position:0%
campaigns
 
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
since citizens united the Spring Court
 
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
case one of the most prominent concerns
 
00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
about our flawed election cycle is dark
 
00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.430 align:start position:0%
about our flawed election cycle is dark
money

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 align:start position:0%
uh wealth
 
00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 align:start position:0%
wealth is a significant barrier to
 
00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
participation for candidates and for
 
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.910 align:start position:0%
participation for candidates and for
donors

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
donors
 
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
our current system is dominated by big
 
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.170 align:start position:0%
our current system is dominated by big
money

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
results in an unrepresentative
 
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
government that the Privileges the
 
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
interests of the few the wealthy few
 
00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 align:start position:0%
including corporations
 
00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 align:start position:0%
public company financing offers
 
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 align:start position:0%
candidates the choice to drop out of the
 
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 align:start position:0%
big money Chase and to focus on talking
 
00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 align:start position:0%
to constituents and getting small
 
00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:35.150 align:start position:0%
to constituents and getting small
donations

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:37.979 align:start position:0%
the infiltration of dark money creates
 
00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 align:start position:0%
conflicts of interest for elected
 
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 align:start position:0%
officials are you representing your
 
00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 align:start position:0%
constituents or are you representing the
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
people who gave you the money
 
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:49.380 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years more than 12
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
jurisdictions have either adopted new
 
00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 align:start position:0%
public financing systems or strengthened
 
00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
their existing ones
 
00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
New York became the first state to enact
 
00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:03.900 align:start position:0%
a Statewide financing program
 
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:05.090 align:start position:0%
a Statewide financing program
since

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:05.100 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
citizens united
 
00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:09.419 align:start position:0%
and with that I am going to stop talking
 
00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 align:start position:0%
and let the speakers who are following
 
00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:14.759 align:start position:0%
me to answer your questions thank you
 
00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and um we're not going to be
 
00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 align:start position:0%
asking representative Lane questions
 
00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:19.139 align:start position:0%
because she's doing a courtesy for
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative mirrorhead so we'll um
 
00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
we'll let her off um just so the
 
00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 align:start position:0%
committee and everybody present knows
 
00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 align:start position:0%
um this bill was not it was
 
00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
inadvertently scheduled it should have
 
00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:29.820 align:start position:0%
been scheduled for next week but had
 
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:31.860 align:start position:0%
already been noticed so we are going to
 
00:05:33.529 --> 00:05:33.539 align:start position:0%
do representative Muirhead a courtesy
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
and I believe we will reopen
 
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
um the hearing we will hear everyone
 
00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
that's here today to speak to the bill
 
00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:39.539 align:start position:0%
um and they are a fair game for
 
00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 align:start position:0%
questions but just in the interest of
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
transparency it was a an error had
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
already gone out we couldn't take it
 
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:46.500 align:start position:0%
back but we also didn't want to
 
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:48.720 align:start position:0%
disrespect representative Muirhead by he
 
00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:50.820 align:start position:0%

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:36.539 align:start position:0%
important effort we need to reduce the
 
00:06:38.809 --> 00:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
influence of money and politics
 
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:41.220 align:start position:0%
and we can do that and increase the
 
00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 align:start position:0%
voice of average citizen by passing this
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary voter owned elections
 
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:50.580 align:start position:0%

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
work to create small donors uh so you
 
00:06:58.129 --> 00:06:58.139 align:start position:0%
would have to qualify for to opt into
 
00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 align:start position:0%
this bill qualify by collecting small
 
00:07:03.409 --> 00:07:03.419 align:start position:0%

Rudman said I challenge my party to
 
00:07:11.689 --> 00:07:11.699 align:start position:0%
return return to the roots of Teddy
 
00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt and take up a challenge from a
 
00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:17.819 align:start position:0%
century ago for real lasting solutions
 
00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 align:start position:0%
to our current campaign Finance which is
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
known as citizen-funded elections Public
 
00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
Funding elections or voter owned
 
00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 align:start position:0%
elections is sort of all known
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
um this is a common in across the
 
00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:32.220 align:start position:0%
country 24 states have some kind of
 
00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:35.060 align:start position:0%
solutions five states Maine Connecticut
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
Hawaii Minnesota and Arizona
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
um have full Public Funding and then
 
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:42.360 align:start position:0%
some states have just partial Public
 
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
Funding of offices 13 states
 
00:07:49.309 --> 00:07:49.319 align:start position:0%
um Inc have some option Maryland has
 
00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
County jurisdictions eligible and then
 
00:07:53.510 --> 00:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
there are other jurisdictions where
 
00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
cities like Seattle or Oakland have
 
00:07:59.390 --> 00:07:59.400 align:start position:0%
Public Funding and we candidates for the
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
president can take up Public Funding of
 
00:08:05.089 --> 00:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
Elections this reduces or stabilizes the
 
00:08:06.770 --> 00:08:06.780 align:start position:0%
cost for running for office we've all
 
00:08:08.629 --> 00:08:08.639 align:start position:0%
seen the cost for running for office
 
00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
increase year after year after year
 
00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:14.280 align:start position:0%
um this would reduce the amount of time
 
00:08:17.330 --> 00:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
that candidates spend fundraising and
 
00:08:19.670 --> 00:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
would allow candidates to talk to
 
00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:21.780 align:start position:0%
Everyday voters
 
00:08:24.969 --> 00:08:24.979 align:start position:0%
this increases
 
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
equality in our political system it
 
00:08:30.230 --> 00:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
encourages more competition
 
00:08:32.449 --> 00:08:32.459 align:start position:0%
it decreases special interests and
 
00:08:35.589 --> 00:08:35.599 align:start position:0%
out-of-state interests
 
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:39.200 align:start position:0%
this bill does have
 
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:42.180 align:start position:0%
does not contain the same funding
 
00:08:44.329 --> 00:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
mechanism as the Arizona
 
00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:46.200 align:start position:0%
did that was stricken down by the
 
00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:47.540 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court
 
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:50.760 align:start position:0%
Maine also has a similar or not a little
 
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:52.260 align:start position:0%
bit different but a Public Funding
 
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:53.760 align:start position:0%
system that they've had for many years
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
and it allows Maine to pass bold
 
00:08:59.570 --> 00:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
bipartisan legislation that's demanded
 
00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:02.339 align:start position:0%
by the public if the industry objects
 
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:04.140 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's really important for
 
00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
us to underline that we want voters to
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
be accountable uh politicians to be
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
accountable to voters and not to the big
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
big money in the in the system
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
um there is a another quote in my
 
00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
testimony from the former Arizona
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
governor which basically I'm just going
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
to summarize says that they are not
 
00:09:27.230 --> 00:09:27.240 align:start position:0%
they're able to pass
 
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:29.820 align:start position:0%
policies that they weren't able to pass
 
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:32.580 align:start position:0%
prior to Public Funding because of big
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
Pharma not allowing them you know sort
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
of getting in the way of passing
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
important prescription drugs legislation
 
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:40.860 align:start position:0%
that they were able to successfully pass
 
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.040 align:start position:0%
after they passed these systems
 
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
um the time is now to Institute a policy
 
00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019 align:start position:0%
that for more fair transparent
 
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:51.300 align:start position:0%
and just systems
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
um I want to just sort of say that this
 
00:09:55.430 --> 00:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
is not the first time this bill has been
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
heard by the committee
 
00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.220 align:start position:0%
um you had a um
 
00:10:04.370 --> 00:10:04.380 align:start position:0%
bipartisan study committee committee
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
chaired by Brad cook a numerous amount
 
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
of years ago and then in 2008 you had a
 
00:10:13.970 --> 00:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
feasibility commission so this this has
 
00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:17.100 align:start position:0%
been studied twice and has been
 
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:19.800 align:start position:0%
introduced a number of times prior and I
 
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
would recommend ought to pass on House
 
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.910 align:start position:0%
would recommend ought to pass on House
Bill

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:27.240 align:start position:0%
um 324. I also with me today Senator
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
former Senator Jim rubins is unable to
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
be here but I have testimony for him and
 
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:34.140 align:start position:0%
I also have a petition signed by a
 
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
number of people and their testimony as
 
00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:41.220 align:start position:0%
well and testimony of Joe Bagshaw from
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
Center Conway who was unable to make it
 
00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
down so happy to take any questions you
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
might have about
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee from
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:58.670 --> 00:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
um I had a couple I was reading over
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
this bill we received a lot of emails
 
00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:01.800 align:start position:0%
about this I'm sure the committee got
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
them as well
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that was in the
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
emails was says that this was publicly
 
00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:07.190 align:start position:0%
emails was says that this was publicly
funded

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:07.200 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:09.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think on page 11
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
um it creates a for the interests of uh
 
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
transparency the fiscal note for this
 
00:11:16.430 --> 00:11:16.440 align:start position:0%
bill is not available yet
 
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:18.060 align:start position:0%
um it's on the back of the bill OLS
 
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:20.220 align:start position:0%
wasn't able to generate it in time but
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
my understanding of it is it creates a
 
00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
like a Citizens fund similar to like
 
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
like a Citizens fund similar to like
Connecticut

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
Connecticut
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
um and one of the things that in my
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
doing my research on the bill
 
00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
um and I think those kind of misleading
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
the emails we got was the the bill
 
00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.069 align:start position:0%
the emails we got was the the bill
um

00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.060 align:start position:0%
the bill takes in donations from the
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
public correct
 
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so are you aware of the other states
 
00:11:45.829 --> 00:11:45.839 align:start position:0%
when they've had these sort of funds
 
00:11:47.930 --> 00:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
um how many people have donated to the
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
fund voluntarily we're not talking about
 
00:11:50.329 --> 00:11:50.339 align:start position:0%
the voter dollars you get we're talking
 
00:11:51.829 --> 00:11:51.839 align:start position:0%
about actual money here
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I will say that other states have
 
00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:55.560 align:start position:0%
funded the main funds them from their
 
00:11:58.069 --> 00:11:58.079 align:start position:0%
general fund Connecticut has a separate
 
00:12:00.170 --> 00:12:00.180 align:start position:0%
fund that this comes from to fund
 
00:12:02.449 --> 00:12:02.459 align:start position:0%
elections Seattle pays for them by
 
00:12:04.730 --> 00:12:04.740 align:start position:0%
property taxes so this is a uniquely New
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way of allowing you know
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
spending a dollar from our general fund
 
00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
and allowing for as you'll see there on
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
page 11.
 
00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:16.980 align:start position:0%
um the voluntary contributions so it can
 
00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:18.959 align:start position:0%
be populated by voluntary contributions
 
00:12:24.050 --> 00:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
as well as a fee for uh election law
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance violations so any
 
00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance violations will then be
 
00:12:30.829 --> 00:12:30.839 align:start position:0%
allocated to this fund
 
00:12:32.630 --> 00:12:32.640 align:start position:0%
um and then there's interest on the fund
 
00:12:35.210 --> 00:12:35.220 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other things listed
 
00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:36.050 align:start position:0%
and a couple of other things listed
um

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:38.210 --> 00:12:38.220 align:start position:0%
as well as the governor could issue a
 
00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
warrant which is under the appropriation
 
00:12:42.350 --> 00:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
section of the bill to fund the bill so
 
00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:43.610 align:start position:0%
section of the bill to fund the bill so
there

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.620 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
um that is an important thing that we
 
00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:47.700 align:start position:0%
need to discover and and work for a New
 
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:50.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire solution to the pop to get big
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:56.690 --> 00:12:56.700 align:start position:0%
that's all I had is my um yes um
 
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:00.660 align:start position:0%
representative kindy sorry I just so I
 
00:13:00.660 --> 00:13:01.550 align:start position:0%
representative kindy sorry I just so I
understand

00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
understand
 
00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
um this bill doesn't do anything to
 
00:13:05.569 --> 00:13:05.579 align:start position:0%
restrict big money does it
 
00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
this bill is voluntary
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
um so just to be clear this bill would
 
00:13:14.509 --> 00:13:14.519 align:start position:0%
create a system that candidates will
 
00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
have to opt in candidates can still use
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
our current system and in other states
 
00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:21.660 align:start position:0%
where they have these systems you see
 
00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:24.740 align:start position:0%
participation rate about 70 75 percent
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
so in in no other state does this
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
universally solve a problem the court
 
00:13:32.569 --> 00:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
has been very clear that you can't
 
00:13:34.730 --> 00:13:34.740 align:start position:0%
mandate a system like this it has to be
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
a voluntary system and so it's complying
 
00:13:40.550 --> 00:13:40.560 align:start position:0%
with all Court objections to to getting
 
00:13:43.190 --> 00:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
money out of politics but I will say
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
that in other states that have had these
 
00:13:47.629 --> 00:13:47.639 align:start position:0%
voluntary opt-in systems you have seen
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
High participation because
 
00:13:52.129 --> 00:13:52.139 align:start position:0%
candidates want to be accountable to the
 
00:13:54.190 --> 00:13:54.200 align:start position:0%
to the voters and voters demand
 
00:13:57.889 --> 00:13:57.899 align:start position:0%
participation in in systems like this so
 
00:13:59.449 --> 00:13:59.459 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question and yes it
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
is a hundred percent voluntary
 
00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:04.380 align:start position:0%
and it would be just for executive
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
Council and governors races to start
 
00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:10.500 align:start position:0%
um and it if those work then the
 
00:14:11.930 --> 00:14:11.940 align:start position:0%
commission could expand it to other
 
00:14:11.940 --> 00:14:13.370 align:start position:0%
commission could expand it to other
races

00:14:13.370 --> 00:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
races
 
00:14:16.129 --> 00:14:16.139 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none uh thank you Miss
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
sink next up also from open democracy it
 
00:14:23.889 --> 00:14:23.899 align:start position:0%
was going to be uh Sarah
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.030 --> 00:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Sarah Lobdell
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
I'm the program coordinator of open
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
democracy and a voter in Keene New
 
00:14:50.459 --> 00:14:51.430 align:start position:0%
democracy and a voter in Keene New
Hampshire

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
my testimony hones in on this bill
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
specifically rather than a broad
 
00:14:58.430 --> 00:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
overview of publicly funded elections
 
00:14:58.440 --> 00:14:59.090 align:start position:0%
overview of publicly funded elections
um

00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:03.230 --> 00:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
and so the system outlined in HB 324 is
 
00:15:04.850 --> 00:15:04.860 align:start position:0%
good for both voters and candidates of
 
00:15:06.290 --> 00:15:06.300 align:start position:0%
all parties
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and I recommend the committee adopt
 
00:15:10.850 --> 00:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
an ought to pass vote
 
00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
as voters and taxpayers we pay more
 
00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:14.760 align:start position:0%
every day for our current system of
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
privately funded elections in New
 
00:15:17.689 --> 00:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire than we would for voter owned
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
elections we pay higher prices for goods
 
00:15:21.769 --> 00:15:21.779 align:start position:0%
and services such as utilities and
 
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:24.060 align:start position:0%
Health Care regularly for example
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
because wealthy donors are able to buy
 
00:15:28.189 --> 00:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
influence through campaign donations and
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
then expecting Returns on investment
 
00:15:31.730 --> 00:15:31.740 align:start position:0%
through policies favorable to these
 
00:15:34.670 --> 00:15:34.680 align:start position:0%
donors at the taxpayers expense
 
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
a place this is particularly troubling
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
is with the executive Council so
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
executive counselors approve contracts
 
00:15:42.530 --> 00:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
for a third of New Hampshire's seven
 
00:15:44.449 --> 00:15:44.459 align:start position:0%
billion dollar budget while at the same
 
00:15:47.329 --> 00:15:47.339 align:start position:0%
time receiving uh potentially receiving
 
00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
campaign donations from the groups whose
 
00:15:52.189 --> 00:15:52.199 align:start position:0%

00:15:52.199 --> 00:15:53.509 align:start position:0%
contracts they may soon vote on in these
instances

00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
instances
 
00:15:55.370 --> 00:15:55.380 align:start position:0%
um will the most qualified contractor
 
00:15:56.750 --> 00:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
get the bid with the state or the

00:16:03.410 --> 00:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
executive counselors and awarding
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
contracts intentionally or
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
subconsciously to their biggest owners
 
00:16:08.090 --> 00:16:08.100 align:start position:0%
risk approving potentially unqualified
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
contractors and any errors resulting
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
from this come at the taxpayers expense
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
with the voter owned elections outlined
 
00:16:19.490 --> 00:16:19.500 align:start position:0%

00:16:25.610 --> 00:16:25.620 align:start position:0%
that money is coming from and candidates
 
00:16:27.410 --> 00:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
as well know where their campaign
 
00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
contributions are coming from uh prior
 
00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:31.500 align:start position:0%
to the election and cannot be swayed by
 
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
donations for example from lobbyists
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
once elected
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%

00:16:38.449 --> 00:16:38.459 align:start position:0%

00:16:40.370 --> 00:16:40.380 align:start position:0%

good morning chairman and house election
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
law members
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for honoring my right to speak
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
today my name is Corrine Dodge I live in
 
00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
as a New Hampshire voter I hate the fact
 
00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
that my voice is being drowned out by
 
00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:48.020 align:start position:0%
excessive secret secret
 
00:18:51.490 --> 00:18:51.500 align:start position:0%
and especially out of state donations
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
pouring into New Hampshire at election
 
00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:56.780 align:start position:0%
Time by Lodge and multinational
 
00:19:00.169 --> 00:19:00.179 align:start position:0%
corporations and by a tiny percentage
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
and a very wealthy individuals
 
00:19:07.370 --> 00:19:07.380 align:start position:0%
currently candidates wanting to run or
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
rerun for our New Hampshire office of
 
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
Governor our executive Council must be
 
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
either independently wealthy
 
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:19.940 align:start position:0%
are willing and able to raise exorbitant
 
00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:22.740 align:start position:0%
exorbitant amounts of money from large
 
00:19:25.490 --> 00:19:25.500 align:start position:0%
corporations and from very wealthy
 
00:19:28.070 --> 00:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
donors individuals
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
in effect the extreme amounts of these
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
donations make candidates obliged to do
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
the bidding of the donors whose agenda
 
00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480 align:start position:0%
is most often
 
00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:43.200 align:start position:0%
in opposition to Everyday citizens
 
00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
can't even begin to compete with wealthy
 
00:19:48.669 --> 00:19:48.679 align:start position:0%
donors citizens like myself
 
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
consequently I also hate the fact that
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
when I speak to public officials I know
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
that my needs as a constituent are going
 
00:19:59.930 --> 00:19:59.940 align:start position:0%
to be secondary to the needs of
 
00:20:01.970 --> 00:20:01.980 align:start position:0%
extremely wealthy donors and
 
00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.010 align:start position:0%
extremely wealthy donors and
corporations

00:20:04.010 --> 00:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
00:20:06.830 --> 00:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
a number of years ago I sat in a chair
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
just like this at a hearing just like
 
00:20:14.210 --> 00:20:14.220 align:start position:0%
this for a bill very similar to this one
 
00:20:17.450 --> 00:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
I was asked by one of your colleagues if
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
I would be willing to share my tax
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
dollars to be used to pay for voter
 
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:25.620 align:start position:0%
owned elections
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
if asked that same question today my
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
answer would be more than a simple yes
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
I've learned a lot since then
 
00:20:39.409 --> 00:20:39.419 align:start position:0%
if asked today my answer would be yes I
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely am willing to pay my share of
 
00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:47.700 align:start position:0%
tax tax dollars to support a voter voter
 
00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:50.220 align:start position:0%
owned elections because that would be
 
00:20:54.310 --> 00:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
foreign than watching my household
 
00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:00.860 align:start position:0%
budget for home heating fuel electricity
 
00:21:04.070 --> 00:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs dwindle
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
even as I see the corporate pro profits
 
00:21:10.010 --> 00:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
arising outrageously
 
00:21:12.650 --> 00:21:12.660 align:start position:0%
I want a government that is actually
 
00:21:15.890 --> 00:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
responsible to the needs of all New
 
00:21:18.110 --> 00:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire constituents
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.169 --> 00:21:27.179 align:start position:0%
I ask that you protect the right of all
 
00:21:29.570 --> 00:21:29.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire citizens to have their
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
Collective voices heard and considered
 
00:21:33.799 --> 00:21:35.770 align:start position:0%
Collective voices heard and considered
amend

00:21:35.770 --> 00:21:35.780 align:start position:0%
amend
 
00:21:38.390 --> 00:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
hb324 if you must
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
but I ask that you amend with integrity
 
00:21:43.970 --> 00:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
and with consideration
 
00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
for constitution for the constituents of
 
00:21:51.169 --> 00:21:51.179 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire past three to four please
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
are there any will you be taking
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
questions Mr
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
will I be I'm sure absolutely are there
 
00:22:00.049 --> 00:22:00.059 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee uh
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative bone
 
00:22:03.350 --> 00:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thanks for taking
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
the question but as I see this I don't
 
00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
will this have any effect at all on on
 
00:22:15.289 --> 00:22:15.299 align:start position:0%
people running for office that have a
 
00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:17.460 align:start position:0%
lot of money from previous campaign
 
00:22:20.930 --> 00:22:20.940 align:start position:0%
donations or other outside agencies from
 
00:22:24.430 --> 00:22:24.440 align:start position:0%
running ads on TV and whatnot
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
how will this affect that I do believe
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
when I've read the bill and it was hard
 
00:22:32.149 --> 00:22:32.159 align:start position:0%
to go through all that but I do believe
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
there's some kind of a con in somebody
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
else may know I am not an expert on the
 
00:22:38.570 --> 00:22:38.580 align:start position:0%
bill but I believe there is a
 
00:22:41.510 --> 00:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
contingency for someone who has run in
 
00:22:42.610 --> 00:22:42.620 align:start position:0%
another election
 
00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
there's some requirements on what the
 
00:22:47.450 --> 00:22:47.460 align:start position:0%
extra money they have and maybe somebody
 
00:22:51.049 --> 00:22:51.059 align:start position:0%
can can confirm that but that was my
 
00:22:51.059 --> 00:22:52.430 align:start position:0%
can can confirm that but that was my
understanding

00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
this bill isn't going to it's not going
 
00:22:56.270 --> 00:22:56.280 align:start position:0%
to change
 
00:22:59.270 --> 00:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
everything overnight but if we do
 
00:23:03.590 --> 00:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
nothing it'll get worse that I know
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
I believe um if there's a clause in
 
00:23:07.370 --> 00:23:07.380 align:start position:0%
there it says you cannot use previous
 
00:23:09.770 --> 00:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
campaign funds just if I'm wrong on that
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
please correct me but I did read the
 
00:23:11.039 --> 00:23:12.130 align:start position:0%
please correct me but I did read the
Bill

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:12.140 align:start position:0%

thank you very much for the greeting
 
00:23:45.230 --> 00:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
my focus this bill focuses on two races
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh race for governor and the race for
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
executive Council my focus is on the
 
00:23:54.409 --> 00:23:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:56.340 align:start position:0%
one of the most powerful entities in
 
00:23:58.970 --> 00:23:58.980 align:start position:0%
state government is one that is arguably
 
00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:01.980 align:start position:0%
least known by the General Public
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
it is one charge with the authority and
 
00:24:06.169 --> 00:24:06.179 align:start position:0%
responsibility of
 
00:24:08.810 --> 00:24:08.820 align:start position:0%
approving or not all contracts having a
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
value of ten thousand dollars or more of
 
00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
course that would include
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
construction contracts
 
00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
approving or not the spending of a major
 
00:24:21.169 --> 00:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
portion of the approximately 5.2
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
billion dollars appropriated annually by
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
our legislature

and commissions
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%

00:24:49.370 --> 00:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
appointed to the executive branch are

00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%

interests end quote
 
00:25:00.289 --> 00:25:00.299 align:start position:0%
there is specific recognition therefore
 
00:25:02.210 --> 00:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
that the council is vulnerable to the
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
pressures of special interests and that
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
it is the duty of each member to serve
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
as advocates for the people
 
00:25:12.470 --> 00:25:12.480 align:start position:0%
while it is plus not possible to know
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
the inner workings of the human mind
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
and in this case how many how many
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
affects decision making among everyone
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
in the position of power
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
it is not impossible
 
00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
every day our jury system sorts the
 
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:29.340 align:start position:0%
wheat from the chaff by convicting
 
00:25:31.730 --> 00:25:31.740 align:start position:0%
defendants based on circumstantial
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
evidence and by invoking their own
 
00:25:36.649 --> 00:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
common sense
 
00:25:39.830 --> 00:25:39.840 align:start position:0%
I cite an example of the application of
 
00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:41.220 align:start position:0%

he continued indicating he received an

unsolicited check in the amount of five
 
00:26:03.169 --> 00:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars from a Fortune 100
 
00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:06.120 align:start position:0%

relationship
 
00:26:11.149 --> 00:26:11.159 align:start position:0%
the timing of this check caused the
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
candidate to conclude it was sent to

influence his decision

he destroyed the check during the video

we can use our common sense to conclude
 
00:26:33.169 --> 00:26:33.179 align:start position:0%
there will be those who will through
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
their contribution at least attempt to

00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 executive Council campaign
 
00:26:46.610 --> 00:26:46.620 align:start position:0%
1.33 million dollars came from in-state
 
00:26:49.669 --> 00:26:49.679 align:start position:0%
contributions almost 218 thousand
 
00:26:52.549 --> 00:26:52.559 align:start position:0%

excess of sixty six hundred dollars
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
could not be traced
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
there should be no campaign contribution
 
00:27:00.289 --> 00:27:00.299 align:start position:0%

00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
which requires complete disclosure
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
unlike the current system
 
00:27:16.250 --> 00:27:16.260 align:start position:0%
and candidates must disavow
 
00:27:18.649 --> 00:27:18.659 align:start position:0%
contributions from

00:27:23.330 --> 00:27:23.340 align:start position:0%
for 30 years I was employed by the
 
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:25.980 align:start position:0%
state's superior court system and worked
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
with honorable people
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%

yeah I silently disagreed
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
but he also advised that perception is
 
00:27:48.299 --> 00:27:49.669 align:start position:0%
but he also advised that perception is
reality

00:27:49.669 --> 00:27:49.679 align:start position:0%
reality
 
00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
that was not disputed
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
I cannot I cannot tell you unequivocally
 
00:27:57.289 --> 00:27:57.299 align:start position:0%
that money is influencing decision
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
making on the executive Council nor can
 
00:28:02.690 --> 00:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
anyone here tell me that it does
 
00:28:04.970 --> 00:28:04.980 align:start position:0%
I can tell you the common sense dictates
 
00:28:07.850 --> 00:28:07.860 align:start position:0%
that it can which brings us back to the
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
concept of perception being reality
 
00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:15.600 align:start position:0%
HB 324 will not quiet the Skeptics but
 
00:28:17.110 --> 00:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
it will be a step in the right direction
 
00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:20.580 align:start position:0%
and its structure proven to provide
 
00:28:22.669 --> 00:28:22.679 align:start position:0%
tangible benefits
 
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
I urge ought to pass on 324.

00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
the current system of funding political
 
00:29:12.649 --> 00:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
campaigns by private donations has led
 
00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:15.779 align:start position:0%
to increasingly expensive campaigns with
 
00:29:18.169 --> 00:29:18.179 align:start position:0%
wealthy donors and corporations exerting
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%

00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
politicians in New Hampshire have
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
received large donations from
 
00:29:28.430 --> 00:29:28.440 align:start position:0%

00:29:40.130 --> 00:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
such a system directly affects who runs

for office and which pieces of
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
legislation are put into law candidates
 
00:29:47.450 --> 00:29:47.460 align:start position:0%

Drive the political agenda everyday
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
voters hold less weight with the
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
candidates who must spend an inordinate
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
amount of time soliciting donations even
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
after being elected
 
00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:09.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire voters want change in
 
00:30:12.049 --> 00:30:12.059 align:start position:0%
campaign funding according to a survey
 
00:30:14.389 --> 00:30:14.399 align:start position:0%
conducted in New Hampshire by public
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
policy polling in 2018
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
a bipartisan majority of Voters believe
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
that big money is a problem in our
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
elections and would support a system
 
00:30:28.909 --> 00:30:28.919 align:start position:0%
like the one proposed in HB 324 I've
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
included a link to the survey at the end
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
of my testimony
 
00:30:36.470 --> 00:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
the solution for this situation is to
 
00:30:38.990 --> 00:30:39.000 align:start position:0%
reform the funding of campaigns so that
 
00:30:41.269 --> 00:30:41.279 align:start position:0%
candidates and elected officials are
 
00:30:43.370 --> 00:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
motivated to serve the citizens of New
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire rather than big big businesses
 
00:30:50.690 --> 00:30:50.700 align:start position:0%
if enacted HB 324 would be a first step
 
00:30:54.169 --> 00:30:54.179 align:start position:0%
in such reform candidates have to meet
 
00:30:56.570 --> 00:30:56.580 align:start position:0%
certain criteria to be eligible for
 
00:30:58.850 --> 00:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
voter dollars and registered voters
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
receive four 25 certificates that they
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
may assign to the participating
 
00:31:07.490 --> 00:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
candidates of their choice participation
 
00:31:11.269 --> 00:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
by candidates and voters is voluntary
 
00:31:14.210 --> 00:31:14.220 align:start position:0%
as a result of this reform engagement
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
between candidates and voters would
 
00:31:18.769 --> 00:31:18.779 align:start position:0%
increase the number of financially
 
00:31:21.409 --> 00:31:21.419 align:start position:0%
viable candidates would grow and they
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
would have to work to make voters
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
believe they are the best choice to
 
00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
receive voter dollars
 
00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
candidates Focus would turn toward their
 
00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
local constituents and the issues that
 
00:31:33.289 --> 00:31:33.299 align:start position:0%
concern them
 
00:31:35.930 --> 00:31:35.940 align:start position:0%
candidates who wish to participate in
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
public funding for their campaigns must
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
collect a minimum number of small
 
00:31:43.490 --> 00:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
donations 2 500 for the office of
 
00:31:46.070 --> 00:31:46.080 align:start position:0%
governor and 500 for the office of
 
00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
executive counselor the amount of each
 
00:31:51.350 --> 00:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
donation is between five and two hundred
 
00:31:53.450 --> 00:31:53.460 align:start position:0%
fifty dollars for governor and between
 
00:31:55.370 --> 00:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
five and one hundred twenty five dollars
 
00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
for executive counselor
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
HB 324 is limited to the campaigns for
 
00:32:04.010 --> 00:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council
 
00:32:06.169 --> 00:32:06.179 align:start position:0%
because the governor and the council are
 
00:32:08.210 --> 00:32:08.220 align:start position:0%
responsible for decisions involving
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
large tax dollar expenditures their
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
offices are subject to lobbying and
 
00:32:16.789 --> 00:32:16.799 align:start position:0%
financial support from donors with high
 
00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:19.380 align:start position:0%
interest in how that money is spent
 
00:32:22.370 --> 00:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
this situation makes these offices ideal
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
for Public Funding as a way to reduce
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
the effects of these donor influences
 
00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:30.539 align:start position:0%
focusing on just six elections makes
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
implementation of the system a
 
00:32:36.049 --> 00:32:36.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
what are the advantages of this system
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
of voter-owned elections candidates of
 
00:32:43.010 --> 00:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
modest means are able to run for office
 
00:32:45.409 --> 00:32:45.419 align:start position:0%
they must reach out to voters and
 
00:32:47.750 --> 00:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
explain why they deserve voter
 
00:32:50.269 --> 00:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
certificates even voters who normally
 
00:32:52.850 --> 00:32:52.860 align:start position:0%
could not afford to donate to campaigns
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
can contribute and feel that they have a
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
voice in the election
 
00:33:00.409 --> 00:33:00.419 align:start position:0%
greater participation by a broader range
 
00:33:03.169 --> 00:33:03.179 align:start position:0%
of candidates and voters leads to
 
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:05.580 align:start position:0%
elected officials who more accurately
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
represent the citizens of New Hampshire
 
00:33:09.710 --> 00:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:11.820 align:start position:0%
funding of this system is an important
 
00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:14.460 align:start position:0%
consideration the report of the
 
00:33:17.570 --> 00:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
bipartisan 2008 commission to study the
 
00:33:19.850 --> 00:33:19.860 align:start position:0%

Funding systems for State elections that
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
have been in place for years

HB 324 provides a workable proven way to
 
00:33:51.529 --> 00:33:51.539 align:start position:0%
improve campaign funding in New
 
00:33:53.950 --> 00:33:53.960 align:start position:0%

Grassroots participation by candidates

Hampshire
 
00:35:11.569 --> 00:35:11.579 align:start position:0%
in 1997 a small group consisting of past
 
00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
legislators and interested citizens was
 
00:35:16.730 --> 00:35:16.740 align:start position:0%
formed to study the issue of Public
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
Funding of election campaigns
 
00:35:22.490 --> 00:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
I participated in that committee as a

Doris haddock granny D joined us after
 
00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
she finished walking across America to
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
promote campaign Finance reform
 
00:35:39.170 --> 00:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
we created the organization Grant

Granite State clean elections and with
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
name changes that organization still
 
00:35:48.410 --> 00:35:48.420 align:start position:0%
exists as open democracy and works
 
00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
tirelessly for Public Funding of
 
00:35:50.820 --> 00:35:52.130 align:start position:0%
tirelessly for Public Funding of

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:52.140 align:start position:0%
Elections
 
00:35:56.510 --> 00:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
in 2000 Senate Bill 447 creating a
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
Public Funding system for New
 
00:36:01.190 --> 00:36:01.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's top three offices past the
 
00:36:04.970 --> 00:36:04.980 align:start position:0%
Senate and failed narrowly in the house
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
in addition to legislative bills there
 
00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
have been study committees a bipartisan
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
commission and a blue ribbon task force
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
but still no Statewide system of Public
 
00:36:17.880 --> 00:36:19.490 align:start position:0%
but still no Statewide system of Public
Funding

00:36:19.490 --> 00:36:19.500 align:start position:0%
Funding
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
over the same period of time the amount
 
00:36:24.589 --> 00:36:24.599 align:start position:0%
of money spent on elections has
 
00:36:24.599 --> 00:36:26.089 align:start position:0%
of money spent on elections has
skyrocketed

00:36:26.089 --> 00:36:26.099 align:start position:0%
skyrocketed
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
the people of New Hampshire are acutely
 
00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
aware of the huge amount of money spent
 
00:36:33.950 --> 00:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
on political campaigns and of how so
 
00:36:35.990 --> 00:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
much of it is coming from unknown
 
00:36:40.010 --> 00:36:40.020 align:start position:0%
sources packs dark money and the very
 
00:36:40.020 --> 00:36:41.930 align:start position:0%
sources packs dark money and the very
wealthy

00:36:41.930 --> 00:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
wealthy
 
00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
people are both discouraged and angry
 
00:36:48.829 --> 00:36:48.839 align:start position:0%
they feel rightly so
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
that their voices are being overpowered
 
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
by big money
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
and so here you are today considering
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
house bill 324.
 
00:37:03.410 --> 00:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
this bill takes its main structure from
 
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:07.140 align:start position:0%
an older bill Senate bill 304.
 
00:37:09.890 --> 00:37:09.900 align:start position:0%
that bill was created by a working group
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
of six legislators
 
00:37:15.050 --> 00:37:15.060 align:start position:0%
two senators four Representatives three
 
00:37:17.569 --> 00:37:17.579 align:start position:0%
Republicans three Democrats
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
it was led by a moderator from open
 
00:37:22.310 --> 00:37:22.320 align:start position:0%
democracy action
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
the process was long and hard and full
 
00:37:29.390 --> 00:37:29.400 align:start position:0%
of discussions and compromises
 
00:37:31.609 --> 00:37:31.619 align:start position:0%
the end result was a proposed public
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
Learning System that would have worked
 
00:37:35.690 --> 00:37:35.700 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
00:37:38.990 --> 00:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 324 would also work for New
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today
 
00:37:42.770 --> 00:37:42.780 align:start position:0%
it is a modest start
 
00:37:45.470 --> 00:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
covering only the campaigns for governor
 
00:37:47.990 --> 00:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
and executive Council
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
the goal is to show that such a such a
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
system can work and improve all our
 
00:37:56.450 --> 00:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
election campaigns for New Hampshire
 
00:37:59.150 --> 00:37:59.160 align:start position:0%
Public offices
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
one compelling future of the bill gives
 
00:38:04.670 --> 00:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
each New Hampshire registered voter for
 
00:38:08.690 --> 00:38:08.700 align:start position:0%
25 certificates to give to candidates of
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
their choice
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
the campaigns can exchange these
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
certificates for cash
 
00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:18.180 align:start position:0%
the city of Seattle included this
 
00:38:20.750 --> 00:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
feature when it adopted a Public Funding
 
00:38:25.310 --> 00:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
funding system in 2015.
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
in evaluating the results of its Public
 
00:38:30.609 --> 00:38:30.619 align:start position:0%
Funding initiative and the use of the 25

certificates two maps of the city were
 
00:38:33.900 --> 00:38:36.170 align:start position:0%
certificates two maps of the city were
created

00:38:36.170 --> 00:38:36.180 align:start position:0%
created
 
00:38:38.450 --> 00:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
the first showed where donors to
 
00:38:40.490 --> 00:38:40.500 align:start position:0%
campaigns lived before the use of
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
certificates not surprisingly they were
 
00:38:45.890 --> 00:38:45.900 align:start position:0%
clustered in wealthy sections of the
 
00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:46.790 align:start position:0%

city

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%

00:38:50.150 --> 00:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
the second map after certificates were
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
in use showed donors spread all over the
 
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.530 align:start position:0%

city

00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%

00:38:56.810 --> 00:38:56.820 align:start position:0%
people who had not been able to donate
 
00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.160 align:start position:0%
to campaigns were empowered by these

to campaigns were empowered by these
certificates

00:39:00.410 --> 00:39:00.420 align:start position:0%
certificates
 
00:39:03.530 --> 00:39:03.540 align:start position:0%
also candidates needed to campaign all
 
00:39:05.870 --> 00:39:05.880 align:start position:0%
over the city and reach out to all
 
00:39:07.790 --> 00:39:07.800 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods in order to convince
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
voters to give them their certificates
 
00:39:14.150 --> 00:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
the certificates created real Grassroots
 
00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.250 align:start position:0%
the certificates created real Grassroots

00:39:19.670 --> 00:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
House Bill 324 deserves to be enacted
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%

00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%
financing public campaigns that is both
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
practical and innovative
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire deserve to
 
00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%

hearing so that we can re-notify it for
 
00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
next week and have representative
 
00:39:59.930 --> 00:39:59.940 align:start position:0%

I'll be opening the hearing for House
 
00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 453
 
00:40:15.290 --> 00:40:15.300 align:start position:0%
relative to prohibiting the folding of
 
00:40:17.030 --> 00:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
election balance and providing adequate
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
envelopes for absentee ballots to
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
prevent folding see I'm awake now so I
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
um let me see here
 
00:40:30.650 --> 00:40:30.660 align:start position:0%

hearings as we'll have the um obviously
 
00:40:43.010 --> 00:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
the spots will introduce and then we'll
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
do the estate Representatives first
 
00:40:45.890 --> 00:40:45.900 align:start position:0%
um and then after that we go through
 
00:40:47.510 --> 00:40:47.520 align:start position:0%
this so representative Perez welcome to

members um I am representative Christine
Perez

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
Perez
 
00:40:57.890 --> 00:40:57.900 align:start position:0%
um thank you for allowing me to present
 
00:41:02.030 --> 00:41:02.040 align:start position:0%
you House Bill 453 as amended and I have
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
copies of the amendment here
 
00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:07.619 align:start position:0%
the bill as amended will only apply to
 
00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:11.820 align:start position:0%
the 135 home towns and cities that as of
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
2022 used voting machines and will be
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
added to RSA 656 33 thus prohibiting
 
00:41:21.530 --> 00:41:21.540 align:start position:0%
folded ballots
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
my initial concern with folded ballots
 
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
started working as a poll Challenger in
 
00:41:26.220 --> 00:41:27.250 align:start position:0%
started working as a poll Challenger in
2018

00:41:27.250 --> 00:41:27.260 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
I observed paid staff of the Town
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
attempting to place absentee ballots
 
00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
that had been folded into the voting
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
machines and frequently had difficulty
 
00:41:38.630 --> 00:41:38.640 align:start position:0%
with the machines accepting these
 
00:41:41.750 --> 00:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
ballots attempts to flatten the creases
 
00:41:44.930 --> 00:41:44.940 align:start position:0%
were not always successful in gaining
 
00:41:47.569 --> 00:41:47.579 align:start position:0%
access to the machines subsequently
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
after the 2020 election with the ballot
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
recounts in Windham the entire State and
 
00:41:56.329 --> 00:41:56.339 align:start position:0%
Beyond became aware of the serious
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
folded pallet concerns
 
00:42:01.310 --> 00:42:01.320 align:start position:0%
as you all know a vast majority of the
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
problem with these foldings was later
 
00:42:05.870 --> 00:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
confirmed by the auditor
 
00:42:07.790 --> 00:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
the concern over folded ballots
 
00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
continues and it continues for other
 
00:42:12.770 --> 00:42:12.780 align:start position:0%
reasons which I will go into with other
 
00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:14.810 align:start position:0%
reasons which I will go into with other
testimony

00:42:14.810 --> 00:42:14.820 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:42:18.109 --> 00:42:18.119 align:start position:0%
um items are regularly used now after
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
opening the envelopes and attempts to
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
flatten the creases this labor Sim
 
00:42:26.569 --> 00:42:26.579 align:start position:0%
exercises exercise is not only con time
 
00:42:28.370 --> 00:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
consuming but costly to the
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
municipalities that use paid voters
 
00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:35.700 align:start position:0%
workers one must also note that not all
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots are mailed as
 
00:42:40.970 --> 00:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
individually individually individuals
 
00:42:43.910 --> 00:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
frequently go to the town offices and
 
00:42:45.770 --> 00:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
hand in their balance
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
I present this as a bipartisan bill as
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
all towns and cities using folded
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
ballots have the potential for problems
 
00:42:56.510 --> 00:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
I submit to you that this problem could
 
00:42:58.670 --> 00:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
easily be resolved
 
00:43:01.849 --> 00:43:01.859 align:start position:0%
by just not folding the ballots
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
I will leave further expertise to those
 
00:43:06.470 --> 00:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
who have kindly offered to speak and
 
00:43:09.109 --> 00:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
support to offer more insight into the
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
potential consequences
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
um one of I did learn late last night
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
that one very important
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
um individual that was going to testify
 
00:43:21.890 --> 00:43:21.900 align:start position:0%
was unable to make it his name is Tom
 
00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
Murray he is co-founder of the
 
00:43:27.650 --> 00:43:27.660 align:start position:0%
government intended in Integrity project
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
so I would like to offer a little bit of
 
00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:33.180 align:start position:0%
information because it is not just the
 
00:43:36.530 --> 00:43:36.540 align:start position:0%
problem with the ballots being rejected
 
00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:39.960 align:start position:0%
by the machines as was brought out
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
during the Wyndham recount the problem
 
00:43:46.730 --> 00:43:46.740 align:start position:0%
of overvote and Phantom votes were also
 
00:43:50.630 --> 00:43:50.640 align:start position:0%
brought out I have a copy of his report
 
00:43:53.089 --> 00:43:53.099 align:start position:0%
that was filed with the commission on
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
voter confidence this past September of
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
2022. uh it's explains that overvote and
 
00:44:04.550 --> 00:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
Phantom vote issues so an overvote we
 
00:44:06.890 --> 00:44:06.900 align:start position:0%
all know if somebody puts too many names
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
if there's only supposed to pick four
 
00:44:10.970 --> 00:44:10.980 align:start position:0%
and you pick five that's considered an
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
overvote what they found in Windham
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
would happen is very often the crease
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
would cause an overvote depending on
 
00:44:21.050 --> 00:44:21.060 align:start position:0%
where that crease was
 
00:44:21.060 --> 00:44:22.430 align:start position:0%
where that crease was
now

00:44:22.430 --> 00:44:22.440 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:44:25.490 --> 00:44:25.500 align:start position:0%
a lot of that that and that um
 
00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
that can be found in his
 
00:44:31.750 --> 00:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
um information on in the beginning
 
00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
Phantom vote is when you have a folded
 
00:44:39.589 --> 00:44:39.599 align:start position:0%
ballot and that fold goes through the
 
00:44:43.550 --> 00:44:43.560 align:start position:0%
oval before a candidate's name and it
 
00:44:46.010 --> 00:44:46.020 align:start position:0%
has been found and I have some pictures
 
00:44:48.650 --> 00:44:48.660 align:start position:0%
of some folded ballots too it has been
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
found that actually
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
that fold can count as a vote towards
 
00:44:58.510 --> 00:44:58.520 align:start position:0%
that particular candidate that can be
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
seen on the ballot and it's in testimony
 
00:45:04.010 --> 00:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
here as they went on
 
00:45:06.349 --> 00:45:06.359 align:start position:0%
the expected overvote rates were
 
00:45:09.370 --> 00:45:09.380 align:start position:0%
expected with these machines to be about
 
00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540 align:start position:0%
.03 percent but in the seven towns that
 
00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:15.260 align:start position:0%
this group went into further investigate
 
00:45:19.329 --> 00:45:19.339 align:start position:0%
they were from 5.2 to
 
00:45:21.530 --> 00:45:21.540 align:start position:0%
22.78 percent
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
their conclusion showed that some
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
changed elections House Bill 1163 that
 
00:45:31.550 --> 00:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
was passed last year it was a start but
 
00:45:33.950 --> 00:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
in his opinion and the people of this
 
00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
group it is it is not all of that the
 
00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:40.140 align:start position:0%
machines are not all of the machines are
 
00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:43.260 align:start position:0%
capable what that bill did is it said
 
00:45:45.530 --> 00:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
that if an overvote went into the
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
machine the machine would kick it out
 
00:45:50.750 --> 00:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
so that it would then go be put into the
 
00:45:52.609 --> 00:45:52.619 align:start position:0%
side of the machine I know that not all
 
00:45:55.849 --> 00:45:55.859 align:start position:0%
the machines are capable of doing that
 
00:45:55.859 --> 00:45:56.750 align:start position:0%
the machines are capable of doing that
um

00:45:56.750 --> 00:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
so that is his testimony as well
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to leave further expertise
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
to those who have kindly offered to
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
speak and support and offer more insight
 
00:46:09.290 --> 00:46:09.300 align:start position:0%
into the potential consequences
 
00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:12.780 align:start position:0%
but in conclusion committee members
 
00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:15.300 align:start position:0%
voting is granted to us under article 11
 
00:46:17.630 --> 00:46:17.640 align:start position:0%
of our state constitution Bills of Right
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
I firmly believe that the Integrity of
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
this right is a reasonable expectation
 
00:46:25.670 --> 00:46:25.680 align:start position:0%
for all and I encourage you to
 
00:46:28.609 --> 00:46:28.619 align:start position:0%
pass this Bill thank you will you be
 
00:46:30.170 --> 00:46:30.180 align:start position:0%
taking questions yes I will are there
 
00:46:32.329 --> 00:46:32.339 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
00:46:34.730 --> 00:46:34.740 align:start position:0%
yes representative weary
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
um suppose a folded ballot comes in
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
nonetheless what is there any
 
00:46:47.270 --> 00:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
uh concern with how that will be
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
addressed or
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
I know that there are towns that have
 
00:46:55.490 --> 00:46:55.500 align:start position:0%
been hand counting fold in ballots okay
 
00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:57.589 align:start position:0%
been hand counting fold in ballots okay
um

00:46:57.589 --> 00:46:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:59.690 --> 00:46:59.700 align:start position:0%
that will be someone else will be going
 
00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:02.640 align:start position:0%
into that as well but you know the the
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
point that I'm trying to make is that it
 
00:47:07.430 --> 00:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
is three-fold it is not just going into
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
the machine it's the problem with that
 
00:47:11.930 --> 00:47:11.940 align:start position:0%
with over count and then with this
 
00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.670 align:start position:0%
with over count and then with this
phantom

00:47:13.670 --> 00:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
phantom
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:21.349 --> 00:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
are there questions from the committee
 
00:47:24.650 --> 00:47:24.660 align:start position:0%
uh representative Howard uh thank you uh
 
00:47:26.930 --> 00:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
so with the Secretary of State's office
 
00:47:28.790 --> 00:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
looking at purchasing new voting
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
machines uh have you reached out to
 
00:47:32.450 --> 00:47:32.460 align:start position:0%
their office at all to see if those new
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
machines uh would be able to uh count
 
00:47:37.730 --> 00:47:37.740 align:start position:0%
the ballots with the the crease because
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
it seems uh that the current issue is
 
00:47:42.349 --> 00:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
that the current uh machines cannot
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
count those ballots
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
well the current machines do can count
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
the ballots but not always accurately no
 
00:47:52.190 --> 00:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
I in answer to your question no I have
 
00:47:54.230 --> 00:47:54.240 align:start position:0%
not reached out to them
 
00:47:56.329 --> 00:47:56.339 align:start position:0%
um there are the town that I live in
 
00:47:58.690 --> 00:47:58.700 align:start position:0%
Londonderry actually for the March
 
00:48:02.510 --> 00:48:02.520 align:start position:0%
upcoming March election we'll be using
 
00:48:05.450 --> 00:48:05.460 align:start position:0%
um testing there's two towns I believe
 
00:48:07.849 --> 00:48:07.859 align:start position:0%
that are doing it we'll be testing new
 
00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:12.060 align:start position:0%
machines so that would be a good um
 
00:48:14.690 --> 00:48:14.700 align:start position:0%
see test to see if something different
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
happens with them but no I have not
 
00:48:18.530 --> 00:48:18.540 align:start position:0%
answered your question
 
00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:20.700 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative Brennan
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:27.599 --> 00:48:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
costly

00:48:30.230 --> 00:48:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:33.349 --> 00:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
folded ballots than what it would be to
 
00:48:36.410 --> 00:48:36.420 align:start position:0%
provide the larger envelopes
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
no I'm telling you that I do not know
 
00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
the answer to that and
 
00:48:43.550 --> 00:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
um but again I think that is twofold
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
there's you are paying people to work at
 
00:48:50.930 --> 00:48:50.940 align:start position:0%
the town so that is the larger
 
00:48:53.950 --> 00:48:53.960 align:start position:0%
um the larger envelopes would be more
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
costly but to try to figure out exactly
 
00:48:58.970 --> 00:48:58.980 align:start position:0%
how many of those will be used no I
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
don't I think the Integrity of your vote
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
may be another issue in along with the
 
00:49:11.030 --> 00:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
um with the financial issues
 
00:49:12.050 --> 00:49:12.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Lane
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you I can't seem to reach my
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
uh what about the postage for the larger
 
00:49:21.470 --> 00:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
envelopes so now we're going to have
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
voters having to spend more on postage
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct because I
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
honestly yes that would be correct but
 
00:49:31.550 --> 00:49:31.560 align:start position:0%
that also I believe is going to be
 
00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:33.300 align:start position:0%
brought up by people who know more about
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
it than I do all right thank you
 
00:49:37.910 --> 00:49:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
um Clayton um wood excuse me thank you
 
00:49:43.370 --> 00:49:43.380 align:start position:0%
for taking my question do we know how
 
00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
many uh potential uh ballots folded
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
ballots off her Town roughly well there
 
00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:50.700 align:start position:0%
were over 62
 
00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.069 align:start position:0%
were over 62
000

00:49:52.069 --> 00:49:52.079 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:49:55.450 --> 00:49:55.460 align:start position:0%
um at the November election Statewide
 
00:49:58.130 --> 00:49:58.140 align:start position:0%
Statewide yes okay thank you but that
 
00:50:01.069 --> 00:50:01.079 align:start position:0%
was all all towns and cities this would
 
00:50:01.079 --> 00:50:02.210 align:start position:0%
was all all towns and cities this would
be

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:02.220 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:50:05.030 --> 00:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
for the 135 that are using machines at
 
00:50:06.829 --> 00:50:06.839 align:start position:0%
this time I understand thank you thank
 
00:50:06.839 --> 00:50:07.809 align:start position:0%
this time I understand thank you thank
you

00:50:07.809 --> 00:50:07.819 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee sixty
 
00:50:11.990 --> 00:50:12.000 align:start position:0%
two thousand seven hundred and nine
 
00:50:15.050 --> 00:50:15.060 align:start position:0%
representative thank you roughly thank
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Perez uh our own uh
 
00:50:19.550 --> 00:50:19.560 align:start position:0%
The veneral Honorable representative
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:26.089 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:50:26.089 --> 00:50:26.099 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:50:27.410 --> 00:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
sorry and representative Perez if you
 
00:50:29.030 --> 00:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
could fill out the uh the pink card for
 
00:50:34.550 --> 00:50:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for that
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
introduction thank you for this
 
00:50:40.270 --> 00:50:40.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak this morning
 
00:50:44.569 --> 00:50:44.579 align:start position:0%
I previously have been and I'm speaking
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
about in years past I have previously
 
00:50:51.170 --> 00:50:51.180 align:start position:0%
opposed this measure because of the cost
 
00:50:53.329 --> 00:50:53.339 align:start position:0%
involved to communities
 
00:50:56.329 --> 00:50:56.339 align:start position:0%
and I've changed my mind and the reason
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
why is because I have new information my
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
I live in Derry and the town clerk she's
 
00:51:07.730 --> 00:51:07.740 align:start position:0%
the former Town moderator told me that
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
she is spending time and money
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
to process folded ballots and this would
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
help alleviate some of that those
 
00:51:20.809 --> 00:51:20.819 align:start position:0%
efforts that she's spending well when
 
00:51:22.730 --> 00:51:22.740 align:start position:0%
she was our town moderator she's now our
 
00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:25.130 align:start position:0%
she was our town moderator she's now our
Clerk

00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
Clerk
 
00:51:27.910 --> 00:51:27.920 align:start position:0%
our absentee ballots were hand counted
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
in the last election because of concern
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
about absentee ballots going through the
 
00:51:36.530 --> 00:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
machine I think we all know about the
 
00:51:38.690 --> 00:51:38.700 align:start position:0%
situation that occurred in Windham where
 
00:51:41.990 --> 00:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
there were the Phantom votes or the
 
00:51:45.710 --> 00:51:45.720 align:start position:0%
votes that went through the uh the
 
00:51:48.530 --> 00:51:48.540 align:start position:0%
bubble I'm sorry the fold went through
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
the bubble
 
00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:50.829 align:start position:0%
the bubble
um

00:51:50.829 --> 00:51:50.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:54.230 --> 00:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then the machines read that as a
 
00:51:57.530 --> 00:51:57.540 align:start position:0%
vote for that candidate and then that
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
was a big mess
 
00:52:03.650 --> 00:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
the community of Windham their Town
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
officials used some folding equipment
 
00:52:06.359 --> 00:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
officials used some folding equipment
that

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
probably wasn't the best idea to use
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
because the folds that were pre-scored
 
00:52:16.730 --> 00:52:16.740 align:start position:0%
on the ballots but in that spot
 
00:52:16.740 --> 00:52:17.750 align:start position:0%
on the ballots but in that spot
um

00:52:17.750 --> 00:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:20.760 align:start position:0%
there was it was it was pre-scored to be
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
certain that there would be no fold on a
 
00:52:25.309 --> 00:52:25.319 align:start position:0%
Target and then the officials in Windham
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
used some Machinery to to make the
 
00:52:31.849 --> 00:52:31.859 align:start position:0%
process go faster and fold the the
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
ballots in a in a different way and it
 
00:52:36.950 --> 00:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
ended up going through a Target and so
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
that was the problem there so
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
if there is the opportunity to
 
00:52:47.809 --> 00:52:47.819 align:start position:0%
make voters more confident that this
 
00:52:51.470 --> 00:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
will not occur again then that's a good
 
00:52:53.750 --> 00:52:53.760 align:start position:0%
idea and if the communities are now
 
00:52:56.930 --> 00:52:56.940 align:start position:0%
spending more money to either count them
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
by count absentee ballots by hand
 
00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:01.549 align:start position:0%
by count absentee ballots by hand
then

00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:53:04.490 --> 00:53:04.500 align:start position:0%
um this is this is a good way to go and
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
also if also communities may may be
 
00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:12.180 align:start position:0%
folding them differently than intended
 
00:53:15.109 --> 00:53:15.119 align:start position:0%
or even the voter might might Fold It
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
innocently not realizing that this could
 
00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:20.700 align:start position:0%
be an issue and also sometimes these
 
00:53:22.790 --> 00:53:22.800 align:start position:0%
folds because they increase the
 
00:53:25.370 --> 00:53:25.380 align:start position:0%
thickness of the paper in that spot can
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
cause some some
 
00:53:30.650 --> 00:53:30.660 align:start position:0%
um jamming of the of the equipment and
 
00:53:33.349 --> 00:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
then that becomes an issue as well and
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
whenever you have these problems voter
 
00:53:37.549 --> 00:53:37.559 align:start position:0%
confidence gets
 
00:53:39.410 --> 00:53:39.420 align:start position:0%
um becomes a concern because people are
 
00:53:41.870 --> 00:53:41.880 align:start position:0%
always worried wait did my vote get
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
counted so
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
that's why our our election officials in
 
00:53:49.730 --> 00:53:49.740 align:start position:0%
my community went to hand counting so
 
00:53:52.069 --> 00:53:52.079 align:start position:0%
that those concerns would not be in play
 
00:53:54.950 --> 00:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
and then that costs money because you
 
00:53:57.650 --> 00:53:57.660 align:start position:0%
have to you have to um spend extra time
 
00:54:00.770 --> 00:54:00.780 align:start position:0%
and hire staff for that
 
00:54:03.410 --> 00:54:03.420 align:start position:0%
so someone asked a good question about
 
00:54:06.650 --> 00:54:06.660 align:start position:0%
the postage and that's one of the
 
00:54:08.510 --> 00:54:08.520 align:start position:0%
reasons why previously I would have said
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
no thank you to this bill
 
00:54:10.319 --> 00:54:11.089 align:start position:0%
no thank you to this bill
um

00:54:11.089 --> 00:54:11.099 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:13.549 --> 00:54:13.559 align:start position:0%
but everything's a balancing act isn't
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
it and we all we have to think
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
what concerns do we are more important
 
00:54:21.230 --> 00:54:21.240 align:start position:0%
right here right now on this specific
 
00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:22.370 align:start position:0%
right here right now on this specific
bill

00:54:22.370 --> 00:54:22.380 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:54:24.890 --> 00:54:24.900 align:start position:0%
I think that um
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
the change on the postage when we have a
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
bill that would pertain to this coming
 
00:54:34.190 --> 00:54:34.200 align:start position:0%
up in a few a little bit later today uh
 
00:54:36.290 --> 00:54:36.300 align:start position:0%
I think right now a first class stamp is
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
59 cents and that is what an absentee
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
ballot folded would cost to send in and
 
00:54:45.890 --> 00:54:45.900 align:start position:0%
now it's going to jump up higher I'm not
 
00:54:47.809 --> 00:54:47.819 align:start position:0%
sure of that exact cost but I'm
 
00:54:50.450 --> 00:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
guesstimating around a dollar fifty two
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
dollars on a flat
 
00:54:52.260 --> 00:54:53.630 align:start position:0%
dollars on a flat
uh

00:54:53.630 --> 00:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
envelope yeah
 
00:54:58.370 --> 00:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
I know that's not ideal
 
00:55:00.829 --> 00:55:00.839 align:start position:0%
and I like I said I would have opposed
 
00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
this uh at these efforts for that reason
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:55:08.210 --> 00:55:08.220 align:start position:0%
but I don't think that's unobtainable
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
for a voter and
 
00:55:11.099 --> 00:55:12.650 align:start position:0%
for a voter and
a

00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:55:14.930 --> 00:55:14.940 align:start position:0%
we have to spend money on gas in
 
00:55:16.849 --> 00:55:16.859 align:start position:0%
bringing these
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
um if we were to vote in person so you
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
know again Balancing Act what do we
 
00:55:26.210 --> 00:55:26.220 align:start position:0%
worry about for the voters also voters
 
00:55:28.130 --> 00:55:28.140 align:start position:0%
have the option of bringing these back
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
to the town hall when in the area that I
 
00:55:32.030 --> 00:55:32.040 align:start position:0%
know I do that when I have something to
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
bring to town hall
 
00:55:35.390 --> 00:55:35.400 align:start position:0%
and I want to save money on postage
 
00:55:37.370 --> 00:55:37.380 align:start position:0%
because I'm cheap I mean Frugal I'm
 
00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:38.990 align:start position:0%
because I'm cheap I mean Frugal I'm
frugal

00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
frugal
 
00:55:40.670 --> 00:55:40.680 align:start position:0%
all right well that's everything are
 
00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
there any questions I hope I can get
 
00:55:45.170 --> 00:55:45.180 align:start position:0%
those I hope I can answer those yes
 
00:55:46.790 --> 00:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative Howard
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh so
 
00:55:52.010 --> 00:55:52.020 align:start position:0%
as you would outlined uh in the Wyndham
 
00:55:55.370 --> 00:55:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh audit situation the issue was the
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
folds on uh where the bubbles were would
 
00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
it be cheaper to standardize folding
 
00:56:05.569 --> 00:56:05.579 align:start position:0%
equipment than it would to uh offshore
 
00:56:08.809 --> 00:56:08.819 align:start position:0%
offshift that cost onto the voter I'm
 
00:56:11.210 --> 00:56:11.220 align:start position:0%
going to pause there Howard um Mr repson
 
00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:13.079 align:start position:0%
hours there's no standardized folding
 
00:56:14.210 --> 00:56:14.220 align:start position:0%
equipment in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:56:15.890 --> 00:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
just so you know
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
yes I I'm sorry I'm trying to uh ask if
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
it would be cheaper uh to implement that
 
00:56:23.750 --> 00:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
as a one-time cost rather than it's a
 
00:56:24.950 --> 00:56:24.960 align:start position:0%
fair question I just want to make sure
 
00:56:26.089 --> 00:56:26.099 align:start position:0%
you understand that there's no
 
00:56:28.730 --> 00:56:28.740 align:start position:0%
designated folding yes I I was asking if
 
00:56:30.230 --> 00:56:30.240 align:start position:0%
it would be cheaper to implement that
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
equipment thank you for that question
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
I was curious about where
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
all those pre-scored
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
folds landed and I looked at each and
 
00:56:42.589 --> 00:56:42.599 align:start position:0%
every ballot
 
00:56:44.450 --> 00:56:44.460 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire that year
 
00:56:46.750 --> 00:56:46.760 align:start position:0%
that that problem occurred in Windham
 
00:56:50.450 --> 00:56:50.460 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State's office does
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
pay attention to that very closely and
 
00:56:57.650 --> 00:56:57.660 align:start position:0%
the preschools are never in a spot where
 
00:57:02.450 --> 00:57:02.460 align:start position:0%
they would hit a voting Target a bubble
 
00:57:05.690 --> 00:57:05.700 align:start position:0%
so that they would be in between a name
 
00:57:07.970 --> 00:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
on on the ballots that so what happened
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
in Windham is they didn't fold the votes
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
in that manner I mean the ballots in
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
that manner and the um
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
they used other folding equipment that
 
00:57:22.190 --> 00:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
they should not have done but they were
 
00:57:25.609 --> 00:57:25.619 align:start position:0%
trying to save time so because we had so
 
00:57:28.609 --> 00:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
many absentee ballots that year with the
 
00:57:32.210 --> 00:57:32.220 align:start position:0%
pandemic so that's
 
00:57:34.130 --> 00:57:34.140 align:start position:0%
the problem that occurred there and I
 
00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.460 align:start position:0%
think someone else will be speaking
 
00:57:38.690 --> 00:57:38.700 align:start position:0%
about that in much more detail behind me
 
00:57:40.309 --> 00:57:40.319 align:start position:0%
we have never talked about folded
 
00:57:42.130 --> 00:57:42.140 align:start position:0%
ballots in this committee ever right now
 
00:57:44.150 --> 00:57:44.160 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
00:57:46.190 --> 00:57:46.200 align:start position:0%
representative Hamer
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question I have
 
00:57:51.890 --> 00:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
a question how many envelopes would be
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
required for sending out the ballot
 
00:57:57.890 --> 00:57:57.900 align:start position:0%
and the weight of that
 
00:58:00.770 --> 00:58:00.780 align:start position:0%
right well I'm sure the the efforts
 
00:58:02.510 --> 00:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
would be made to keep the weight as low
 
00:58:05.930 --> 00:58:05.940 align:start position:0%
as possible not using thick paper uh
 
00:58:08.270 --> 00:58:08.280 align:start position:0%
there's the ballot it would be the same
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
as it is now
 
00:58:09.839 --> 00:58:10.970 align:start position:0%
as it is now
um

00:58:10.970 --> 00:58:10.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
think of that's two or three uh the
 
00:58:15.170 --> 00:58:15.180 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office could
 
00:58:17.210 --> 00:58:17.220 align:start position:0%
address that issue but it would be the
 
00:58:19.069 --> 00:58:19.079 align:start position:0%
same you'd have the ballot to send back
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
in and then the ballot inside that I
 
00:58:22.309 --> 00:58:22.319 align:start position:0%
mean the envelope to send back in and
 
00:58:24.049 --> 00:58:24.059 align:start position:0%
then the ballot inside that envelope so
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
I think it would be the same envelope
 
00:58:29.930 --> 00:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:31.970 --> 00:58:31.980 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:58:35.630 --> 00:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
no worries uh yes representative Lane
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:58:43.910 --> 00:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.730 --> 00:58:46.740 align:start position:0%
I just lost my train of thought
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
if it comes back to me okay I'll return
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
absolutely all right other other not
 
00:58:53.690 --> 00:58:53.700 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:58:55.069 --> 00:58:55.079 align:start position:0%
all right representative Lane I think
 
00:58:56.030 --> 00:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to be uh you're gonna have
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
to fire that uh missile off later
 
00:59:00.470 --> 00:59:00.480 align:start position:0%
I thank you representative good home
 
00:59:02.870 --> 00:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
O'Brien uh next up representative Erica
 
00:59:11.030 --> 00:59:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:13.549 --> 00:59:13.559 align:start position:0%
oh okay um well we can we if you want to
 
00:59:15.109 --> 00:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
if you want to ask right now I'm fine
 
00:59:18.849 --> 00:59:18.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
you're not done yet we're gonna we're
 
00:59:22.190 --> 00:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
gonna extend some courtesy here she she
 
00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
remembered uh representative Lane
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:29.990 --> 00:59:30.000 align:start position:0%
what's what's the amendment change from
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:35.210 --> 00:59:35.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that uh I have the answer
 
00:59:37.549 --> 00:59:37.559 align:start position:0%
to that okay I think it was distributed
 
00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
I I was trying to compare it but it's
 
00:59:41.210 --> 00:59:41.220 align:start position:0%
coming up the answer is coming up it was
 
00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:43.920 align:start position:0%
distributed I believe uh obviously I'll
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
all right now representative Erica
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
welcome to uh welcome to election law uh
 
00:59:53.930 --> 00:59:53.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
00:59:55.789 --> 00:59:55.799 align:start position:0%
election law committee um to answer that
 
00:59:57.710 --> 00:59:57.720 align:start position:0%
question from representative Lane the
 
00:59:59.569 --> 00:59:59.579 align:start position:0%
amendment says that it's not all towns
 
01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:01.980 align:start position:0%
and cities it's simply those who use
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
vote counting machines so that we don't
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
add an extra cost to those towns who are
 
01:00:08.569 --> 01:00:08.579 align:start position:0%
already on Counting every ballot
 
01:00:10.970 --> 01:00:10.980 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I came to this topic from a slightly
 
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:15.540 align:start position:0%
different different approach but we had
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
one of those wonderful matchmaking by
 
01:00:20.210 --> 01:00:20.220 align:start position:0%
OLS opportunities so I am a co-sponsor
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
to this bill from my colleague from
 
01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
Londonderry I had looked at the ballot
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
in Derry there was actually no way to
 
01:00:29.329 --> 01:00:29.339 align:start position:0%
fold derry's ballot without going
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
through a bubble on one side or the
 
01:00:34.069 --> 01:00:34.079 align:start position:0%
other it was unfortunately one of the
 
01:00:36.049 --> 01:00:36.059 align:start position:0%
scenarios where the Secretary of State
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
simply could not give a space I looked
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
at how we might mandate that there's
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
certain spaces for folding what we might
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
be able to do in order to make sure that
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
we avoid this problem while keeping
 
01:00:49.910 --> 01:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
these ballots in a small an envelope as
 
01:00:49.920 --> 01:00:51.950 align:start position:0%
these ballots in a small an envelope as
possible

01:00:51.950 --> 01:00:51.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
I couldn't come up with any solution
 
01:00:55.849 --> 01:00:55.859 align:start position:0%
nobody could come up with any solution
 
01:00:57.470 --> 01:00:57.480 align:start position:0%
to make sure that this wouldn't happen
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
and that's actually why we had poll
 
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
workers were counting until about 3 A.M
 
01:01:05.450 --> 01:01:05.460 align:start position:0%
in Derry this past November
 
01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:07.740 align:start position:0%
we had over 1 000 ballots that were
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
absentee and were folded because any
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
fold went through one of the bubbles
 
01:01:16.549 --> 01:01:16.559 align:start position:0%
it was very very important to make sure
 
01:01:18.289 --> 01:01:18.299 align:start position:0%
with confidence that the election
 
01:01:20.870 --> 01:01:20.880 align:start position:0%
results were actually true a thousand
 
01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
votes would have been enough to swing
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
quite a few elections in Derry so that
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
was absolutely mandatory to make sure
 
01:01:29.690 --> 01:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
that we were confident
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
that cost a lot of money it cost a lot
 
01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
of time and if we didn't have such an
 
01:01:36.170 --> 01:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
exceptional town clerk it would have
 
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
thrown a lot into question people know
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
how seriously she takes election
 
01:01:43.670 --> 01:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
integrity and therefore any concerns
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
were diffused with going so late Into
 
01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
the Night
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
by requiring absentee ballots to being
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
closed in an envelopes that will allow
 
01:01:55.069 --> 01:01:55.079 align:start position:0%
the ballot to be mailed without folding
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
we remove that risk and we remove that
 
01:02:00.829 --> 01:02:00.839 align:start position:0%
decision from town Town moderators who
 
01:02:03.530 --> 01:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
may be facing a shortage of poll workers
 
01:02:05.690 --> 01:02:05.700 align:start position:0%
we need our poll workers to be on point
 
01:02:08.210 --> 01:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
all day and hopefully not all night
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
until it's almost Sunrise again that's
 
01:02:13.130 --> 01:02:13.140 align:start position:0%
what was expected of our poll workers
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
and we need to figure out what we can do
 
01:02:17.210 --> 01:02:17.220 align:start position:0%
in order to ease their burden so we have
 
01:02:19.309 --> 01:02:19.319 align:start position:0%
people continue to volunteer at our
 
01:02:21.289 --> 01:02:21.299 align:start position:0%
elections and keep our elections fair
 
01:02:24.230 --> 01:02:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.170 --> 01:02:27.180 align:start position:0%
well when we look at this I look at the
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
cost and I look at the cost to a person
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
who has to return these ballots right
 
01:02:34.370 --> 01:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
now a forever stamp is 63 cents and an
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
oversized letter is a dollar three we're
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
talking about an extra 40 cents if we're
 
01:02:41.569 --> 01:02:41.579 align:start position:0%
looking at extra overweight charges then
 
01:02:43.630 --> 01:02:43.640 align:start position:0%
we get into another territory as well
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
but I ask you what's the value in making
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
sure that your vote is counted correctly
 
01:02:51.890 --> 01:02:51.900 align:start position:0%
if you're sending in an absentee ballot
 
01:02:53.990 --> 01:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's folded and you're not sure if the
 
01:02:56.150 --> 01:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
machine will read it correctly or if a
 
01:02:57.890 --> 01:02:57.900 align:start position:0%
poll worker counting at 2 30 in the
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
morning is going to read it correctly is
 
01:03:04.250 --> 01:03:04.260 align:start position:0%
it worth 40 cents is it worth a dollar
 
01:03:09.829 --> 01:03:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.470 --> 01:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
we okay questions from the committee
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
uh representative Bell
 
01:03:16.069 --> 01:03:16.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:03:17.390 --> 01:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
taking the question
 
01:03:19.309 --> 01:03:19.319 align:start position:0%
so do you think this should be on our
 
01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:21.180 align:start position:0%
show this Friday you don't have to
 
01:03:23.870 --> 01:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
answer that's a plug
 
01:03:25.549 --> 01:03:25.559 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:03:27.289 --> 01:03:27.299 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham did I put out
 
01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
your name right Burnham or Burnham
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
Burnham is fine thank you thank you uh
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you rep
 
01:03:37.789 --> 01:03:37.799 align:start position:0%
resent um as far as the
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
suggested new envelope would that just
 
01:03:42.890 --> 01:03:42.900 align:start position:0%
be us is there a standardized envelope
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
where there'll be a specialty envelope
 
01:03:47.510 --> 01:03:47.520 align:start position:0%
or just a regular Manila size
 
01:03:49.069 --> 01:03:49.079 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question that gets
 
01:03:50.690 --> 01:03:50.700 align:start position:0%
into the issue of our length of ballots
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
when you have 10 representatives in
 
01:03:54.530 --> 01:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
Derry plus all the other office offices
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
we have a rather large ballot that will
 
01:03:57.900 --> 01:03:59.030 align:start position:0%
we have a rather large ballot that will
require

01:03:59.030 --> 01:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
require
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
um that will require probably some work
 
01:04:02.510 --> 01:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
to figure out the correct way to get
 
01:04:04.490 --> 01:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
that done I do think that this is
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
important enough that we need to figure
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
out how to do that and how to move
 
01:04:11.270 --> 01:04:11.280 align:start position:0%
forward on this because confidence is
 
01:04:12.650 --> 01:04:12.660 align:start position:0%
key otherwise people become
 
01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:14.160 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised because they don't think
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
their vote counts
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
 
01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:19.430 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from the
committee

01:04:19.430 --> 01:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
um yes representative Brennan
 
01:04:24.230 --> 01:04:24.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
um in the spirit of ensuring that every
 
01:04:27.710 --> 01:04:27.720 align:start position:0%
vote is counted
 
01:04:30.170 --> 01:04:30.180 align:start position:0%
how do we address the additional
 
01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
shipping time for these larger envelopes
 
01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:39.720 align:start position:0%
that cost between 125 and 175 per ballot
 
01:04:41.390 --> 01:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
um thank you I actually found the
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
oversized postage for oversized letter
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
as a dollar three on the USPS site today
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
but yours probably works if you end up
 
01:04:50.329 --> 01:04:50.339 align:start position:0%
sticking a few more envelopes in there
 
01:04:52.490 --> 01:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
may be more shipping time but when you
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
request an absentee ballot you know that
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
there's going to be some time at the
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
post office I know in in towns that are
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
further away that may need to send into
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
a Central Station that's a lot further
 
01:05:05.390 --> 01:05:05.400 align:start position:0%
away than Dairy and Manchester the
 
01:05:07.549 --> 01:05:07.559 align:start position:0%
turnaround time may be slower but I
 
01:05:09.230 --> 01:05:09.240 align:start position:0%
think that that's a function that people
 
01:05:11.089 --> 01:05:11.099 align:start position:0%
in a town would understand how long mail
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
delivery takes this does not stop people
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
from taking their absentee ballot into
 
01:05:18.470 --> 01:05:18.480 align:start position:0%
town hall and delivering it just as they
 
01:05:20.150 --> 01:05:20.160 align:start position:0%
would that would save them that money it
 
01:05:21.530 --> 01:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
would give them that confidence that
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
it's actually in election officials
 
01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
hands and there's nothing to prohibit
 
01:05:28.069 --> 01:05:28.079 align:start position:0%
that and honestly if anybody's mailing
 
01:05:30.049 --> 01:05:30.059 align:start position:0%
even a standard size envelope or a large
 
01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:32.280 align:start position:0%
one with the way things are nowadays I
 
01:05:33.349 --> 01:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mail it in the last week
 
01:05:33.359 --> 01:05:35.150 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mail it in the last week
anyways

01:05:35.150 --> 01:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:05:37.609 --> 01:05:37.619 align:start position:0%
other questions from the committee
 
01:05:39.049 --> 01:05:39.059 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you representative
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
Leon thank you next up representative
 
01:05:54.650 --> 01:05:54.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:56.760 align:start position:0%
well I'm mostly here for the next one
 
01:05:56.760 --> 01:05:58.130 align:start position:0%
well I'm mostly here for the next one
but

01:05:58.130 --> 01:05:58.140 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:06:01.190 --> 01:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
um I I discovered some things while
 
01:06:03.710 --> 01:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
researching my testimony that relate to
 
01:06:06.230 --> 01:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
this bill so I'm reluctantly opposed to
 
01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:06.950 align:start position:0%
this bill so I'm reluctantly opposed to
it

01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:08.809 --> 01:06:08.819 align:start position:0%
yeah I definitely agree that what
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
happened in Windham was a fiasco
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
um but I
 
01:06:15.170 --> 01:06:15.180 align:start position:0%
I still think voting machines are
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
capable of reading folded ballots
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
um and the big problem with this is um
 
01:06:24.770 --> 01:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
we're talking about these postage for
 
01:06:28.849 --> 01:06:28.859 align:start position:0%
for envelopes so my um first class uh
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
envelopes actually the size limit for
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
standard size first class is 6 1 8
 
01:06:35.809 --> 01:06:35.819 align:start position:0%
inches by 11 and a half inches which is
 
01:06:39.230 --> 01:06:39.240 align:start position:0%
obviously much uh smaller than uh
 
01:06:41.750 --> 01:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
smaller than a than a ballot and that's
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
the type of mail which the forever
 
01:06:46.010 --> 01:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
stamps I think they're currently 63
 
01:06:47.809 --> 01:06:47.819 align:start position:0%
cents with 24 for each additional
 
01:06:49.490 --> 01:06:49.500 align:start position:0%
allowance um
 
01:06:49.500 --> 01:06:50.930 align:start position:0%
allowance um
if

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
so if you uh but these will probably but
 
01:06:54.950 --> 01:06:54.960 align:start position:0%
then there's also the large envelope
 
01:06:58.849 --> 01:06:58.859 align:start position:0%
rate which is uh only goes up to
 
01:07:02.569 --> 01:07:02.579 align:start position:0%
uh 15 inches by 11 and 5 8 inches of
 
01:07:04.970 --> 01:07:04.980 align:start position:0%
size 11 and 5 8 is enough to accommodate
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
the width of our ballots but I
 
01:07:09.890 --> 01:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
and I wish the and you might have to
 
01:07:11.089 --> 01:07:11.099 align:start position:0%
check for the Secretary of State's
 
01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
office who seemed not to be here but I
 
01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:14.700 align:start position:0%
think some ballots are currently more
 
01:07:17.150 --> 01:07:17.160 align:start position:0%
than 15 inches in size so you
 
01:07:18.589 --> 01:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
unless you want to put something in
 
01:07:20.510 --> 01:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
there limiting the size of pallets they
 
01:07:22.730 --> 01:07:22.740 align:start position:0%
need to get more multi-page ballots and
 
01:07:24.230 --> 01:07:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know it's a simple seemingly
 
01:07:26.150 --> 01:07:26.160 align:start position:0%
simple thing that
 
01:07:30.049 --> 01:07:30.059 align:start position:0%
um as cascading consequences so I I
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
would say the best solution the best
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
solution is uh best solution is just to
 
01:07:37.069 --> 01:07:37.079 align:start position:0%
continue folding the ballads probably
 
01:07:39.349 --> 01:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
maybe using a slightly larger what we
 
01:07:40.910 --> 01:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
call it digest size envelope that
 
01:07:43.010 --> 01:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
requires maybe only two folds instead of
 
01:07:45.049 --> 01:07:45.059 align:start position:0%
some people end up sending things in
 
01:07:46.370 --> 01:07:46.380 align:start position:0%
especially of a letter size return
 
01:07:49.490 --> 01:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
envelope but that's uh folded it four or
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
eights I've seen some very elaborately
 
01:07:53.270 --> 01:07:53.280 align:start position:0%
folded ballots what observing counts
 
01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:54.589 align:start position:0%
folded ballots what observing counts
some

01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:07:56.809 --> 01:07:56.819 align:start position:0%
and uh the other thing is of course to
 
01:07:59.870 --> 01:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
bear in mind is you have the affidavitum
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
you have like
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
you have to put the ballot inside when
 
01:08:05.270 --> 01:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
you return it there's at least two
 
01:08:06.890 --> 01:08:06.900 align:start position:0%
return ballots you have to you have like
 
01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
return ballots you have to you have like
that

01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
like I think it's called the affidavit
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
ballot that you sign and then you put
 
01:08:13.010 --> 01:08:13.020 align:start position:0%
that aside the actual mailing envelope
 
01:08:15.349 --> 01:08:15.359 align:start position:0%
and then occasionally people then stick
 
01:08:16.910 --> 01:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
the mailing envelope inside a second
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
melee envelope and if so if you're
 
01:08:21.950 --> 01:08:21.960 align:start position:0%
talking like a really big flat that's uh
 
01:08:23.930 --> 01:08:23.940 align:start position:0%
those are envelopes that people will
 
01:08:25.249 --> 01:08:25.259 align:start position:0%
have a hard time
 
01:08:27.590 --> 01:08:27.600 align:start position:0%
those are that are expensive to provide
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
and if uh it's also something that if
 
01:08:31.610 --> 01:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
they want to use a additional mailing
 
01:08:33.169 --> 01:08:33.179 align:start position:0%
envelope especially if they're overseas
 
01:08:34.610 --> 01:08:34.620 align:start position:0%
voters whatever that might not be
 
01:08:36.530 --> 01:08:36.540 align:start position:0%
something that they even find where they
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
are so I would
 
01:08:40.490 --> 01:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
I would reluctantly say that we we
 
01:08:41.689 --> 01:08:41.699 align:start position:0%
should keep this part of the election
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
law the way it is and just uh you know
 
01:08:46.430 --> 01:08:46.440 align:start position:0%
improve our voting uh our voting
 
01:08:47.630 --> 01:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
procedures because I don't think there's
 
01:08:49.130 --> 01:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
any way prevent at least some ballots
 
01:08:50.809 --> 01:08:50.819 align:start position:0%
from coming in with folds in them for
 
01:08:53.329 --> 01:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
one reason or another so
 
01:08:53.339 --> 01:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
one reason or another so
um

01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:56.390 --> 01:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
I agree that we agree there's a problem
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure this would create more
 
01:09:00.229 --> 01:09:00.239 align:start position:0%
solutions especially with balance that
 
01:09:01.490 --> 01:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
are bigger than that large envelope size
 
01:09:03.050 --> 01:09:03.060 align:start position:0%
then you get for priority mail which is
 
01:09:05.689 --> 01:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
really expensive that's like 9.95 a pop
 
01:09:07.490 --> 01:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
and that's uh
 
01:09:09.709 --> 01:09:09.719 align:start position:0%
that's an unreasonable burden to put on
 
01:09:11.930 --> 01:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
uh on the voters and
 
01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:13.859 align:start position:0%
also if the other
 
01:09:15.950 --> 01:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
also then if the state pays for return
 
01:09:17.930 --> 01:09:17.940 align:start position:0%
postage as in the next bill then that's
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
an unreasonable burden to put on the
 
01:09:22.309 --> 01:09:22.319 align:start position:0%
state so I I would in principles of
 
01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:24.420 align:start position:0%
principle it's a good idea but I don't
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
think it's going to work unless you
 
01:09:28.669 --> 01:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
restrict the size of the of the ballots
 
01:09:31.249 --> 01:09:31.259 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's my uh that's my
 
01:09:33.110 --> 01:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's my testimony so I'd be happy to
 
01:09:34.669 --> 01:09:34.679 align:start position:0%
take any questions should anyone have
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
one I not that I can necessarily answer
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
them but I'd be happy to take the
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
questions questions from the committee
 
01:09:43.550 --> 01:09:43.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none uh good thank you uh
 
01:09:44.749 --> 01:09:44.759 align:start position:0%
representative you'll be disappointed
 
01:09:46.249 --> 01:09:46.259 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office is here
 
01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
and they are up next oh oh no I'm not
 
01:09:51.110 --> 01:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
disappointed okay so if I'm if I'm wrong
 
01:09:53.090 --> 01:09:53.100 align:start position:0%
um I stand corrected if I'm right well
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:20.510 --> 01:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
all right we're back sorry about that
 
01:10:20.520 --> 01:10:22.810 align:start position:0%
all right we're back sorry about that
um

01:10:22.810 --> 01:10:22.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:26.149 --> 01:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
uh senior senior Deputy
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
um Hennessy correct or did I get your
 
01:10:29.630 --> 01:10:29.640 align:start position:0%
title just deputy just Deputy I
 
01:10:31.850 --> 01:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
apologize thank you Mr chair uh thank
 
01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:33.780 align:start position:0%
you members of the committee I am here
 
01:10:35.930 --> 01:10:35.940 align:start position:0%
to offer just some education some
 
01:10:38.689 --> 01:10:38.699 align:start position:0%
information on the envelopes and ballot
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:45.960 align:start position:0%
um the process for absentee envelopes is
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
that the secretary's estate's office for
 
01:10:50.810 --> 01:10:50.820 align:start position:0%
All State elections mails out to your
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
local city or town clerk uh three
 
01:10:55.610 --> 01:10:55.620 align:start position:0%
envelopes one would be the outside
 
01:11:00.410 --> 01:11:00.420 align:start position:0%
envelope that the clerk puts all of the
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
voter information into
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
um the other would be the return outside
 
01:11:07.790 --> 01:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
envelope which the voter would put their
 
01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
affidavits signed affidavit envelope
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
into which inside goes their absentee
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
ballot so you have a big envelope with a
 
01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:18.659 align:start position:0%
medium-sized envelope with a smaller
 
01:11:21.649 --> 01:11:21.659 align:start position:0%
envelope with a ballot ultimately is is
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
the way that would work
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
um I I did hear from the sponsor of the
 
01:11:29.510 --> 01:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill that she is planning on submitting
 
01:11:32.870 --> 01:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment to remove hand count Town
 
01:11:34.970 --> 01:11:34.980 align:start position:0%
ballots if you are from a handcount town
 
01:11:36.770 --> 01:11:36.780 align:start position:0%
you know that your ballot is always
 
01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:38.090 align:start position:0%
you know that your ballot is always
folded

01:11:38.090 --> 01:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
folded
 
01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
um some of this has to do with privacy
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
concerns so
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
um voters are required to hand their
 
01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
ballot to the moderator and the
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
moderator puts it into the box so voters
 
01:11:49.610 --> 01:11:49.620 align:start position:0%
like to make sure that nobody can see
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
their ballot and how they voted so
 
01:11:53.390 --> 01:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons why Hancock
 
01:11:56.990 --> 01:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
time ballots are folded but if the
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
amendment removes that then we don't
 
01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:01.739 align:start position:0%
need to talk about these anymore
 
01:12:05.270 --> 01:12:05.280 align:start position:0%
there are three other styles or sizes of
 
01:12:08.810 --> 01:12:08.820 align:start position:0%
ballots to consider and ideally all
 
01:12:10.970 --> 01:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
ballots would be just printed on one
 
01:12:14.870 --> 01:12:14.880 align:start position:0%
side of the ballot because again voters
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
like the option of turning their ballot
 
01:12:18.530 --> 01:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
over when it goes through a machine
 
01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
count so that the moderator or anyone
 
01:12:24.290 --> 01:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
else hanging out by the machine doesn't
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
see how they voted so in a smaller town
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
in a smaller election year you might
 
01:12:34.010 --> 01:12:34.020 align:start position:0%
just have an eight and a half by eleven
 
01:12:34.020 --> 01:12:36.050 align:start position:0%
just have an eight and a half by eleven
ballot

01:12:36.050 --> 01:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:12:38.149 --> 01:12:38.159 align:start position:0%
um in a bigger Town
 
01:12:40.729 --> 01:12:40.739 align:start position:0%
um that has a lot of State reps you
 
01:12:44.149 --> 01:12:44.159 align:start position:0%
would have an eight and a half by 14
 
01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.590 align:start position:0%
would have an eight and a half by 14
ballot

01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
and then in a bigger town with a lot of
 
01:12:50.990 --> 01:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
State reps and perhaps maybe a lot of
 
01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
other candidates on the ballot you would
 
01:12:56.209 --> 01:12:56.219 align:start position:0%
have an eight and a half by 18 ballot
 
01:12:56.219 --> 01:12:57.470 align:start position:0%
have an eight and a half by 18 ballot
so

01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:59.750 --> 01:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
um if you think about the process and
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
that this Bill calls for where a voter
 
01:13:05.390 --> 01:13:05.400 align:start position:0%
would or anyone wouldn't be able to vote
 
01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:07.560 align:start position:0%
about fold a ballot and it would require
 
01:13:10.370 --> 01:13:10.380 align:start position:0%
some sort of rigid envelope and I think
 
01:13:12.709 --> 01:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
the easiest way would be the affidavit
 
01:13:14.330 --> 01:13:14.340 align:start position:0%
envelope would have to be rigid since
 
01:13:16.669 --> 01:13:16.679 align:start position:0%
that would be the most inside envelope
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
to protect the ballot so if you have a
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
big ballot the Virgin envelope would
 
01:13:25.010 --> 01:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
have to go around this one here and then
 
01:13:27.290 --> 01:13:27.300 align:start position:0%
there would have to be a bigger envelope
 
01:13:29.709 --> 01:13:29.719 align:start position:0%
to be able to fit this envelope inside
 
01:13:32.149 --> 01:13:32.159 align:start position:0%
and then the third envelope would again
 
01:13:35.689 --> 01:13:35.699 align:start position:0%
have to be bigger to fit this ballot the
 
01:13:38.630 --> 01:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
other two envelopes inside of it
 
01:13:40.490 --> 01:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
um just because of time constraints we
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
weren't able to have a sit-down meeting
 
01:13:45.290 --> 01:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
with the post office to determine what
 
01:13:47.209 --> 01:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
that might look like what the envelope
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
options are with a different vendor too
 
01:13:51.490 --> 01:13:51.500 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
this if you if you again just visualize
 
01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
what a voter would get in their mailbox
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
this probably would not actually even
 
01:14:00.169 --> 01:14:00.179 align:start position:0%
fit in their mailbox if it was rigid and
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
not being able to bend
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
um even
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
an envelope like this which would have
 
01:14:08.930 --> 01:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
um an envelope that would fit this
 
01:14:10.669 --> 01:14:10.679 align:start position:0%
inside to not Bend and then two other
 
01:14:14.390 --> 01:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
bigger envelopes may not fit in a a
 
01:14:16.669 --> 01:14:16.679 align:start position:0%
voter's mailbox either
 
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
um so those are just some things to
 
01:14:21.770 --> 01:14:21.780 align:start position:0%
consider with trying not to fold the
 
01:14:21.780 --> 01:14:22.970 align:start position:0%
consider with trying not to fold the
ballot

01:14:22.970 --> 01:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:23.689 align:start position:0%
ballot
um

01:14:23.689 --> 01:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
I think that's what I have for you right
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
now so I'm happy to take any questions
 
01:14:28.370 --> 01:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
that you might have
 
01:14:30.050 --> 01:14:30.060 align:start position:0%
all right and I'm sorry did I introduce
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
myself Aaron Hennessey deputy secretary
 
01:14:33.830 --> 01:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
of state I attempted to introduce you
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I bundled it uh uh marvelously
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
representative boam
 
01:14:40.790 --> 01:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:14:43.370 --> 01:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
taking the question uh with the current
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
voting machines and the newer ones
 
01:14:49.610 --> 01:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
will it will it be capable of handling
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
ballots that are smaller
 
01:14:55.729 --> 01:14:55.739 align:start position:0%
then what the voters are using in other
 
01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
words smaller absentee ballots then
 
01:15:02.149 --> 01:15:02.159 align:start position:0%
then the regular ballot
 
01:15:04.669 --> 01:15:04.679 align:start position:0%
so are you saying that perhaps a smaller
 
01:15:06.050 --> 01:15:06.060 align:start position:0%
ballot than an eight and a half by
 
01:15:08.570 --> 01:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
eleven I think what you get down to at
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
that point would be that the voter
 
01:15:12.590 --> 01:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see the candidates
 
01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.790 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to see the candidates
names

01:15:13.790 --> 01:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
names
 
01:15:16.310 --> 01:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
or voters that
 
01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
like me have eye issues but I I can find
 
01:15:22.370 --> 01:15:22.380 align:start position:0%
out about the sizes that their their
 
01:15:27.130 --> 01:15:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.350 --> 01:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
mailing I mean once a month I get an
 
01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:33.060 align:start position:0%
envelope about this thick from the post
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
office for my County
 
01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:37.070 align:start position:0%
office for my County
um

01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
ballot uh at least once a month and it
 
01:15:42.530 --> 01:15:42.540 align:start position:0%
comes in a couple days so I don't think
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
the the late problem but I do see
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
do you I mean you already mentioned you
 
01:15:49.610 --> 01:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
haven't looked into
 
01:15:52.669 --> 01:15:52.679 align:start position:0%
what the maximum size envelopes the post
 
01:15:55.970 --> 01:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:58.370 --> 01:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
I'm sure that for any price you're able
 
01:16:02.450 --> 01:16:02.460 align:start position:0%
to send it but it being rigid
 
01:16:04.070 --> 01:16:04.080 align:start position:0%
um the post office does note on their
 
01:16:05.450 --> 01:16:05.460 align:start position:0%
website that you might have to pay
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
parcel package prices for that which if
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
you've tried to mail
 
01:16:12.890 --> 01:16:12.900 align:start position:0%
holiday packages recently you know that
 
01:16:15.350 --> 01:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
that's very expensive
 
01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:16.980 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
 
01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:18.229 align:start position:0%
further questions uh representative
Howard

01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
Howard
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and uh thank you for
 
01:16:22.070 --> 01:16:22.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so I'll I'll
 
01:16:24.290 --> 01:16:24.300 align:start position:0%
repeat uh what I asked uh the sponsor of
 
01:16:27.890 --> 01:16:27.900 align:start position:0%
the bill earlier uh and for the new
 
01:16:29.390 --> 01:16:29.400 align:start position:0%
voting machines that the Secretary of
 
01:16:32.030 --> 01:16:32.040 align:start position:0%
State's office is looking at uh have the
 
01:16:33.770 --> 01:16:33.780 align:start position:0%
capabilities and accuracies of the
 
01:16:35.810 --> 01:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
machines been tested on if they can
 
01:16:39.649 --> 01:16:39.659 align:start position:0%
count uh with potential folds on uh
 
01:16:43.370 --> 01:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
where the uh Circle uh to select who you
 
01:16:45.830 --> 01:16:45.840 align:start position:0%
want uh would be
 
01:16:47.930 --> 01:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so
 
01:16:50.689 --> 01:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
just for some background information the
 
01:16:52.910 --> 01:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
ballot law commission is the one that
 
01:16:57.530 --> 01:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.649 --> 01:16:59.659 align:start position:0%
excuse me and in the general election
 
01:17:02.090 --> 01:17:02.100 align:start position:0%
there were three towns that tried out a
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
new device from voting works
 
01:17:09.050 --> 01:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
and in our post audits of that general
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
election we didn't encounter any issues
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
where there was any
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um unintended marks counted by the
 
01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.010 align:start position:0%
um unintended marks counted by the
device

01:17:18.010 --> 01:17:18.020 align:start position:0%
device
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
there are three other devices that may
 
01:17:25.970 --> 01:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
be used in these in the local elections
 
01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:30.239 align:start position:0%
this winter in towns and cities those
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
are dominion esns and if a town decides
 
01:17:37.070 --> 01:17:37.080 align:start position:0%
to sponsor it clear ballot and after all
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
of those elections are done we will also
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
be doing audits of the voters intent and
 
01:17:43.970 --> 01:17:43.980 align:start position:0%
if the ballot and if the device read
 
01:17:46.610 --> 01:17:46.620 align:start position:0%
that ballot correctly so we haven't gone
 
01:17:48.970 --> 01:17:48.980 align:start position:0%
through the process of making sure that
 
01:17:51.649 --> 01:17:51.659 align:start position:0%
what happened in Windham when they
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
folded their ballots through the oval
 
01:17:56.209 --> 01:17:56.219 align:start position:0%
wouldn't happen again on the new more
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
sophisticated devices but our our hope
 
01:18:02.510 --> 01:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
further questions representative Brennan
 
01:18:07.790 --> 01:18:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question the the
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
current absentee ballots when they're
 
01:18:12.709 --> 01:18:12.719 align:start position:0%
mailed out are they able to is a voter
 
01:18:15.830 --> 01:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
able to Simply put that ballot in their
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
standard mailbox and have it picked up
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
by their regular mail carrier
 
01:18:25.490 --> 01:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
yes as long as they put postage on it
 
01:18:27.830 --> 01:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
are the questions representative weary
 
01:18:29.570 --> 01:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

01:18:31.430 --> 01:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
do we know the distribution or the
 
01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
breakdown between those ballots which
 
01:18:41.570 --> 01:18:41.580 align:start position:0%
are handed in for absentee purposes in
 
01:18:44.090 --> 01:18:44.100 align:start position:0%
the town halls versus what is actually
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
mailed I thank you for the question
 
01:18:48.050 --> 01:18:48.060 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't believe
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
there's any tracking mechanism for how
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
it was delivered
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
right now I don't believe any towns
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
track that
 
01:18:59.090 --> 01:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
and it's not I don't believe it's in our
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
and our system to do that
 
01:19:04.490 --> 01:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
a way to calculate that just so you know
 
01:19:06.950 --> 01:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
would be we passed a law last year for
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
um making Epstein data public and you'd
 
01:19:11.090 --> 01:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
look for people that requested and
 
01:19:13.310 --> 01:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
returned on the same day
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
because there's no way the post office
 
01:19:18.050 --> 01:19:18.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:21.050 --> 01:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:22.970 --> 01:19:22.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you deputy secretary
 
01:19:42.890 --> 01:19:42.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:57.350 --> 01:19:57.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:00.350 --> 01:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
ah thank you thanks for taking my
 
01:20:03.770 --> 01:20:03.780 align:start position:0%

the Kent Street Coalition
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
um but I'm speaking today on my own

um but I'm speaking today on my own
behalf

01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
behalf
 
01:20:18.470 --> 01:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
um and I am speaking in opposition to
 
01:20:20.630 --> 01:20:20.640 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:20:22.550 --> 01:20:22.560 align:start position:0%
um I want to just first address the
 
01:20:27.290 --> 01:20:27.300 align:start position:0%
issue of the folding of the ballots and
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
the issue that occurred in Windham that
 
01:20:35.870 --> 01:20:35.880 align:start position:0%
was a very unique circumstance in that a
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
machine was used to fold and crease the
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
ballots and what happened was that the
 
01:20:45.530 --> 01:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
process of using that very heavy
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
stamping machine to create the crease
 
01:20:52.430 --> 01:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
created a shadow line that unfortunately
 
01:20:55.970 --> 01:20:55.980 align:start position:0%
as we saw did lead to Phantom ballots
 
01:21:00.649 --> 01:21:00.659 align:start position:0%
and Phantom votes and also over votes so
 
01:21:05.090 --> 01:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
that was a function of a folding machine
 
01:21:07.030 --> 01:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
being used
 
01:21:11.570 --> 01:21:11.580 align:start position:0%
Windham this last election did a trial
 
01:21:14.689 --> 01:21:14.699 align:start position:0%
of hand folded ballots before the
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
election to see if any of those would
 
01:21:22.490 --> 01:21:22.500 align:start position:0%
just by doing a regular hand folding if
 
01:21:25.189 --> 01:21:25.199 align:start position:0%
we would see Phantom votes are over
 
01:21:25.199 --> 01:21:26.709 align:start position:0%
we would see Phantom votes are over
votes

01:21:26.709 --> 01:21:26.719 align:start position:0%
votes
 
01:21:29.630 --> 01:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
that did not occur none of the
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
hand-folded ballots regardless of where
 
01:21:35.169 --> 01:21:35.179 align:start position:0%
they where the fold landed
 
01:21:39.830 --> 01:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
made a impacted the the vote so I just
 
01:21:43.370 --> 01:21:43.380 align:start position:0%
think it's very important to be aware
 
01:21:46.610 --> 01:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
that that was a very unique situation in
 
01:21:49.550 --> 01:21:49.560 align:start position:0%
Windham and that it could be addressed
 
01:21:51.410 --> 01:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
by just not allowing these sorts of
 
01:21:53.689 --> 01:21:53.699 align:start position:0%
machines to be used in the future and
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
certainly windham's not using them
 
01:21:56.100 --> 01:21:57.709 align:start position:0%
certainly windham's not using them
so

01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:57.719 --> 01:21:58.630 align:start position:0%
so
um

01:21:58.630 --> 01:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
then there's the issue about the
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
envelopes themselves that would be used
 
01:22:06.950 --> 01:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're not just talking about being able
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
to go to Staples and buy envelopes to do
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
this these envelopes have to be of a
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
certain quality and they have to be
 
01:22:17.530 --> 01:22:17.540 align:start position:0%
pre-printed with specific information
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
so there's a real cost in in the
 
01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:26.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
I would point you to the committee the
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
the secretary of state had a special
 
01:22:36.410 --> 01:22:36.420 align:start position:0%
committee on covid voting that covered a
 
01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
lot of issues but I would say that 50
 
01:22:42.530 --> 01:22:42.540 align:start position:0%
percent of the maybe eight meetings that
 
01:22:44.649 --> 01:22:44.659 align:start position:0%
they had to talk about how to address
 
01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
elections through covid had to do
 
01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:50.699 align:start position:0%
specifically with the absentee ballots
 
01:22:52.250 --> 01:22:52.260 align:start position:0%
knowing there would be any increased use
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
of them they found that the cost was
 
01:22:59.270 --> 01:22:59.280 align:start position:0%
prohibitive to using this sort of
 
01:23:02.530 --> 01:23:02.540 align:start position:0%
um to doing flat ballots
 
01:23:04.630 --> 01:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:23:07.070 --> 01:23:07.080 align:start position:0%
there's lots of research there I can
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
pull it up for you if anyone's
 
01:23:11.750 --> 01:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
interested it's all on the record hours
 
01:23:14.330 --> 01:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
and hours and hours of time were spent I
 
01:23:17.630 --> 01:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
sat through through all of it and even
 
01:23:19.850 --> 01:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
though I originally thought this might
 
01:23:22.490 --> 01:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
be a way to go it it just seemed like a
 
01:23:26.330 --> 01:23:26.340 align:start position:0%
real obstacle so next you know the we do
 
01:23:28.189 --> 01:23:28.199 align:start position:0%
have the issue of the slower mail that
 
01:23:30.490 --> 01:23:30.500 align:start position:0%
we're facing all around
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
but this would add another
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
slow down to the process as I think you
 
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:38.350 align:start position:0%
slow down to the process as I think you
mentioned

01:23:38.350 --> 01:23:38.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned
 
01:23:41.450 --> 01:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
and that's both we have to remember on
 
01:23:44.570 --> 01:23:44.580 align:start position:0%
the sending end from the town to the
 
01:23:47.950 --> 01:23:47.960 align:start position:0%
voter and then on the voter end
 
01:23:50.689 --> 01:23:50.699 align:start position:0%
this also is an issue when you come to
 
01:23:53.990 --> 01:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
yukava voters who are overseas and these
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
ballots have to be sent overseas again a
 
01:24:00.050 --> 01:24:00.060 align:start position:0%
really increased cost particularly when
 
01:24:03.130 --> 01:24:03.140 align:start position:0%
you're looking at larger envelopes
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
and heavier weights perhaps so you know
 
01:24:10.430 --> 01:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
for the state even if they're not
 
01:24:12.229 --> 01:24:12.239 align:start position:0%
picking up the cost of the postage
 
01:24:14.930 --> 01:24:14.940 align:start position:0%
there's still a substantial increase of
 
01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:15.890 align:start position:0%
there's still a substantial increase of
cost

01:24:15.890 --> 01:24:15.900 align:start position:0%
cost
 
01:24:18.649 --> 01:24:18.659 align:start position:0%
and then let's look at the voter this
 
01:24:22.250 --> 01:24:22.260 align:start position:0%
this presents real costs to them and a
 
01:24:25.490 --> 01:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
burden on their voting access partly
 
01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:28.860 align:start position:0%
it's the delay time that it would now
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
take extra days to
 
01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:33.350 align:start position:0%
take extra days to
um

01:24:33.350 --> 01:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:35.450 --> 01:24:35.460 align:start position:0%
to make sure that their vote could be
 
01:24:38.090 --> 01:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
processed and let's remember that the
 
01:24:40.490 --> 01:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
majority of people who do absentee
 
01:24:43.250 --> 01:24:43.260 align:start position:0%
ballots do them because they're not able
 
01:24:46.070 --> 01:24:46.080 align:start position:0%
to get down to the town halls to deliver
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
their ballots they're out of town
 
01:24:50.530 --> 01:24:50.540 align:start position:0%
they're out of state they're disabled
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
so you know it's not an option of I
 
01:24:56.689 --> 01:24:56.699 align:start position:0%
don't want to pay that postage so I'm
 
01:24:59.270 --> 01:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
going to go down to the town hall or I
 
01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:01.140 align:start position:0%
don't I'm worried about the time and
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
will my ballot be counted so I'm going
 
01:25:05.810 --> 01:25:05.820 align:start position:0%
to go down to town hall these absentee
 
01:25:07.669 --> 01:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
ballot Provisions in our constitution
 
01:25:09.830 --> 01:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
exist primarily to accommodate the
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
people who are really not able to to be
 
01:25:17.350 --> 01:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
there and get their ballots in like that
 
01:25:20.630 --> 01:25:20.640 align:start position:0%
so and then the cost is real for people
 
01:25:24.110 --> 01:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
I mean we hear a lot of talk about you
 
01:25:27.649 --> 01:25:27.659 align:start position:0%
know the cost of
 
01:25:31.390 --> 01:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
living has gone way up and
 
01:25:34.430 --> 01:25:34.440 align:start position:0%
those extra 50 cents in fact can make a
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
difference particularly if you have
 
01:25:38.570 --> 01:25:38.580 align:start position:0%
multiple members in your family who are
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
voting absentee so I think it's it's not
 
01:25:45.350 --> 01:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't behoove us to
 
01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:46.250 align:start position:0%
it doesn't behoove us to
um

01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:49.430 --> 01:25:49.440 align:start position:0%
to downgrade that concern and then it's
 
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
not clear to me from the way the bill is
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
written whether the voter themselves
 
01:25:56.990 --> 01:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
would in fact be subject to a penalty if
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
they did think oh I'm going to say
 
01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
Postage and I'm going to get a regular
 
01:26:04.669 --> 01:26:04.679 align:start position:0%
envelope and fold it and send it in that
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
of course would be very disconcerting if
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
that was the case
 
01:26:10.320 --> 01:26:11.350 align:start position:0%
that was the case
um

01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I just double checking the other
 
01:26:16.970 --> 01:26:16.980 align:start position:0%
issue around yuakava quite frankly is
 
01:26:20.689 --> 01:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
with uh SB 418 which already has
 
01:26:20.699 --> 01:26:22.310 align:start position:0%
with uh SB 418 which already has
presented

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
presented
 
01:26:25.250 --> 01:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
um timeline burdens around primary
 
01:26:28.729 --> 01:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
elections for whether the state is going
 
01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:31.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to get ballots to our
 
01:26:34.250 --> 01:26:34.260 align:start position:0%
overseas military and other overseas
 
01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.350 align:start position:0%
overseas military and other overseas
voters

01:26:35.350 --> 01:26:35.360 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
in time to meet the requirements of
 
01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:41.880 align:start position:0%
uacava if we are now adding extra days
 
01:26:44.030 --> 01:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
because we have a flat rate envelope
 
01:26:46.370 --> 01:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
that needs to go out and that slows the
 
01:26:48.590 --> 01:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
process we're running into additional
 
01:26:52.070 --> 01:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
problems with SB 418 so with that I will
 
01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:55.620 align:start position:0%
conclude my um my testimony I'm happy to
 
01:26:57.229 --> 01:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:25.850 --> 01:27:25.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:27.590 --> 01:27:27.600 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Ken eyring I'm from
 
01:27:29.639 --> 01:27:31.250 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Ken eyring I'm from
Windham

01:27:31.250 --> 01:27:31.260 align:start position:0%
Windham
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate the time to speak on
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
this bill I'm in favor of this bill I
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
lived through the nightmare of the
 
01:27:42.770 --> 01:27:42.780 align:start position:0%
election the general election in 2020. I
 
01:27:44.689 --> 01:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
believe that this should be a bipartisan
 
01:27:44.699 --> 01:27:46.430 align:start position:0%
believe that this should be a bipartisan
bill

01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:27:49.490 --> 01:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
um I work very closely with former
 
01:27:51.890 --> 01:27:51.900 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State Bill Gardner and
 
01:27:56.090 --> 01:27:56.100 align:start position:0%
Senator Bob Guida to get the forensic
 
01:27:59.090 --> 01:27:59.100 align:start position:0%
audit that would analyze what took place
 
01:28:01.250 --> 01:28:01.260 align:start position:0%
in Windham that was the
 
01:28:04.430 --> 01:28:04.440 align:start position:0%
largest numerical discrepancy in the
 
01:28:05.930 --> 01:28:05.940 align:start position:0%
history of the state between election
 
01:28:08.930 --> 01:28:08.940 align:start position:0%
day results and the Hand recount
 
01:28:08.940 --> 01:28:10.310 align:start position:0%
day results and the Hand recount
and

01:28:10.310 --> 01:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
the forensic audit which was led by
 
01:28:14.810 --> 01:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
Harry hirsty who has been a consultant
 
01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:16.380 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire
 
01:28:19.850 --> 01:28:19.860 align:start position:0%
in the past he confirmed in that audit
 
01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:23.460 align:start position:0%
that folds going through ovals can be
 
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
misread and are misread by the machines
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
and it was a rate from anywhere from 35
 
01:28:34.010 --> 01:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
percent and upwards to almost double
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
so you've heard testimony that folded
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
ballots going through machines that can
 
01:28:40.370 --> 01:28:40.380 align:start position:0%
be read
 
01:28:40.380 --> 01:28:42.350 align:start position:0%
be read
accurately

01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
accurately
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
but a folded ballot and a folded but
 
01:28:46.610 --> 01:28:46.620 align:start position:0%
then a fold going through an oval
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
through a ballot or two different things
 
01:28:52.370 --> 01:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
and we have human error that can be
 
01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:55.440 align:start position:0%
introduced and it is introduced in every
 
01:28:55.440 --> 01:28:58.189 align:start position:0%
introduced and it is introduced in every
election

01:28:58.189 --> 01:28:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:04.129 --> 01:29:04.139 align:start position:0%
in Windham in the November 2020 election
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
between the election day results and the
 
01:29:12.790 --> 01:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
1163 votes were shifted they were
 
01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.270 align:start position:0%
1163 votes were shifted they were
adjusted

01:29:17.270 --> 01:29:17.280 align:start position:0%
adjusted
 
01:29:20.050 --> 01:29:20.060 align:start position:0%
too accurate to more accurately reflect
 
01:29:23.530 --> 01:29:23.540 align:start position:0%
what the voter's intent were
 
01:29:27.129 --> 01:29:27.139 align:start position:0%
1163 votes is a lot of votes that were
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
inaccurately counted by the machines on
 
01:29:32.870 --> 01:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:29:34.790 --> 01:29:34.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:29:37.010 --> 01:29:37.020 align:start position:0%
I believe that if ballots are continued
 
01:29:38.990 --> 01:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be folded
 
01:29:41.689 --> 01:29:41.699 align:start position:0%
then it should be mandatory that they'd
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
be hand counted
 
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
so last year HB 1163
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
addressed part of the issue of the
 
01:29:52.250 --> 01:29:52.260 align:start position:0%
Windham incident
 
01:29:54.950 --> 01:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the general election in 2020.
 
01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:56.510 align:start position:0%
the general election in 2020.
by

01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
having the machine set to reject over
 
01:30:01.070 --> 01:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
voted ballots
 
01:30:03.770 --> 01:30:03.780 align:start position:0%
so what was happening is that in races
 
01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:07.260 align:start position:0%
where there were all of the votes for
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
any given race
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
were filled in for any given for all the
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
candidates if an oval went through one
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
of the candidates
 
01:30:20.030 --> 01:30:20.040 align:start position:0%
ovals that were not voted for
 
01:30:22.850 --> 01:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
and it was read as a as a phantom vote
 
01:30:26.030 --> 01:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
then it triggered an overvote and if you
 
01:30:28.629 --> 01:30:28.639 align:start position:0%
look at the testimony that Tom Murray
 
01:30:32.229 --> 01:30:32.239 align:start position:0%
presented that the sponsor
 
01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
said that she distributed to each of you
 
01:30:36.830 --> 01:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
I think you'll see that there were
 
01:30:39.850 --> 01:30:39.860 align:start position:0%
enormous issues with
 
01:30:42.350 --> 01:30:42.360 align:start position:0%
overvotes being counted
 
01:30:44.990 --> 01:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
in towns that use machines all across
 
01:30:46.910 --> 01:30:46.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:30:46.920 --> 01:30:48.550 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
um

01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
but 1163 does not address the fact that
 
01:30:54.890 --> 01:30:54.900 align:start position:0%
there are still
 
01:30:57.350 --> 01:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
Phantom votes that can be counted and in
 
01:31:00.110 --> 01:31:00.120 align:start position:0%
the November 2020 general election in
 
01:31:04.090 --> 01:31:04.100 align:start position:0%
Windham one of the Democrats candidates
 
01:31:07.490 --> 01:31:07.500 align:start position:0%
received 99 extra votes that were
 
01:31:11.510 --> 01:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
removed from her vote totals during the
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
recount and also confirmed during the
 
01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
forensic audit
 
01:31:20.450 --> 01:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
so this bill would address that part of
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:31:25.790 --> 01:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
and lead to more accurate results
 
01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:28.380 align:start position:0%
uh the ballot there was a question
 
01:31:31.850 --> 01:31:31.860 align:start position:0%
raised about uh testing on the new
 
01:31:34.370 --> 01:31:34.380 align:start position:0%
machines that are being looked at I sat
 
01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
in uh on
 
01:31:38.330 --> 01:31:38.340 align:start position:0%
a ballot law
 
01:31:41.270 --> 01:31:41.280 align:start position:0%
Commission test of two machines
 
01:31:43.370 --> 01:31:43.380 align:start position:0%
and they
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
did not put any folded ballots through
 
01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
the Dominion machine that they tested
 
01:31:47.699 --> 01:31:49.070 align:start position:0%
the Dominion machine that they tested
zero

01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
zero
 
01:31:51.649 --> 01:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
that to me is disturbing knowing the
 
01:31:54.290 --> 01:31:54.300 align:start position:0%
fact of the issues that we've had with
 
01:31:55.729 --> 01:31:55.739 align:start position:0%
folded ballots
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
they put two folded ballots through the
 
01:32:00.169 --> 01:32:00.179 align:start position:0%
voting Works machines
 
01:32:03.890 --> 01:32:03.900 align:start position:0%
and again that's not enough
 
01:32:07.790 --> 01:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
to make a statement that we have
 
01:32:12.709 --> 01:32:12.719 align:start position:0%
accurate ability to read folded ballots
 
01:32:17.050 --> 01:32:17.060 align:start position:0%
through ovals through any new machines
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
you heard testimony that Wyndham did a
 
01:32:21.470 --> 01:32:21.480 align:start position:0%
test and that there were no problems
 
01:32:24.169 --> 01:32:24.179 align:start position:0%
with the folds going through
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
with with folded ballots but again
 
01:32:30.410 --> 01:32:30.420 align:start position:0%
you need to test with folds going
 
01:32:31.970 --> 01:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
through the ovals
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
and since Windom is been brought up I
 
01:32:37.689 --> 01:32:37.699 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:32:40.129 --> 01:32:40.139 align:start position:0%
emphasize the fact that there is always
 
01:32:41.689 --> 01:32:41.699 align:start position:0%
a human error
 
01:32:45.590 --> 01:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
and you would think that the town that
 
01:32:47.930 --> 01:32:47.940 align:start position:0%
brought such
 
01:32:51.350 --> 01:32:51.360 align:start position:0%
attention to this issue regarding the
 
01:32:55.010 --> 01:32:55.020 align:start position:0%
November 2020 general election would be
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
extremely careful
 
01:32:59.090 --> 01:32:59.100 align:start position:0%
with how they process their folded
 
01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:05.930 --> 01:33:05.940 align:start position:0%
they still folded ballots through the
 
01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.370 align:start position:0%
they still folded ballots through the
ovals

01:33:07.370 --> 01:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
ovals
 
01:33:10.610 --> 01:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
for the September 13th primary and I
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
find that to be very disturbing
 
01:33:14.930 --> 01:33:14.940 align:start position:0%
and I have you know I didn't think of it
 
01:33:17.149 --> 01:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
I should have brought a sample of that I
 
01:33:19.490 --> 01:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
filed a complaint with 33 issues
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
regarding Wyndham's elections for the
 
01:33:23.750 --> 01:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
September primary I'm going to file
 
01:33:25.189 --> 01:33:25.199 align:start position:0%
another complaint
 
01:33:27.890 --> 01:33:27.900 align:start position:0%
for the general election
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
forward a link to all of you in this
 
01:33:34.370 --> 01:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
committee so that you can read that
 
01:33:38.090 --> 01:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
complaint and one of the links in that
 
01:33:40.970 --> 01:33:40.980 align:start position:0%
complaint shows the folded
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh ballot that goes through two ovals
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
which again is very disturbing
 
01:33:50.570 --> 01:33:50.580 align:start position:0%
Dairy hand counts all of the
 
01:33:52.729 --> 01:33:52.739 align:start position:0%
all of the folded ballots I think that
 
01:33:55.790 --> 01:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
is an exemplary example
 
01:33:55.800 --> 01:33:56.570 align:start position:0%
is an exemplary example
um

01:33:56.570 --> 01:33:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:00.169 --> 01:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
if you pass this bill there will be a
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
tremendous savings for towns that do
 
01:34:04.970 --> 01:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
that but what Dairy does is it ensures
 
01:34:06.649 --> 01:34:06.659 align:start position:0%
the accuracy of the vote and isn't that
 
01:34:08.390 --> 01:34:08.400 align:start position:0%
what we all want we all want to make
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure that every valid vote cast is
 
01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:12.950 align:start position:0%
sure that every valid vote cast is
counted

01:34:12.950 --> 01:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
counted
 
01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:16.310 align:start position:0%
counted
accurately

01:34:16.310 --> 01:34:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:16.320 --> 01:34:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:34:20.870 --> 01:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.970 --> 01:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
you know from my position every Phantom
 
01:34:24.669 --> 01:34:24.679 align:start position:0%
vote that's counted
 
01:34:27.530 --> 01:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises an actual vote
 
01:34:27.540 --> 01:34:28.850 align:start position:0%
disenfranchises an actual vote
and

01:34:28.850 --> 01:34:28.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh you know there was concerns about the
 
01:34:33.590 --> 01:34:33.600 align:start position:0%
size of the envelopes we all get mail
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
all of us get mail that's larger than an
 
01:34:39.169 --> 01:34:39.179 align:start position:0%
eight and a half by eleven
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
piece of paper
 
01:34:43.910 --> 01:34:43.920 align:start position:0%
the post the postman folds it around our
 
01:34:45.830 --> 01:34:45.840 align:start position:0%
other envelopes and puts it in our
 
01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.629 align:start position:0%
other envelopes and puts it in our
mailbox

01:34:47.629 --> 01:34:47.639 align:start position:0%
mailbox
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
there's no Bend in here that's going to
 
01:34:51.709 --> 01:34:51.719 align:start position:0%
mess up how our machine rate reads the
 
01:34:51.719 --> 01:34:52.610 align:start position:0%
mess up how our machine rate reads the
vote

01:34:52.610 --> 01:34:52.620 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:34:54.830 --> 01:34:54.840 align:start position:0%
if that's if that's how it was delivered
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
but if that's a concern and it causes
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
you not to support this bill then again
 
01:35:02.570 --> 01:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that somebody write an
 
01:35:05.090 --> 01:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
amendment that says that all bolded
 
01:35:07.790 --> 01:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
ballots should be hand counted or must
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
be hand counted you know the the cost
 
01:35:12.719 --> 01:35:14.030 align:start position:0%
be hand counted you know the the cost
of

01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
the extra envelopes I realize that's a
 
01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:17.689 align:start position:0%
the extra envelopes I realize that's a
consideration

01:35:17.689 --> 01:35:17.699 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
but in the end that's the foundation of
 
01:35:23.209 --> 01:35:23.219 align:start position:0%
our government we want to make sure that
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
however the votes are cast that they're
 
01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
accurately counted and
 
01:35:33.310 --> 01:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
the as you heard testimony from
 
01:35:36.169 --> 01:35:36.179 align:start position:0%
representative Lyon uh isn't it there's
 
01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
an enormous cost to Dairy right now and
 
01:35:40.970 --> 01:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
other towns who hand count
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
folded ballots so that would be offset
 
01:35:46.209 --> 01:35:46.219 align:start position:0%
and it would be a tremendous
 
01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:48.960 align:start position:0%
reduction in the burden of those towns
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
because they stay until all the wee
 
01:35:52.790 --> 01:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
hours in the morning counting the
 
01:35:55.250 --> 01:35:55.260 align:start position:0%
ballots to make sure that the votes are
 
01:35:58.610 --> 01:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
accurately counted and I know from
 
01:36:00.350 --> 01:36:00.360 align:start position:0%
testifying on other bills there are
 
01:36:01.629 --> 01:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
concerns about
 
01:36:04.790 --> 01:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
extending you know putting requirements
 
01:36:06.530 --> 01:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
on Election workers that extend their
 
01:36:08.090 --> 01:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
hours into the wee hours in the morning
 
01:36:10.129 --> 01:36:10.139 align:start position:0%
because the longer that they stay there
 
01:36:11.810 --> 01:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
you know the more that there might be a
 
01:36:13.490 --> 01:36:13.500 align:start position:0%
possibility that errors are made because
 
01:36:16.129 --> 01:36:16.139 align:start position:0%
again human error people get tired
 
01:36:18.850 --> 01:36:18.860 align:start position:0%
so you know in conclusion I I
 
01:36:20.990 --> 01:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
respectfully ask that you support this
 
01:36:22.490 --> 01:36:22.500 align:start position:0%
bill because I've lived through the
 
01:36:25.850 --> 01:36:25.860 align:start position:0%
Nightmare and and in addition to that
 
01:36:28.250 --> 01:36:28.260 align:start position:0%
the same error was made on subsequent
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
elections so I appreciate your time
 
01:36:34.669 --> 01:36:34.679 align:start position:0%
foreign thank you are there questions
 
01:36:36.590 --> 01:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
from the committee
 
01:36:39.050 --> 01:36:39.060 align:start position:0%
representative Burnham
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr erling
 
01:36:44.990 --> 01:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
has there been any consideration I know
 
01:36:48.229 --> 01:36:48.239 align:start position:0%
we've talked about envelopes folding has
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
there been any consideration on mailing
 
01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
tubes it seems like the standard of
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
um the ballots in width is eight and a
 
01:36:58.370 --> 01:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
half inches so that would give a
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
reusable mailing tube an option to not
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
only not have a fold in it but you to be
 
01:37:08.570 --> 01:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
reused as the voter sends back their
 
01:37:12.050 --> 01:37:12.060 align:start position:0%
ballot I I had never thought of that but
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
I actually think that's a clever
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
um and a very insightful suggestion I
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
don't know what the cost would be but
 
01:37:22.610 --> 01:37:22.620 align:start position:0%
the cost would be more upfront obviously
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
and then as you suggested you could
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
recycle the tubes because to be returned
 
01:37:30.110 --> 01:37:30.120 align:start position:0%
back to the town I think that's a good
 
01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
idea something to look into but but it
 
01:37:35.090 --> 01:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
would help Implement something like this
 
01:37:37.430 --> 01:37:37.440 align:start position:0%
and address some of the concerns
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you for your
 
01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:46.010 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thank you for your
time

01:37:46.010 --> 01:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:37:48.530 --> 01:37:48.540 align:start position:0%
representative wood can you send up the
 
01:39:00.649 --> 01:39:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:00.659 --> 01:39:06.350 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:39:06.350 --> 01:39:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:09.229 --> 01:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
one person signed in for and against not
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
sure what that means and then two in
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill and that closes the
 
01:39:21.890 --> 01:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
she might be the one that has I don't
 
01:39:25.729 --> 01:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
have a card
 
01:39:27.649 --> 01:39:27.659 align:start position:0%
that one with no name I have a car I
 
01:39:29.629 --> 01:39:29.639 align:start position:0%
have a blank card
 
01:39:29.639 --> 01:39:42.370 align:start position:0%
have a blank card
foreign

01:39:42.370 --> 01:39:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:44.990 --> 01:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
I have a card that says simply watch
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions one minute there's no name or
 
01:39:58.129 --> 01:39:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:03.770 --> 01:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay and it's unusual but we will reopen
 
01:40:05.510 --> 01:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
the public hearings on our house bill
 
01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.689 align:start position:0%
the public hearings on our house bill
453.

01:40:07.689 --> 01:40:07.699 align:start position:0%
453.
 
01:40:10.729 --> 01:40:10.739 align:start position:0%
I'll be quick Joan dargie
 
01:40:12.770 --> 01:40:12.780 align:start position:0%
um town clerk Milford also the
 
01:40:15.050 --> 01:40:15.060 align:start position:0%
legislative chair for um co-chair for
 
01:40:16.729 --> 01:40:16.739 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City and town clerks
 
01:40:16.739 --> 01:40:18.110 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire City and town clerks
Association

01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
Association
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
um one of the things I'm just going to
 
01:40:20.689 --> 01:40:20.699 align:start position:0%
bring up what hasn't been addressed and
 
01:40:23.810 --> 01:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
that is the cost to the towns because
 
01:40:25.310 --> 01:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
the town has to create their own
 
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelope
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
if you picture that the quantity of
 
01:40:32.270 --> 01:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
affidavit envelopes that changes every
 
01:40:35.390 --> 01:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
time the affidavit envelope changes
 
01:40:38.149 --> 01:40:38.159 align:start position:0%
um that we wouldn't have the the volume
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
that would for that size envelope it'll
 
01:40:44.270 --> 01:40:44.280 align:start position:0%
cut it'd be cost prohibited basically to
 
01:40:46.729 --> 01:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
come up with an eight and a half by 14
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
and and the other thing we have to
 
01:40:50.930 --> 01:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
figure is like in Milford our ballots
 
01:40:52.729 --> 01:40:52.739 align:start position:0%
are 10 to 12 pages long
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
so for a town election which I'm
 
01:40:57.290 --> 01:40:57.300 align:start position:0%
assuming this would apply to the town
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
election as well it's not going to apply
 
01:41:01.310 --> 01:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
to it
 
01:41:04.250 --> 01:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
okay so it should apply to I mean I'm
 
01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
assuming it applies to the town election
 
01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't be able to fold the town
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
ballots the reason that I did a the the
 
01:41:13.669 --> 01:41:13.679 align:start position:0%
city and town clerks Association was
 
01:41:13.679 --> 01:41:14.629 align:start position:0%
city and town clerks Association was
split

01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
split
 
01:41:18.050 --> 01:41:18.060 align:start position:0%
so we have towns like Derry that want to
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
hand count the absentees but then we
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
have other towns that have four to ten
 
01:41:24.770 --> 01:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
thousand absentee ballots there's no way
 
01:41:26.629 --> 01:41:26.639 align:start position:0%
they're going to hand count them
 
01:41:29.270 --> 01:41:29.280 align:start position:0%
um the what we did have I'll just bring
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
up what we had as for a suggested
 
01:41:35.149 --> 01:41:35.159 align:start position:0%
Amendment and that is a one-fold
 
01:41:38.090 --> 01:41:38.100 align:start position:0%
just folding in half that may make the
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
envelopes more
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
amenable to producing and in the postage
 
01:41:48.109 --> 01:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be so cost prohibitive
 
01:41:49.729 --> 01:41:49.739 align:start position:0%
um and then the other amendment was to
 
01:41:52.370 --> 01:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
exclude the towns from this requirement
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have so sorry about not
 
01:41:56.570 --> 01:41:56.580 align:start position:0%
filling out the card properly
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's okay and we will need one though
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
when you go back
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me we will need you to fill one
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
out though we'll do thank you thank you
 
01:42:15.430 --> 01:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.870 --> 01:42:19.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.189 --> 01:42:22.199 align:start position:0%
uh no I don't think we're gonna do that
 
01:42:24.910 --> 01:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
because we're significantly over time
 
01:42:27.830 --> 01:42:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm probably gonna get chewed out by
 
01:42:29.570 --> 01:42:29.580 align:start position:0%
the clerk for opening and closing a
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
and the public hearing on House Bill 453
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:01.790 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:05.450 --> 01:44:05.460 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 508 is open
 
01:44:19.010 --> 01:44:19.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.930 --> 01:44:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm Jonah wheeler I'm represent
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
Peterborough and Sharon Hillsboro
 
01:44:25.010 --> 01:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
District 33.
 
01:44:26.330 --> 01:44:26.340 align:start position:0%
um like I said I'll be as quick as I can
 
01:44:28.189 --> 01:44:28.199 align:start position:0%
I think I will be this is a pretty
 
01:44:30.290 --> 01:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
simple piece of legislation even though
 
01:44:32.450 --> 01:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
I am a freshman with a fiscal Note
 
01:44:34.310 --> 01:44:34.320 align:start position:0%
coming before you I think it is fairly
 
01:44:36.229 --> 01:44:36.239 align:start position:0%
simple and straightforward
 
01:44:38.570 --> 01:44:38.580 align:start position:0%
we've had poll taxes in this country for
 
01:44:40.729 --> 01:44:40.739 align:start position:0%
a long time and states have employed
 
01:44:42.470 --> 01:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
poll taxes other countries have employed
 
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
poll taxes and I think the evidence is
 
01:44:46.970 --> 01:44:46.980 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that those poll taxes
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
hinder people's ability to get out there
 
01:44:53.330 --> 01:44:53.340 align:start position:0%
and vote not uh everyone people who can
 
01:44:56.090 --> 01:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
afford them are able to vote but those
 
01:45:00.649 --> 01:45:00.659 align:start position:0%
who are not cannot access their rights
 
01:45:03.830 --> 01:45:03.840 align:start position:0%
as a citizen to vote and participate in
 
01:45:06.709 --> 01:45:06.719 align:start position:0%
their governmental process the 24th
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment ratified in 1964
 
01:45:14.330 --> 01:45:14.340 align:start position:0%
made it illegal for poll taxes to exist
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
in federal elections but as we all
 
01:45:20.390 --> 01:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
probably know the state still has the
 
01:45:22.790 --> 01:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
ability to impose a poll tax if it if
 
01:45:24.890 --> 01:45:24.900 align:start position:0%
it's so wanted to so I'm bringing this
 
01:45:28.250 --> 01:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
legislation forward to try and uh Nix
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
that before before it happens
 
01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:31.669 align:start position:0%
that before before it happens
um

01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:33.709 --> 01:45:33.719 align:start position:0%
like Louise Spencer said for the last
 
01:45:35.629 --> 01:45:35.639 align:start position:0%
piece of legislation the cost of living
 
01:45:39.050 --> 01:45:39.060 align:start position:0%
has increased uh significantly we all I
 
01:45:40.510 --> 01:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
think feel that in one way or another
 
01:45:43.790 --> 01:45:43.800 align:start position:0%
and while the
 
01:45:46.250 --> 01:45:46.260 align:start position:0%
price of a stamp might not seem like a
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
lot 40 cents to a dollar to to many of
 
01:45:51.470 --> 01:45:51.480 align:start position:0%
us that can be a lot for some people it
 
01:45:53.750 --> 01:45:53.760 align:start position:0%
can be a burden nonetheless it's a
 
01:45:55.669 --> 01:45:55.679 align:start position:0%
financial burden to voting no matter how
 
01:45:57.830 --> 01:45:57.840 align:start position:0%
much it is and with the cost of living
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
and with people who generally vote again
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
like Louise said in her in her testimony
 
01:46:05.330 --> 01:46:05.340 align:start position:0%
people who are using absentee ballots
 
01:46:07.490 --> 01:46:07.500 align:start position:0%
are people who have disabilities or
 
01:46:10.370 --> 01:46:10.380 align:start position:0%
health concerns and have a hard time
 
01:46:12.470 --> 01:46:12.480 align:start position:0%
getting to the town clerk's office to
 
01:46:14.450 --> 01:46:14.460 align:start position:0%
access their absentee ballot in the
 
01:46:17.450 --> 01:46:17.460 align:start position:0%
first place so why would we add another
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
barrier to make it so that they have to
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
to grab a stamp I think this is a
 
01:46:24.890 --> 01:46:24.900 align:start position:0%
worthwhile expenditure for the state and
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
voting for your voting should be your
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
right as a citizen uh not a privilege to
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
those who can afford it so with that
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll take any questions that the
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
committee has and I thank the chairman
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
for for allowing me to speak thank you
 
01:46:39.060 --> 01:46:42.410 align:start position:0%
for for allowing me to speak thank you
questions

01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
I guess you've supplied everything they
 
01:46:57.169 --> 01:46:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.169 --> 01:47:03.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:04.729 --> 01:47:04.739 align:start position:0%
well I
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
he set me up it was my fault
 
01:47:06.719 --> 01:47:18.290 align:start position:0%
he set me up it was my fault
representative

01:47:18.290 --> 01:47:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:20.209 --> 01:47:20.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:47:21.649 --> 01:47:21.659 align:start position:0%
committee members for allowing me to
 
01:47:24.590 --> 01:47:24.600 align:start position:0%
speak as representative wheeler did I am
 
01:47:26.149 --> 01:47:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to take the same tact and let
 
01:47:27.590 --> 01:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
y'all get to lunch just make it really
 
01:47:27.600 --> 01:47:29.330 align:start position:0%
y'all get to lunch just make it really
brief

01:47:29.330 --> 01:47:29.340 align:start position:0%
brief
 
01:47:31.970 --> 01:47:31.980 align:start position:0%
um no matter where one happens to be on
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
the political Spectrum uh chances are
 
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
you believe in the value of democracy of
 
01:47:38.510 --> 01:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
people's participation ability to
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
participate in our electoral process
 
01:47:44.450 --> 01:47:44.460 align:start position:0%
I believe that that necessarily entails
 
01:47:47.510 --> 01:47:47.520 align:start position:0%
um ensuring uh excessive accessibility
 
01:47:50.750 --> 01:47:50.760 align:start position:0%
for all facilitating safe and secure
 
01:47:53.030 --> 01:47:53.040 align:start position:0%
elections with input from as many of our
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
citizens as possible in that light this
 
01:47:57.830 --> 01:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
bill helps to reduce barriers to
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
participation plain and simple really
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
the only concern I can see is a cost and
 
01:48:05.270 --> 01:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
to that I say if anything is worth
 
01:48:08.149 --> 01:48:08.159 align:start position:0%
investing in it is our fundamental right
 
01:48:10.010 --> 01:48:10.020 align:start position:0%
to participation in our electoral
 
01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:11.030 align:start position:0%
to participation in our electoral
process

01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
told you I was going to keep it short
 
01:48:13.850 --> 01:48:13.860 align:start position:0%
and sweet
 
01:48:16.070 --> 01:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
and I'm open to any questions thank you
 
01:48:18.590 --> 01:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
well done thank you
 
01:48:26.030 --> 01:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:44.090 --> 01:48:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%

City and town clerks Association on this
 
01:49:08.450 --> 01:49:08.460 align:start position:0%
one where also just have a question as
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
to whether it is going to apply to the
 
01:49:22.970 --> 01:49:22.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:24.950 --> 01:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
a really good question to ask the bill
 
01:49:27.530 --> 01:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
sponsor okay rather than the committee
 
01:49:29.629 --> 01:49:29.639 align:start position:0%
okay and that's where we're mixed on it
 
01:49:32.090 --> 01:49:32.100 align:start position:0%
in favor and not in favor I'm sorry what
 
01:49:33.709 --> 01:49:33.719 align:start position:0%
that's where we're mixed the
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
associations mixed on that can't really
 
01:49:37.490 --> 01:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
vote on it without understanding that
 
01:49:52.430 --> 01:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.629 --> 01:50:13.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I'm
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
continue to be representative Timothy
 
01:50:19.370 --> 01:50:19.380 align:start position:0%
Horgan I continue unless something
 
01:50:21.109 --> 01:50:21.119 align:start position:0%
unexpected has happened I continue to
 
01:50:23.390 --> 01:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
represent Stratford County District 10
 
01:50:25.250 --> 01:50:25.260 align:start position:0%
the town of Durham so I actually have a
 
01:50:28.430 --> 01:50:28.440 align:start position:0%
page of written testimony which um
 
01:50:30.109 --> 01:50:30.119 align:start position:0%
I think I already submitted it on the
 
01:50:32.750 --> 01:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
web portal but um here's a hard copy of
 
01:50:32.760 --> 01:50:33.470 align:start position:0%
web portal but um here's a hard copy of
it

01:50:33.470 --> 01:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
and um as a others have noted uh the
 
01:50:39.530 --> 01:50:39.540 align:start position:0%
current system we allow we expect uh
 
01:50:42.530 --> 01:50:42.540 align:start position:0%
voters to fix their own Tamp stamps to
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
the absentee ballot return envelopes and
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
I admit this is in line with the New
 
01:50:48.470 --> 01:50:48.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire way of doing things where
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
government does as little as possible
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
for the people and the government does
 
01:50:53.030 --> 01:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
anything it does to as cheaply as
 
01:50:56.629 --> 01:50:56.639 align:start position:0%
possible but I uh don't think that's
 
01:50:59.270 --> 01:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
fair as I I would agree that it's a poll
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
tax but also there's a practical issue
 
01:51:04.609 --> 01:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
not everybody has a supply of stamps
 
01:51:07.070 --> 01:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
around the house even those who I mean
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
I've got lots of those stamps around the
 
01:51:11.570 --> 01:51:11.580 align:start position:0%
house but those forever stamps currently
 
01:51:13.729 --> 01:51:13.739 align:start position:0%
worth 63 cents don't necessarily have a
 
01:51:15.649 --> 01:51:15.659 align:start position:0%
posted scale to make sure the returned
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
envelope weighs less than an ounce nor
 
01:51:21.830 --> 01:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody have nor do most people nor
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
is everyone necessarily have a supply of
 
01:51:26.209 --> 01:51:26.219 align:start position:0%
additional out stamps currently 24 cents
 
01:51:27.470 --> 01:51:27.480 align:start position:0%
per additional ounce of the package
 
01:51:29.330 --> 01:51:29.340 align:start position:0%
weighs more than an ounce and ballot
 
01:51:31.609 --> 01:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
return envelopes often way more than one
 
01:51:31.619 --> 01:51:32.689 align:start position:0%
return envelopes often way more than one
ounce and

01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
ounce and
 
01:51:35.629 --> 01:51:35.639 align:start position:0%
it would be a good fraction for Town
 
01:51:38.030 --> 01:51:38.040 align:start position:0%
clerks to actually uh
 
01:51:41.330 --> 01:51:41.340 align:start position:0%
CR make up a sample of returned envelope
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
ballot and weigh it I don't know whether
 
01:51:44.750 --> 01:51:44.760 align:start position:0%
they all do it and also sometimes the
 
01:51:47.390 --> 01:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
cost will vary a little bit uh
 
01:51:50.270 --> 01:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
according to perhaps like say whether as
 
01:51:51.890 --> 01:51:51.900 align:start position:0%
I alluded to sometimes people put a
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
second their own mailing envelope around
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
the official mailing envelope especially
 
01:51:59.030 --> 01:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
when this sentient from uh from overseas
 
01:52:01.729 --> 01:52:01.739 align:start position:0%
um so that's uh which might which would
 
01:52:03.890 --> 01:52:03.900 align:start position:0%
make it way which might kick an envelope
 
01:52:06.109 --> 01:52:06.119 align:start position:0%
up to the next ounce but anyway
 
01:52:07.970 --> 01:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
um we had a lot of discussion about the
 
01:52:10.550 --> 01:52:10.560 align:start position:0%
size of ballast in the previous bill um
 
01:52:12.890 --> 01:52:12.900 align:start position:0%
and we mentioned those uh
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
first class large envelopes those are
 
01:52:16.490 --> 01:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
light Flats they probably be a fairly
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
lightweight flat unless you're from
 
01:52:19.250 --> 01:52:19.260 align:start position:0%
Milford in which case you've got 12
 
01:52:21.709 --> 01:52:21.719 align:start position:0%
pages of stuff in the uh in the ballot
 
01:52:24.050 --> 01:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
and those we've had a problem
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't really really easy to build
 
01:52:27.890 --> 01:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
but those will actually have the uh
 
01:52:29.810 --> 01:52:29.820 align:start position:0%
calendars mailed are having a problem
 
01:52:31.490 --> 01:52:31.500 align:start position:0%
getting the calendars is taking a week
 
01:52:32.930 --> 01:52:32.940 align:start position:0%
and that's because the post office has
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
to separately hand
 
01:52:37.129 --> 01:52:37.139 align:start position:0%
usually as stupid has to hand sort the
 
01:52:40.250 --> 01:52:40.260 align:start position:0%
very the lighter large envelope so
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
that's that's why that piece is taking a
 
01:52:43.609 --> 01:52:43.619 align:start position:0%
week to get there instead of two days
 
01:52:45.229 --> 01:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
and that would happen with certain
 
01:52:47.090 --> 01:52:47.100 align:start position:0%
ballots depending on what the size of
 
01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
the package was but and finally I go
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
into some detail
 
01:52:54.109 --> 01:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
I have a couple paragraph about the
 
01:52:55.609 --> 01:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
possibility of the Secretary State
 
01:52:57.290 --> 01:52:57.300 align:start position:0%
getting a business
 
01:53:00.649 --> 01:53:00.659 align:start position:0%
plymail account so that'll be a
 
01:53:02.750 --> 01:53:02.760 align:start position:0%
so it'd be a simple way to pay for the
 
01:53:04.129 --> 01:53:04.139 align:start position:0%
uh at least I think it would be simple
 
01:53:05.689 --> 01:53:05.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's some complications from
 
01:53:08.689 --> 01:53:08.699 align:start position:0%
overlooked of of
 
01:53:11.570 --> 01:53:11.580 align:start position:0%
to send the ballots back otherwise
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
otherwise the alternative would be to
 
01:53:15.470 --> 01:53:15.480 align:start position:0%
have the town clerks uh you know keep
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
hand over the stamps to the uh to the
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
citizens they come and return the ballot
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
if they're or if they're mailing out one
 
01:53:24.290 --> 01:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
that's I think
 
01:53:26.810 --> 01:53:26.820 align:start position:0%
and actually I probably maybe I should
 
01:53:28.550 --> 01:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
have done this because this actually uh
 
01:53:30.350 --> 01:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
kicks up the cost in the financial note
 
01:53:32.090 --> 01:53:32.100 align:start position:0%
because there's an annual fee for such
 
01:53:34.430 --> 01:53:34.440 align:start position:0%
an account but uh it would I still think
 
01:53:36.830 --> 01:53:36.840 align:start position:0%
that would be money well worth it and
 
01:53:38.750 --> 01:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
it's not a not really a large sum of
 
01:53:40.430 --> 01:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
money in the larger schema things in
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
fact can probably be paid for entirely
 
01:53:45.290 --> 01:53:45.300 align:start position:0%
out of the existing uh so-called Java
 
01:53:48.649 --> 01:53:48.659 align:start position:0%
funds help America vote tax funds so I
 
01:53:51.169 --> 01:53:51.179 align:start position:0%
I would say this is a uh excellent bill
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
it's a common sense idea that should
 
01:53:54.770 --> 01:53:54.780 align:start position:0%
have been done years ago so I uh urgency
 
01:53:57.109 --> 01:53:57.119 align:start position:0%
committees move forward and pass it
 
01:53:58.970 --> 01:53:58.980 align:start position:0%
and I guess I'd be happy to take any
 
01:54:02.090 --> 01:54:02.100 align:start position:0%
questions although I am I too like the
 
01:54:02.100 --> 01:54:03.229 align:start position:0%
questions although I am I too like the
previous

01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
previous
 
01:54:05.750 --> 01:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
um Witnesses M standing between you and
 
01:54:07.850 --> 01:54:07.860 align:start position:0%
your lunch but anyway thank you thank
 
01:54:10.189 --> 01:54:10.199 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
01:54:12.290 --> 01:54:12.300 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
01:54:14.629 --> 01:54:14.639 align:start position:0%
representative Kennedy
 
01:54:16.010 --> 01:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
um do you believe that every person who
 
01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
votes in person should receive a mileage
 
01:54:22.430 --> 01:54:22.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for driving to the polling
 
01:54:24.470 --> 01:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
place no
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
01:54:28.070 --> 01:54:28.080 align:start position:0%
I mean if you wish I don't know whether
 
01:54:29.570 --> 01:54:29.580 align:start position:0%
that be a Germaine amendment to this
 
01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
bill you're certainly free to consider
 
01:54:32.930 --> 01:54:32.940 align:start position:0%
that if you think that's a good idea but
 
01:54:34.250 --> 01:54:34.260 align:start position:0%
I would say
 
01:54:36.590 --> 01:54:36.600 align:start position:0%
I would say no but there's I don't think
 
01:54:38.090 --> 01:54:38.100 align:start position:0%
a mileage reimbursement is the same
 
01:54:41.330 --> 01:54:41.340 align:start position:0%
thing as uh providing return postage on
 
01:54:43.010 --> 01:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
the envelope so it's
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
thank you I mean I would probably put in
 
01:54:47.390 --> 01:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
for the mileage and take it if you if
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:05.030 --> 01:55:05.040 align:start position:0%
Deputy deputy secretary Hennessey
 
01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.229 align:start position:0%
Deputy deputy secretary Hennessey
foreign

01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:11.990 --> 01:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
again Aaron Hennessey I'm the deputy
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
secretary of state and I'm just here to
 
01:55:17.629 --> 01:55:17.639 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might have and
 
01:55:21.790 --> 01:55:21.800 align:start position:0%
point out that this bill which is under
 
01:55:24.530 --> 01:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
657.7 would apply to State elections
 
01:55:24.540 --> 01:55:25.310 align:start position:0%
657.7 would apply to State elections
only

01:55:25.310 --> 01:55:25.320 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:55:28.010 --> 01:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
so people who request an absentee ballot
 
01:55:30.770 --> 01:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
in a town or city election would have to
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.629 --> 01:55:38.639 align:start position:0%
and with that you're done
 
01:55:43.669 --> 01:55:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:46.970 --> 01:55:46.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:51.050 --> 01:55:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:42.050 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:42.050 --> 01:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:42.060 --> 01:56:44.050 align:start position:0%
okay
one

01:56:44.050 --> 01:56:44.060 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:48.679 align:start position:0%
two three signed in favor and none
 
01:56:51.109 --> 01:56:51.119 align:start position:0%
opposed that closes the public hearing
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 508.
 
01:56:56.450 --> 01:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
and the committee is in recess until one
 
01:56:56.460 --> 03:04:09.349 align:start position:0%
and the committee is in recess until one
o'clock

03:04:09.349 --> 03:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:09.359 --> 03:04:10.969 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:04:10.969 --> 03:04:10.979 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:04:13.610 --> 03:04:13.620 align:start position:0%
okay the average of the clocks that I
 
03:04:16.309 --> 03:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
checked agreeing on one o'clock we will
 
03:04:18.730 --> 03:04:18.740 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing on House Bill
 
03:04:22.370 --> 03:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
195. welcome representative Lane
 
03:04:22.380 --> 03:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
195. welcome representative Lane
welcome

03:04:25.190 --> 03:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:28.730 --> 03:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
um 195 I okay I'm Connie Lane I'm
 
03:04:32.690 --> 03:04:32.700 align:start position:0%
represent uh Ward 2 in Concord and
 
03:04:34.849 --> 03:04:34.859 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
03:04:38.150 --> 03:04:38.160 align:start position:0%
this is a campaign finance bill the
 
03:04:40.670 --> 03:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
theory is is that the transparency is
 
03:04:43.670 --> 03:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
the goal so that the voter knows who is
 
03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
sending them
 
03:04:47.389 --> 03:04:47.399 align:start position:0%
communication whether that communication
 
03:04:49.510 --> 03:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
is email
 
03:04:52.750 --> 03:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
Flyers that we all get inundated with
 
03:04:56.630 --> 03:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
or any other communication
 
03:04:59.269 --> 03:04:59.279 align:start position:0%
this bill has been around for a while as
 
03:05:02.570 --> 03:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
you can see and the report that we just
 
03:05:04.610 --> 03:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
got and
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
um it it is lowering the threshold from
 
03:05:10.730 --> 03:05:10.740 align:start position:0%
five thousand dollars to twenty five
 
03:05:13.910 --> 03:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars in order to qualify for
 
03:05:16.490 --> 03:05:16.500 align:start position:0%
registration as a political advocacy
 
03:05:21.410 --> 03:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
organization under RSA 664.
 
03:05:24.889 --> 03:05:24.899 align:start position:0%
so if an organization sends out mailers
 
03:05:28.550 --> 03:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
emails tv ads within 60 days before a
 
03:05:31.550 --> 03:05:31.560 align:start position:0%
primary or a general election that costs
 
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
more than twenty five hundred dollars
 
03:05:36.050 --> 03:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
they must register with the Secretary of
 
03:05:38.830 --> 03:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
State as a political
 
03:05:42.170 --> 03:05:42.180 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization and that in a
 
03:05:45.370 --> 03:05:45.380 align:start position:0%
nutshell is what this bill is about
 
03:05:48.170 --> 03:05:48.180 align:start position:0%
there are some concerns that it is
 
03:05:51.230 --> 03:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
perhaps unconstitutional but all it does
 
03:05:53.809 --> 03:05:53.819 align:start position:0%
really is expand this
 
03:05:53.819 --> 03:05:55.309 align:start position:0%
really is expand this
to

03:05:55.309 --> 03:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:05:58.190 --> 03:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
those who are sending us and not and we
 
03:06:00.110 --> 03:06:00.120 align:start position:0%
don't know who they are sending us
 
03:06:02.090 --> 03:06:02.100 align:start position:0%
information either about candidates or
 
03:06:04.790 --> 03:06:04.800 align:start position:0%
issues and it lowers that to twenty five
 
03:06:06.349 --> 03:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
03:06:08.450 --> 03:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:06:12.469 --> 03:06:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:14.450 --> 03:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Blaine do you
 
03:06:16.370 --> 03:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
have an example of a group that will be
 
03:06:17.630 --> 03:06:17.640 align:start position:0%
affected by this
 
03:06:20.210 --> 03:06:20.220 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry could you set up an example of
 
03:06:23.030 --> 03:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
a group that would be affected by this
 
03:06:25.010 --> 03:06:25.020 align:start position:0%
no because right now they don't register
 
03:06:26.809 --> 03:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
so we don't know who they are they don't
 
03:06:28.370 --> 03:06:28.380 align:start position:0%
even have to put their stuff on their
 
03:06:28.380 --> 03:06:30.950 align:start position:0%
even have to put their stuff on their
mailers

03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
mailers
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
and I'll allow myself a follow-up
 
03:06:37.309 --> 03:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
it's good to be the chair sometimes
 
03:06:39.830 --> 03:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
um so and it's twenty five hundred
 
03:06:42.530 --> 03:06:42.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in total yes
 
03:06:44.570 --> 03:06:44.580 align:start position:0%
over what period of time or per camera
 
03:06:48.050 --> 03:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
if they do it within 60 days if they
 
03:06:50.150 --> 03:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
mail that out and that within that 60
 
03:06:52.969 --> 03:06:52.979 align:start position:0%
days they spent 2500 then they are
 
03:06:55.429 --> 03:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization and they
 
03:06:57.710 --> 03:06:57.720 align:start position:0%
have to register all we're requiring is
 
03:06:59.570 --> 03:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
that they register so that people know
 
03:07:01.550 --> 03:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
where it's coming from
 
03:07:02.929 --> 03:07:02.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:07:05.510 --> 03:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:07:07.730 --> 03:07:07.740 align:start position:0%
representative Barry I just want to tack
 
03:07:10.610 --> 03:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
onto that um so it's 60 days or a
 
03:07:13.490 --> 03:07:13.500 align:start position:0%
calendar year correct
 
03:07:14.809 --> 03:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
because it's tacking into the existing
 
03:07:16.730 --> 03:07:16.740 align:start position:0%
or am I misreading it
 
03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
because it's I don't want to read the
 
03:07:20.510 --> 03:07:20.520 align:start position:0%
whole thing but Pao means identity
 
03:07:21.710 --> 03:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
including an unlimited to an
 
03:07:23.389 --> 03:07:23.399 align:start position:0%
organization describing I said well that
 
03:07:26.210 --> 03:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
makes our expenditures of 2500 or more
 
03:07:29.290 --> 03:07:29.300 align:start position:0%
in a calendar year so it's 60 days or
 
03:07:32.330 --> 03:07:32.340 align:start position:0%
calendars or or more you're right in a
 
03:07:34.190 --> 03:07:34.200 align:start position:0%
calendar year okay so it's it's the 60
 
03:07:36.050 --> 03:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
days and the calendar year yes okay yeah
 
03:07:37.490 --> 03:07:37.500 align:start position:0%

03:07:39.230 --> 03:07:39.240 align:start position:0%
apologize I was just genuinely
 
03:07:39.240 --> 03:07:41.090 align:start position:0%

03:08:02.030 --> 03:08:02.040 align:start position:0%

where they're receiving this it doesn't
 
03:08:06.469 --> 03:08:06.479 align:start position:0%
do anything for enforcement or any no
 
03:08:08.750 --> 03:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
anything any already whatever
 
03:08:11.389 --> 03:08:11.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement is there already would not
 
03:08:15.050 --> 03:08:15.060 align:start position:0%
change so right now okay and actually
 
03:08:17.330 --> 03:08:17.340 align:start position:0%
there's not a lot of enforcement but
 
03:08:20.809 --> 03:08:20.819 align:start position:0%
we're trying to give you know baby steps
 
03:08:24.110 --> 03:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
follow up good so is there is this
 
03:08:26.870 --> 03:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
happening now with the 5000 limit no
 
03:08:28.969 --> 03:08:28.979 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't expand out to those
 
03:08:30.889 --> 03:08:30.899 align:start position:0%
kinds of mailers and things so we've
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
expanded the definition so that these
 
03:08:35.630 --> 03:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
they can't come in and dump for instance
 
03:08:38.630 --> 03:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
something that says I have a position on
 
03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
something and I don't have a position on
 
03:08:42.830 --> 03:08:42.840 align:start position:0%
that it's contrary and it comes out two
 
03:08:45.349 --> 03:08:45.359 align:start position:0%
weeks before the election I have no time
 
03:08:48.889 --> 03:08:48.899 align:start position:0%
or money to counter that so the idea is
 
03:08:51.530 --> 03:08:51.540 align:start position:0%
to pry at least people will know who
 
03:08:56.150 --> 03:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
sent out that mailer that's the goal
 
03:08:58.790 --> 03:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bay
 
03:09:02.330 --> 03:09:02.340 align:start position:0%
the 2500 is that like if it's a mailer
 
03:09:05.030 --> 03:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
is it one mailing or total for mailing
 
03:09:07.490 --> 03:09:07.500 align:start position:0%
for different total thank you it's 25
 
03:09:09.650 --> 03:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
like I think representative Berry
 
03:09:11.929 --> 03:09:11.939 align:start position:0%
pointed out it's gonna be a total of
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars in a year
 
03:09:15.469 --> 03:09:15.479 align:start position:0%
but only if they send it out within that
 
03:09:19.490 --> 03:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:22.429 --> 03:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
representative Barry so I just um just
 
03:09:23.570 --> 03:09:23.580 align:start position:0%
want to go back to it because you and I
 
03:09:25.490 --> 03:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
had a discussion about paos
 
03:09:29.090 --> 03:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
um so basically we're lowering you're
 
03:09:30.590 --> 03:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
attempting to lower the threshold five
 
03:09:32.210 --> 03:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
thousand twenty five hundred and then
 
03:09:34.849 --> 03:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
you're expanding the definition of what
 
03:09:37.190 --> 03:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
a let's call it political communication
 
03:09:41.150 --> 03:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:43.670 --> 03:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:09:45.590 --> 03:09:45.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Blaine
 
03:09:54.790 --> 03:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:16.790 --> 03:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:19.130 --> 03:10:19.140 align:start position:0%
good afternoon the committee this is my
 
03:10:22.130 --> 03:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
2022 political mail pile
 
03:10:24.650 --> 03:10:24.660 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to show you that
 
03:10:24.660 --> 03:10:25.969 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to show you that
disclosure

03:10:25.969 --> 03:10:25.979 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
03:10:28.730 --> 03:10:28.740 align:start position:0%
is different on almost every single one
 
03:10:31.130 --> 03:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
of these pieces whether they follow the
 
03:10:33.650 --> 03:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
law or not follow the law some have paid
 
03:10:36.889 --> 03:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
for by the name of the committee but not
 
03:10:40.550 --> 03:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
their Treasurer some have no disclosure
 
03:10:41.769 --> 03:10:41.779 align:start position:0%
at all
 
03:10:46.070 --> 03:10:46.080 align:start position:0%
some have registered some have not so
 
03:10:48.050 --> 03:10:48.060 align:start position:0%
they send out mail when they have no
 
03:10:50.870 --> 03:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
marking on them you don't know who it's
 
03:10:53.389 --> 03:10:53.399 align:start position:0%
from but some of them have markings on
 
03:10:55.550 --> 03:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
them some of this mail is federal and
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
some of its state so
 
03:11:00.050 --> 03:11:00.060 align:start position:0%
I know that this will only apply to the
 
03:11:03.710 --> 03:11:03.720 align:start position:0%
state but open democracy let me my name
 
03:11:05.809 --> 03:11:05.819 align:start position:0%
is Olivia Zink and I'm from Franklin New
 
03:11:07.309 --> 03:11:07.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm the executive director
 
03:11:09.830 --> 03:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
of open democracy action we're a
 
03:11:12.050 --> 03:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan non-profit
 
03:11:14.830 --> 03:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
um here in Concord we've been working on
 
03:11:17.809 --> 03:11:17.819 align:start position:0%
transparency for a really long time so
 
03:11:19.490 --> 03:11:19.500 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is if you're
 
03:11:22.550 --> 03:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
spending money and naming a candidate
 
03:11:25.190 --> 03:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
you have to register and report your
 
03:11:27.530 --> 03:11:27.540 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance
 
03:11:30.950 --> 03:11:30.960 align:start position:0%
so it it basically strikes the language
 
03:11:33.110 --> 03:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
functionally equivalent to express
 
03:11:35.809 --> 03:11:35.819 align:start position:0%
advocacy and if people don't know what
 
03:11:37.570 --> 03:11:37.580 align:start position:0%
functionally equivalent to express
 
03:11:42.830 --> 03:11:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:45.050 --> 03:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
um Bill Marsh doesn't talk about his
 
03:11:46.790 --> 03:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
record on the environment because it's
 
03:11:50.570 --> 03:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
extreme it's not saying vote against him
 
03:11:52.969 --> 03:11:52.979 align:start position:0%
it's just sort of stating something
 
03:11:56.330 --> 03:11:56.340 align:start position:0%
about this state Senate candidate if you
 
03:11:59.090 --> 03:11:59.100 align:start position:0%
use the magic word vote for vote against
 
03:12:00.950 --> 03:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's three or four other magic words
 
03:12:03.590 --> 03:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
that trigger you to
 
03:12:06.530 --> 03:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
be considered a functionally equivalent
 
03:12:09.590 --> 03:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
to express advocacy but if you don't use
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:17.389 --> 03:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
call your State Rep and ask them to to
 
03:12:19.429 --> 03:12:19.439 align:start position:0%
for this position and then you actually
 
03:12:22.790 --> 03:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
don't trigger disclosure voters see all
 
03:12:25.969 --> 03:12:25.979 align:start position:0%
of this as political mail
 
03:12:28.670 --> 03:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
voters don't distinction don't make a
 
03:12:31.490 --> 03:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
distinction between something that says
 
03:12:33.590 --> 03:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
you know Bill Marsh doesn't talk about
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
his record on health care and vote for
 
03:12:38.690 --> 03:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
vote against
 
03:12:42.290 --> 03:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
this bill closes a loophole in our
 
03:12:43.849 --> 03:12:43.859 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance
 
03:12:46.730 --> 03:12:46.740 align:start position:0%
many years ago open democracy worked
 
03:12:49.849 --> 03:12:49.859 align:start position:0%
with Senator Bradley on creating the
 
03:12:51.469 --> 03:12:51.479 align:start position:0%
disclosure bill
 
03:12:54.349 --> 03:12:54.359 align:start position:0%
it was actually about 10 years ago and
 
03:12:56.929 --> 03:12:56.939 align:start position:0%
then after we passed a disclosure Bill
 
03:12:58.790 --> 03:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
to get more groups to register and
 
03:13:01.670 --> 03:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
report we noticed this loophole where
 
03:13:03.530 --> 03:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
groups were instead of using those magic
 
03:13:05.750 --> 03:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
words a vote for or vote against they're
 
03:13:08.230 --> 03:13:08.240 align:start position:0%
using other words
 
03:13:11.330 --> 03:13:11.340 align:start position:0%
to get around this loophole so basically
 
03:13:13.250 --> 03:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
this is trying to plug the loophole by
 
03:13:15.349 --> 03:13:15.359 align:start position:0%
saying if you clearly identify a
 
03:13:17.870 --> 03:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
candidate within the time period and
 
03:13:20.750 --> 03:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
it's not trying to get small groups it's
 
03:13:22.550 --> 03:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
trying to get the big bigger groups that
 
03:13:24.170 --> 03:13:24.180 align:start position:0%
are spending at least two thousand five
 
03:13:26.030 --> 03:13:26.040 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars because you know
 
03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
that a group that
 
03:13:31.910 --> 03:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
spent time mailing this to a group of
 
03:13:33.830 --> 03:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
Voters they've spent more than two
 
03:13:36.349 --> 03:13:36.359 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars
 
03:13:39.530 --> 03:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
um also just wanted to say
 
03:13:39.540 --> 03:13:40.250 align:start position:0%
um also just wanted to say
um

03:13:40.250 --> 03:13:40.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
you might hear about some Court
 
03:13:45.889 --> 03:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
decisions in other states and I want you
 
03:13:48.769 --> 03:13:48.779 align:start position:0%
to know that political speech is
 
03:13:51.170 --> 03:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
different and the first circuit has
 
03:13:53.870 --> 03:13:53.880 align:start position:0%
looked at political speech and that we
 
03:13:57.110 --> 03:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
can require disclosure if they are
 
03:13:59.330 --> 03:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
making an act of spending money to
 
03:14:01.670 --> 03:14:01.680 align:start position:0%
influence the election and voters
 
03:14:04.570 --> 03:14:04.580 align:start position:0%
deserve that that
 
03:14:07.849 --> 03:14:07.859 align:start position:0%
Integrity in the political process to be
 
03:14:10.429 --> 03:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
able to look at the Secretary of State's
 
03:14:13.190 --> 03:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
office and find out if the group
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
registered or reported I can tell you
 
03:14:17.809 --> 03:14:17.819 align:start position:0%
most voters don't go to the Secretary of
 
03:14:19.610 --> 03:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
State's office and go to the campaign
 
03:14:21.469 --> 03:14:21.479 align:start position:0%
Finance filings and see if a group
 
03:14:23.809 --> 03:14:23.819 align:start position:0%
registered a report like only democracy
 
03:14:25.849 --> 03:14:25.859 align:start position:0%
nerds like me and maybe representative
 
03:14:27.650 --> 03:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
Barry look up when when he gets
 
03:14:29.090 --> 03:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
political mail did this group register
 
03:14:30.889 --> 03:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
or report
 
03:14:30.899 --> 03:14:32.150 align:start position:0%
or report
um

03:14:32.150 --> 03:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:33.950 --> 03:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
I do want to share a little bit of
 
03:14:36.410 --> 03:14:36.420 align:start position:0%
History this committee has seen this
 
03:14:38.389 --> 03:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
bill before this is not the first time
 
03:14:40.610 --> 03:14:40.620 align:start position:0%
you have seen this bill before this bill
 
03:14:45.250 --> 03:14:45.260 align:start position:0%
has passed the senate 24-nothing in 2019
 
03:14:48.950 --> 03:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
passed this committee 20 nothing
 
03:14:50.389 --> 03:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
um it did not make it over the Finish
 
03:14:52.309 --> 03:14:52.319 align:start position:0%
Line because the governor did veto it
 
03:14:55.370 --> 03:14:55.380 align:start position:0%
that year but I do hope that this
 
03:14:56.630 --> 03:14:56.640 align:start position:0%
committee will look at this bill
 
03:14:58.610 --> 03:14:58.620 align:start position:0%
favorably to just say groups should
 
03:15:01.309 --> 03:15:01.319 align:start position:0%
register and report if they are making
 
03:15:03.230 --> 03:15:03.240 align:start position:0%
political contributions
 
03:15:05.570 --> 03:15:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's a simple transparency so please
 
03:15:08.809 --> 03:15:08.819 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass house bill
 
03:15:08.819 --> 03:15:10.210 align:start position:0%
vote ought to pass house bill
um

03:15:10.210 --> 03:15:10.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:14.570 --> 03:15:14.580 align:start position:0%
195. this is the 2022 campaign mail I
 
03:15:16.610 --> 03:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
have a whole stack in my office of 2020
 
03:15:22.010 --> 03:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
mail 2018 mail 2016 Mayo uh you can see
 
03:15:24.230 --> 03:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
that this is happening uh throughout our
 
03:15:27.410 --> 03:15:27.420 align:start position:0%
his throughout history and also you know
 
03:15:29.570 --> 03:15:29.580 align:start position:0%
if anyone wants to save their 2024 mail
 
03:15:32.750 --> 03:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
you know we'll take it and this is
 
03:15:35.150 --> 03:15:35.160 align:start position:0%
voters Republican voters that received
 
03:15:37.370 --> 03:15:37.380 align:start position:0%
things for Jeb Bradley and Democratic
 
03:15:38.990 --> 03:15:39.000 align:start position:0%
voters and independent voters like this
 
03:15:41.269 --> 03:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
is we try to collect mail from multiple
 
03:15:42.650 --> 03:15:42.660 align:start position:0%
different sources to see who's
 
03:15:45.050 --> 03:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
registering and Reporting
 
03:15:46.429 --> 03:15:46.439 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take any
 
03:15:46.439 --> 03:15:48.469 align:start position:0%
with that I'm happy to take any
questions

03:15:48.469 --> 03:15:48.479 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:15:53.950 --> 03:15:53.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:56.330 --> 03:15:56.340 align:start position:0%
representative there's very few people
 
03:15:57.710 --> 03:15:57.720 align:start position:0%
that keep the political mail so we have
 
03:16:00.230 --> 03:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
that in common my wife's comments to
 
03:16:01.250 --> 03:16:01.260 align:start position:0%
throw it out
 
03:16:02.210 --> 03:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and I should have asked this to
 
03:16:03.410 --> 03:16:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative lamb she was up here but
 
03:16:05.870 --> 03:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
I I kind of just noticed it it says in
 
03:16:07.969 --> 03:16:07.979 align:start position:0%
the language here
 
03:16:10.849 --> 03:16:10.859 align:start position:0%
um and are publicly distributed
 
03:16:13.610 --> 03:16:13.620 align:start position:0%
um within 60 days we don't Define
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
publicly distributed and I know like one
 
03:16:19.190 --> 03:16:19.200 align:start position:0%
of the very most common campaign tactics
 
03:16:21.110 --> 03:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
are um you know these campaign staffers
 
03:16:23.210 --> 03:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
will generate letters to the editor and
 
03:16:24.830 --> 03:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
they'll ship it off to somebody to
 
03:16:26.750 --> 03:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
publish another publication like you
 
03:16:28.309 --> 03:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
know the newspaper
 
03:16:30.950 --> 03:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
um would that count under this
 
03:16:33.230 --> 03:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
um because that's you've got a political
 
03:16:34.429 --> 03:16:34.439 align:start position:0%
expansion happening right you're paying
 
03:16:36.469 --> 03:16:36.479 align:start position:0%
a staffer to generate campaign materials
 
03:16:38.450 --> 03:16:38.460 align:start position:0%
it's going in somebody else's name and
 
03:16:40.969 --> 03:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
then it's being publicly distributed
 
03:16:42.349 --> 03:16:42.359 align:start position:0%
um and this part to be fair this
 
03:16:43.490 --> 03:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
question probably shouldn't have been
 
03:16:45.230 --> 03:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
asked of you but like I said I missed my
 
03:16:46.250 --> 03:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
opportunity the representative Lane
 
03:16:48.230 --> 03:16:48.240 align:start position:0%
maybe she can tell me later but
 
03:16:50.450 --> 03:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
um it's something like reading this I'm
 
03:16:51.349 --> 03:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
thinking like we don't really Define
 
03:16:54.590 --> 03:16:54.600 align:start position:0%
publicly distributed so
 
03:16:56.570 --> 03:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and I think
 
03:16:58.849 --> 03:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has in other
 
03:17:01.070 --> 03:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance letters made reference
 
03:17:04.490 --> 03:17:04.500 align:start position:0%
to this so if this Sharon Carson letter
 
03:17:07.910 --> 03:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
got sent to voters in Franklin it
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't actually meet that definition
 
03:17:11.870 --> 03:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
because Sharon Carson isn't my state
 
03:17:14.750 --> 03:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
senator so what the attorney general has
 
03:17:16.969 --> 03:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
when they've tried to do campaign
 
03:17:19.250 --> 03:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
Finance violations has said was it
 
03:17:21.530 --> 03:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
distributed to voters in that District
 
03:17:24.650 --> 03:17:24.660 align:start position:0%
so if you mailed something
 
03:17:27.170 --> 03:17:27.180 align:start position:0%
that was intended to Manchester voters
 
03:17:29.330 --> 03:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
to a different town then it wouldn't be
 
03:17:31.250 --> 03:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
considered actually publicly distributed
 
03:17:32.929 --> 03:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
that's how the attorney general has
 
03:17:36.950 --> 03:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
defined it in violations prior but I
 
03:17:39.410 --> 03:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
would you know maybe ask that you ask
 
03:17:41.030 --> 03:17:41.040 align:start position:0%
Ann Edwards or somebody from the
 
03:17:43.910 --> 03:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on how they're defining
 
03:17:54.410 --> 03:17:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:57.230 --> 03:17:57.240 align:start position:0%
is this just mailers or I don't know
 
03:18:01.490 --> 03:18:01.500 align:start position:0%
bumper stickers uh well it actually our
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
disclosure laws apply more broadly to
 
03:18:08.570 --> 03:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
mailers radio ads
 
03:18:08.580 --> 03:18:09.309 align:start position:0%
mailers radio ads
um

03:18:09.309 --> 03:18:09.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:18:12.130 --> 03:18:12.140 align:start position:0%
lawn signs actually require disclosure
 
03:18:15.230 --> 03:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
anything you're spending more than
 
03:18:16.910 --> 03:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
twenty two thousand five hundred dollars
 
03:18:18.889 --> 03:18:18.899 align:start position:0%
on aggregately
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you need to register
 
03:18:22.969 --> 03:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
most people who are running for office
 
03:18:25.370 --> 03:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
register and file their campaign Finance
 
03:18:25.380 --> 03:18:26.929 align:start position:0%
register and file their campaign Finance
reports

03:18:26.929 --> 03:18:26.939 align:start position:0%
reports
 
03:18:29.210 --> 03:18:29.220 align:start position:0%
the majority of people do there are just
 
03:18:31.070 --> 03:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
certain groups that are not registering
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
and Reporting and and this bill is just
 
03:18:35.990 --> 03:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
trying to plug that loophole but it does
 
03:18:39.889 --> 03:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
the definition in 664 does Define
 
03:18:43.910 --> 03:18:43.920 align:start position:0%
commune all Community the communications
 
03:18:45.830 --> 03:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
um and so Facebook ads do count I I
 
03:18:48.469 --> 03:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
believe but somebody can correct me if
 
03:18:51.170 --> 03:18:51.180 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong on on that
 
03:18:55.610 --> 03:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
so if somebody sends out 2 500 bucks
 
03:18:57.650 --> 03:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
worth of bumper stickers that say
 
03:18:59.630 --> 03:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
Representative Steven Smith murders
 
03:19:05.690 --> 03:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:08.809 --> 03:19:08.819 align:start position:0%
third if if they put those all over cars
 
03:19:12.050 --> 03:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
right now it wouldn't qualify if those
 
03:19:14.990 --> 03:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
bumper stickers still are on cars close
 
03:19:17.090 --> 03:19:17.100 align:start position:0%
to the election then it would qualify
 
03:19:18.590 --> 03:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
that the person who spent the money
 
03:19:21.410 --> 03:19:21.420 align:start position:0%
needed to register
 
03:19:24.050 --> 03:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
um as a political group and
 
03:19:26.450 --> 03:19:26.460 align:start position:0%
and disclose their spending
 
03:19:28.130 --> 03:19:28.140 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would never hurt a
 
03:19:28.140 --> 03:19:30.530 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would never hurt a
kitten

03:19:30.530 --> 03:19:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:32.030 --> 03:19:32.040 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:19:35.929 --> 03:19:35.939 align:start position:0%
representative Brian thank you
 
03:19:39.290 --> 03:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
of those letters that you have there how
 
03:19:41.450 --> 03:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
many of them
 
03:19:44.450 --> 03:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
you uh you have no idea where they came
 
03:19:46.910 --> 03:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
from you can't determine what
 
03:19:49.070 --> 03:19:49.080 align:start position:0%
organization organization or person sent
 
03:19:49.080 --> 03:19:50.510 align:start position:0%
organization organization or person sent
them

03:19:50.510 --> 03:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:19:53.330 --> 03:19:53.340 align:start position:0%
there's one in this pile that's that has
 
03:19:56.929 --> 03:19:56.939 align:start position:0%
no disclosure disclosure whatsoever I'm
 
03:19:58.550 --> 03:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
trying to find it
 
03:20:02.450 --> 03:20:02.460 align:start position:0%
um they didn't say paid for by anything
 
03:20:05.870 --> 03:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
and I wish I had like put them in a
 
03:20:08.150 --> 03:20:08.160 align:start position:0%
put sticky notes on them because now
 
03:20:09.590 --> 03:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
they're all out of order but there is
 
03:20:12.889 --> 03:20:12.899 align:start position:0%
one that has no no disclosure no return
 
03:20:14.870 --> 03:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
address no website
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
no indication of of anyone who they
 
03:20:20.570 --> 03:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
spent money for
 
03:20:23.929 --> 03:20:23.939 align:start position:0%
um there are others I will say that
 
03:20:27.170 --> 03:20:27.180 align:start position:0%
some of them say paid for by and list a
 
03:20:28.490 --> 03:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
Treasurer which is what you're supposed
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
to do you're supposed to list a
 
03:20:32.870 --> 03:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
Treasurer and an address
 
03:20:36.530 --> 03:20:36.540 align:start position:0%
um some of them don't all do that
 
03:20:38.389 --> 03:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
so they're all over the place as far as
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
how our just how our law is supposed to
 
03:20:43.550 --> 03:20:43.560 align:start position:0%
look and then what actually happens is
 
03:20:45.530 --> 03:20:45.540 align:start position:0%
and anyone willing wanting to look
 
03:20:48.230 --> 03:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
through them happy to make this pile
 
03:20:48.240 --> 03:20:51.110 align:start position:0%
through them happy to make this pile
available

03:20:51.110 --> 03:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:51.120 --> 03:20:54.110 align:start position:0%
 
questions

03:20:54.110 --> 03:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:54.120 --> 03:20:56.050 align:start position:0%
 
representative

03:20:56.050 --> 03:20:56.060 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:21:00.110 --> 03:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
so if uh you see some of those and you
 
03:21:02.150 --> 03:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
can't uh and they don't disclose who
 
03:21:03.950 --> 03:21:03.960 align:start position:0%
they are and how can you make them
 
03:21:05.929 --> 03:21:05.939 align:start position:0%
accountable will it uh be an
 
03:21:07.790 --> 03:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
investigation by the Secretary of State
 
03:21:10.670 --> 03:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth can you Enlighten us on
 
03:21:14.090 --> 03:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
that I'm sure and I uh urge you to ask
 
03:21:16.190 --> 03:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office but the
 
03:21:19.070 --> 03:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
way it works currently is is and I know
 
03:21:20.750 --> 03:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
that there has been campaign Finance
 
03:21:24.170 --> 03:21:24.180 align:start position:0%
violations filed regular citizens can
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
send a letter saying I received this
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
mail and I don't know who it's from and
 
03:21:30.889 --> 03:21:30.899 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General will investigate
 
03:21:32.750 --> 03:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
who who mailed them sometimes they can
 
03:21:34.490 --> 03:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
find out from the bulk permit number
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
because there's a bulk permit number on
 
03:21:38.990 --> 03:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
it and they'll find out who who mailed
 
03:21:41.809 --> 03:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
that in there are other ways that the
 
03:21:43.790 --> 03:21:43.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General can investigate who
 
03:21:46.309 --> 03:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
sent these letters but I think by
 
03:21:48.710 --> 03:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation we're just
 
03:21:51.349 --> 03:21:51.359 align:start position:0%
saying anyone engaged in this activity
 
03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:54.479 align:start position:0%
should register and Report that's all
 
03:21:56.929 --> 03:21:56.939 align:start position:0%
not trying to stop anyone from doing any
 
03:21:58.190 --> 03:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
of this political mail all this
 
03:21:59.510 --> 03:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
political mail will still show up in
 
03:22:02.030 --> 03:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
your inbox your mailbox we're just
 
03:22:04.010 --> 03:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
saying that it should have who who paid
 
03:22:06.410 --> 03:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
for it so voters can decide I think that
 
03:22:08.809 --> 03:22:08.819 align:start position:0%
it's really important that voters become
 
03:22:11.690 --> 03:22:11.700 align:start position:0%
informed consumers they are getting some
 
03:22:13.790 --> 03:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
something telling them to vote for these
 
03:22:14.990 --> 03:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
candidates and they can see that
 
03:22:17.150 --> 03:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
Northwood Democratic committee Tom Chase
 
03:22:21.170 --> 03:22:21.180 align:start position:0%
chair and Tom Ted Wilkinson treasurer
 
03:22:23.150 --> 03:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
paid for it I think they're supposed to
 
03:22:29.750 --> 03:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:22:34.309 --> 03:22:34.319 align:start position:0%
now you said there was this is a
 
03:22:37.269 --> 03:22:37.279 align:start position:0%
follow-up uh sort of for that last one
 
03:22:41.269 --> 03:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
uh I received some mail like that myself
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
and I
 
03:22:45.530 --> 03:22:45.540 align:start position:0%
pushed to get an investigation when you
 
03:22:47.690 --> 03:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
received that mail that had no
 
03:22:49.730 --> 03:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
information about who sent it did you
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:56.450 --> 03:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
um I what I've I have been doing in
 
03:22:58.969 --> 03:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
recent years open democracy has filed
 
03:23:01.790 --> 03:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
complaints in years past but what I've
 
03:23:04.309 --> 03:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
been doing is trying to train volunteers
 
03:23:06.590 --> 03:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
who are collecting this mail for us so
 
03:23:08.450 --> 03:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
that the voter who receives the mail
 
03:23:10.610 --> 03:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
files the complaint because I do think
 
03:23:11.990 --> 03:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's important that the voter who's
 
03:23:14.809 --> 03:23:14.819 align:start position:0%
receiving the mail says this is
 
03:23:16.490 --> 03:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
something that showed up in my mailbox
 
03:23:17.990 --> 03:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:23:21.590 --> 03:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
it uh so that it's it's you know and and
 
03:23:23.630 --> 03:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
also you know if there's multiple of
 
03:23:25.490 --> 03:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
these that show up
 
03:23:28.130 --> 03:23:28.140 align:start position:0%
um in multiple mailboxes
 
03:23:30.410 --> 03:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
um and also things that have happened
 
03:23:32.570 --> 03:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
like whether you see an ad in a
 
03:23:34.849 --> 03:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
newspaper clipping Those ads in
 
03:23:36.710 --> 03:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
newspapers that if they don't if they
 
03:23:38.870 --> 03:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
haven't registered and Report reported
 
03:23:40.490 --> 03:23:40.500 align:start position:0%
and spent money in in those
 
03:23:41.630 --> 03:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
advertisements because I think it's
 
03:23:43.250 --> 03:23:43.260 align:start position:0%
important for
 
03:23:45.229 --> 03:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
our political discourse to know who's
 
03:23:50.990 --> 03:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.330 --> 03:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative quilly thank you Mr
 
03:23:53.340 --> 03:23:54.590 align:start position:0%
representative quilly thank you Mr
chairman

03:23:54.590 --> 03:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:23:57.170 --> 03:23:57.180 align:start position:0%
how would this apply to an organization
 
03:23:59.870 --> 03:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
or a person who was based outside of New
 
03:24:01.790 --> 03:24:01.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and had no Presence at all in
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in your opinion how would
 
03:24:04.670 --> 03:24:04.680 align:start position:0%
that apply
 
03:24:07.790 --> 03:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
well our our disclosure law says your
 
03:24:10.250 --> 03:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
Treasurer must be from New Hampshire so
 
03:24:11.870 --> 03:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
groups National groups that are spending
 
03:24:13.910 --> 03:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
money outside do
 
03:24:16.429 --> 03:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
ask for the treasurer to be from New
 
03:24:18.110 --> 03:24:18.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's a lot of groups you
 
03:24:18.120 --> 03:24:18.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so there's a lot of groups you
see

03:24:18.950 --> 03:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
see
 
03:24:21.950 --> 03:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
with a New Hampshire treasure there our
 
03:24:24.050 --> 03:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
law I believe requires your Treasurer to
 
03:24:25.790 --> 03:24:25.800 align:start position:0%
be from New Hampshire so we see a lot of
 
03:24:27.830 --> 03:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
national groups that have Treasures in
 
03:24:29.809 --> 03:24:29.819 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for State male not for
 
03:24:33.170 --> 03:24:33.180 align:start position:0%
federal mail this is for State male
 
03:24:35.330 --> 03:24:35.340 align:start position:0%
um they do ask for the treasure to be in
 
03:24:37.790 --> 03:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire and we do see a lot
 
03:24:39.349 --> 03:24:39.359 align:start position:0%
of groups that have New Hampshire
 
03:24:39.359 --> 03:24:41.450 align:start position:0%
of groups that have New Hampshire
treasurers

03:24:41.450 --> 03:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
treasurers
 
03:24:43.610 --> 03:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
some of them are the same person it's
 
03:24:45.469 --> 03:24:45.479 align:start position:0%
really fun when you're like oh they've
 
03:24:47.030 --> 03:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
just asked the same person to be the
 
03:24:51.650 --> 03:24:51.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:54.290 --> 03:24:54.300 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
03:25:00.889 --> 03:25:00.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:14.110 --> 03:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:16.130 --> 03:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:25:17.570 --> 03:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
committee appreciate the opportunity to
 
03:25:19.070 --> 03:25:19.080 align:start position:0%
speak here today my name is Greg Moore I
 
03:25:20.510 --> 03:25:20.520 align:start position:0%
am the state director for Americans for
 
03:25:22.969 --> 03:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
Prosperity and I'm here to testify in
 
03:25:25.910 --> 03:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
opposition to house bill 195.
 
03:25:27.650 --> 03:25:27.660 align:start position:0%
I will say this I've now been in this
 
03:25:29.090 --> 03:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
role for 10 years and I have spent
 
03:25:31.130 --> 03:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
countless countless hours spending time
 
03:25:33.410 --> 03:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
with our in-house counsel outside
 
03:25:35.570 --> 03:25:35.580 align:start position:0%
Council understanding compliance laws
 
03:25:37.309 --> 03:25:37.319 align:start position:0%
and I think those are some things that
 
03:25:39.050 --> 03:25:39.060 align:start position:0%
are really important to understand
 
03:25:41.210 --> 03:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
there are basically five types of
 
03:25:43.250 --> 03:25:43.260 align:start position:0%
communication political communication
 
03:25:45.170 --> 03:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
that are sort of recognized from a legal
 
03:25:46.729 --> 03:25:46.739 align:start position:0%
perspective the first is was called
 
03:25:49.250 --> 03:25:49.260 align:start position:0%
voter and issue education
 
03:25:50.450 --> 03:25:50.460 align:start position:0%
and that could be anything from
 
03:25:54.530 --> 03:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
legislative scorecards to uh these uh
 
03:25:58.010 --> 03:25:58.020 align:start position:0%
voter guides let's say citizens count uh
 
03:26:00.349 --> 03:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
balladopedia other groups like that
 
03:26:02.570 --> 03:26:02.580 align:start position:0%
this is just information not asking
 
03:26:04.190 --> 03:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
anything of the voter making no ask of
 
03:26:06.349 --> 03:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
the voter just pushing information now
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
that information May well come from the
 
03:26:10.370 --> 03:26:10.380 align:start position:0%
perspective of that organization but
 
03:26:12.769 --> 03:26:12.779 align:start position:0%
it's still it's still uh not asking
 
03:26:15.769 --> 03:26:15.779 align:start position:0%
anyone to do anything the second second
 
03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
group is called direct lobbying and
 
03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's when someone with an orange badge
 
03:26:22.309 --> 03:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
like this comes and talks comes talks
 
03:26:24.590 --> 03:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
directly to you or sends you materials
 
03:26:26.990 --> 03:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
or or whatnot uh the third group of
 
03:26:28.309 --> 03:26:28.319 align:start position:0%
political communication is what's known
 
03:26:29.750 --> 03:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
as Grassroots lobbying that's where an
 
03:26:32.090 --> 03:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
organization would reach out to a
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
legislators constituents and ask them
 
03:26:36.290 --> 03:26:36.300 align:start position:0%
encourage them to take a position on a
 
03:26:38.210 --> 03:26:38.220 align:start position:0%
certain piece of legislation one of the
 
03:26:39.769 --> 03:26:39.779 align:start position:0%
factors of that is it always includes
 
03:26:41.389 --> 03:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
What's called the call to action at the
 
03:26:44.210 --> 03:26:44.220 align:start position:0%
end meaning call call Representative so
 
03:26:46.250 --> 03:26:46.260 align:start position:0%
and so and and at this number and tell
 
03:26:48.469 --> 03:26:48.479 align:start position:0%
them to support X bill
 
03:26:51.410 --> 03:26:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh then the last two groups or groups
 
03:26:53.389 --> 03:26:53.399 align:start position:0%
that are basically decided by case law
 
03:26:54.889 --> 03:26:54.899 align:start position:0%
the first one being is called Express
 
03:26:57.889 --> 03:26:57.899 align:start position:0%
advocacy uh that was basically put in
 
03:27:00.110 --> 03:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
play by Buckley vivallejo and that
 
03:27:03.830 --> 03:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
Express advocacy is uh is basically what
 
03:27:05.389 --> 03:27:05.399 align:start position:0%
was described as using the magic words
 
03:27:08.090 --> 03:27:08.100 align:start position:0%
vote for elect send someone to send
 
03:27:09.950 --> 03:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
someone a conquer don't send don't send
 
03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:11.520 align:start position:0%
someone to Washington that's what's
 
03:27:13.610 --> 03:27:13.620 align:start position:0%
called Express advocacy and then there's
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
What's called the functional equivalent
 
03:27:17.389 --> 03:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
of Express advocacy that doesn't use any
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
of the magic words but speaks to uh a
 
03:27:23.570 --> 03:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
candidate's a candidate's fitness or
 
03:27:25.090 --> 03:27:25.100 align:start position:0%
temperament for office
 
03:27:28.670 --> 03:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
ability to serve in office
 
03:27:32.150 --> 03:27:32.160 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's that's the bumper
 
03:27:33.290 --> 03:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
stickers you were talking about would be
 
03:27:34.429 --> 03:27:34.439 align:start position:0%
the functional equivalence of Express
 
03:27:36.889 --> 03:27:36.899 align:start position:0%
advocacy so those are the five buckets
 
03:27:39.290 --> 03:27:39.300 align:start position:0%
that political communication resides in
 
03:27:42.349 --> 03:27:42.359 align:start position:0%
and as far as regulation
 
03:27:45.590 --> 03:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh this the courts have given have given
 
03:27:47.090 --> 03:27:47.100 align:start position:0%
States broad ability to regulate
 
03:27:49.070 --> 03:27:49.080 align:start position:0%
lobbyists like making me wear this
 
03:27:51.349 --> 03:27:51.359 align:start position:0%
orange badge right now even though even
 
03:27:52.670 --> 03:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
though technically this isn't lobbying
 
03:27:53.870 --> 03:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm doing right now this isn't
 
03:27:56.330 --> 03:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
lobbying that's those it's more for
 
03:27:57.830 --> 03:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
those private conversations is what
 
03:28:00.229 --> 03:28:00.239 align:start position:0%
lobbying is under RSA 15.
 
03:28:02.630 --> 03:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
the express advocacy we regulate under
 
03:28:05.450 --> 03:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
664 uh that's the majority when
 
03:28:06.889 --> 03:28:06.899 align:start position:0%
someone's actually saying vote for vote
 
03:28:10.010 --> 03:28:10.020 align:start position:0%
against that's covered under 664. the
 
03:28:10.020 --> 03:28:11.510 align:start position:0%
against that's covered under 664. the
original

03:28:11.510 --> 03:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
original
 
03:28:15.349 --> 03:28:15.359 align:start position:0%
of this uh Roman 11 Roman 12 we have
 
03:28:15.359 --> 03:28:16.190 align:start position:0%
of this uh Roman 11 Roman 12 we have
here

03:28:16.190 --> 03:28:16.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:28:18.889 --> 03:28:18.899 align:start position:0%
uh under defining political advocacy
 
03:28:21.229 --> 03:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
organization is where in the past was
 
03:28:22.729 --> 03:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
swept up the functional equivalent of
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
Express advocacy
 
03:28:26.269 --> 03:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
that leaves the two other buckets one is
 
03:28:29.110 --> 03:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
the Grassroots lobbying and the other is
 
03:28:31.910 --> 03:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
voter and issue information
 
03:28:34.910 --> 03:28:34.920 align:start position:0%
and the courts have a mixed a mixed view
 
03:28:36.650 --> 03:28:36.660 align:start position:0%
on the ability to regulate Grassroots
 
03:28:39.950 --> 03:28:39.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying as a prior prior uh person
 
03:28:42.830 --> 03:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
mentioned prior speaker mentioned uh the
 
03:28:44.750 --> 03:28:44.760 align:start position:0%
First District Court authorized
 
03:28:46.130 --> 03:28:46.140 align:start position:0%
legislation symbol of this for the state
 
03:28:49.250 --> 03:28:49.260 align:start position:0%
of Maine however more recently uh courts
 
03:28:50.630 --> 03:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey and New York struck down
 
03:28:52.550 --> 03:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
legislation similar to this so it's a
 
03:28:54.469 --> 03:28:54.479 align:start position:0%
sort of a mixed mixed background and if
 
03:28:55.790 --> 03:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
you're looking at the most recent cases
 
03:28:57.229 --> 03:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
it's against the idea of trying to
 
03:28:59.510 --> 03:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
regulate Grassroots lobbying and then
 
03:29:00.889 --> 03:29:00.899 align:start position:0%
there's the final bucket which is voter
 
03:29:00.899 --> 03:29:01.870 align:start position:0%
there's the final bucket which is voter
initial

03:29:01.870 --> 03:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
initial
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
voter and issue information and the
 
03:29:06.110 --> 03:29:06.120 align:start position:0%
courts have been pretty clear that that
 
03:29:08.510 --> 03:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
is fully protected by free speech and
 
03:29:10.910 --> 03:29:10.920 align:start position:0%
that that can't well be regulated the
 
03:29:12.290 --> 03:29:12.300 align:start position:0%
problem with the legislation you see at
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
hand is it sweeps all five of those
 
03:29:16.370 --> 03:29:16.380 align:start position:0%
under one bucket for a discrete time
 
03:29:18.349 --> 03:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
period but it sweeps it all up into one
 
03:29:21.469 --> 03:29:21.479 align:start position:0%
bucket including everything from from uh
 
03:29:23.210 --> 03:29:23.220 align:start position:0%
people going and I would imagine
 
03:29:25.010 --> 03:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
citizens count for example would have to
 
03:29:26.269 --> 03:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
register as a political advocacy
 
03:29:27.769 --> 03:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
organization because I'm sure they spend
 
03:29:29.750 --> 03:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
more than 2500 over the Arc of the year
 
03:29:31.070 --> 03:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
and they do mentions candidates name
 
03:29:33.229 --> 03:29:33.239 align:start position:0%
within the last 60 days
 
03:29:35.269 --> 03:29:35.279 align:start position:0%
now who is doing
 
03:29:37.370 --> 03:29:37.380 align:start position:0%
that type of voter and voter and issue
 
03:29:38.690 --> 03:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
information in the last 60 days as well
 
03:29:40.010 --> 03:29:40.020 align:start position:0%
as a lot of groups of League of Women
 
03:29:42.170 --> 03:29:42.180 align:start position:0%
Voters again not telling you who to vote
 
03:29:44.389 --> 03:29:44.399 align:start position:0%
for not calling anyone names not
 
03:29:46.070 --> 03:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
encouraging you to vote for or against a
 
03:29:48.110 --> 03:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
specific issue uh there are a lot of
 
03:29:50.389 --> 03:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
groups out there most of those most of
 
03:29:51.889 --> 03:29:51.899 align:start position:0%
those groups are are groups that are
 
03:29:54.590 --> 03:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
pretty well open you know so
 
03:29:56.389 --> 03:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
so you know I think you see a lot of
 
03:29:58.010 --> 03:29:58.020 align:start position:0%
legislative scorecards come out close to
 
03:30:00.410 --> 03:30:00.420 align:start position:0%
elections that's often a common thing as
 
03:30:02.750 --> 03:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
well as as well as a lot of other
 
03:30:04.969 --> 03:30:04.979 align:start position:0%
information talking about
 
03:30:04.979 --> 03:30:05.650 align:start position:0%
information talking about
um

03:30:05.650 --> 03:30:05.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:07.729 --> 03:30:07.739 align:start position:0%
information that might identify
 
03:30:09.349 --> 03:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
candidate so saying something about
 
03:30:11.450 --> 03:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu our governor sununa's
 
03:30:13.910 --> 03:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
proposal would do this and that would be
 
03:30:15.530 --> 03:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
vote information but that too would be
 
03:30:18.170 --> 03:30:18.180 align:start position:0%
swept up and that is why that is why at
 
03:30:19.190 --> 03:30:19.200 align:start position:0%
least in the New York and New Jersey
 
03:30:21.050 --> 03:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
cases this legislation was viewed as
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
unconstitutionally overbroad
 
03:30:26.510 --> 03:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh what is Grassroots lobbying within
 
03:30:28.729 --> 03:30:28.739 align:start position:0%
the last 60 days well typically
 
03:30:30.530 --> 03:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
typically as you know there's not a lot
 
03:30:32.150 --> 03:30:32.160 align:start position:0%
of legislation that takes place in the
 
03:30:33.950 --> 03:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
last 60 days before our primary general
 
03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
election but some things do happen
 
03:30:37.130 --> 03:30:37.140 align:start position:0%
within New Hampshire government we have
 
03:30:40.370 --> 03:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
veto sessions we have uh nominations
 
03:30:42.290 --> 03:30:42.300 align:start position:0%
before the executive Council we have
 
03:30:43.910 --> 03:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
contracts that come before the executive
 
03:30:46.490 --> 03:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
Council and if a group of people wanted
 
03:30:49.010 --> 03:30:49.020 align:start position:0%
to opine on that particular issue I'll
 
03:30:50.929 --> 03:30:50.939 align:start position:0%
give for example there was a I say the
 
03:30:53.929 --> 03:30:53.939 align:start position:0%
most high profile one last year was the
 
03:30:55.849 --> 03:30:55.859 align:start position:0%
issue of landfills there was a veto
 
03:30:57.950 --> 03:30:57.960 align:start position:0%
override I know some people have looks
 
03:30:59.530 --> 03:30:59.540 align:start position:0%
like they saw some scars from that one
 
03:31:02.510 --> 03:31:02.520 align:start position:0%
but but that was that was an issue where
 
03:31:04.790 --> 03:31:04.800 align:start position:0%
I think both sides spent over twenty
 
03:31:07.130 --> 03:31:07.140 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars they were weighing
 
03:31:08.870 --> 03:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
in and they were encouraging people to
 
03:31:10.610 --> 03:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
reach out to specific in that case
 
03:31:13.190 --> 03:31:13.200 align:start position:0%
Senators to support the override of the
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
veto so this this bill would pull in
 
03:31:17.450 --> 03:31:17.460 align:start position:0%
groups like that a lot of these groups
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
are fairly unsophisticated Community
 
03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:20.210 align:start position:0%
are fairly unsophisticated Community
groups

03:31:20.210 --> 03:31:20.220 align:start position:0%
groups
 
03:31:21.710 --> 03:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
I think you're going to have a lot of
 
03:31:23.450 --> 03:31:23.460 align:start position:0%
non-compliance If This Were to take
 
03:31:25.849 --> 03:31:25.859 align:start position:0%
place you groups that just have no idea
 
03:31:27.769 --> 03:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
that this would apply to them uh
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
particularly particularly folks who are
 
03:31:31.070 --> 03:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
pushing out voter guides or things like
 
03:31:32.570 --> 03:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't appreciate that the
 
03:31:34.130 --> 03:31:34.140 align:start position:0%
supplies to them and it would be it
 
03:31:35.630 --> 03:31:35.640 align:start position:0%
would be pulling in a lot of those folks
 
03:31:38.210 --> 03:31:38.220 align:start position:0%
uh in addition to that in addition to
 
03:31:39.769 --> 03:31:39.779 align:start position:0%
that uh one of the things that's really
 
03:31:42.710 --> 03:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
odd about this legislation is it strikes
 
03:31:44.330 --> 03:31:44.340 align:start position:0%
the regulation of the functional
 
03:31:46.309 --> 03:31:46.319 align:start position:0%
equivalence of Express advocacy but for
 
03:31:48.830 --> 03:31:48.840 align:start position:0%
60 days before the primary in a general
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
so for example the bumper sticker that
 
03:31:53.690 --> 03:31:53.700 align:start position:0%
rep that the chairman mentioned that
 
03:31:55.610 --> 03:31:55.620 align:start position:0%
bumper sticker
 
03:31:57.950 --> 03:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
they'd be required to uh under current
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
law when if they hit five thousand
 
03:32:01.969 --> 03:32:01.979 align:start position:0%
dollars of spending they'd be they'd be
 
03:32:03.530 --> 03:32:03.540 align:start position:0%
required to register as a political
 
03:32:05.389 --> 03:32:05.399 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization at any point in a
 
03:32:06.650 --> 03:32:06.660 align:start position:0%
cycle if they want to start calling
 
03:32:08.990 --> 03:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
someone names or talk about their their
 
03:32:12.370 --> 03:32:12.380 align:start position:0%
Fitness or uh quality of their candidacy
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
uh or Fitness to hold office but uh but
 
03:32:18.650 --> 03:32:18.660 align:start position:0%
at this bill would stop regulating the
 
03:32:19.729 --> 03:32:19.739 align:start position:0%
functional equivalence of Express
 
03:32:22.370 --> 03:32:22.380 align:start position:0%
advocacy but for the last 60 days so if
 
03:32:23.690 --> 03:32:23.700 align:start position:0%
someone were running a campaign for
 
03:32:25.550 --> 03:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
governor and they wanted to just
 
03:32:27.349 --> 03:32:27.359 align:start position:0%
basically make all sorts of wild
 
03:32:29.510 --> 03:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
accusations if they're in a primary or
 
03:32:30.950 --> 03:32:30.960 align:start position:0%
if they don't have a primary they just
 
03:32:32.030 --> 03:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
want to start making all sorts of wild
 
03:32:33.469 --> 03:32:33.479 align:start position:0%
accusations that could go completely
 
03:32:34.969 --> 03:32:34.979 align:start position:0%
unregulated or another group that's
 
03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
trying to support a candidate for
 
03:32:38.210 --> 03:32:38.220 align:start position:0%
governor could make all sorts of wild
 
03:32:40.130 --> 03:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
accusations that would have no no
 
03:32:41.929 --> 03:32:41.939 align:start position:0%
responsibility to register with the
 
03:32:43.969 --> 03:32:43.979 align:start position:0%
state whatsoever but for the last 60
 
03:32:46.250 --> 03:32:46.260 align:start position:0%
days before primary in a general so I
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
think there are a lot of concerns that
 
03:32:49.910 --> 03:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
we have with this legislation not the
 
03:32:52.250 --> 03:32:52.260 align:start position:0%
least of which are some of the impacts
 
03:32:54.590 --> 03:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
it would have on small groups that
 
03:32:54.600 --> 03:32:55.370 align:start position:0%
it would have on small groups that
really

03:32:55.370 --> 03:32:55.380 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:32:58.010 --> 03:32:58.020 align:start position:0%
are pretty unsophisticated uh could
 
03:32:59.990 --> 03:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
potentially be set up for
 
03:33:02.030 --> 03:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
for getting let's say let's say a group
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
that wants to weigh in on I know usually
 
03:33:05.929 --> 03:33:05.939 align:start position:0%
it's late July early Late July that for
 
03:33:07.490 --> 03:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
example Planned Parenthood
 
03:33:09.469 --> 03:33:09.479 align:start position:0%
there the the Family Planning contracts
 
03:33:11.090 --> 03:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
come up before the council that would
 
03:33:13.190 --> 03:33:13.200 align:start position:0%
fall within the 60-day window so
 
03:33:14.510 --> 03:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
suddenly they would have to register if
 
03:33:15.769 --> 03:33:15.779 align:start position:0%
they wanted to say call Executive
 
03:33:18.110 --> 03:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
counselor so and so and ask them to
 
03:33:20.330 --> 03:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
support these contracts though that's
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
that's the type of stuff you'd be
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
pulling in if you were to pass this
 
03:33:25.370 --> 03:33:25.380 align:start position:0%
legislation and I think that now a group
 
03:33:26.750 --> 03:33:26.760 align:start position:0%
like Planned Parenthood would be fine
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
but maybe think of some of the smaller
 
03:33:30.050 --> 03:33:30.060 align:start position:0%
health centers that maybe that maybe
 
03:33:31.729 --> 03:33:31.739 align:start position:0%
don't have the type of operation behind
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
them they might miss out on something
 
03:33:34.790 --> 03:33:34.800 align:start position:0%
like this and suddenly be breaking the
 
03:33:36.410 --> 03:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
law so those are some of the concerns we
 
03:33:38.590 --> 03:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
have but I at this point I'd be happy to
 
03:33:43.370 --> 03:33:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:45.190 --> 03:33:45.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:33:48.170 --> 03:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
so in my County I'm not going to name
 
03:33:50.870 --> 03:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
the town but there was a brutal gloves
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
off throw down over a warrant article to
 
03:33:56.809 --> 03:33:56.819 align:start position:0%
build a new community center so if 25
 
03:33:58.729 --> 03:33:58.739 align:start position:0%
people got together and each kicked in
 
03:34:01.190 --> 03:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
100 bucks to send out a mailer
 
03:34:04.070 --> 03:34:04.080 align:start position:0%
would this make them after register and
 
03:34:06.950 --> 03:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
report I don't believe I believe this
 
03:34:09.410 --> 03:34:09.420 align:start position:0%
applies to state only
 
03:34:11.150 --> 03:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
um you'd have to I I'd encourage you to
 
03:34:12.530 --> 03:34:12.540 align:start position:0%
reach out to the Department of Justice
 
03:34:14.510 --> 03:34:14.520 align:start position:0%
and ask that question
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm gonna I'm an engineer by
 
03:34:20.269 --> 03:34:20.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:21.710 --> 03:34:21.720 align:start position:0%
representative Barry
 
03:34:23.630 --> 03:34:23.640 align:start position:0%
you're here representing Americans for
 
03:34:23.640 --> 03:34:24.950 align:start position:0%
you're here representing Americans for
Prosperity

03:34:24.950 --> 03:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
Prosperity
 
03:34:26.450 --> 03:34:26.460 align:start position:0%
um would that how would this legislation
 
03:34:29.570 --> 03:34:29.580 align:start position:0%
or would it impact your group at all
 
03:34:32.150 --> 03:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
not per se I mean we
 
03:34:34.190 --> 03:34:34.200 align:start position:0%
the only time we've weighed in on vetoes
 
03:34:36.830 --> 03:34:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh has been in on budgets which tend not
 
03:34:38.990 --> 03:34:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be near elections it's the the odd
 
03:34:39.950 --> 03:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
number here
 
03:34:41.510 --> 03:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh so it really doesn't have an impact
 
03:34:43.670 --> 03:34:43.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that that there might not
 
03:34:45.050 --> 03:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
be a time where we might want to weigh
 
03:34:47.269 --> 03:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
in on a veto one way or the other or
 
03:34:50.269 --> 03:34:50.279 align:start position:0%
that uh I think the biggest impact it
 
03:34:53.750 --> 03:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
would have directly for our organization
 
03:34:56.630 --> 03:34:56.640 align:start position:0%
is uh depending on whether or not we
 
03:34:58.729 --> 03:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
could just put it under our
 
03:35:01.370 --> 03:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
see we have a political committee we
 
03:35:02.570 --> 03:35:02.580 align:start position:0%
have to have a political committee and a
 
03:35:04.490 --> 03:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization then
 
03:35:06.110 --> 03:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
that effect for us is it it might
 
03:35:07.910 --> 03:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
accelerate how soon we get our our
 
03:35:10.370 --> 03:35:10.380 align:start position:0%
legislative scorecard out
 
03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
um so you know just so we don't have to
 
03:35:13.250 --> 03:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
create another committee and go through
 
03:35:15.410 --> 03:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
that compliance process and in two
 
03:35:16.670 --> 03:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
different silos
 
03:35:20.389 --> 03:35:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh I think probably taking my I'm here
 
03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
today representing Americans for
 
03:35:22.610 --> 03:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
Prosperity but I also happen to be the
 
03:35:23.750 --> 03:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
state director for Americans for
 
03:35:26.630 --> 03:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
Prosperity Foundation uh an AFP
 
03:35:28.429 --> 03:35:28.439 align:start position:0%
Foundation was the organization that
 
03:35:30.050 --> 03:35:30.060 align:start position:0%
brought litigation into New Jersey case
 
03:35:31.910 --> 03:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
it overturned a similar law in Federal
 
03:35:33.710 --> 03:35:33.720 align:start position:0%
District Court
 
03:35:37.610 --> 03:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
um I I suspect uh AFP Foundation might
 
03:35:39.469 --> 03:35:39.479 align:start position:0%
look closely at this legislation in
 
03:35:44.269 --> 03:35:44.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:46.729 --> 03:35:46.739 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
03:35:49.370 --> 03:35:49.380 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm gonna ask you the same
 
03:35:52.490 --> 03:35:52.500 align:start position:0%
similar question I asked um Miss sink
 
03:35:54.710 --> 03:35:54.720 align:start position:0%
um publicly distributed
 
03:35:57.290 --> 03:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
um with the supply to like when the
 
03:35:58.790 --> 03:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
union leader endorses somebody for
 
03:36:00.769 --> 03:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
governor would they then because that's
 
03:36:02.450 --> 03:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
publicly distributed I'm assuming the
 
03:36:04.250 --> 03:36:04.260 align:start position:0%
union leaders distribution costs more
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
than 2500 bucks
 
03:36:08.330 --> 03:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
um it's an endorsement Express advocacy
 
03:36:10.250 --> 03:36:10.260 align:start position:0%
for a candidate would that would they
 
03:36:13.010 --> 03:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
didn't have to form a political obvious
 
03:36:15.889 --> 03:36:15.899 align:start position:0%
organization in report
 
03:36:15.899 --> 03:36:17.630 align:start position:0%
organization in report
ah

03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
ah
 
03:36:18.950 --> 03:36:18.960 align:start position:0%
you raise a great question because
 
03:36:20.030 --> 03:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
you're bumping up against the
 
03:36:22.670 --> 03:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
Constitutional uh provision
 
03:36:23.929 --> 03:36:23.939 align:start position:0%
um that's the challenge because
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
technically this is so broad it could
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
bring in a newscast that mentions the
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
candidate's name because the news spends
 
03:36:31.309 --> 03:36:31.319 align:start position:0%
more than twenty five hundred dollars a
 
03:36:32.809 --> 03:36:32.819 align:start position:0%
year and as it turns out they tend to
 
03:36:34.250 --> 03:36:34.260 align:start position:0%
mention candidates names within the last
 
03:36:35.870 --> 03:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
60 days
 
03:36:35.880 --> 03:36:36.650 align:start position:0%
60 days
um

03:36:36.650 --> 03:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:39.170 --> 03:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
and again that that's why I I'd
 
03:36:42.229 --> 03:36:42.239 align:start position:0%
encourage I'd encourage the uh committee
 
03:36:43.790 --> 03:36:43.800 align:start position:0%
to to reach out to the Department of
 
03:36:46.130 --> 03:36:46.140 align:start position:0%
Justice to figure out if this law were
 
03:36:48.469 --> 03:36:48.479 align:start position:0%
to pass how Department of Justice might
 
03:36:50.030 --> 03:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
try to enforce it or if they would even
 
03:36:52.190 --> 03:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
if they would enforce it because because
 
03:36:54.590 --> 03:36:54.600 align:start position:0%
of some of the the challenges uh like
 
03:36:56.450 --> 03:36:56.460 align:start position:0%
you just mentioned we've seen scenarios
 
03:36:58.690 --> 03:36:58.700 align:start position:0%
like that
 
03:37:02.210 --> 03:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.889 --> 03:37:09.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:21.290 --> 03:37:21.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:23.450 --> 03:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
hello everyone again Aaron Hennessey I
 
03:37:25.550 --> 03:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
am the deputy secretary of state and I
 
03:37:27.410 --> 03:37:27.420 align:start position:0%
am here to just offer some information
 
03:37:29.690 --> 03:37:29.700 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
03:37:33.410 --> 03:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
um just in general our office when when
 
03:37:35.090 --> 03:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
03:37:37.190 --> 03:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
um makes changes to election laws we
 
03:37:39.050 --> 03:37:39.060 align:start position:0%
like to see them clean things up and
 
03:37:40.849 --> 03:37:40.859 align:start position:0%
just make them easier to read especially
 
03:37:42.590 --> 03:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
for you folks I know we gave you a bunch
 
03:37:44.570 --> 03:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
of information
 
03:37:47.630 --> 03:37:47.640 align:start position:0%
um and the white and purple book is all
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
the election laws that we have in the
 
03:37:51.229 --> 03:37:51.239 align:start position:0%
state and I hope you finish that I can
 
03:37:52.849 --> 03:37:52.859 align:start position:0%
take questions on that right now too if
 
03:37:55.130 --> 03:37:55.140 align:start position:0%
you'd like but um I just want to point
 
03:37:58.490 --> 03:37:58.500 align:start position:0%
out that this bill in in my reading
 
03:38:00.110 --> 03:38:00.120 align:start position:0%
causes a little bit more confusion than
 
03:38:01.809 --> 03:38:01.819 align:start position:0%
it does clarification
 
03:38:06.349 --> 03:38:06.359 align:start position:0%
for example the reference to on line
 
03:38:10.309 --> 03:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
four to RSA 664 colon 2 comma
 
03:38:13.010 --> 03:38:13.020 align:start position:0%
three refers back to a political
 
03:38:16.130 --> 03:38:16.140 align:start position:0%
committee within the definition of a
 
03:38:18.950 --> 03:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
political advocacy organization and when
 
03:38:21.710 --> 03:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
you go when you go up and you read what
 
03:38:23.870 --> 03:38:23.880 align:start position:0%
a political committee is and when you go
 
03:38:27.950 --> 03:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
to the small D it also references a five
 
03:38:30.469 --> 03:38:30.479 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar amount so if this were
 
03:38:32.990 --> 03:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
to be passed as it is there would be a
 
03:38:35.210 --> 03:38:35.220 align:start position:0%
reference where there's five thousand
 
03:38:38.210 --> 03:38:38.220 align:start position:0%
dollars but there's also a 2500 and
 
03:38:40.130 --> 03:38:40.140 align:start position:0%
which amount is it that you're supposed
 
03:38:43.190 --> 03:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
to follow so just some confusion there
 
03:38:46.030 --> 03:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
when reading what what's the intent
 
03:38:48.110 --> 03:38:48.120 align:start position:0%
confusion between what the political
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization is definition wise
 
03:38:54.410 --> 03:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
versus a political committee to
 
03:38:57.170 --> 03:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
representative Barry's point the um in a
 
03:38:58.910 --> 03:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year
 
03:39:01.910 --> 03:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
um being in there but then down below on
 
03:39:04.610 --> 03:39:04.620 align:start position:0%
line 11 60 days prior to a general
 
03:39:04.620 --> 03:39:06.650 align:start position:0%
line 11 60 days prior to a general
election

03:39:06.650 --> 03:39:06.660 align:start position:0%
election
 
03:39:08.269 --> 03:39:08.279 align:start position:0%
um I'm not from the Department of
 
03:39:10.130 --> 03:39:10.140 align:start position:0%
Justice but I have worked with them a
 
03:39:11.750 --> 03:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
bunch I do recommend reaching out to
 
03:39:16.429 --> 03:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
them because the law the words online
 
03:39:19.490 --> 03:39:19.500 align:start position:0%
10 and 11 publicly distributed
 
03:39:22.429 --> 03:39:22.439 align:start position:0%
um does that mean that on 61 days before
 
03:39:24.469 --> 03:39:24.479 align:start position:0%
the election if I drop off a bunch of
 
03:39:27.170 --> 03:39:27.180 align:start position:0%
mailings at the post office that's when
 
03:39:30.050 --> 03:39:30.060 align:start position:0%
it was publicly distributed but
 
03:39:33.050 --> 03:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
57 days before the election when a voter
 
03:39:35.030 --> 03:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
gets that mailing and they call US
 
03:39:36.650 --> 03:39:36.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice because it doesn't
 
03:39:38.630 --> 03:39:38.640 align:start position:0%
follow this law how are they going to
 
03:39:40.550 --> 03:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
interpret that did it break the law did
 
03:39:42.530 --> 03:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
it not break the law will it cause
 
03:39:44.210 --> 03:39:44.220 align:start position:0%
unnecessary confusion for the people
 
03:39:47.210 --> 03:39:47.220 align:start position:0%
getting the information for those trying
 
03:39:49.030 --> 03:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
to send it out
 
03:39:53.389 --> 03:39:53.399 align:start position:0%
and in the political committee section
 
03:39:56.330 --> 03:39:56.340 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it has just a reference to a
 
03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
full calendar year it doesn't make any
 
03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
reference to the 60 days before so just
 
03:40:03.769 --> 03:40:03.779 align:start position:0%
some inconsistencies that this creates
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
instead of clarifying up some
 
03:40:06.120 --> 03:40:07.610 align:start position:0%
instead of clarifying up some
information

03:40:07.610 --> 03:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:40:09.469 --> 03:40:09.479 align:start position:0%
I think that's it
 
03:40:11.330 --> 03:40:11.340 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions
 
03:40:13.490 --> 03:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
thank you and I admire your optimism at
 
03:40:15.889 --> 03:40:15.899 align:start position:0%
the mail we'll get there in four days
 
03:40:18.530 --> 03:40:18.540 align:start position:0%
not in the North Country questions from
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
03:40:23.750 --> 03:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you thanks
 
03:40:46.729 --> 03:40:46.739 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:46.739 --> 03:41:05.590 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:09.410 --> 03:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
sheet is four in favor one against uh
 
03:41:10.910 --> 03:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
closest public hearing and house bill
 
03:41:10.920 --> 03:41:21.170 align:start position:0%
closest public hearing and house bill
195.

03:41:21.170 --> 03:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:25.670 --> 03:41:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:29.210 --> 03:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
this guy never got here so but he's on
 
03:42:12.830 --> 03:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
all right we will open the public
 
03:42:18.050 --> 03:42:18.060 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 196. welcome
 
03:42:19.910 --> 03:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative Lane and I can't find
 
03:42:21.469 --> 03:42:21.479 align:start position:0%
your card
 
03:42:26.389 --> 03:42:26.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:28.670 --> 03:42:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm representative Lane and I'm
 
03:42:32.450 --> 03:42:32.460 align:start position:0%
from Ward 2 in Concord and thank you uh
 
03:42:34.969 --> 03:42:34.979 align:start position:0%
for considering this bill
 
03:42:37.550 --> 03:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
um again this is a campaign finance bill
 
03:42:41.030 --> 03:42:41.040 align:start position:0%
that's basically trying to uh improve
 
03:42:43.849 --> 03:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
our laws our existing laws which as we
 
03:42:46.910 --> 03:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
just heard are a bit confusing and
 
03:42:46.920 --> 03:42:48.469 align:start position:0%
just heard are a bit confusing and
um

03:42:48.469 --> 03:42:48.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:50.690 --> 03:42:50.700 align:start position:0%
and to look at what other states have
 
03:42:54.349 --> 03:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
done in terms of transparency
 
03:42:57.050 --> 03:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
the goal is to make everything as
 
03:42:59.570 --> 03:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible and make it less
 
03:42:59.580 --> 03:43:01.190 align:start position:0%
transparent as possible and make it less
confusing

03:43:01.190 --> 03:43:01.200 align:start position:0%
confusing
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
um so one of the ways of doing that is
 
03:43:07.550 --> 03:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
to set up a committee or commission my
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
original bill that you all have set up a
 
03:43:13.849 --> 03:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
commission I was told that it would be
 
03:43:16.550 --> 03:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
more likely to pass if I changed it to
 
03:43:18.650 --> 03:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
committee I don't really care whether
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
it's a commission or a committee so I
 
03:43:24.170 --> 03:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
passed out to all of you when you came
 
03:43:25.670 --> 03:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
back from lunch you should have this
 
03:43:30.110 --> 03:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
unapproved amendment to 196. and my
 
03:43:32.330 --> 03:43:32.340 align:start position:0%
thought was and basically what this bill
 
03:43:34.490 --> 03:43:34.500 align:start position:0%
does is everywhere the word commission
 
03:43:37.670 --> 03:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
pops up it substitutes committee so
 
03:43:41.090 --> 03:43:41.100 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the amendment
 
03:43:43.610 --> 03:43:43.620 align:start position:0%
one of the recommendations of the
 
03:43:45.349 --> 03:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State special committee on
 
03:43:47.030 --> 03:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
voter confidence
 
03:43:50.330 --> 03:43:50.340 align:start position:0%
is for the legislature to review the
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
body of election law
 
03:43:55.250 --> 03:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
and this bill would do so related to
 
03:43:58.190 --> 03:43:58.200 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance law it doesn't tackle
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
all the election laws just the campaign
 
03:44:01.910 --> 03:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
Finance laws
 
03:44:04.490 --> 03:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
now my hope is that the committee would
 
03:44:07.389 --> 03:44:07.399 align:start position:0%
speak with campaign Finance reform
 
03:44:07.399 --> 03:44:09.010 align:start position:0%
speak with campaign Finance reform
Advocates

03:44:09.010 --> 03:44:09.020 align:start position:0%
Advocates
 
03:44:12.110 --> 03:44:12.120 align:start position:0%
review other states law talk with the
 
03:44:13.450 --> 03:44:13.460 align:start position:0%
AG's office
 
03:44:16.570 --> 03:44:16.580 align:start position:0%
and anyone they think we should talk to
 
03:44:18.889 --> 03:44:18.899 align:start position:0%
there are some previous studies and
 
03:44:20.630 --> 03:44:20.640 align:start position:0%
committees that have looked at this in
 
03:44:22.010 --> 03:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
the past in New Hampshire and look at
 
03:44:22.020 --> 03:44:23.690 align:start position:0%
the past in New Hampshire and look at
that

03:44:23.690 --> 03:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:44:26.990 --> 03:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
um and then make recommendations so that
 
03:44:29.330 --> 03:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we can draft some legislation and
 
03:44:32.389 --> 03:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
consider it either next year or next
 
03:44:32.399 --> 03:44:33.830 align:start position:0%
consider it either next year or next
session

03:44:33.830 --> 03:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
session
 
03:44:37.670 --> 03:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
03:44:42.170 --> 03:44:42.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.670 --> 03:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:46.680 --> 03:44:54.830 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:44:54.830 --> 03:44:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.950 --> 03:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:06.050 --> 03:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:45:07.849 --> 03:45:07.859 align:start position:0%
um my name is Olivia Zink and I live in
 
03:45:09.530 --> 03:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
Franklin and I represent open democracy
 
03:45:09.540 --> 03:45:10.429 align:start position:0%
Franklin and I represent open democracy
action

03:45:10.429 --> 03:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
action
 
03:45:14.090 --> 03:45:14.100 align:start position:0%
we transparency is critical to our
 
03:45:16.610 --> 03:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
democracy being open and accountable
 
03:45:19.250 --> 03:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
having a study committee to study
 
03:45:21.110 --> 03:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance is a good start in
 
03:45:22.910 --> 03:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
improving our process
 
03:45:25.790 --> 03:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
if this stays a commission or becomes a
 
03:45:28.490 --> 03:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
committee I do hope that the legislature
 
03:45:30.469 --> 03:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
will seek the views of the Secretary of
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
State and the Attorney General because
 
03:45:33.650 --> 03:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
those were two appointed members and if
 
03:45:34.790 --> 03:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a committee it's only
 
03:45:37.990 --> 03:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislators but I do hope you will give
 
03:45:40.849 --> 03:45:40.859 align:start position:0%
the two agents or two you know the
 
03:45:41.990 --> 03:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office in the
 
03:45:43.849 --> 03:45:43.859 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice a chance to have a
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
voice when this committee had their
 
03:45:47.929 --> 03:45:47.939 align:start position:0%
organization day the Attorney General
 
03:45:49.849 --> 03:45:49.859 align:start position:0%
Ann Edwards said to you that there are
 
03:45:54.110 --> 03:45:54.120 align:start position:0%
1600 violations in 2020. I do think that
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea for us to look at those
 
03:45:59.150 --> 03:45:59.160 align:start position:0%
violations figure out what's happening
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
maybe this this committee would make a
 
03:46:03.830 --> 03:46:03.840 align:start position:0%
recommendation that the Secretary of
 
03:46:04.910 --> 03:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
State's office and the Attorney General
 
03:46:07.309 --> 03:46:07.319 align:start position:0%
hold a training so campaigns know how to
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
file their campaign Finance
 
03:46:12.469 --> 03:46:12.479 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me
 
03:46:12.479 --> 03:46:13.250 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me
um

03:46:13.250 --> 03:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:17.269 --> 03:46:17.279 align:start position:0%
the there has been a bill that had has
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
failed but uh wanted to make sure that
 
03:46:23.450 --> 03:46:23.460 align:start position:0%
the campaign Finance reports are legible
 
03:46:25.729 --> 03:46:25.739 align:start position:0%
I have seen that the many reports are
 
03:46:28.490 --> 03:46:28.500 align:start position:0%
not legible the Secretary of State's
 
03:46:28.500 --> 03:46:29.870 align:start position:0%
not legible the Secretary of State's
office

03:46:29.870 --> 03:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
office
 
03:46:33.650 --> 03:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
um once uh Karen Ladd once told me that
 
03:46:36.309 --> 03:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
her favorite way to get campaign Finance
 
03:46:38.870 --> 03:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
reports are when a candidate fills them
 
03:46:41.570 --> 03:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
out in pencil and faxes them so she
 
03:46:43.550 --> 03:46:43.560 align:start position:0%
can't read them and I said why can't you
 
03:46:46.490 --> 03:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
send them back and ask them to resubmit
 
03:46:48.530 --> 03:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
them so you can read them and she's like
 
03:46:50.150 --> 03:46:50.160 align:start position:0%
if that's not our job that's the
 
03:46:51.889 --> 03:46:51.899 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's job to enforce the
 
03:46:51.899 --> 03:46:52.729 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's job to enforce the
law

03:46:52.729 --> 03:46:52.739 align:start position:0%
law
 
03:46:54.710 --> 03:46:54.720 align:start position:0%
I do think that there might be a way to
 
03:46:56.210 --> 03:46:56.220 align:start position:0%
streamline that process so if somebody
 
03:46:58.010 --> 03:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
fills out a report that's incomplete
 
03:46:59.990 --> 03:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a signature missing
 
03:47:00.000 --> 03:47:01.010 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a signature missing
information

03:47:01.010 --> 03:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
information
 
03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
that there's a way for the Secretary of
 
03:47:04.790 --> 03:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
State's office to just say can you
 
03:47:07.929 --> 03:47:07.939 align:start position:0%
finish this information
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
followthemoney.org uh gives New
 
03:47:12.530 --> 03:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire an F on our campaign
 
03:47:16.429 --> 03:47:16.439 align:start position:0%
disclosure we rank 48 out of 50 states
 
03:47:19.670 --> 03:47:19.680 align:start position:0%
so I do think that this uh there is lots
 
03:47:21.429 --> 03:47:21.439 align:start position:0%
of room to improve New Hampshire's
 
03:47:25.729 --> 03:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
disclosure and and campaign Finance
 
03:47:27.830 --> 03:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
um I think there will be some really
 
03:47:29.750 --> 03:47:29.760 align:start position:0%
amazing ideas that come from a
 
03:47:31.790 --> 03:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group of legislators look
 
03:47:35.269 --> 03:47:35.279 align:start position:0%
reviewing campaign Finance reports
 
03:47:37.250 --> 03:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
seeing if there's more efficiencies and
 
03:47:39.650 --> 03:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
effective ways to keep this going
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
one idea might be
 
03:47:44.210 --> 03:47:44.220 align:start position:0%
people fill out using the online
 
03:47:46.729 --> 03:47:46.739 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system so that it's
 
03:47:46.739 --> 03:47:48.830 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance system so that it's
legible

03:47:48.830 --> 03:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
legible
 
03:47:52.610 --> 03:47:52.620 align:start position:0%
um this this bill hopefully will
 
03:47:57.410 --> 03:47:57.420 align:start position:0%
allow you to study the committee to
 
03:48:00.650 --> 03:48:00.660 align:start position:0%
to look at maybe examining the cost of
 
03:48:03.410 --> 03:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
campaigns the effectiveness of of New
 
03:48:05.630 --> 03:48:05.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's disclosure law and our
 
03:48:08.809 --> 03:48:08.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement constitutional options to
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
regulate campaign Finance
 
03:48:14.290 --> 03:48:14.300 align:start position:0%
and specific revisions that might be
 
03:48:17.809 --> 03:48:17.819 align:start position:0%
aimed at improving the integrity and
 
03:48:20.030 --> 03:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
increasing public confidence in our
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance so please support House
 
03:48:22.319 --> 03:48:23.530 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance so please support House
Bill

03:48:23.530 --> 03:48:23.540 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:48:27.290 --> 03:48:27.300 align:start position:0%
196 or as amended
 
03:48:29.809 --> 03:48:29.819 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions
 
03:48:33.650 --> 03:48:33.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:41.090 --> 03:48:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.030 --> 03:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.010 --> 03:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
so this is just your Tuesday now that's
 
03:48:53.349 --> 03:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
that's what's happening
 
03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
03:48:57.170 --> 03:48:57.180 align:start position:0%
committee Aaron Hennessey deputy
 
03:48:59.269 --> 03:48:59.279 align:start position:0%
secretary of state just want to go on
 
03:49:01.250 --> 03:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
record that we support this legislation
 
03:49:03.229 --> 03:49:03.239 align:start position:0%
whether it's a commission or a committee
 
03:49:05.870 --> 03:49:05.880 align:start position:0%
and would be happy to participate with
 
03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
either the committee or as a member of
 
03:49:08.570 --> 03:49:08.580 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
03:49:11.870 --> 03:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
and as a former this is an aside as a
 
03:49:15.229 --> 03:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
former eight-year user of these laws
 
03:49:16.849 --> 03:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
um I I did find them confusing
 
03:49:16.859 --> 03:49:21.910 align:start position:0%
um I I did find them confusing
unnecessarily

03:49:21.910 --> 03:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:24.110 --> 03:49:24.120 align:start position:0%
I think you just beat your last record
 
03:49:26.269 --> 03:49:26.279 align:start position:0%
on brevity
 
03:49:29.570 --> 03:49:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:31.490 --> 03:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
we got thank you for taking my question
 
03:49:33.110 --> 03:49:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh regarding
 
03:49:35.330 --> 03:49:35.340 align:start position:0%
um establishing this commission or
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
committee does it have to be done by I'm
 
03:49:39.889 --> 03:49:39.899 align:start position:0%
new to the board does it have to be done
 
03:49:43.610 --> 03:49:43.620 align:start position:0%
by the election law uh committee or can
 
03:49:48.110 --> 03:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
the can your office initiate this
 
03:49:48.120 --> 03:49:52.750 align:start position:0%
the can your office initiate this
foreign

03:49:52.750 --> 03:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:54.530 --> 03:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:57.530 --> 03:49:57.540 align:start position:0%
that is a great question I imagine that
 
03:50:00.950 --> 03:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
we could initiate something but we would
 
03:50:02.870 --> 03:50:02.880 align:start position:0%
then have to come to you to say hey
 
03:50:04.429 --> 03:50:04.439 align:start position:0%
would you listen to what we have to say
 
03:50:06.830 --> 03:50:06.840 align:start position:0%
so I think it would be more effective
 
03:50:09.229 --> 03:50:09.239 align:start position:0%
and efficient if you did it your within
 
03:50:12.650 --> 03:50:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:15.530 --> 03:50:15.540 align:start position:0%
okay follow up yeah
 
03:50:18.229 --> 03:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
um on the the uh
 
03:50:20.570 --> 03:50:20.580 align:start position:0%
the latest report that was done on voter
 
03:50:23.090 --> 03:50:23.100 align:start position:0%
integrity was that brought up from this
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't here so I apologize was
 
03:50:27.050 --> 03:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
that brought up through
 
03:50:28.910 --> 03:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
um the lecture law committee or was it
 
03:50:32.150 --> 03:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
brought up through the uh that was a
 
03:50:35.210 --> 03:50:35.220 align:start position:0%
secretary of state's decision to form
 
03:50:37.849 --> 03:50:37.859 align:start position:0%
that commission Okay so
 
03:50:40.010 --> 03:50:40.020 align:start position:0%
How would
 
03:50:41.210 --> 03:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
oh well
 
03:50:43.670 --> 03:50:43.680 align:start position:0%
okay while she's here
 
03:50:46.190 --> 03:50:46.200 align:start position:0%
uh how would that be different
 
03:50:48.229 --> 03:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
how would that be different
 
03:50:48.239 --> 03:50:50.750 align:start position:0%
how would that be different
just

03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:50:50.760 --> 03:50:53.929 align:start position:0%
just
so

03:50:53.929 --> 03:50:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:53.939 --> 03:50:54.469 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:50:54.469 --> 03:50:54.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:57.590 --> 03:50:57.600 align:start position:0%
the difference would be that that
 
03:51:00.950 --> 03:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
commission identified some issues
 
03:51:03.710 --> 03:51:03.720 align:start position:0%
um and if this commission to a were to
 
03:51:07.070 --> 03:51:07.080 align:start position:0%
do the process itself usually a
 
03:51:09.650 --> 03:51:09.660 align:start position:0%
commission or a committee will in their
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation and their final report
 
03:51:13.670 --> 03:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
and this has just been my past
 
03:51:15.889 --> 03:51:15.899 align:start position:0%
legislative experience have an actual
 
03:51:18.410 --> 03:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
language of a bill that it's going to
 
03:51:22.849 --> 03:51:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:24.889 --> 03:51:24.899 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:30.190 --> 03:51:30.200 align:start position:0%
yep so the idea is where's the reporting
 
03:51:34.610 --> 03:51:34.620 align:start position:0%
so this will on November 1st
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:42.349 --> 03:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
they must produce a report that goes to
 
03:51:43.610 --> 03:51:43.620 align:start position:0%
the Speaker of the House the president
 
03:51:45.889 --> 03:51:45.899 align:start position:0%
of the Senate the house clerk the Senate
 
03:51:47.570 --> 03:51:47.580 align:start position:0%
clerk the governor and the State Library
 
03:51:47.580 --> 03:51:49.849 align:start position:0%
clerk the governor and the State Library
so

03:51:49.849 --> 03:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:52.070 --> 03:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
that means both Senate President and the
 
03:51:53.630 --> 03:51:53.640 align:start position:0%
speaker would get it it would come to
 
03:51:56.269 --> 03:51:56.279 align:start position:0%
their attention and then there would be
 
03:51:58.969 --> 03:51:58.979 align:start position:0%
recommendations from this committee
 
03:52:04.130 --> 03:52:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:05.990 --> 03:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh it says make recommendations when
 
03:52:07.309 --> 03:52:07.319 align:start position:0%
when a state
 
03:52:09.590 --> 03:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
legislature form committee makes
 
03:52:11.570 --> 03:52:11.580 align:start position:0%
recommendations it's in the report but I
 
03:52:12.830 --> 03:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
mean really what they're doing is filing
 
03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
bills at that point
 
03:52:16.490 --> 03:52:16.500 align:start position:0%
if the executive branch forms a
 
03:52:19.550 --> 03:52:19.560 align:start position:0%
commission you get the report people may
 
03:52:22.309 --> 03:52:22.319 align:start position:0%
read it or not but what it doesn't do is
 
03:52:25.550 --> 03:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:37.370 --> 03:52:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:02.330 --> 03:53:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:02.340 --> 03:53:19.849 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:53:19.849 --> 03:53:19.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:23.030 --> 03:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
let's go on the blue sheet we have five
 
03:53:25.429 --> 03:53:25.439 align:start position:0%
in favor none against that closes the
 
03:53:27.650 --> 03:53:27.660 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 196. I
 
03:53:33.950 --> 03:53:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.570 --> 03:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:08.580 --> 04:05:26.269 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:05:26.269 --> 04:05:26.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:28.670 --> 04:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
okay all right let's open the executive
 
04:05:32.889 --> 04:05:32.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:35.030 --> 04:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
I did the same thing this morning if you
 
04:05:37.729 --> 04:05:37.739 align:start position:0%
did yeah oh okay
 
04:05:41.689 --> 04:05:41.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:43.910 --> 04:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
somebody said the word retain and so my
 
04:05:45.710 --> 04:05:45.720 align:start position:0%
head switched modes
 
04:05:47.389 --> 04:05:47.399 align:start position:0%
yeah so public hearing let's do that
 
04:05:49.790 --> 04:05:49.800 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Hamer
 
04:05:52.250 --> 04:05:52.260 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm Heidi Hamer from
 
04:05:54.710 --> 04:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I'm introducing House
 
04:05:58.189 --> 04:05:58.199 align:start position:0%
Bill 209 relative to The Forum required
 
04:06:00.650 --> 04:06:00.660 align:start position:0%
to request an absentee ballot
 
04:06:03.830 --> 04:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
this simple Bill simplifies the form
 
04:06:07.130 --> 04:06:07.140 align:start position:0%
required to request an absentee ballot
 
04:06:09.530 --> 04:06:09.540 align:start position:0%
this new form is trying to make it
 
04:06:12.710 --> 04:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
easier for our challenged voters to vote
 
04:06:16.189 --> 04:06:16.199 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot many absentee voters are
 
04:06:18.290 --> 04:06:18.300 align:start position:0%
elderly or disabled
 
04:06:21.530 --> 04:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
some absentee voters work long hours or
 
04:06:23.510 --> 04:06:23.520 align:start position:0%
have long commutes and are unable to
 
04:06:25.309 --> 04:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
make it to the polls on Election Day
 
04:06:27.469 --> 04:06:27.479 align:start position:0%
during regular hours
 
04:06:29.929 --> 04:06:29.939 align:start position:0%
some voters are combined confined to
 
04:06:32.510 --> 04:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
jail for a misdemeanor or while waiting
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
trial they have a right to vote by
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot
 
04:06:38.570 --> 04:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
there are voters who are caring for a
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
child or an adult they also
 
04:06:43.849 --> 04:06:43.859 align:start position:0%
are unable to come to the polls and vote
 
04:06:44.990 --> 04:06:45.000 align:start position:0%
in person
 
04:06:46.670 --> 04:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
they also have the right to vote
 
04:06:46.680 --> 04:06:48.050 align:start position:0%
they also have the right to vote
absentee

04:06:48.050 --> 04:06:48.060 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
04:06:51.410 --> 04:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
well you could be on vacation lucky you
 
04:06:54.469 --> 04:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
filling out this simplified form to
 
04:06:56.510 --> 04:06:56.520 align:start position:0%
request an absentee ballot will help
 
04:06:58.790 --> 04:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
those voters and make our city clerks
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
Town clerks jobs easier
 
04:07:03.950 --> 04:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
my Manchester city clerk has done
 
04:07:06.950 --> 04:07:06.960 align:start position:0%
countless in-home visits especially the
 
04:07:09.170 --> 04:07:09.180 align:start position:0%
elderly voters because they do not
 
04:07:12.110 --> 04:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
understand the current request forms so
 
04:07:14.150 --> 04:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
this is my version of making everyone's
 
04:07:17.210 --> 04:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot request easier
 
04:07:18.710 --> 04:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:07:22.870 --> 04:07:22.880 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee

okay what
 
04:07:28.610 --> 04:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
representative Barry
 
04:07:30.349 --> 04:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
um sorry I reviewed this when you sent
 
04:07:31.670 --> 04:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
to me and I'm sorry I didn't get back to
 
04:07:35.150 --> 04:07:35.160 align:start position:0%
you uh are you making any changes to the
 
04:07:36.650 --> 04:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
requirements to request an absentee
 
04:07:39.050 --> 04:07:39.060 align:start position:0%
ballot like you're not opening it up to
 
04:07:40.910 --> 04:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
just anybody like all you're doing is
 
04:07:43.550 --> 04:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
streamlining the actual page right yeah
 
04:07:43.560 --> 04:07:45.950 align:start position:0%
streamlining the actual page right yeah
okay

04:07:45.950 --> 04:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:07:48.410 --> 04:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
04:07:52.370 --> 04:07:52.380 align:start position:0%
okay thanks thank you
 
04:07:55.010 --> 04:07:55.020 align:start position:0%
John dodgy
 
04:07:59.389 --> 04:07:59.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:59.399 --> 04:08:01.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:08:01.250 --> 04:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:08:17.510 --> 04:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:19.490 --> 04:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman Aaron Hennessey
 
04:08:21.710 --> 04:08:21.720 align:start position:0%
deputy secretary of state
 
04:08:23.090 --> 04:08:23.100 align:start position:0%
um I want to applaud the representative
 
04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
for trying to simplify something
 
04:08:29.030 --> 04:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
um for those of you who have not seen
 
04:08:32.450 --> 04:08:32.460 align:start position:0%
a absentee ballot application this is
 
04:08:35.710 --> 04:08:35.720 align:start position:0%
what one looks like right now and again
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
this is the legislature sets what goes
 
04:08:39.950 --> 04:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
on here
 
04:08:41.269 --> 04:08:41.279 align:start position:0%
um and there's a bunch of different
 
04:08:43.370 --> 04:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
reasons there's reasons if it's there's
 
04:08:45.710 --> 04:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
a snowstorm
 
04:08:48.490 --> 04:08:48.500 align:start position:0%
um and then you have to flip it over
 
04:08:51.830 --> 04:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
one thing I will point out
 
04:08:54.469 --> 04:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
um to representative Barry's question
 
04:08:57.650 --> 04:08:57.660 align:start position:0%
earlier I believe it does remove one
 
04:08:59.809 --> 04:08:59.819 align:start position:0%
thing from the current
 
04:08:59.819 --> 04:09:00.530 align:start position:0%
thing from the current
um

04:09:00.530 --> 04:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:05.269 --> 04:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
application in which it currently on the
 
04:09:08.870 --> 04:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
application it says that if um your apps
 
04:09:10.250 --> 04:09:10.260 align:start position:0%
and from
 
04:09:12.769 --> 04:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
where you live or you're disabled and
 
04:09:15.229 --> 04:09:15.239 align:start position:0%
not able to come in and register to vote
 
04:09:17.630 --> 04:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
you can have an
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
um a registration sent to you with the
 
04:09:22.610 --> 04:09:22.620 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot materials and I don't
 
04:09:26.090 --> 04:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
see that on the on the new Option
 
04:09:26.100 --> 04:09:27.590 align:start position:0%
see that on the on the new Option
um

04:09:27.590 --> 04:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:09:30.290 --> 04:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
and then also I just wanted to
 
04:09:32.750 --> 04:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion that if you are going
 
04:09:34.570 --> 04:09:34.580 align:start position:0%
to simplify
 
04:09:37.189 --> 04:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
our constitution
 
04:09:41.450 --> 04:09:41.460 align:start position:0%
uh in the part first article 11 gives
 
04:09:44.150 --> 04:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
two options for absentee voters and that
 
04:09:47.330 --> 04:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
is the disability or absence and it
 
04:09:49.070 --> 04:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
would be much easier if you just had two
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
different check boxes and defined what
 
04:09:54.410 --> 04:09:54.420 align:start position:0%
those things were so I can't
 
04:09:56.929 --> 04:09:56.939 align:start position:0%
um be at the polls I need a absentee
 
04:09:59.210 --> 04:09:59.220 align:start position:0%
ballot and it's a one of two reasons and
 
04:10:01.250 --> 04:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
you make definitions for those two
 
04:10:02.689 --> 04:10:02.699 align:start position:0%
reasons which
 
04:10:06.889 --> 04:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
we have already defined in previously
 
04:10:10.370 --> 04:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take questions thank you
 
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
04:10:14.269 --> 04:10:14.279 align:start position:0%
representative Lane
 
04:10:17.030 --> 04:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you

04:10:18.479 --> 04:10:19.429 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:10:21.469 --> 04:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
I want to speak to your comment about
 
04:10:23.870 --> 04:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
that because
 
04:10:27.290 --> 04:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
part of the reason that we expanded out
 
04:10:30.650 --> 04:10:30.660 align:start position:0%
this way is because people technically
 
04:10:32.870 --> 04:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're not out of town
 
04:10:36.290 --> 04:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
they're not away from their town if they
 
04:10:38.510 --> 04:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
say are sitting in jail
 
04:10:40.849 --> 04:10:40.859 align:start position:0%
so the idea so people wouldn't check
 
04:10:42.710 --> 04:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
that or they they couldn't use that and
 
04:10:45.349 --> 04:10:45.359 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a disability so we
 
04:10:47.210 --> 04:10:47.220 align:start position:0%
heard testimony I think last year the
 
04:10:50.750 --> 04:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
year before and tried to clarify that
 
04:10:52.670 --> 04:10:52.680 align:start position:0%
that was part of the reason we wanted to
 
04:10:54.969 --> 04:10:54.979 align:start position:0%
clarify it so people would understand
 
04:10:59.090 --> 04:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
that it would qualify for that
 
04:11:01.250 --> 04:11:01.260 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and that can
 
04:11:03.050 --> 04:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
still be included within the definition
 
04:11:05.450 --> 04:11:05.460 align:start position:0%
in one of those two boxes it's just a
 
04:11:07.189 --> 04:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
suggestion if you're trying to simplify
 
04:11:07.199 --> 04:11:09.830 align:start position:0%
suggestion if you're trying to simplify
things

04:11:09.830 --> 04:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
for the questions
 
04:11:12.889 --> 04:11:12.899 align:start position:0%
representative Kelly
 
04:11:14.809 --> 04:11:14.819 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:11:17.090 --> 04:11:17.100 align:start position:0%

Deputy uh

04:11:18.590 --> 04:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
Tennessee
 
04:11:23.290 --> 04:11:23.300 align:start position:0%
uh a note in in RSA 657-1
 
04:11:26.870 --> 04:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
regarding excuses for absentee voting
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
it also includes
 
04:11:31.429 --> 04:11:31.439 align:start position:0%
a National Weather Service winter storm
 
04:11:32.929 --> 04:11:32.939 align:start position:0%
warning on the Monday before the
 
04:11:32.939 --> 04:11:33.830 align:start position:0%
warning on the Monday before the
election

04:11:33.830 --> 04:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
election
 
04:11:36.769 --> 04:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
is I don't think that's in this
 
04:11:38.570 --> 04:11:38.580 align:start position:0%
simplified version but wouldn't that
 
04:11:40.910 --> 04:11:40.920 align:start position:0%
still need to be there
 
04:11:40.920 --> 04:11:42.769 align:start position:0%
still need to be there
657

04:11:42.769 --> 04:11:42.779 align:start position:0%
657
 
04:11:45.650 --> 04:11:45.660 align:start position:0%
uh one it's uh
 
04:11:47.689 --> 04:11:47.699 align:start position:0%
paragraph Roman numeral two or section
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two
 
04:11:51.110 --> 04:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
so I I don't have that in front of me
 
04:11:53.450 --> 04:11:53.460 align:start position:0%
but I do have the our current
 
04:11:55.910 --> 04:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
application and which does include that
 
04:11:58.849 --> 04:11:58.859 align:start position:0%
and the two reasons for
 
04:12:01.429 --> 04:12:01.439 align:start position:0%
um for the storm for you to get an
 
04:12:03.110 --> 04:12:03.120 align:start position:0%
absentee ballot would be that you're
 
04:12:05.330 --> 04:12:05.340 align:start position:0%
elderly informed or have a physical
 
04:12:07.490 --> 04:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
disability and would otherwise vote in
 
04:12:09.050 --> 04:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
person but have concerns for their
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
safety traveling in the storm they think
 
04:12:14.330 --> 04:12:14.340 align:start position:0%
that would fit under the disability
 
04:12:16.849 --> 04:12:16.859 align:start position:0%
um option for you to check
 
04:12:19.250 --> 04:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
um also I anticipate that school child
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
care or adult care will be canceled and
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
would otherwise vote in person but will
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
need to care for children or affirmed
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
adults and that again is already an
 
04:12:27.720 --> 04:12:29.030 align:start position:0%
adults and that again is already an
absentee

04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
absentee
 
04:12:31.309 --> 04:12:31.319 align:start position:0%
excuse that you can have
 
04:12:33.889 --> 04:12:33.899 align:start position:0%
so I think it's just duplicative of what
 
04:12:33.899 --> 04:12:35.110 align:start position:0%
so I think it's just duplicative of what
the

04:12:35.110 --> 04:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:12:38.030 --> 04:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
reasons we already have in law
 
04:12:39.830 --> 04:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry if I'm not being clear
 
04:12:42.650 --> 04:12:42.660 align:start position:0%
enough so we already have a reason where
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
you if you're caring for a child or or
 
04:12:48.050 --> 04:12:48.060 align:start position:0%
an adult you can get an absentee ballot
 
04:12:49.670 --> 04:12:49.680 align:start position:0%
if you're unable to come to the polls
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
and we already have a reason if you have
 
04:12:54.229 --> 04:12:54.239 align:start position:0%
a disability and if you for some reason
 
04:12:56.689 --> 04:12:56.699 align:start position:0%
can't go outside when it's slippery or
 
04:12:59.150 --> 04:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
you can't drive when it's snowing
 
04:13:00.590 --> 04:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
I believe that would be covered under
 
04:13:04.450 --> 04:13:04.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:09.830 --> 04:13:09.840 align:start position:0%
follow up uh yes a follow-up uh I have
 
04:13:11.030 --> 04:13:11.040 align:start position:0%
it in front of me I believe it's the
 
04:13:12.950 --> 04:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
current version and
 
04:13:15.170 --> 04:13:15.180 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:13:16.969 --> 04:13:16.979 align:start position:0%
the first excuse under the weather
 
04:13:16.979 --> 04:13:18.889 align:start position:0%
the first excuse under the weather
service

04:13:18.889 --> 04:13:18.899 align:start position:0%
service
 
04:13:20.809 --> 04:13:20.819 align:start position:0%
storm warning
 
04:13:24.110 --> 04:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any reference in the RSA
 
04:13:27.170 --> 04:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
itself to being disabled or infirm it
 
04:13:29.330 --> 04:13:29.340 align:start position:0%
simply says if you're in fear
 
04:13:31.670 --> 04:13:31.680 align:start position:0%
for your safety traveling in the
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
prospective storm that you can use that
 
04:13:36.290 --> 04:13:36.300 align:start position:0%
as being absent
 
04:13:39.410 --> 04:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm just thinking and
 
04:13:41.330 --> 04:13:41.340 align:start position:0%
that the application would need to have
 
04:13:43.910 --> 04:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
that corrected if we left it in so I
 
04:13:45.530 --> 04:13:45.540 align:start position:0%
don't think it's covered elsewhere but
 
04:13:47.809 --> 04:13:47.819 align:start position:0%
you'll check me on this I'm sure when
 
04:13:49.309 --> 04:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
you have a chance
 
04:13:52.370 --> 04:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I
 
04:13:54.590 --> 04:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
I can get a legal opinion as to whether
 
04:13:56.330 --> 04:13:56.340 align:start position:0%
that would be a
 
04:13:59.570 --> 04:13:59.580 align:start position:0%
fall under disability or not but
 
04:14:01.429 --> 04:14:01.439 align:start position:0%
again if you want to leave all of that
 
04:14:03.950 --> 04:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
in there then then this is what your
 
04:14:09.170 --> 04:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.110 --> 04:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:12.120 --> 04:14:14.809 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:14:14.809 --> 04:14:14.819 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:14:18.469 --> 04:14:18.479 align:start position:0%
um back to the disability
 
04:14:20.030 --> 04:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um and I just heard that you were going
 
04:14:23.450 --> 04:14:23.460 align:start position:0%
to check on that but a few years ago we
 
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
were told that disability when we were
 
04:14:27.530 --> 04:14:27.540 align:start position:0%
working on the National Weather Service
 
04:14:30.290 --> 04:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
built that it would not cover the things
 
04:14:32.929 --> 04:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
that are set out in that bill okay so I
 
04:14:33.830 --> 04:14:33.840 align:start position:0%
just wanted
 
04:14:35.929 --> 04:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
that was part of the reason it went into
 
04:14:39.590 --> 04:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
the bill so ask again if you would
 
04:14:42.290 --> 04:14:42.300 align:start position:0%
please if they think that if that's the
 
04:14:48.710 --> 04:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:51.710 --> 04:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
thank you I will follow up on that
 
04:14:54.530 --> 04:14:54.540 align:start position:0%
definition and I apologize I was I was
 
04:14:57.590 --> 04:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
never on Election law and so I was not
 
04:15:01.790 --> 04:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.150 --> 04:15:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:05.160 --> 04:15:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:15:07.309 --> 04:15:07.319 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:15:07.319 --> 04:15:10.510 align:start position:0%
okay

and on on the blue sheet we have one in
 
04:16:02.330 --> 04:16:02.340 align:start position:0%
favor chew against and that closes the
 
04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
public hearing on House Bill 209
 
04:16:11.929 --> 04:16:11.939 align:start position:0%

05:02:11.570 --> 05:02:11.580 align:start position:0%
okay it's three o'clock
 
05:02:13.670 --> 05:02:13.680 align:start position:0%

to uh retain House Bill one more time
 
05:02:24.170 --> 05:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
115 I think I don't have my notes in
 
05:02:37.610 --> 05:02:37.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:39.590 --> 05:02:39.600 align:start position:0%
um per the request of the sponsor uh we
 
05:02:41.150 --> 05:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
want to hold on to this there's a
 
05:02:43.788 --> 05:02:43.798 align:start position:0%
similar legislation in the Senate so we
 
05:02:45.410 --> 05:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
want to kind of sit back and see what's
 
05:02:47.208 --> 05:02:47.218 align:start position:0%
going to go on over there and then we
 
05:02:48.650 --> 05:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
will make our move forward at that point
 
05:02:50.208 --> 05:02:50.218 align:start position:0%
after working on the bill and talking
 
05:02:52.788 --> 05:02:52.798 align:start position:0%
with ourselves
 
05:02:52.798 --> 05:02:56.868 align:start position:0%
with ourselves

House Bill 350.
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
so uh planning for the future
 
05:15:35.270 --> 05:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
I serve on another committee and they
 
05:15:37.430 --> 05:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
meet on the same day because you know
 
05:15:41.930 --> 05:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
planning and uh so I have to go there in
 
05:15:44.270 --> 05:15:44.280 align:start position:0%
the afternoon so what I plan to do here
 
05:15:48.350 --> 05:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
is from now on when we exact bills we'll
 
05:15:50.570 --> 05:15:50.580 align:start position:0%
do them earlier in the day so I don't
 
05:15:52.190 --> 05:15:52.200 align:start position:0%
want to change the political makeup of
 
05:15:53.990 --> 05:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
the committee because you had traffic or
 
05:15:55.128 --> 05:15:55.138 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
05:15:58.010 --> 05:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
moose in the roads so we'll probably do
 
05:16:00.230 --> 05:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
one public hearing it gives people an
 
05:16:02.510 --> 05:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come in late and then
 
05:16:05.090 --> 05:16:05.100 align:start position:0%
we'll exec bills before lunch and do the
 
05:16:06.590 --> 05:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
remainder of the public hearings in the
 
05:16:08.330 --> 05:16:08.340 align:start position:0%
afternoon I gotta look at the schedule
 
05:16:10.788 --> 05:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
but it should work out that way so
 
05:16:12.770 --> 05:16:12.780 align:start position:0%
that's the plan
