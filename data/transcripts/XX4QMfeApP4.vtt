00:21:03.770 --> 00:21:03.780 align:start position:0%
good morning everyone
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
um before we start if we could please
 
00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
rise and join me in the Pledge of
 
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:12.190 align:start position:0%
rise and join me in the Pledge of
Allegiance

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
of the United States of America and to
 
00:21:17.690 --> 00:21:17.700 align:start position:0%
the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:21:20.150 --> 00:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
nation under God indivisible with
 
00:21:24.789 --> 00:21:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:27.710 --> 00:21:27.720 align:start position:0%
thank you at this point I'm opening the
 
00:21:30.409 --> 00:21:30.419 align:start position:0%
full committee work session
 
00:21:36.289 --> 00:21:36.299 align:start position:0%
to deal with HB 287 and hb470
 
00:21:36.299 --> 00:21:37.909 align:start position:0%
to deal with HB 287 and hb470
and

00:21:37.909 --> 00:21:37.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
representative Muse would you like to
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk to us for a few seconds here about
 
00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.789 align:start position:0%
talk to us for a few seconds here about
this

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:21:47.810 --> 00:21:47.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:52.330 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:52.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:55.970 --> 00:21:55.980 align:start position:0%
these are these are two bills uh that uh
 
00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
earlier on the schedule we decided to uh
 
00:22:05.210 --> 00:22:05.220 align:start position:0%
to hold off on uh execing and um uh one
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the things that that has done is it
 
00:22:09.890 --> 00:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
has given us some time uh to basically
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
put together some information that
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
compares and contrasts uh two bills that
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
that I sent I think essentially try to
 
00:22:19.190 --> 00:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
achieve the same aims
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that we're trying
 
00:22:22.390 --> 00:22:22.400 align:start position:0%
to do right now in New Hampshire
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
is to catch up to where some other
 
00:22:29.049 --> 00:22:29.059 align:start position:0%
states are in terms of our ability
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
to legally offer drug checking and and
 
00:22:34.310 --> 00:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
why drug checking is important is
 
00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:37.860 align:start position:0%
because of the amount of uh of uh of
 
00:22:41.990 --> 00:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
fentanyl that's being found in in pills
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
that are actually being sold on the
 
00:22:44.159 --> 00:22:45.310 align:start position:0%
that are actually being sold on the
street

00:22:45.310 --> 00:22:45.320 align:start position:0%
street
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
any more fentanyl is being used to to
 
00:22:52.370 --> 00:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
cut other drugs because it's cheaper
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
than those drugs it's more available
 
00:22:57.169 --> 00:22:57.179 align:start position:0%
than those drugs and I think one of the
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
things we're finding out in New
 
00:23:00.169 --> 00:23:00.179 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is it's also far more deadly
 
00:23:01.789 --> 00:23:01.799 align:start position:0%
than those drugs
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
so I think our choice to today hopefully
 
00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's it's it and we we kind of go in uh
 
00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020 align:start position:0%
one of uh one of two directions but
 
00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:14.340 align:start position:0%
basically go in the same general
 
00:23:16.130 --> 00:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
direction of catching up
 
00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600 align:start position:0%
but but I think the the the ultimate
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
goal here of of both of these bills is
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
to reduce the number of deaths due to
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
overdose uh in this state
 
00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:32.220 align:start position:0%
um we have a real issue
 
00:23:34.430 --> 00:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
um my personal opinion is that one of
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
the bills will go farther and will help
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
us do that and will help us
 
00:23:42.230 --> 00:23:42.240 align:start position:0%
um will help us save more lives
 
00:23:45.950 --> 00:23:45.960 align:start position:0%
the other bill would be a good start
 
00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that I would I
 
00:23:49.970 --> 00:23:49.980 align:start position:0%
would ask you to sort of keep in the
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
back of your mind as you as you look at
 
00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:55.799 align:start position:0%
look at both of these bills is
 
00:23:57.890 --> 00:23:57.900 align:start position:0%
the severity of the problem that we have
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
now so not too long ago I read on in the
 
00:24:04.130 --> 00:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
news that five people died of overdoses
 
00:24:06.770 --> 00:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
in a single week in Manchester alone
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
so we have uh we have a real problem and
 
00:24:13.010 --> 00:24:13.020 align:start position:0%
and well I'll be the first to admit that
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
we we absolutely need to uh
 
00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
put resources uh into law enforcement
 
00:24:22.430 --> 00:24:22.440 align:start position:0%
and Border interdiction and start
 
00:24:25.130 --> 00:24:25.140 align:start position:0%
stopping uh you know the flow of drugs
 
00:24:27.710 --> 00:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
into New Hampshire
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
um what it doesn't do is change the fact
 
00:24:32.810 --> 00:24:32.820 align:start position:0%
that there are already a lot of drugs
 
00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
that are already in New Hampshire and
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
are killing people
 
00:24:39.710 --> 00:24:39.720 align:start position:0%
and so we we
 
00:24:43.130 --> 00:24:43.140 align:start position:0%
know we I'd like to think that um this
 
00:24:44.990 --> 00:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
isn't a choice between one approach or
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
the other that essentially the the basic
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
approach of reducing the harm that the
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
drugs that are already in our state can
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
do is something that we can adopt as a
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
strategy uh to complement
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
um the sort of tighter enforcement I
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
think that everybody wants to see
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
so essentially that's what
 
00:25:13.789 --> 00:25:13.799 align:start position:0%
um HB 470 uh as uh as amended uh would
 
00:25:17.930 --> 00:25:17.940 align:start position:0%
do uh to a lesser extent what 287 would
 
00:25:21.169 --> 00:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
do is uh offer some protection to people
 
00:25:23.630 --> 00:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
legal protection to people who are using
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
and providing fentanyl test strips now
 
00:25:29.510 --> 00:25:29.520 align:start position:0%
which are which are basically currently
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
considered illegal drug paraphernalia
 
00:25:34.490 --> 00:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
in in terms of what it might accomplish
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we learned during
 
00:25:38.090 --> 00:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
the public hearing is we're we learned
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
that the test strips are already being
 
00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
distributed in New Hampshire they're not
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't say that they're widely
 
00:25:47.930 --> 00:25:47.940 align:start position:0%
available but they're available in in
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
some of the places where they actually
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
will do good
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
so you know an issue is is how far do we
 
00:25:57.470 --> 00:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
do we actually want to go with this do
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
we want to catch up a little bit
 
00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
um or do we want to lay the groundwork
 
00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
for actually being able to do you know
 
00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
to expand this type of work and one of
 
00:26:11.450 --> 00:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
the reasons why this is necessary is
 
00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
we're also seeing things like um like
 
00:26:17.870 --> 00:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
xylazine being cut into drugs on the
 
00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
street and uh while xylazine doesn't
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
create the same kind of Overdose
 
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:26.900 align:start position:0%
problems at the same level that cutting
 
00:26:29.630 --> 00:26:29.640 align:start position:0%
pills with fentanyl does it creates a
 
00:26:32.029 --> 00:26:32.039 align:start position:0%
whole other set of problems in terms of
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
the way that it reacts with some of the
 
00:26:37.430 --> 00:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
drugs that it's combined with and also
 
00:26:40.250 --> 00:26:40.260 align:start position:0%
just the physical toll that it takes on
 
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:42.740 align:start position:0%
the people who use it
 
00:26:47.090 --> 00:26:47.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not an expert in Pharmacology but it
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
looks like using xylazine can create
 
00:26:52.370 --> 00:26:52.380 align:start position:0%
some of the same physical effects that
 
00:26:55.630 --> 00:26:55.640 align:start position:0%
we see with people who are on meth
 
00:26:59.390 --> 00:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
open source uh open source that get
 
00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.810 align:start position:0%
open source uh open source that get
infected

00:27:01.810 --> 00:27:01.820 align:start position:0%
infected
 
00:27:04.930 --> 00:27:04.940 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
basically a terrible thing for anybody
 
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
to have to go through
 
00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.210 align:start position:0%
to have to go through
um

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:14.520 align:start position:0%
so so I think one of the things we're
 
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do is to you know with with
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
this approach is to modify our
 
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
controlled Drug Act in a way that makes
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
it possible uh for us not only to
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
provide things like fentanyl test strips
 
00:27:31.549 --> 00:27:31.559 align:start position:0%
but to provide more widespread uh the
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
more widespread capability for people
 
00:27:39.169 --> 00:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
who are uh who are using uh you know who
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
are using drugs and yes they're they are
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
illegal drugs but for people who are
 
00:27:46.190 --> 00:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
using these drugs to actually know what
 
00:27:47.750 --> 00:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're taking and I think one of the
 
00:27:49.130 --> 00:27:49.140 align:start position:0%
things that I said during the public
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
hearing that I'll uh that I'll repeat
 
00:27:54.529 --> 00:27:54.539 align:start position:0%
now is
 
00:27:56.750 --> 00:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
if it was your kid
 
00:27:58.970 --> 00:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
you know what would you want
 
00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know would you would you want us to
 
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
be would you want them I mean you're
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
never going to want them to take drugs
 
00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
um but if they are taking drugs if
 
00:28:09.169 --> 00:28:09.179 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about taking drugs
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you want to know that there's a
 
00:28:14.210 --> 00:28:14.220 align:start position:0%
place you can go or they could go uh
 
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that what they're
 
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:17.820 align:start position:0%
taking is really what they think they're
 
00:28:21.950 --> 00:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
taking and uh and also what they what
 
00:28:25.730 --> 00:28:25.740 align:start position:0%
they to know that what they might take
 
00:28:27.769 --> 00:28:27.779 align:start position:0%
um while not actually being you know
 
00:28:30.769 --> 00:28:30.779 align:start position:0%
quote unquote safe at least won't kill
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
them uh so I think those are the things
 
00:28:36.049 --> 00:28:36.059 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to accomplish today
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I've done is I've
 
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:41.820 align:start position:0%
I've uh in conjunction with some of the
 
00:28:43.630 --> 00:28:43.640 align:start position:0%
folks who are here
 
00:28:47.090 --> 00:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
Ms naughty Miss McGinley
 
00:28:50.510 --> 00:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
um put together a uh a comparison sheet
 
00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
between the two bills there is an
 
00:28:54.470 --> 00:28:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendment to 470 that I'm prepared to
 
00:28:57.169 --> 00:28:57.179 align:start position:0%
walk through but for now I'm gonna stop
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
talking and let other people lay in
 
00:29:01.549 --> 00:29:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you actually before you stop
 
00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.570 align:start position:0%
thank you actually before you stop
talking

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:02.580 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
um could you just tell us the the change
 
00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:07.500 align:start position:0%
you made in the amendment the the the
 
00:29:10.190 --> 00:29:10.200 align:start position:0%
concern that we heard was regarding the
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
packaging materials for um
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
for controlled substances and it looks
 
00:29:16.789 --> 00:29:16.799 align:start position:0%
like you've done something with it I'm
 
00:29:18.409 --> 00:29:18.419 align:start position:0%
just not sure
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
you know the the the the concern around
 
00:29:24.889 --> 00:29:24.899 align:start position:0%
packaging materials we have attempted to
 
00:29:27.230 --> 00:29:27.240 align:start position:0%
address that in the amendment so so in
 
00:29:29.389 --> 00:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
the original bill I think the way that
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
folks were interpreting it is that any
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
packaging materials would no longer you
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
know be subject uh you know uh for
 
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
instance if you're found with packaging
 
00:29:41.149 --> 00:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
materials uh you know during an
 
00:29:41.159 --> 00:29:42.830 align:start position:0%
materials uh you know during an
investigation

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:42.840 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:29:45.169 --> 00:29:45.179 align:start position:0%
um those actually couldn't be used in in
 
00:29:47.510 --> 00:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
the prosecution
 
00:29:51.169 --> 00:29:51.179 align:start position:0%
um and so the the you know the issue
 
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
with that I think uh from a law
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement point of point of view is
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
you you know you want to make sure that
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
people who are creating factories or who
 
00:30:02.029 --> 00:30:02.039 align:start position:0%
are Distributing uh Distributing drugs
 
00:30:05.450 --> 00:30:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh that materials like that can actually
 
00:30:07.909 --> 00:30:07.919 align:start position:0%
be used as evidence in the prosecution
 
00:30:09.889 --> 00:30:09.899 align:start position:0%
against them
 
00:30:12.230 --> 00:30:12.240 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to do with the
 
00:30:14.690 --> 00:30:14.700 align:start position:0%
amendment is to sort of separate that
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
kind of packaging from essentially what
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
people would need to bring in a small
 
00:30:22.669 --> 00:30:22.679 align:start position:0%
amount of drugs to get tested
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
so the little baggie that I use uh the
 
00:30:28.669 --> 00:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
little sandwich bag that I use to to
 
00:30:31.430 --> 00:30:31.440 align:start position:0%
bring in half of a pill or a small
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
amount of drugs
 
00:30:36.529 --> 00:30:36.539 align:start position:0%
um we we don't necessarily want people
 
00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:38.760 align:start position:0%
charged with violating the drug
 
00:30:43.130 --> 00:30:43.140 align:start position:0%
paraphernalia law if they if for for
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
simply using that to package the
 
00:30:47.210 --> 00:30:47.220 align:start position:0%
material that they want to have tested
 
00:30:49.789 --> 00:30:49.799 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the distinction that
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
we're making another thing that we've
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
done with the amendment we've added uh
 
00:30:58.250 --> 00:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in there that when
 
00:31:00.649 --> 00:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
we're defining drug checking
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
um we're also uh expanding the um uh the
 
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:09.860 align:start position:0%
expanding it to cover not only naloxone
 
00:31:13.730 --> 00:31:13.740 align:start position:0%
which is the opioid reversal agent
 
00:31:17.149 --> 00:31:17.159 align:start position:0%
that's uh currently the most in use with
 
00:31:18.610 --> 00:31:18.620 align:start position:0%
with fentanyl
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
overdoses as well as any kind of opioid
 
00:31:24.289 --> 00:31:24.299 align:start position:0%
overdoses and just broadening it to
 
00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:28.260 align:start position:0%
include all opioid reversal agents and
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons we're doing that is
 
00:31:34.250 --> 00:31:34.260 align:start position:0%
because the FDA has actually begun to
 
00:31:37.610 --> 00:31:37.620 align:start position:0%
approve some new opioid reversal agents
 
00:31:40.269 --> 00:31:40.279 align:start position:0%
that will be more effective on fentanyl
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
so a in a state where where so often
 
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
trying to catch up
 
00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're we're
 
00:31:51.769 --> 00:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
trying to do is is catch up a little
 
00:31:54.710 --> 00:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
more if not start to get a little bit
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
ahead of the game or at least put
 
00:31:58.970 --> 00:31:58.980 align:start position:0%
ourselves into a position where every
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
time we do something like this we don't
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
have to start from scratch and to to to
 
00:32:06.649 --> 00:32:06.659 align:start position:0%
do things like add things like fentanyl
 
00:32:10.490 --> 00:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
test strips one bill at a time
 
00:32:12.950 --> 00:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
all right representative thank you I'm
 
00:32:15.649 --> 00:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
looking at the amendment and it says I'm
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
confused and it may be just me but
 
00:32:20.690 --> 00:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
paragraph x a
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
says drug paraphernalia will include
 
00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
packaging repackaging storing but then
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
the addition underneath says it shall
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
not include drugs
 
00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:33.360 align:start position:0%
um packaging preparing so how does that
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
how does that address the law
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
enforcement concern I think I think what
 
00:32:39.529 --> 00:32:39.539 align:start position:0%
if you look down at XD if you look at
 
00:32:41.570 --> 00:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
the last line in XD
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
um uh what it says is drug packaging in
 
00:32:47.090 --> 00:32:47.100 align:start position:0%
this section refers to packaging
 
00:32:50.090 --> 00:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
materials provided for or utilized in
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
drug checking okay
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
anywhere else now I represent Manion
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:02.269 --> 00:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the section that says
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
nominal containing nominal amounts for
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of checking the definition
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
being 10 milligrams or less is this does
 
00:33:13.970 --> 00:33:13.980 align:start position:0%
this bill make possessing 10 milligrams
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's all that's how I'm reading it so
 
00:33:23.149 --> 00:33:23.159 align:start position:0%
you can help me out with that what it
 
00:33:24.950 --> 00:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
what it does is it considers 10
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
milligrams or less when it is when it is
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
brought in for drug checking
 
00:33:33.590 --> 00:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
um what it what what it does is make it
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
allowable for for drug checking it
 
00:33:38.090 --> 00:33:38.100 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the drug legal
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
um but uh if if it's being brought in
 
00:33:43.450 --> 00:33:43.460 align:start position:0%
for drug checking purposes
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
uh a nominal and essentially what what
 
00:33:50.450 --> 00:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
it the reason that's in there is people
 
00:33:52.130 --> 00:33:52.140 align:start position:0%
have to bring in something
 
00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:54.000 align:start position:0%
and given the nature of the Beast
 
00:33:56.330 --> 00:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
anything that they bring in is going to
 
00:33:58.070 --> 00:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
be illegal
 
00:33:59.690 --> 00:33:59.700 align:start position:0%
um so I mean we're it's a little bit of
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
a conundrum and this is an area where we
 
00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:03.419 align:start position:0%
do need to have a little bit of
 
00:34:10.849 --> 00:34:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:12.829 --> 00:34:12.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman this was a
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
follow-up so if if people who use drugs
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
package it all in 10 milligram
 
00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:19.609 align:start position:0%
package it all in 10 milligram
increments

00:34:19.609 --> 00:34:19.619 align:start position:0%
increments
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
and anytime they get stopped they can
 
00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
say they're on the way to get it tested
 
00:34:25.070 --> 00:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
would that pose a problem would that
 
00:34:28.250 --> 00:34:28.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:32.329 --> 00:34:32.339 align:start position:0%
I think one of the thing one of the so I
 
00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:36.599 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure you're I'm not sure I uh I
 
00:34:37.849 --> 00:34:37.859 align:start position:0%
understand the premise of your question
 
00:34:40.310 --> 00:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
but the women I think I think what he's
 
00:34:42.950 --> 00:34:42.960 align:start position:0%
saying is if I'm a drug dealer and I
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
want to circum nut make it circumvent
 
00:34:46.129 --> 00:34:46.139 align:start position:0%
the law
 
00:34:48.649 --> 00:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
can I then just package everything in 10
 
00:34:51.349 --> 00:34:51.359 align:start position:0%
milligram packages and if I get stopped
 
00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
say I'm just going to have a check at
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
the place with this law let me on
 
00:34:57.410 --> 00:34:57.420 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
so kind of following that through if if
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
you have 10 milligrams uh and it's in
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
the type of packaging that somebody
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
would normally use uh the average person
 
00:35:13.370 --> 00:35:13.380 align:start position:0%
um would use uh to to actually transport
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
a small amount of drugs to a drug
 
00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:18.359 align:start position:0%
testing facility yes
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
um somebody somebody could say somebody
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
could say that on the other hand what
 
00:35:25.010 --> 00:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
you what they wouldn't be able to do is
 
00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:27.720 align:start position:0%
to create a whole bunch of little tiny
 
00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
packages with less than 10 milligrams uh
 
00:35:33.829 --> 00:35:33.839 align:start position:0%
and if you if you stop them they they
 
00:35:36.349 --> 00:35:36.359 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to say oh you know I
 
00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:38.579 align:start position:0%
only have a whole bunch of little tiny
 
00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
packages and I'm on my way to drug
 
00:35:44.089 --> 00:35:44.099 align:start position:0%
checking I mean I mean this is
 
00:35:47.630 --> 00:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:49.740 align:start position:0%
I think part part of what we're trying
 
00:35:51.950 --> 00:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
to do here is we're we're trying to help
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
people who otherwise
 
00:35:57.050 --> 00:35:57.060 align:start position:0%
might die from taking drugs that
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
basically have bad stuff in them
 
00:36:01.849 --> 00:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
um we're not trying to get in the way of
 
00:36:04.190 --> 00:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
criminal prosecutions at all and I but I
 
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:05.640 align:start position:0%
think these are science some of the
 
00:36:07.730 --> 00:36:07.740 align:start position:0%
Judgment calls that we have to be
 
00:36:09.410 --> 00:36:09.420 align:start position:0%
willing to make if we're gonna if we're
 
00:36:12.589 --> 00:36:12.599 align:start position:0%
going to save more lives in this state
 
00:36:16.069 --> 00:36:16.079 align:start position:0%
I I agree I just I think that when we
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
look at these we also have to play
 
00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:19.079 align:start position:0%
Devil's Advocate to make sure that we
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
don't we don't leave a a big hole um
 
00:36:24.170 --> 00:36:24.180 align:start position:0%
but I see where you're going who had to
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
I've been here 120 seconds and I want to
 
00:36:33.829 --> 00:36:33.839 align:start position:0%
talk I just had a question for president
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
Manion because um or maybe any other
 
00:36:37.910 --> 00:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
people with law enforcement experience
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
in the room
 
00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:41.460 align:start position:0%
um I know that there's some inferences
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
or at least as I as far as I know
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
there's some inferences that you have to
 
00:36:46.670 --> 00:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
make to decide between the charge of
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
possession or versus possession with
 
00:36:50.510 --> 00:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute do I have that
 
00:36:52.490 --> 00:36:52.500 align:start position:0%
right and I was thinking that maybe if
 
00:36:54.250 --> 00:36:54.260 align:start position:0%
you can speak to the reasoning between
 
00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
one of those charges or the other that
 
00:36:59.150 --> 00:36:59.160 align:start position:0%
that might highlight how this would be
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
implemented or like shed some light on
 
00:37:01.500 --> 00:37:03.589 align:start position:0%
implemented or like shed some light on
it

00:37:03.589 --> 00:37:03.599 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
yes clearly there's you need more to
 
00:37:08.089 --> 00:37:08.099 align:start position:0%
prove dealing as opposed to just
 
00:37:10.250 --> 00:37:10.260 align:start position:0%
possessing however my question goes both
 
00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980 align:start position:0%
ways if I'm a drug user and I know that
 
00:37:16.310 --> 00:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
10 million 10 milligrams or less is
 
00:37:18.349 --> 00:37:18.359 align:start position:0%
legal that's all I'm going to carry on
 
00:37:19.910 --> 00:37:19.920 align:start position:0%
me at any given time or that's how I'm
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
going to package it and I'm not talking
 
00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
just specifically dealers this applies
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
to anything
 
00:37:26.569 --> 00:37:26.579 align:start position:0%
so if you're a drug user and you want to
 
00:37:27.890 --> 00:37:27.900 align:start position:0%
skirt the system you just package
 
00:37:29.930 --> 00:37:29.940 align:start position:0%
everything in 10 milligrams or less and
 
00:37:31.849 --> 00:37:31.859 align:start position:0%
now it's legal to possess that's my
 
00:37:31.859 --> 00:37:36.290 align:start position:0%
now it's legal to possess that's my
concern

00:37:36.290 --> 00:37:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:37.790 --> 00:37:37.800 align:start position:0%
well that's what I'm trying to
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
understand I'm not asking this question
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
and to be argumentative but to
 
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:44.220 align:start position:0%
understand because I've never had to
 
00:37:46.370 --> 00:37:46.380 align:start position:0%
personally decide between
 
00:37:48.829 --> 00:37:48.839 align:start position:0%
charging someone with possession versus
 
00:37:51.589 --> 00:37:51.599 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to distribute but
 
00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:53.400 align:start position:0%
it is possible from what I understand
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
for someone to have a substantial volume
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
of illegal drugs that they don't intend
 
00:38:00.849 --> 00:38:00.859 align:start position:0%
to distribute and then there's whatever
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
factors are observed by the officer that
 
00:38:05.870 --> 00:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
seem to justify the charge of possession
 
00:38:07.970 --> 00:38:07.980 align:start position:0%
with intent to distribute and so I
 
00:38:09.890 --> 00:38:09.900 align:start position:0%
wonder if someone had a whole bunch of
 
00:38:12.109 --> 00:38:12.119 align:start position:0%
10 milligram packages
 
00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
why couldn't they be charged with intent
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
to distribute in that case you know AB
 
00:38:19.970 --> 00:38:19.980 align:start position:0%
like regard regardless of whatever the
 
00:38:21.890 --> 00:38:21.900 align:start position:0%
law says that so that's what I'm trying
 
00:38:23.690 --> 00:38:23.700 align:start position:0%
to wrap my head around is like when does
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
an officer decide yeah that is to
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
distribute that is one of the elements
 
00:38:29.930 --> 00:38:29.940 align:start position:0%
that would go towards intent to
 
00:38:32.630 --> 00:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
distribute packaging material the amount
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh a drug if the drugs
 
00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.230 align:start position:0%
of the uh a drug if the drugs
pre-packaged

00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
pre-packaged
 
00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
um a lot of money there's a lot of
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
different things that would add up to an
 
00:38:41.569 --> 00:38:41.579 align:start position:0%
intent to distribute having a lot of
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
packages would be one of the elements
 
00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:46.740 align:start position:0%
um well that's what I mean is why
 
00:38:49.010 --> 00:38:49.020 align:start position:0%
couldn't that be a charge in in such a
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
such a scenario if someone had a whole
 
00:38:54.349 --> 00:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
bunch of 10 milligram or whatever
 
00:38:58.250 --> 00:38:58.260 align:start position:0%
packages what what's the limitation I'm
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
guessing like that's what I guess I'm
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
trying to get at is like what would
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
prevent an officer from charging someone
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
with intent to distribute in that
 
00:39:08.450 --> 00:39:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.370 --> 00:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
in my experience
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
having let's say they had five bags each
 
00:39:14.930 --> 00:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
one of them was 10 milligrams or less
 
00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:17.160 align:start position:0%
that certainly would not be enough to
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
charge them with possession with intent
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
to distribute well you could probably
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
charge them but you wouldn't get a
 
00:39:24.349 --> 00:39:24.359 align:start position:0%
conviction you would need other things
 
00:39:26.990 --> 00:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
you you might need some history you
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
might need as as the chairman said a lot
 
00:39:30.589 --> 00:39:30.599 align:start position:0%
of money in this possession maybe some
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
scales for weighing stuff extra
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
packaging equipment on the side you have
 
00:39:37.849 --> 00:39:37.859 align:start position:0%
to have quite a bit to prove uh intent
 
00:39:40.069 --> 00:39:40.079 align:start position:0%
to distribute I just think if if
 
00:39:42.230 --> 00:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
somebody's if somebody packages up four
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
or five 10 milligram bags and they're in
 
00:39:46.970 --> 00:39:46.980 align:start position:0%
their purse that's certainly not going
 
00:39:48.530 --> 00:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
to be enough to charge with intend to
 
00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:50.700 align:start position:0%
distribute my experience representative
 
00:39:52.630 --> 00:39:52.640 align:start position:0%
Mandan what do you think though about
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
the last part of the sentence that says
 
00:39:57.650 --> 00:39:57.660 align:start position:0%
containing normal amounts for the
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
purpose of drug checking I think that it
 
00:40:01.490 --> 00:40:01.500 align:start position:0%
would be difficult to make the argument
 
00:40:03.770 --> 00:40:03.780 align:start position:0%
if you had three or four bags that that
 
00:40:06.050 --> 00:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
was just for drug checking don't you
 
00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:08.750 align:start position:0%
was just for drug checking don't you
think

00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.450 align:start position:0%
 
clarity

00:40:11.450 --> 00:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
clarity
 
00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.550 align:start position:0%
clarity
I

00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:40:15.770 --> 00:40:15.780 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not in support of legalizing
 
00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:17.700 align:start position:0%
any amount of it I mean if you're gonna
 
00:40:19.069 --> 00:40:19.079 align:start position:0%
if you're gonna test it I mean aren't
 
00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:20.579 align:start position:0%
these testing strips something that a
 
00:40:21.650 --> 00:40:21.660 align:start position:0%
person could get
 
00:40:22.910 --> 00:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
I thought that was a point of these
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
fentanyl Tessa strips or or if there's
 
00:40:26.569 --> 00:40:26.579 align:start position:0%
any new drugs coming along as the person
 
00:40:28.130 --> 00:40:28.140 align:start position:0%
would actually could get the test strips
 
00:40:29.690 --> 00:40:29.700 align:start position:0%
and test it on their own not have to
 
00:40:31.730 --> 00:40:31.740 align:start position:0%
bring it somewhere to test it I just see
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
it opening up a door to people now being
 
00:40:36.050 --> 00:40:36.060 align:start position:0%
creative with their packaging to get
 
00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.069 align:start position:0%
creative with their packaging to get
around

00:40:37.069 --> 00:40:37.079 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:40:40.370 --> 00:40:40.380 align:start position:0%
drug possession charges
 
00:40:42.890 --> 00:40:42.900 align:start position:0%
Earths and Roads
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:46.130 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:40:46.130 --> 00:40:46.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
I don't know if this question is
 
00:40:49.670 --> 00:40:49.680 align:start position:0%
necessary for representative Muse or if
 
00:40:51.890 --> 00:40:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's representative Manion
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
the concern that I that I have with this
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
which I've always had
 
00:40:56.700 --> 00:40:59.390 align:start position:0%
which I've always had
is

00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
there's two sides of every coin right so
 
00:41:04.550 --> 00:41:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you're a drug dealer
 
00:41:08.569 --> 00:41:08.579 align:start position:0%
and your intention is to sell Fentanyl
 
00:41:10.670 --> 00:41:10.680 align:start position:0%
would this just not make it a lot easier
 
00:41:13.190 --> 00:41:13.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to show that indeed there is
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
the drug that you're looking for
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
in in this
 
00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.420 align:start position:0%
so how do how
 
00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:23.220 align:start position:0%
how do you how do you combat that
 
00:41:24.829 --> 00:41:24.839 align:start position:0%
because every everybody is very creative
 
00:41:24.839 --> 00:41:25.849 align:start position:0%
because every everybody is very creative
right

00:41:25.849 --> 00:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:41:27.770 --> 00:41:27.780 align:start position:0%
um that that is the concern that I have
 
00:41:29.210 --> 00:41:29.220 align:start position:0%
so representative Mania kind of brought
 
00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:30.720 align:start position:0%
it up and I
 
00:41:30.720 --> 00:41:31.550 align:start position:0%
it up and I
um

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.480 align:start position:0%
I think I would have to have that a
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
little bit more drastic what a what a
 
00:41:37.430 --> 00:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
test strip would do is it would show
 
00:41:40.010 --> 00:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
that fentanyl is is in whatever you're
 
00:41:43.190 --> 00:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
testing what it wouldn't show is the
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
purity of the drug
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
um and it wouldn't necess it it wouldn't
 
00:41:50.450 --> 00:41:50.460 align:start position:0%
necessarily it wouldn't show things like
 
00:41:55.250 --> 00:41:55.260 align:start position:0%
uh like xylazine uh it wouldn't show uh
 
00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes antidepressants or stimulants
 
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:00.540 align:start position:0%
or other things that can be mixed in a
 
00:42:04.310 --> 00:42:04.320 align:start position:0%
pill right so if you're a dealer you
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
know trying to prove let's say that you
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
know this is the good the good stuff I
 
00:42:11.810 --> 00:42:11.820 align:start position:0%
mean all of all the test strip will do
 
00:42:13.790 --> 00:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
is show you that there's a little bit of
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in it it'll it'll be positive
 
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:18.660 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like a pregnancy test trip
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
where you can you know you're 100
 
00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.030 align:start position:0%
where you can you know you're 100
pregnant

00:42:22.030 --> 00:42:22.040 align:start position:0%
pregnant
 
00:42:25.069 --> 00:42:25.079 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:42:27.530 --> 00:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
so it's representative Muse I think that
 
00:42:27.540 --> 00:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
so it's representative Muse I think that
you're

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
I think you are saying exactly what my
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
concern is is that if you are
 
00:42:34.609 --> 00:42:34.619 align:start position:0%
selling it
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
this is going to show you that you are
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
indeed selling what you say you're
 
00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:40.010 align:start position:0%
indeed selling what you say you're
selling

00:42:40.010 --> 00:42:40.020 align:start position:0%
selling
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
well and actually if you if you kind of
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
think that through a little bit too I
 
00:42:46.010 --> 00:42:46.020 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of one of the issues we have
 
00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:47.820 align:start position:0%
is that people don't know they're buying
 
00:42:50.390 --> 00:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
drugs with fentanyl in them
 
00:42:53.569 --> 00:42:53.579 align:start position:0%
um so if it if a dealer actually was to
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
test it I mean part the a big part of
 
00:42:58.970 --> 00:42:58.980 align:start position:0%
the issue is people just don't know what
 
00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140 align:start position:0%
they're taking you know and and that's
 
00:43:04.430 --> 00:43:04.440 align:start position:0%
that's part of that's one of the reasons
 
00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:05.349 align:start position:0%
that's part of that's one of the reasons
why

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:43:08.089 --> 00:43:08.099 align:start position:0%
uh why we're having so many issues with
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
overdosing right now
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
um so I I won't say that you know I I
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that there isn't any
 
00:43:19.250 --> 00:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
conceivable way that parts of this
 
00:43:22.130 --> 00:43:22.140 align:start position:0%
process could conceivably help a drug
 
00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:25.319 align:start position:0%
dealer a little tiny bit but there have
 
00:43:27.950 --> 00:43:27.960 align:start position:0%
been there has been a lot of effort
 
00:43:30.650 --> 00:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
um behind this bill to make sure that
 
00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
what we're actually doing is maximizing
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
the harm that these drugs will you know
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
can do on people who don't understand
 
00:43:42.710 --> 00:43:42.720 align:start position:0%
what they're taking that that's the real
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
focus of it
 
00:43:46.670 --> 00:43:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to at this point
 
00:43:48.589 --> 00:43:48.599 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering I see it as a
 
00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:49.800 align:start position:0%
representative from the chiefs of the
 
00:43:52.130 --> 00:43:52.140 align:start position:0%
Police Association here would you uh
 
00:43:56.809 --> 00:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
based on what you've heard so far I'm
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead I mean
 
00:44:03.589 --> 00:44:03.599 align:start position:0%
what was the reasoning or like what was
 
00:44:04.849 --> 00:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
the basis
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:12.530 --> 00:44:12.540 align:start position:0%
and actually I think I'll I'll let Miss
 
00:44:14.930 --> 00:44:14.940 align:start position:0%
Nolte uh answer that question and I'm
 
00:44:16.309 --> 00:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
going to ask them to come up after the
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
chief talk so okay
 
00:44:22.190 --> 00:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
sure I think I actually know it but I
 
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:23.700 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure I have it 100
 
00:44:25.609 --> 00:44:25.619 align:start position:0%
right thank you
 
00:44:26.990 --> 00:44:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I just want to
 
00:44:29.270 --> 00:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
clarify I'm in support of the testing
 
00:44:31.370 --> 00:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
equipment to test these drugs and I want
 
00:44:33.109 --> 00:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
to make sure everyone knows that I just
 
00:44:35.329 --> 00:44:35.339 align:start position:0%
don't want to reach a point where we
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
legalize any amount of drugs that that
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
people become creative with and now
 
00:44:41.690 --> 00:44:41.700 align:start position:0%
possession becomes an issue even not
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
even dealing just possession alone but I
 
00:44:45.410 --> 00:44:45.420 align:start position:0%
am in support of testing or the ability
 
00:44:46.910 --> 00:44:46.920 align:start position:0%
to test these things
 
00:44:49.370 --> 00:44:49.380 align:start position:0%
go ahead Chief thank you
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
yes good morning members of the
 
00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
committee and uh Mr chair thank you for
 
00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:54.900 align:start position:0%
giving an opportunity to uh to address
 
00:44:57.530 --> 00:44:57.540 align:start position:0%
some of these issues my name is John
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
perfonsky I'm the chief in Bedford and I
 
00:45:02.270 --> 00:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
am the President of the Police
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
Association the Chiefs Association in
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
law enforcement is not opposed to
 
00:45:09.050 --> 00:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips or testing
 
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:11.940 align:start position:0%
equipment as representative just
 
00:45:15.290 --> 00:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
indicated uh we're not in opposition to
 
00:45:17.930 --> 00:45:17.940 align:start position:0%
a fentanyl test strip or any material
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
that would determine whether or not
 
00:45:24.950 --> 00:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
there is illicit or even listed drugs uh
 
00:45:27.710 --> 00:45:27.720 align:start position:0%
in in a particular amount of drugs but
 
00:45:31.430 --> 00:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
we are opposed to any provision that
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
would effectively legalize the
 
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:36.420 align:start position:0%
possession of any quantity of controlled
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
drugs that results in the death of
 
00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
drugs that results in the death of
individuals

00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
individuals
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
for those who may not be familiar with
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
fentanyl right fentanyl two micrograms
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
not milligrams micrograms of fentanyl
 
00:45:49.619 --> 00:45:53.329 align:start position:0%
not milligrams micrograms of fentanyl
which

00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.089 --> 00:45:56.099 align:start position:0%
would sit on the top of Lincoln's head
 
00:45:59.450 --> 00:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
on a penny is enough to kill someone so
 
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
we're we're definitely uh in adamantly
 
00:46:04.609 --> 00:46:04.619 align:start position:0%
opposed to any legislation that would
 
00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
legalize the possession of drugs uh of
 
00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:09.900 align:start position:0%
any quantity that is lethal and can kill
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
people but we're not opposed to uh test
 
00:46:16.130 --> 00:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
strips or other material that would
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
allow someone to determine whether or
 
00:46:20.450 --> 00:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
not a particular quantity of a substance
 
00:46:24.349 --> 00:46:24.359 align:start position:0%
contains a particular drug in it that
 
00:46:26.589 --> 00:46:26.599 align:start position:0%
seems perfectly reasonable
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
and your colleagues across the way have
 
00:46:33.190 --> 00:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
a complimentary bill that that does that
 
00:46:36.650 --> 00:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
but it does not include the drugs that
 
00:46:38.809 --> 00:46:38.819 align:start position:0%
are being tested themselves the notion
 
00:46:41.089 --> 00:46:41.099 align:start position:0%
that people are going to travel to a
 
00:46:43.309 --> 00:46:43.319 align:start position:0%
particular location unless there is
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
something that people are thinking about
 
00:46:48.109 --> 00:46:48.119 align:start position:0%
in terms of setting up a storefront to
 
00:46:50.650 --> 00:46:50.660 align:start position:0%
test drugs which I haven't heard of yet
 
00:46:52.970 --> 00:46:52.980 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that people would be
 
00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:54.230 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that people would be
testing

00:46:54.230 --> 00:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
testing
 
00:46:55.730 --> 00:46:55.740 align:start position:0%
um would be getting test strips and if
 
00:46:58.370 --> 00:46:58.380 align:start position:0%
they had the notion to test whatever
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
they had they would do that wherever
 
00:47:02.569 --> 00:47:02.579 align:start position:0%
they were
 
00:47:07.490 --> 00:47:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh so uh and let me also add that uh in
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
talking to people that are substance
 
00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:13.140 align:start position:0%
abusers and users that have substance
 
00:47:15.849 --> 00:47:15.859 align:start position:0%
abuse disorders that I've talked to over
 
00:47:19.069 --> 00:47:19.079 align:start position:0%
44 years of law enforcement 27 and Drug
 
00:47:20.809 --> 00:47:20.819 align:start position:0%
law enforcement
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
um some will tell you not all some will
 
00:47:24.770 --> 00:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
tell you that they're actively seeking
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
drugs with fentanyl in it for the
 
00:47:30.950 --> 00:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
particular purpose for why that drug is
 
00:47:32.990 --> 00:47:33.000 align:start position:0%
in it it gives them a more euphoric
 
00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:34.550 align:start position:0%
in it it gives them a more euphoric
reaction

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:34.560 align:start position:0%
reaction
 
00:47:38.829 --> 00:47:38.839 align:start position:0%
um than than other drugs and uh honestly
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
I don't want to and I don't hope that
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
the committee is not being misled that
 
00:47:46.370 --> 00:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
drug checking or fentanyl test strips
 
00:47:50.870 --> 00:47:50.880 align:start position:0%
will have a perceptible change in in the
 
00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
drug deaths rate in the state of New
 
00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 473 last year and we're on
 
00:47:57.550 --> 00:47:57.560 align:start position:0%
trajectory to increase that this year
 
00:47:59.990 --> 00:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement desperately desperately
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
wants to reduce that number to zero if
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
at all possible there's been a lot of
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
money in treatment and Recovery which is
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
where it should be
 
00:48:12.530 --> 00:48:12.540 align:start position:0%
and there is more opportunities for
 
00:48:13.970 --> 00:48:13.980 align:start position:0%
treatment recovery than we've ever had
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
in the state which is a good thing
 
00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
but we're swimming in a sea of illegal
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
drugs here in the state and people will
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
use those if they're available
 
00:48:26.390 --> 00:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we desperately need some additional
 
00:48:29.150 --> 00:48:29.160 align:start position:0%
coordination and support to be able to
 
00:48:31.010 --> 00:48:31.020 align:start position:0%
reduce the supply of drugs that are
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
killing more than 470 Granite Staters
 
00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:37.740 align:start position:0%
every year that's appalling to me as a
 
00:48:39.290 --> 00:48:39.300 align:start position:0%
police chief and a law enforcement
 
00:48:40.910 --> 00:48:40.920 align:start position:0%
professional and we are desperately
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
trying to find a way to reduce that
 
00:48:45.109 --> 00:48:45.119 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed to drug checking but
 
00:48:48.170 --> 00:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
please do not add the checking amount of
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:53.870 --> 00:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chief
 
00:48:56.210 --> 00:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
if there were because it's my
 
00:48:57.650 --> 00:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are some places
 
00:48:59.390 --> 00:48:59.400 align:start position:0%
or there will be some places where
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
people could go and have their stuff
 
00:49:01.200 --> 00:49:02.450 align:start position:0%
people could go and have their stuff
checked

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:02.460 align:start position:0%
checked
 
00:49:05.750 --> 00:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
if that if if that were the case how
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
would we address the
 
00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.230 align:start position:0%
would we address the
um

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:10.849 --> 00:49:10.859 align:start position:0%
the people going to have their stuff
 
00:49:13.970 --> 00:49:13.980 align:start position:0%
tested would would there any change to
 
00:49:16.309 --> 00:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
this I know that using a word such as
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
residual versus nominal would any of
 
00:49:21.829 --> 00:49:21.839 align:start position:0%
that help you think or just leave it
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
alone as far as illegality
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
in a practical sense a law enforcement
 
00:49:28.550 --> 00:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
officer is not going to be able to
 
00:49:30.470 --> 00:49:30.480 align:start position:0%
determine someone that's taking a
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
quantity a testable amount of drugs and
 
00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
there needs to be a testable amount
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
right to facilitate because clearly as
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
you indicated they're going to say oh
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
well I'm I'm going to the drug checking
 
00:49:44.809 --> 00:49:44.819 align:start position:0%
facility right the same issue occurs
 
00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:47.660 align:start position:0%
with the drug take-back boxes right
 
00:49:50.990 --> 00:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
there were various iterations of uh take
 
00:49:53.210 --> 00:49:53.220 align:start position:0%
back bill that would allow someone to
 
00:49:55.130 --> 00:49:55.140 align:start position:0%
bring illicit drugs to a take back box
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
well right I get stopped by a trooper
 
00:50:01.550 --> 00:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
and I have a kilo of heroin with me with
 
00:50:03.230 --> 00:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in it well I'm going to take it
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
to the Dropbox facility right how are
 
00:50:07.670 --> 00:50:07.680 align:start position:0%
you going to disprove that you can't in
 
00:50:09.890 --> 00:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
a practical sense so you've created a
 
00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
defensible argument to possession of
 
00:50:14.930 --> 00:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.130 --> 00:50:18.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:20.630 --> 00:50:20.640 align:start position:0%
representative jambrian
 
00:50:23.150 --> 00:50:23.160 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Chief a
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
few questions if I may
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
um a police officer in the field I
 
00:50:29.990 --> 00:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
remember I'm going back to the 1990s
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
when I was actively involved in that
 
00:50:31.619 --> 00:50:33.410 align:start position:0%
when I was actively involved in that
profession

00:50:33.410 --> 00:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
profession
 
00:50:36.230 --> 00:50:36.240 align:start position:0%
um come upon a scene and they find a
 
00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.329 align:start position:0%
um come upon a scene and they find a
substance

00:50:37.329 --> 00:50:37.339 align:start position:0%
substance
 
00:50:39.589 --> 00:50:39.599 align:start position:0%
and obviously you don't want to be
 
00:50:41.210 --> 00:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
touching it as a police officer rubber
 
00:50:44.210 --> 00:50:44.220 align:start position:0%
gloves the whole thing PPE how do you
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
test in the field whether there are
 
00:50:51.470 --> 00:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
illicit drugs present and what drugs can
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
you presently test for
 
00:50:55.790 --> 00:50:55.800 align:start position:0%
well it's been a while since I've done
 
00:50:59.089 --> 00:50:59.099 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr representative so
 
00:51:01.790 --> 00:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
um I'll tell you that the most recent
 
00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:05.220 align:start position:0%
technology right which we don't have DEA
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
has it and they do make it available to
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
State Police and local Municipal it's
 
00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:10.790 align:start position:0%
State Police and local Municipal it's
it's

00:51:10.790 --> 00:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
um a sort of a
 
00:51:16.210 --> 00:51:16.220 align:start position:0%
a device that allows
 
00:51:19.030 --> 00:51:19.040 align:start position:0%
the operator to
 
00:51:21.589 --> 00:51:21.599 align:start position:0%
analyze the the substance without
 
00:51:23.270 --> 00:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
actually touching it right I haven't
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
used it so I'm not exactly sure how that
 
00:51:27.890 --> 00:51:27.900 align:start position:0%
works test strips
 
00:51:31.309 --> 00:51:31.319 align:start position:0%
um are particularly dicey when it comes
 
00:51:33.230 --> 00:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
to fentanyl because if it becomes
 
00:51:36.410 --> 00:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
Airborne in any kind of quantity if it
 
00:51:38.930 --> 00:51:38.940 align:start position:0%
happens to be at a very high potency
 
00:51:42.170 --> 00:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
rate it can induce an overdose and of
 
00:51:44.030 --> 00:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
course you know we're all aware of law
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and other folks
 
00:51:50.030 --> 00:51:50.040 align:start position:0%
that have been um treated at hospitals
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
after succumbing to an overdose when a
 
00:51:55.130 --> 00:51:55.140 align:start position:0%
quantity of material gets airborne right
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
and it's absorbable so
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
testing is usually done by strips or
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
placing a quantity and a tiny little
 
00:52:06.349 --> 00:52:06.359 align:start position:0%
plastic bag mixing it with a reagent or
 
00:52:08.950 --> 00:52:08.960 align:start position:0%
reagents in that bag and then
 
00:52:11.690 --> 00:52:11.700 align:start position:0%
observing the color of the liquid that's
 
00:52:13.370 --> 00:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
in the bag that determines whether or
 
00:52:15.650 --> 00:52:15.660 align:start position:0%
not that particular substance for
 
00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine and and other types of
 
00:52:19.690 --> 00:52:19.700 align:start position:0%
drugs including heroin and whatnot
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's been the most common practice
 
00:52:25.490 --> 00:52:25.500 align:start position:0%
over the years but there is new
 
00:52:27.470 --> 00:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
technology out there that can do it it's
 
00:52:31.510 --> 00:52:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:34.549 --> 00:52:34.559 align:start position:0%
and chief just for the clarity of a
 
00:52:37.250 --> 00:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
committee a positive test on the test
 
00:52:39.650 --> 00:52:39.660 align:start position:0%
kit would was that probable cause to
 
00:52:41.089 --> 00:52:41.099 align:start position:0%
arrest at that point
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh it gives you a presumptive indication
 
00:52:45.470 --> 00:52:45.480 align:start position:0%
that there's a presence of illicit drugs
 
00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:46.370 align:start position:0%
that there's a presence of illicit drugs
right

00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:52:49.490 --> 00:52:49.500 align:start position:0%
um and then the sample or the quantity
 
00:52:50.930 --> 00:52:50.940 align:start position:0%
would then have to be sent to the state
 
00:52:54.290 --> 00:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
forensic lab to be subject to a higher
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
level of tests with a gas chromat
 
00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:58.130 align:start position:0%
level of tests with a gas chromat
chromatographer

00:52:58.130 --> 00:52:58.140 align:start position:0%
chromatographer
 
00:53:01.970 --> 00:53:01.980 align:start position:0%
big machine to test to make sure that it
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:07.849 --> 00:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
00:53:09.410 --> 00:53:09.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:53:14.450 --> 00:53:14.460 align:start position:0%
so if someone has a pill that they don't
 
00:53:16.609 --> 00:53:16.619 align:start position:0%
know what's in it
 
00:53:19.609 --> 00:53:19.619 align:start position:0%
and they bring a portion that has 10
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
milligrams in it to wherever or they get
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
stopped or it is tested
 
00:53:27.470 --> 00:53:27.480 align:start position:0%
with the method you you indicated
 
00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:30.240 align:start position:0%
it would tell you there could be any
 
00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:32.700 align:start position:0%
number of illicit drugs is there's there
 
00:53:34.609 --> 00:53:34.619 align:start position:0%
are limited how much can it tell you
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
about that other than there's an illicit
 
00:53:39.349 --> 00:53:39.359 align:start position:0%
drug in it and how does it know right a
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strip could only tell you
 
00:53:44.990 --> 00:53:45.000 align:start position:0%
that there is a a detectable quantity of
 
00:53:46.910 --> 00:53:46.920 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in whatever substance you're
 
00:53:49.010 --> 00:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
you're exposing that's stripped to right
 
00:53:50.690 --> 00:53:50.700 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't tell you whether or not
 
00:53:53.809 --> 00:53:53.819 align:start position:0%
there is a lethal dose or uh or less
 
00:53:57.770 --> 00:53:57.780 align:start position:0%
than lethal dose involved so
 
00:54:00.650 --> 00:54:00.660 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's not it's not the perfect
 
00:54:04.150 --> 00:54:04.160 align:start position:0%
answer or solution uh simply because
 
00:54:06.589 --> 00:54:06.599 align:start position:0%
most of the samples from what I
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
understand from talking to the folks at
 
00:54:11.990 --> 00:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
DEA and State Police for the last couple
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
of years unfortunately most of the
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
samples that are obtained through
 
00:54:19.910 --> 00:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
investigations or C's contain Fentanyl
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
all right so virtually most most of the
 
00:54:25.549 --> 00:54:25.559 align:start position:0%
substances out there contain a
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
detectable amount of fentanyl xylazine
 
00:54:33.049 --> 00:54:33.059 align:start position:0%
is more troubling as you may know it's
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
um it's a sedative that's used by large
 
00:54:38.329 --> 00:54:38.339 align:start position:0%
animal vets typically
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's in schedule three of the Controlled
 
00:54:44.690 --> 00:54:44.700 align:start position:0%
Substances Act and it is not an opioid
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
so therefore an opioid Agonist like
 
00:54:50.930 --> 00:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
naloxone has no effect on xylazine right
 
00:54:53.089 --> 00:54:53.099 align:start position:0%
and I'm not aware and I don't think that
 
00:54:55.329 --> 00:54:55.339 align:start position:0%
there is any uh
 
00:54:58.210 --> 00:54:58.220 align:start position:0%
manufactured or available testing
 
00:55:01.069 --> 00:55:01.079 align:start position:0%
material that would allow someone in the
 
00:55:04.849 --> 00:55:04.859 align:start position:0%
field to test for xylazine right so and
 
00:55:06.589 --> 00:55:06.599 align:start position:0%
the other question that we're struggling
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
to get an answer to frankly is what is
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
the source of the xylazine that is now
 
00:55:16.549 --> 00:55:16.559 align:start position:0%
showing up in a fairly sizable number of
 
00:55:19.490 --> 00:55:19.500 align:start position:0%
seizures in New Hampshire is it being
 
00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:22.200 align:start position:0%
illicitly produced in clandestine Labs
 
00:55:24.650 --> 00:55:24.660 align:start position:0%
like fentanyl is it being diverted from
 
00:55:28.309 --> 00:55:28.319 align:start position:0%
the legal Market or is it a combination
 
00:55:30.170 --> 00:55:30.180 align:start position:0%
of the two so we're still struggling to
 
00:55:32.270 --> 00:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
try to get the answer to that the
 
00:55:34.910 --> 00:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
assumption is is that the xylazine that
 
00:55:36.410 --> 00:55:36.420 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as being clandestinely
 
00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:38.270 align:start position:0%
we're seeing as being clandestinely
manufactured

00:55:38.270 --> 00:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
manufactured
 
00:55:38.280 --> 00:55:40.490 align:start position:0%
manufactured
follow-up

00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:55:41.990 --> 00:55:42.000 align:start position:0%
so you've answered the question
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
reference to test strips
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
I was also interested in the the type of
 
00:55:49.670 --> 00:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
testing you described that a police
 
00:55:51.770 --> 00:55:51.780 align:start position:0%
officer would do with a small substance
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
in a particular reagent and it would
 
00:55:57.170 --> 00:55:57.180 align:start position:0%
indicate that there were illegal drugs
 
00:55:59.450 --> 00:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
is that the same same type of answer
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
it's the presumptive amount right so if
 
00:56:06.170 --> 00:56:06.180 align:start position:0%
there is a a sign if there is a
 
00:56:08.990 --> 00:56:09.000 align:start position:0%
sufficient quantity of drugs to be able
 
00:56:11.750 --> 00:56:11.760 align:start position:0%
to expose it to a reagent and you need a
 
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:15.140 align:start position:0%
bit right and put it in a plastic bag
 
00:56:18.829 --> 00:56:18.839 align:start position:0%
and mix it with the reagent that gives
 
00:56:20.589 --> 00:56:20.599 align:start position:0%
you the presumptive indication
 
00:56:22.930 --> 00:56:22.940 align:start position:0%
presumptively right
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
that that tested testable substance
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
contains whatever you're testing it
 
00:56:29.690 --> 00:56:29.700 align:start position:0%
against right whether it's
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
methamphetamine heroin or whatever the
 
00:56:34.150 --> 00:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
other case may be
 
00:56:39.010 --> 00:56:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.930 --> 00:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
00:56:43.549 --> 00:56:43.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you chief
 
00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
for taking my question based on your
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
training experience have you ever found
 
00:56:48.530 --> 00:56:48.540 align:start position:0%
any drug dealers that are really
 
00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
concerned with the end users of their
 
00:56:50.819 --> 00:56:52.069 align:start position:0%
concerned with the end users of their
product

00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunately there are
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
um you know at the lower level of the
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
drug trafficking Spectrum a number of
 
00:57:04.069 --> 00:57:04.079 align:start position:0%
people support their drug use uh by
 
00:57:07.490 --> 00:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
selling uh smaller quantities of drugs
 
00:57:10.790 --> 00:57:10.800 align:start position:0%
so the answer to that is yes
 
00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:11.329 align:start position:0%
so the answer to that is yes
um

00:57:11.329 --> 00:57:11.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
typically traffickers at the higher
 
00:57:16.790 --> 00:57:16.800 align:start position:0%
level of the spectrum don't simply
 
00:57:19.549 --> 00:57:19.559 align:start position:0%
because they know that if they become
 
00:57:21.410 --> 00:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
their own best customer they're likely
 
00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:25.140 align:start position:0%
not to survive or make the best business
 
00:57:27.290 --> 00:57:27.300 align:start position:0%
judgments with respect to drug
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking so Folks at the higher end
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
of the trafficking Spectrum typically
 
00:57:34.490 --> 00:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
don't use but at middle and low ends of
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
the traffic I found that a fairly
 
00:57:39.290 --> 00:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
sizable number of people support their
 
00:57:42.589 --> 00:57:42.599 align:start position:0%
habits and substance use disorder by
 
00:57:44.390 --> 00:57:44.400 align:start position:0%
selling it to friends and acquaintances
 
00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:45.609 align:start position:0%
selling it to friends and acquaintances
or

00:57:45.609 --> 00:57:45.619 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
on the street thank you chief
 
00:57:51.650 --> 00:57:51.660 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
00:57:54.410 --> 00:57:54.420 align:start position:0%
um so I just wanted to clarify first of
 
00:57:58.549 --> 00:57:58.559 align:start position:0%
all that 10 milligrams is about the size
 
00:58:01.370 --> 00:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
of a half a grain of rice right it's
 
00:58:03.890 --> 00:58:03.900 align:start position:0%
it's a very very very small amount to
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
carry around small bags of 10 milligrams
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
in each one is
 
00:58:12.349 --> 00:58:12.359 align:start position:0%
just an interesting thought but the
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
question that I wanted to ask was
 
00:58:18.650 --> 00:58:18.660 align:start position:0%
um you know the benefit of you know as
 
00:58:20.210 --> 00:58:20.220 align:start position:0%
we've said functional test strips just
 
00:58:21.589 --> 00:58:21.599 align:start position:0%
tell you whether or not there's it's
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's in it it's yes or no
 
00:58:25.190 --> 00:58:25.200 align:start position:0%
um whereas
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
um the other analyzing equipment would
 
00:58:28.849 --> 00:58:28.859 align:start position:0%
be able to give you kind of a breakdown
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
of what Senate right and uh you know as
 
00:58:32.930 --> 00:58:32.940 align:start position:0%
one of my colleagues said
 
00:58:34.490 --> 00:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
um you know there's two sides you can
 
00:58:35.809 --> 00:58:35.819 align:start position:0%
kind of look at it from either side and
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
I think I'm curious if you think that
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful in the overall
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
um fight against you know
 
00:58:47.030 --> 00:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
um to to to reduce uh the harm on people
 
00:58:48.950 --> 00:58:48.960 align:start position:0%
and really to get a handle on these
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
things for us to know how much of what
 
00:58:53.089 --> 00:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
there is and then to also be able to get
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
like an early heads up of what new
 
00:58:57.230 --> 00:58:57.240 align:start position:0%
things are coming especially with the
 
00:59:00.250 --> 00:59:00.260 align:start position:0%
prevalence of xylazine now uh very very
 
00:59:03.170 --> 00:59:03.180 align:start position:0%
difficult thing to handle but don't you
 
00:59:04.609 --> 00:59:04.619 align:start position:0%
think that knowledge is power that would
 
00:59:07.190 --> 00:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
be really good for us to to be able to
 
00:59:09.470 --> 00:59:09.480 align:start position:0%
fight back against it
 
00:59:11.150 --> 00:59:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question well it's
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
it's a philosophical argument all right
 
00:59:15.289 --> 00:59:15.299 align:start position:0%
and it's a philosophical decision
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
because what you're what you're
 
00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:20.780 align:start position:0%
proposing or what you're postulating is
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
a strategy that bumps up against
 
00:59:27.710 --> 00:59:27.720 align:start position:0%
facilitating drug use right and and
 
00:59:29.870 --> 00:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's the philosophical question that
 
00:59:32.870 --> 00:59:32.880 align:start position:0%
we all struggle with right what can we
 
00:59:37.010 --> 00:59:37.020 align:start position:0%
do to control and reduce because if the
 
00:59:40.309 --> 00:59:40.319 align:start position:0%
premise is right if the premise is that
 
00:59:42.289 --> 00:59:42.299 align:start position:0%
we don't want people using illicit drugs
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
that causes harm to them in the
 
00:59:47.930 --> 00:59:47.940 align:start position:0%
community right then we don't want to
 
00:59:50.710 --> 00:59:50.720 align:start position:0%
engage in any sort of
 
00:59:54.530 --> 00:59:54.540 align:start position:0%
legal exercise that ends up facilitating
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
drug use which we don't want people to
 
01:00:00.470 --> 01:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
do from the foundational perspective
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
right so that's the struggle that we
 
01:00:07.309 --> 01:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
have and so in a society that we have
 
01:00:09.950 --> 01:00:09.960 align:start position:0%
today where we're we're effectively
 
01:00:12.849 --> 01:00:12.859 align:start position:0%
swimming in a sea of illicit drugs right
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
have in fact do we engage in that kind
 
01:00:18.650 --> 01:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
of activity without effectively
 
01:00:21.289 --> 01:00:21.299 align:start position:0%
legalizing possession of controlled
 
01:00:23.809 --> 01:00:23.819 align:start position:0%
drugs so that's that's really the
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
problem right can I follow up really
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
quickly I think
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
because you brought up kind of what is
 
01:00:31.670 --> 01:00:31.680 align:start position:0%
the premise right what do we really want
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
to accomplish I would just put that a
 
01:00:34.849 --> 01:00:34.859 align:start position:0%
little bit differently I would say the
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
premise is that we don't want people to
 
01:00:36.599 --> 01:00:37.549 align:start position:0%
premise is that we don't want people to
die

01:00:37.549 --> 01:00:37.559 align:start position:0%
die
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
and I think that you know something like
 
01:00:42.170 --> 01:00:42.180 align:start position:0%
this is that's really at at the heart of
 
01:00:45.049 --> 01:00:45.059 align:start position:0%
harm reduction is you know to say that
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
you know people may fall down that that
 
01:00:51.230 --> 01:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
go down that road and it's unfortunate
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
we don't want to encourage it or
 
01:00:55.069 --> 01:00:55.079 align:start position:0%
facilitate it but at the end of the day
 
01:00:56.569 --> 01:00:56.579 align:start position:0%
we want to keep people alive long enough
 
01:00:59.390 --> 01:00:59.400 align:start position:0%
for them to be able to to you know have
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
the chance to get out of that if they
 
01:01:03.170 --> 01:01:03.180 align:start position:0%
can so thank you
 
01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:06.839 align:start position:0%
you're welcome represent Bolden
 
01:01:08.510 --> 01:01:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:01:10.690 --> 01:01:10.700 align:start position:0%
um I think it was like
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
2015 that the house passed and the
 
01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:17.160 align:start position:0%
governor signed legislation
 
01:01:21.410 --> 01:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
um to give immunity from arrest
 
01:01:23.809 --> 01:01:23.819 align:start position:0%
um if the evidence for possession of
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh a controlled substance was found
 
01:01:31.130 --> 01:01:31.140 align:start position:0%
um when an orbital overdose was reported
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it's called the 9-1-1
 
01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
immunity law
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
um and so I know that's like a
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
complicated way of describing it but
 
01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you have drugs on you
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
um and you're pulled over then you're
 
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
charged with possession but if you have
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
drugs on you and the only reason that
 
01:01:47.930 --> 01:01:47.940 align:start position:0%
that's come to the awareness of an
 
01:01:49.670 --> 01:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
officer is because you're at the scene
 
01:01:51.589 --> 01:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
of an overdose that you reported
 
01:01:53.450 --> 01:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
then under the law New Hampshire you're
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
immune from prosecution so my question
 
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:56.930 align:start position:0%
immune from prosecution so my question
was

01:01:56.930 --> 01:01:56.940 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
um in uh in the time period since 2015
 
01:02:03.410 --> 01:02:03.420 align:start position:0%
have you seen examples of
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
um drug dealers may be deliberately
 
01:02:07.789 --> 01:02:07.799 align:start position:0%
causing overdoses so that they could
 
01:02:09.890 --> 01:02:09.900 align:start position:0%
obtain that immunity because I remember
 
01:02:11.510 --> 01:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
that that was an argument against the
 
01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:14.339 align:start position:0%
legislation at the time and sort of was
 
01:02:15.589 --> 01:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
something that people were worried about
 
01:02:18.410 --> 01:02:18.420 align:start position:0%
that people would find a way to um
 
01:02:20.390 --> 01:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the laws it was
 
01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
proposed so I wasn't sure if maybe you
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
knew of any instances in which
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
um drug dealers were causing overdoses
 
01:02:31.210 --> 01:02:31.220 align:start position:0%
and calling them in to get immunity
 
01:02:34.250 --> 01:02:34.260 align:start position:0%
drug dealers I don't of course I I can't
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
hope to speculate what goes through the
 
01:02:37.609 --> 01:02:37.619 align:start position:0%
mind of a drug dealer and I hope I never
 
01:02:41.030 --> 01:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
could or will but I don't believe that
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
in any right world that they would
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
induce or think about causing a drug
 
01:02:49.970 --> 01:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
overdose simply to escape prosecution by
 
01:02:53.329 --> 01:02:53.339 align:start position:0%
way of the 9-1-1 immunity provision
 
01:02:55.789 --> 01:02:55.799 align:start position:0%
which by the way ladies and gentlemen
 
01:02:58.309 --> 01:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
has not worked out well has it right
 
01:02:59.930 --> 01:02:59.940 align:start position:0%
when we're looking at the highest number
 
01:03:02.990 --> 01:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
of drug overdoses since we began taking
 
01:03:06.650 --> 01:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
stats in 2015 so the fact that we're
 
01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
immunizing people because they call
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 really isn't working out well
 
01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:14.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that we should reverse
 
01:03:15.530 --> 01:03:15.540 align:start position:0%
that but I think we should take a look
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
at what we have done and what is working
 
01:03:20.510 --> 01:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
and what is not working
 
01:03:22.490 --> 01:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
um that no actually I think we've gone
 
01:03:24.049 --> 01:03:24.059 align:start position:0%
far enough a field away from the test
 
01:03:25.190 --> 01:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
strips do you want to ask a question
 
01:03:27.049 --> 01:03:27.059 align:start position:0%
about test trips
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
no okay uh thank you cheers hoping for
 
01:03:32.690 --> 01:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
the data that he cited um because I get
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
I think we all get emails with the
 
01:03:36.650 --> 01:03:36.660 align:start position:0%
overdose statistics and I was hoping
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you could share whatever you have
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
if you have it yeah
 
01:03:43.849 --> 01:03:43.859 align:start position:0%
she's asking if you have the data as far
 
01:03:48.710 --> 01:03:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.720 --> 01:03:49.789 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:03:49.789 --> 01:03:49.799 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:03:52.910 --> 01:03:52.920 align:start position:0%
I I do have those uh I can tell you that
 
01:03:54.170 --> 01:03:54.180 align:start position:0%
um last year of course all the
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
toxicology reports have not been uh
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
completed for 2022 but uh if all those
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
toxicology reports come back positive
 
01:04:06.890 --> 01:04:06.900 align:start position:0%
for controlled drugs uh the number is
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:21.589 --> 01:04:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.870 --> 01:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
sure the office of the medical examiner
 
01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:25.619 align:start position:0%
has those as well so I can certainly get
 
01:04:27.829 --> 01:04:27.839 align:start position:0%
those too thank you very much
 
01:04:29.390 --> 01:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative Reed
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
um so I'm bringing this back to the test
 
01:04:38.630 --> 01:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
strips and the way I'm I'm I think we've
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know really veered off so this bill
 
01:04:44.270 --> 01:04:44.280 align:start position:0%
is about legal you know making
 
01:04:46.789 --> 01:04:46.799 align:start position:0%
um drug checking equipment
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
um okay so if a user is going to go and
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
buy drugs the way I see it is
 
01:04:55.190 --> 01:04:55.200 align:start position:0%
um this could save a life so they go
 
01:04:56.809 --> 01:04:56.819 align:start position:0%
they buy their drug they take it
 
01:04:58.309 --> 01:04:58.319 align:start position:0%
wherever they're going to use they test
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
it they use the drug I the this back and
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
forth over 10 milligram amounts and
 
01:05:06.589 --> 01:05:06.599 align:start position:0%
packaging it and going it I don't think
 
01:05:09.170 --> 01:05:09.180 align:start position:0%
any drug user is going to package their
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
drug go get it tested
 
01:05:15.109 --> 01:05:15.119 align:start position:0%
go back go you that's just not real life
 
01:05:17.650 --> 01:05:17.660 align:start position:0%
I think we need to bring this back to
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
legalizing fentanyl test strips to save
 
01:05:23.569 --> 01:05:23.579 align:start position:0%
lives and if you have an amount of
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
illegal substance in your car then you
 
01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
treat it like it is an illegal substance
 
01:05:30.770 --> 01:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
but if you're pulled over and you have
 
01:05:32.569 --> 01:05:32.579 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips or whatever drug
 
01:05:34.849 --> 01:05:34.859 align:start position:0%
checking equipment that's fine you know
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
but to make it okay to drive around
 
01:05:42.109 --> 01:05:42.119 align:start position:0%
Manchester with little baggies of drugs
 
01:05:43.730 --> 01:05:43.740 align:start position:0%
saying you're getting tests it doesn't
 
01:05:45.410 --> 01:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
make sense to me is there a question
 
01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:47.970 align:start position:0%
representary am I right I guess
 
01:05:47.970 --> 01:05:51.530 align:start position:0%
representary am I right I guess
[Laughter]

01:05:51.530 --> 01:05:51.540 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:05:54.049 --> 01:05:54.059 align:start position:0%
you know does that make sense yeah it
 
01:05:55.490 --> 01:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
does make sense I'll go back to my
 
01:05:56.809 --> 01:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
initial statement which is we're not
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
opposed to fentanyl test drive right
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
we're not opposed to the notion of it
 
01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:01.980 align:start position:0%
right and and I think that your analysis
 
01:06:04.069 --> 01:06:04.079 align:start position:0%
is spot on that folks are not going to
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
be getting in the car and go well let me
 
01:06:07.010 --> 01:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
drive down to the local test strip
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
location and and test this out no
 
01:06:09.650 --> 01:06:09.660 align:start position:0%
they're not going to do that you're
 
01:06:11.390 --> 01:06:11.400 align:start position:0%
going to do it at home uh or wherever
 
01:06:12.829 --> 01:06:12.839 align:start position:0%
they are so
 
01:06:14.450 --> 01:06:14.460 align:start position:0%
um I think that the best way to get this
 
01:06:17.390 --> 01:06:17.400 align:start position:0%
through and make it workable is to
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
remove the provision that contains any
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
kind of uh controlled substance quantity
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
and simply legalize test strips for the
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
purpose that you intended to be used for
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:06:30.589 --> 01:06:30.599 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
01:06:32.809 --> 01:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:06:35.930 --> 01:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
the the fact is that there are or will
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
be drug testing facilities though so
 
01:06:41.450 --> 01:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
would it be amenable to maybe add in a
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
clarification that while in the process
 
01:06:45.950 --> 01:06:45.960 align:start position:0%
of being tested add a drug testing
 
01:06:49.910 --> 01:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
facility that that amount is like that
 
01:06:51.950 --> 01:06:51.960 align:start position:0%
amount is legal because I think
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
otherwise you kind of set up a situation
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
where there could just be like you know
 
01:06:57.230 --> 01:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
people go to get their drugs tested and
 
01:06:58.789 --> 01:06:58.799 align:start position:0%
then police just come and arrest
 
01:06:58.799 --> 01:06:59.890 align:start position:0%
then police just come and arrest
everybody

01:06:59.890 --> 01:06:59.900 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
01:07:03.109 --> 01:07:03.119 align:start position:0%
right I I I don't know I mean if there's
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
any sort of speculation that you're
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to establish drug testing
 
01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:07.609 align:start position:0%
going to establish drug testing
facilities

01:07:07.609 --> 01:07:07.619 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:07:09.770 --> 01:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
um I think that we we would all have to
 
01:07:12.170 --> 01:07:12.180 align:start position:0%
look very carefully at how that would
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
actually play out in the field right
 
01:07:17.089 --> 01:07:17.099 align:start position:0%
um and what quantities are we talking
 
01:07:19.069 --> 01:07:19.079 align:start position:0%
about and there's just a whole range of
 
01:07:19.079 --> 01:07:20.329 align:start position:0%
about and there's just a whole range of
issues

01:07:20.329 --> 01:07:20.339 align:start position:0%
issues
 
01:07:23.630 --> 01:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the start would be to
 
01:07:26.089 --> 01:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
Simply legalize the testing uh to test
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
strips that that you're trying to
 
01:07:30.349 --> 01:07:30.359 align:start position:0%
legalize and and make that something
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
that people can have and use and and
 
01:07:35.089 --> 01:07:35.099 align:start position:0%
then if you want to address this testing
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
facility issue then come back at it
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
later on and take a look at something
 
01:07:41.809 --> 01:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's it's workable
 
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Chief we appreciate your
 
01:07:47.630 --> 01:07:47.640 align:start position:0%
time I'm gonna ask now someone who has
 
01:07:49.250 --> 01:07:49.260 align:start position:0%
something to do with the testing
 
01:07:52.250 --> 01:07:52.260 align:start position:0%
facilities if you'd like to
 
01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:05.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.089 --> 01:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
is it on
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
um sorry thank you for
 
01:08:13.799 --> 01:08:14.569 align:start position:0%
um sorry thank you for
um

01:08:14.569 --> 01:08:14.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm Dr Carrie Nolte I'm a family
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner and a nursing
 
01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
professor and harm reduction researcher
 
01:08:23.390 --> 01:08:23.400 align:start position:0%
at the University of New Hampshire I'm
 
01:08:24.709 --> 01:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
Lauren McGinley I'm the executive
 
01:08:26.269 --> 01:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
director of the New Hampshire harm
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
reduction coalition
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
so the first thing that I thought that
 
01:08:31.669 --> 01:08:31.679 align:start position:0%
representative bolden's bag would be
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
helpful to illustrate is that there are
 
01:08:36.229 --> 01:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
two different you know measures when we
 
01:08:39.050 --> 01:08:39.060 align:start position:0%
think about milligrams as far as potency
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
so you can have a large pill that is a
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
10 milligram pill it could be like a
 
01:08:47.570 --> 01:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
horse pill but you could also have a 10
 
01:08:50.030 --> 01:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
milligram pill that's super tiny and so
 
01:08:52.070 --> 01:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
that is not what we're talking about the
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about is a
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
weight-based measure and so in a baggie
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
we're really talking about like this
 
01:09:01.249 --> 01:09:01.259 align:start position:0%
little corner is 10 milligrams and to
 
01:09:04.370 --> 01:09:04.380 align:start position:0%
just respectfully correct something that
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
Chief profansky said my apologies the um
 
01:09:11.090 --> 01:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
he had cited that the head of Link
 
01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
Lincoln's head was two micrograms but
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
the DEA actually uses that same 410
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
milligrams so I just want to translate
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
that we're not talking about the potency
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a weight-based
 
01:09:25.789 --> 01:09:25.799 align:start position:0%
measure so 10 milligrams does represent
 
01:09:27.590 --> 01:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
Lincoln's head
 
01:09:29.689 --> 01:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
um on a Penny thank you I couldn't
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
remember the coin
 
01:09:34.070 --> 01:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and so I I think I hope that that's
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
helpful I I think when I'm so happy to
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
hear that the committee is sound
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
supportive of the test strips
 
01:09:44.570 --> 01:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
um which is which is great
 
01:09:47.570 --> 01:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I in reality that's not a positive
 
01:09:50.150 --> 01:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
change for our state right now fentanyl
 
01:09:51.890 --> 01:09:51.900 align:start position:0%
test strips are already distributed
 
01:09:53.570 --> 01:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
through harm reduction programs they're
 
01:09:55.130 --> 01:09:55.140 align:start position:0%
covered under the syringe service
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
program so any member of a certain
 
01:09:59.990 --> 01:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
service program can possess them within
 
01:10:02.090 --> 01:10:02.100 align:start position:0%
Public Health we always think about a
 
01:10:04.610 --> 01:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
Swiss Cheese model of we're never going
 
01:10:07.070 --> 01:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
to do all the things there's no one
 
01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
solution so we've brought in Good
 
01:10:11.290 --> 01:10:11.300 align:start position:0%
Samaritan laws we've brought in naloxone
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've brought in harm reduction
 
01:10:16.490 --> 01:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
programming fentanyl test strips is
 
01:10:19.390 --> 01:10:19.400 align:start position:0%
another one but comprehensive drug
 
01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
checking is another one and so I clearly
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
the discussion that you're having is
 
01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether to bring in comprehensive drug
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
checking today and So within that you
 
01:10:34.669 --> 01:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
know we we know now since since we have
 
01:10:37.070 --> 01:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
heard um talked to you previously
 
01:10:39.649 --> 01:10:39.659 align:start position:0%
there's already a new synthetic opioid
 
01:10:39.659 --> 01:10:40.630 align:start position:0%
there's already a new synthetic opioid
out

01:10:40.630 --> 01:10:40.640 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:10:43.310 --> 01:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
nitazine apologies for the pronunciation
 
01:10:45.290 --> 01:10:45.300 align:start position:0%
I've only read it and not actually
 
01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
spoken it
 
01:10:49.370 --> 01:10:49.380 align:start position:0%
um but we know that that is um
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
circulating in the drug Supply in the
 
01:10:53.570 --> 01:10:53.580 align:start position:0%
minute Mid-Atlantic States and Maryland
 
01:10:55.669 --> 01:10:55.679 align:start position:0%
in particular and the only way we know
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
that is because they have comprehensive
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
drug checking in those places and so
 
01:11:05.330 --> 01:11:05.340 align:start position:0%
what we what we want to be able to do is
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
that to be on the Forefront of these
 
01:11:10.189 --> 01:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
things and so as we think about the drug
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
doths being as high as they are and
 
01:11:15.770 --> 01:11:15.780 align:start position:0%
having increase last year being the
 
01:11:19.070 --> 01:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
highest year it's not about a policy
 
01:11:21.169 --> 01:11:21.179 align:start position:0%
that didn't work it's that our policies
 
01:11:23.810 --> 01:11:23.820 align:start position:0%
are working it's that we we may have
 
01:11:26.870 --> 01:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
seen 1500 deaths last year if not for
 
01:11:29.149 --> 01:11:29.159 align:start position:0%
all these slices of cheese that we've
 
01:11:31.790 --> 01:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
put in place over the last five years
 
01:11:34.189 --> 01:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
and So within that time as far as I'm
 
01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
aware and looking at the medical
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
examiner reports there hasn't been a
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
heroin death in the state of New
 
01:11:42.229 --> 01:11:42.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in five years they are all
 
01:11:45.169 --> 01:11:45.179 align:start position:0%
fentanyl deaths and so when we think
 
01:11:47.450 --> 01:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
about talking about fentanyl it's
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
ubiquitous it is the drug Supply it's
 
01:11:52.669 --> 01:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
not just something that's there and so
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
you know recently there's been anecdotal
 
01:11:58.370 --> 01:11:58.380 align:start position:0%
reports that are unverified but of of
 
01:12:00.169 --> 01:12:00.179 align:start position:0%
people using
 
01:12:03.050 --> 01:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
um fentanyl test straps on Adderall at a
 
01:12:05.090 --> 01:12:05.100 align:start position:0%
private school in those testing positive
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
and so when we talk about all of these
 
01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:10.260 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that we can do that
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
and offer those Services these the
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive drug checking is a proven
 
01:12:15.120 --> 01:12:16.510 align:start position:0%
comprehensive drug checking is a proven
strategy

01:12:16.510 --> 01:12:16.520 align:start position:0%
strategy
 
01:12:19.010 --> 01:12:19.020 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
um California Rhode Island where they
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
have seen reductions in deaths and part
 
01:12:25.790 --> 01:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
of that is not just the testing itself
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
but the messaging so what we would be
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
able to message out to people who engage
 
01:12:32.689 --> 01:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
with treatment programs and harm
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
reduction programs there's car fentanyl
 
01:12:36.770 --> 01:12:36.780 align:start position:0%
circulating in the supply use extra
 
01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.570 align:start position:0%
circulating in the supply use extra
caution

01:12:38.570 --> 01:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
caution
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
um in in those messaging so it only
 
01:12:42.770 --> 01:12:42.780 align:start position:0%
takes one task to identify a new
 
01:12:46.490 --> 01:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
substance instead of a year of of
 
01:12:49.310 --> 01:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
waiting to find out what it is
 
01:12:52.189 --> 01:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to point out one
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
other thing that came up that was a
 
01:12:57.770 --> 01:12:57.780 align:start position:0%
minor modification So based on the prior
 
01:12:57.780 --> 01:12:59.330 align:start position:0%
minor modification So based on the prior
discussion

01:12:59.330 --> 01:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
um we had talked to some other drug
 
01:13:05.630 --> 01:13:05.640 align:start position:0%
checking experts across the country
 
01:13:08.410 --> 01:13:08.420 align:start position:0%
um to support representative Muses
 
01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:14.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment here and under X under 3 XD
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
um drug packaging means the materials
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
are items used by persons ingesting
 
01:13:21.290 --> 01:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
drugs so specifically there we took out
 
01:13:23.570 --> 01:13:23.580 align:start position:0%
selling or buying to clarify that that
 
01:13:27.470 --> 01:13:27.480 align:start position:0%
was not the intention that to support
 
01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:30.920 align:start position:0%
um drug traffickers testing supplies
 
01:13:33.410 --> 01:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
within that you know within those
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
conversations where the nominal amount
 
01:13:38.689 --> 01:13:38.699 align:start position:0%
came from and where that was added was
 
01:13:41.149 --> 01:13:41.159 align:start position:0%
the concern over compete what you're
 
01:13:43.490 --> 01:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
talking about today can people
 
01:13:43.500 --> 01:13:44.090 align:start position:0%
talking about today can people
um

01:13:44.090 --> 01:13:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:47.450 --> 01:13:47.460 align:start position:0%
can people say I'm bringing this for
 
01:13:50.750 --> 01:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
drug checking and not be you know I'm
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
going to tell you for sure that having
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
their drug dealers are not going to
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
package this little corner of drugs into
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
little plastic baggies based on this
 
01:14:03.530 --> 01:14:03.540 align:start position:0%
it's just not feasible it's not going to
 
01:14:06.169 --> 01:14:06.179 align:start position:0%
happen in my work with people who use
 
01:14:06.179 --> 01:14:07.610 align:start position:0%
happen in my work with people who use
drugs

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:07.620 align:start position:0%
drugs
 
01:14:09.950 --> 01:14:09.960 align:start position:0%
um and so where nominal amount came from
 
01:14:13.010 --> 01:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
was actually legislation in other states
 
01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:14.570 align:start position:0%
was actually legislation in other states
so

01:14:14.570 --> 01:14:14.580 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:17.209 --> 01:14:17.219 align:start position:0%
um if the if the committee would like to
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
move to residual I see no problem with
 
01:14:21.290 --> 01:14:21.300 align:start position:0%
that I think we see no problem with that
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
but what had happened in other states
 
01:14:25.850 --> 01:14:25.860 align:start position:0%
was that people were concerned about the
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
definition of residual and so nominal is
 
01:14:32.209 --> 01:14:32.219 align:start position:0%
actually meant to imply that residual
 
01:14:35.209 --> 01:14:35.219 align:start position:0%
amount that little tiny piece now the
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
other changes in here including moving
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
all of the terminology so the original
 
01:14:43.250 --> 01:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
Bill asked to eliminate preparing
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
packaging repackaging blah blah
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
um completely and loud and clear that
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
was heard that wasn't feasible that may
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
interfere with probable cause but here
 
01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
we're we are specifying that this is for
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
you know drug checking so the mechanism
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
of it would be that
 
01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
um as the chief had spoken about I think
 
01:15:06.830 --> 01:15:06.840 align:start position:0%
it's what he was describing as the same
 
01:15:09.470 --> 01:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
units that we're looking to use that
 
01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
police have used for a public health use
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and so within that you know we need
 
01:15:18.950 --> 01:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
to you can do a test that says this has
 
01:15:22.250 --> 01:15:22.260 align:start position:0%
xylazine fentanyl methamphetamine Etc on
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
the spot you can tell people what is in
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
there you can say yes this Adderall has
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
fentanyl in it
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
but you need to send it out in order to
 
01:15:32.870 --> 01:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
quantify it and so that's why in order
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
to be protected in order to do this work
 
01:15:37.490 --> 01:15:37.500 align:start position:0%
we need to have preparing packaging
 
01:15:40.310 --> 01:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
repackaging all of that not because we
 
01:15:44.330 --> 01:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
we want to eliminate packaging from a
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
probable cause but because we as public
 
01:15:46.800 --> 01:15:47.830 align:start position:0%
probable cause but because we as public
health

01:15:47.830 --> 01:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
practitioners need to be able to do that
 
01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
for this program to be effective
 
01:15:54.770 --> 01:15:54.780 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you for all your time all
 
01:15:56.750 --> 01:15:56.760 align:start position:0%
the different no actually that you um
 
01:15:59.149 --> 01:15:59.159 align:start position:0%
raised a couple questions so
 
01:16:02.209 --> 01:16:02.219 align:start position:0%
if the if the bill said
 
01:16:05.209 --> 01:16:05.219 align:start position:0%
packaging materials for use by the
 
01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
testing facility versus just leaving it
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
blank would that not
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
narrow it down so that only you would be
 
01:16:14.450 --> 01:16:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.370 --> 01:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
that would be
 
01:16:18.530 --> 01:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
a nominal amount definition is under
 
01:16:21.830 --> 01:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
drug checking already so
 
01:16:24.350 --> 01:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
um that to me
 
01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:26.640 align:start position:0%
clarifies the purpose I mean the only I
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
guess the only other thing and I say
 
01:16:30.709 --> 01:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
this as a researcher would be that you
 
01:16:34.570 --> 01:16:34.580 align:start position:0%
know I have a goal of doing research on
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
wounds and Drug checking and so you know
 
01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
I might not be a testing facility but
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
you know it's part of that research and
 
01:16:44.510 --> 01:16:44.520 align:start position:0%
where we can see and and quantify what
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
xylazine is doing to people's skin and
 
01:16:49.189 --> 01:16:49.199 align:start position:0%
that's my next question
 
01:16:52.010 --> 01:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
um the chief brought up you know
 
01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
the existence of these drug checking
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
facilities are you proposing opening one
 
01:16:58.790 --> 01:16:58.800 align:start position:0%
or how would what's the mechanics of
 
01:17:01.250 --> 01:17:01.260 align:start position:0%
this sure yeah I think that
 
01:17:03.169 --> 01:17:03.179 align:start position:0%
um we would love to I mean I think part
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
of it is we need the legislation in
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
place to seek grants and support
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
um they are covered
 
01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
um you know they there has been Federal
 
01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
funding allocated to this we're not
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
looking for State funding at all
 
01:17:17.930 --> 01:17:17.940 align:start position:0%
um and especially for piloting it and
 
01:17:20.930 --> 01:17:20.940 align:start position:0%
getting it out there research funding
 
01:17:23.149 --> 01:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
um is a possibility
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
01:17:27.890 --> 01:17:27.900 align:start position:0%
um what we have seen and I I totally
 
01:17:30.169 --> 01:17:30.179 align:start position:0%
understand the idea that like no one's
 
01:17:32.209 --> 01:17:32.219 align:start position:0%
going to go to these things but in every
 
01:17:34.370 --> 01:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
other place they are they they exist
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
they do and they're overburdened by
 
01:17:39.410 --> 01:17:39.420 align:start position:0%
people wanting tests and samples and
 
01:17:40.970 --> 01:17:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's it that's a really important thing
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
because that is something that a person
 
01:17:44.810 --> 01:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
who uses drugs is doing to protect their
 
01:17:46.430 --> 01:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
own health and safety they're taking
 
01:17:49.610 --> 01:17:49.620 align:start position:0%
action to go check their drugs
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
um and and that leads to other Behavior
 
01:17:53.930 --> 01:17:53.940 align:start position:0%
years of protecting their health and
 
01:17:56.990 --> 01:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
safety like reducing use getting into
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
treatment whatever it is
 
01:18:04.250 --> 01:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
so if someone walks in and they say hey
 
01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:07.560 align:start position:0%
I've got this could you test it
 
01:18:09.590 --> 01:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
you have to ship it out is what you're
 
01:18:11.570 --> 01:18:11.580 align:start position:0%
saying to have it tested or no yeah so
 
01:18:14.870 --> 01:18:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the the ftir machines are a small
 
01:18:17.570 --> 01:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
handheld tiny thing those are what can
 
01:18:20.030 --> 01:18:20.040 align:start position:0%
be used at the point of care and those
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
can so that's where you could say yes
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
this has methamphetamine and Fentanyl in
 
01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
it but in order to quantify is it you
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
know one part Fentanyl and 50 Parts
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
um methamphetamine or whatever it is
 
01:18:36.649 --> 01:18:36.659 align:start position:0%
that has to be sent out to a lab and so
 
01:18:38.510 --> 01:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
previously when I had provided a
 
01:18:42.470 --> 01:18:42.480 align:start position:0%
testimony to the committee I had sent
 
01:18:45.169 --> 01:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
information about drugs data in those
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
reports and that's that lab that's that
 
01:18:50.330 --> 01:18:50.340 align:start position:0%
centralized database that to be honest
 
01:18:51.890 --> 01:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
we don't contribute to in New Hampshire
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
but we benefit from from the samples
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
that are being sent in from Maine and
 
01:18:58.310 --> 01:18:58.320 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and Rhode Island
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
where is this testing facility I believe
 
01:19:03.530 --> 01:19:03.540 align:start position:0%
physically they're located in California
 
01:19:06.050 --> 01:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
so doesn't that also raise federal law
 
01:19:07.970 --> 01:19:07.980 align:start position:0%
questions with you shipping drugs across
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
the country I'm not sure on the
 
01:19:11.689 --> 01:19:11.699 align:start position:0%
particulars about that but I know that
 
01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:14.940 align:start position:0%
those have been addressed through oh
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
okay so I did get to go visit one of the
 
01:19:19.910 --> 01:19:19.920 align:start position:0%
harm reduction based drug testing
 
01:19:22.430 --> 01:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
facilities in Lawrence Massachusetts it
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
was incredibly eye-opening wonderful to
 
01:19:27.050 --> 01:19:27.060 align:start position:0%
see the program I did ask that question
 
01:19:29.990 --> 01:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it falls under some protections
 
01:19:33.169 --> 01:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
offered because the shipment is going to
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
a research-based university
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
um and so this is it's part of a
 
01:19:39.110 --> 01:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
research program
 
01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from the committee
 
01:19:44.330 --> 01:19:44.340 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
01:19:46.010 --> 01:19:46.020 align:start position:0%
yeah could you just give a little
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
thumbnail sketch of what these
 
01:19:49.669 --> 01:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
facilities are like it sounds like your
 
01:19:51.590 --> 01:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
facility is different from a drug
 
01:19:53.510 --> 01:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
checking facility
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
and that drug checking facility has to
 
01:19:58.250 --> 01:19:58.260 align:start position:0%
send it to a lab could you just kind of
 
01:20:00.050 --> 01:20:00.060 align:start position:0%
clear up the difference between all of
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
that and how successful this is in the
 
01:20:04.010 --> 01:20:04.020 align:start position:0%
other states why do people just go there
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
to get it and come sure yeah I would be
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
happy to so like I said in Lawrence
 
01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.649 align:start position:0%
happy to so like I said in Lawrence
Massachusetts

01:20:09.649 --> 01:20:09.659 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
um their drug checking facility sits
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
within a syringe service program or harm
 
01:20:16.850 --> 01:20:16.860 align:start position:0%
reduction program that is sponsored by
 
01:20:18.709 --> 01:20:18.719 align:start position:0%
their Community Health Center and give
 
01:20:21.770 --> 01:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
some space there people would walk in
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
they would be able to engage in syringe
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
Disposal Services first so being able to
 
01:20:30.130 --> 01:20:30.140 align:start position:0%
dispose of their syringes within a bio
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
Hazard bin they would then come through
 
01:20:34.850 --> 01:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
they would meet with a care coordinator
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
who would ask them if they would like to
 
01:20:40.370 --> 01:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
have HIV testing hepatitis C testing if
 
01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:43.080 align:start position:0%
they needed help with any wounds and if
 
01:20:45.470 --> 01:20:45.480 align:start position:0%
they had any drugs to test today at that
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
point the person would come in place the
 
01:20:50.630 --> 01:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
drugs down the chemist would go through
 
01:20:52.850 --> 01:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
the process of checking each individual
 
01:20:56.450 --> 01:20:56.460 align:start position:0%
sample to just give an example of how
 
01:20:58.970 --> 01:20:58.980 align:start position:0%
small the samples needed to be people
 
01:21:00.890 --> 01:21:00.900 align:start position:0%
don't even need to bring in substances
 
01:21:03.050 --> 01:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
they could bring in equipment that they
 
01:21:05.149 --> 01:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
use to mix drugs like a cooker or a
 
01:21:07.850 --> 01:21:07.860 align:start position:0%
cotton a very very very small residual
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
amount left over on something and even
 
01:21:12.470 --> 01:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
that was able to be tested then Cole
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
would be able to deliver preliminary
 
01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
results about that all the while I would
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
say it takes about
 
01:21:22.010 --> 01:21:22.020 align:start position:0%
seven minutes per test
 
01:21:24.229 --> 01:21:24.239 align:start position:0%
um and then in that amount of time
 
01:21:27.890 --> 01:21:27.900 align:start position:0%
people are able to either get their hep
 
01:21:30.290 --> 01:21:30.300 align:start position:0%
C or HIV testing done talk to somebody
 
01:21:32.390 --> 01:21:32.400 align:start position:0%
about if they need a safe place to sleep
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
a warm meal that day do you need an
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
extra sleeping bag here's your Sharps
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
container and here are your initial
 
01:21:40.250 --> 01:21:40.260 align:start position:0%
results and then in about a week to two
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
weeks people as they come in and out of
 
01:21:46.729 --> 01:21:46.739 align:start position:0%
that Center are able to also receive
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
their confirmatory results which is what
 
01:21:56.810 --> 01:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.820 --> 01:21:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
amusement

01:21:58.790 --> 01:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
amusement
 
01:22:02.630 --> 01:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
I just wanted you to to try to maybe
 
01:22:04.370 --> 01:22:04.380 align:start position:0%
expand on on a thought that you
 
01:22:06.530 --> 01:22:06.540 align:start position:0%
introduced earlier you had said that in
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
in the middle Mid-Atlantic states where
 
01:22:11.330 --> 01:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
they actually have drug checking uh in
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
process now one of the things that
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
they're actually able to do is to to
 
01:22:19.189 --> 01:22:19.199 align:start position:0%
identify and track new drugs that come
 
01:22:21.169 --> 01:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
into the system and things like clusters
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
and you said that currently because we
 
01:22:26.510 --> 01:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't do this in New Hampshire we don't
 
01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
have that that kind of data and I
 
01:22:35.830 --> 01:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
how much of a handicap is it not to have
 
01:22:39.590 --> 01:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
data like that uh in in this state if
 
01:22:41.649 --> 01:22:41.659 align:start position:0%
you're actually really trying to stop
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
fentanyl deaths
 
01:22:46.130 --> 01:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I'll speak to that
 
01:22:48.709 --> 01:22:48.719 align:start position:0%
um it it
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
it's frustrating as a public health
 
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
professional I wish that the people that
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
live 30 minutes away from me who are in
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I wish that I had their
 
01:23:01.610 --> 01:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
range of sight their Polaroid picture of
 
01:23:03.290 --> 01:23:03.300 align:start position:0%
their drug Supply situation is much
 
01:23:05.930 --> 01:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
clearer than ours is right now so we
 
01:23:07.550 --> 01:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
don't know which way they're traveling
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's what substances we
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
should be focusing a lot of our effort
 
01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
on talking to our participants about yes
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
there are people that utilize fentanyl
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
but there are also people who
 
01:23:21.830 --> 01:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
occasionally on the weekend utilize
 
01:23:24.470 --> 01:23:24.480 align:start position:0%
cocaine and so if I had an idea of what
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
our cocaine Supply realistically looked
 
01:23:29.209 --> 01:23:29.219 align:start position:0%
like I knew that those recreational
 
01:23:31.550 --> 01:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
users of cocaine could be an area of
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
focus for us instead of focusing on some
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
other areas where maybe the data isn't
 
01:23:37.370 --> 01:23:37.380 align:start position:0%
going to point us in that direction
 
01:23:37.380 --> 01:23:40.370 align:start position:0%
going to point us in that direction
immediately

01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
immediately
 
01:23:43.430 --> 01:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I will just add that there's also a
 
01:23:46.729 --> 01:23:46.739 align:start position:0%
a clinical benefit to this so we know
 
01:23:48.169 --> 01:23:48.179 align:start position:0%
that there's thousands of
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
hospitalizations in New Hampshire for
 
01:23:52.370 --> 01:23:52.380 align:start position:0%
injecting related infections and wounds
 
01:23:55.610 --> 01:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
and so as a nurse practitioner in in
 
01:23:56.870 --> 01:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
healthcare for the homeless and doing
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
Outreach you know we've seen these these
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
changing wounds these sores these things
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
we think that they're related to
 
01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
we think that they're related to
xylazine

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
xylazine
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
um because that's what we've heard from
 
01:24:09.770 --> 01:24:09.780 align:start position:0%
surrounding states
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
um but we don't know that and it would
 
01:24:13.310 --> 01:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
actually change your treatment decision
 
01:24:15.649 --> 01:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
if this was substance use related or
 
01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
maybe a bacteria a different bacterial
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
infection so so there's a benefit to
 
01:24:23.450 --> 01:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
reducing hospitalizations and better
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
treating infection as well
 
01:24:29.209 --> 01:24:29.219 align:start position:0%
how how far away are you from being able
 
01:24:31.250 --> 01:24:31.260 align:start position:0%
to let's say this became law tomorrow
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
how long would it take you to to get one
 
01:24:35.410 --> 01:24:35.420 align:start position:0%
of these facilities up and running
 
01:24:38.030 --> 01:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
one that's a great question I'd love to
 
01:24:39.229 --> 01:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
know the answer
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
um myself
 
01:24:43.729 --> 01:24:43.739 align:start position:0%
um but uh one thing that I I had meant
 
01:24:45.169 --> 01:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
to ask
 
01:24:47.689 --> 01:24:47.699 align:start position:0%
um the uh committee was that for
 
01:24:49.490 --> 01:24:49.500 align:start position:0%
whatever reason this the original Bill
 
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
the effective date was January 1st of
 
01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:54.179 align:start position:0%
next year
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
um in many bills come through as
 
01:25:00.169 --> 01:25:00.179 align:start position:0%
effective in July first and so if that
 
01:25:01.610 --> 01:25:01.620 align:start position:0%
is a possible Amendment you would
 
01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:02.930 align:start position:0%
is a possible Amendment you would
consider

01:25:02.930 --> 01:25:02.940 align:start position:0%
consider
 
01:25:05.090 --> 01:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
um I think we could get there sooner
 
01:25:08.030 --> 01:25:08.040 align:start position:0%
um but if we see this if this does come
 
01:25:11.030 --> 01:25:11.040 align:start position:0%
through for um July 1st we would be
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
searching for funding
 
01:25:15.410 --> 01:25:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you know within the months preceding
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
that in preparation so my hope would be
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
you know early within the year if that
 
01:25:23.390 --> 01:25:23.400 align:start position:0%
were the case
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
who was actually we as UNH involved in
 
01:25:28.729 --> 01:25:28.739 align:start position:0%
this or is it just a coalition who is
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
this yeah so it'd be New Hampshire harm
 
01:25:31.970 --> 01:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
reduction Coalition
 
01:25:34.189 --> 01:25:34.199 align:start position:0%
um and we have service regions for
 
01:25:35.810 --> 01:25:35.820 align:start position:0%
direct service and Stratford County
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
Manchester and Concord and then we
 
01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
support the other syringe service
 
01:25:41.930 --> 01:25:41.940 align:start position:0%
programs or harm reduction programs that
 
01:25:43.610 --> 01:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
exist throughout the state
 
01:25:46.010 --> 01:25:46.020 align:start position:0%
so UNH isn't involved he just happened
 
01:25:48.110 --> 01:25:48.120 align:start position:0%
to work there is that is that correct or
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
I hope that UNH is involved we'll have
 
01:25:51.890 --> 01:25:51.900 align:start position:0%
to negotiate that later but you know
 
01:25:54.890 --> 01:25:54.900 align:start position:0%
there yeah I mean I think as far as um
 
01:25:56.750 --> 01:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
this is something that it falls within
 
01:25:58.729 --> 01:25:58.739 align:start position:0%
my harm reduction research program of
 
01:25:58.739 --> 01:26:00.350 align:start position:0%
my harm reduction research program of
research

01:26:00.350 --> 01:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
research
 
01:26:01.729 --> 01:26:01.739 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:26:03.890 --> 01:26:03.900 align:start position:0%
um preliminary talks we do have some of
 
01:26:05.930 --> 01:26:05.940 align:start position:0%
this equipment and lab supplies that are
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
utilized for other purposes or no longer
 
01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.290 align:start position:0%
utilized for other purposes or no longer
utilized

01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
um but obviously I can't speak on behalf
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
of my employer that they're willing to
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
make that but once the bill is passed we
 
01:26:18.229 --> 01:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
can hopefully do that
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
I represent Stone
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have two quick
 
01:26:24.649 --> 01:26:24.659 align:start position:0%
questions and thank you for taking the
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
questions the first one is when someone
 
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
comes in from the public what quantity
 
01:26:30.530 --> 01:26:30.540 align:start position:0%
of test strips do you give out
 
01:26:30.540 --> 01:26:31.490 align:start position:0%
of test strips do you give out
um

01:26:31.490 --> 01:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
uh whatever they ask for typically we
 
01:26:36.050 --> 01:26:36.060 align:start position:0%
are encouraging people to take the
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips about how many
 
01:26:39.239 --> 01:26:40.070 align:start position:0%
fentanyl test strips about how many
um

01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:41.450 --> 01:26:41.460 align:start position:0%
what's your typical compliment when
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
somebody so we make a kit we have an
 
01:26:44.990 --> 01:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
overdose prevention kit those currently
 
01:26:47.209 --> 01:26:47.219 align:start position:0%
have two fentanyl test strips in it um
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
but if someone came in and they had
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
utilized a fentanyl test strip and they
 
01:26:53.209 --> 01:26:53.219 align:start position:0%
felt like they would work that into the
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
way they use drugs we would be happy
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
handing them 20 or 25 or 30. okay thank
 
01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
you my second question if I'm allowed to
 
01:27:03.590 --> 01:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
proceed uh you mentioned residual
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
testing doesn't that kind of
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
put you in a position where they've
 
01:27:09.530 --> 01:27:09.540 align:start position:0%
already utilized drugs if you're doing
 
01:27:11.570 --> 01:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
residue testing after the fact of using
 
01:27:13.189 --> 01:27:13.199 align:start position:0%
the drugs
 
01:27:15.590 --> 01:27:15.600 align:start position:0%
um yes you're you are correct so um
 
01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
sometimes people will come to the drug
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
testing facilities uh the harm reduction
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
programs and um say I use this drug it
 
01:27:26.030 --> 01:27:26.040 align:start position:0%
did not at all feel like what I was
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
expecting or I
 
01:27:31.010 --> 01:27:31.020 align:start position:0%
um I had an overdose I experienced an
 
01:27:33.050 --> 01:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
adverse reaction that I was not prepared
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
for can you please tell me what's going
 
01:27:41.750 --> 01:27:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
um just really quickly um just because
 
01:27:45.530 --> 01:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:27:47.209 --> 01:27:47.219 align:start position:0%
oh I lost my train of thought with the
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
whole Newman thing okay
 
01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.750 align:start position:0%
whole Newman thing okay
um

01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:01.070 --> 01:28:01.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
I think there's something in the air I
 
01:28:05.510 --> 01:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't know no I mean I think I just I I
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
think I had had it in my mind to ask
 
01:28:08.810 --> 01:28:08.820 align:start position:0%
this but maybe it's
 
01:28:13.250 --> 01:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
clear by now but um that
 
01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:15.900 align:start position:0%
by by explaining that you can seek
 
01:28:19.149 --> 01:28:19.159 align:start position:0%
grants you're saying that this is
 
01:28:22.010 --> 01:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
widely accepted I I want to make sure I
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
understand like it's federally not just
 
01:28:26.930 --> 01:28:26.940 align:start position:0%
tolerated but encouraged
 
01:28:29.209 --> 01:28:29.219 align:start position:0%
and that it's it just comes down to
 
01:28:30.890 --> 01:28:30.900 align:start position:0%
individual states
 
01:28:34.850 --> 01:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
to allow for this kind of activity yeah
 
01:28:36.770 --> 01:28:36.780 align:start position:0%
I think that's what I'm trying to wrap
 
01:28:41.149 --> 01:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:43.189 --> 01:28:43.199 align:start position:0%
you know I failed every science class I
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
ever went in and uh
 
01:28:47.570 --> 01:28:47.580 align:start position:0%
um you said it was a weight-based
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
measure but then you talked about
 
01:28:50.090 --> 01:28:50.100 align:start position:0%
Lincoln's head on a penny which doesn't
 
01:28:53.629 --> 01:28:53.639 align:start position:0%
seem like a weight thing so but maybe it
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter anymore because you're
 
01:28:56.870 --> 01:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
also saying that residual is fine with
 
01:28:58.729 --> 01:28:58.739 align:start position:0%
you and
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
like I was looking at the syringe law
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
the syringe exchange law from what was
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
that like 2017 or something and um it
 
01:29:07.250 --> 01:29:07.260 align:start position:0%
just talks about residual in there
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
because like obviously you can't
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
exchange a used syringe without also
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
moving drugs like you can't transport it
 
01:29:17.090 --> 01:29:17.100 align:start position:0%
to another location because without
 
01:29:18.350 --> 01:29:18.360 align:start position:0%
moving drugs because there's always
 
01:29:20.570 --> 01:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
going to be something in there
 
01:29:21.950 --> 01:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know there's just a couple
 
01:29:23.149 --> 01:29:23.159 align:start position:0%
of things that were on my mind while you
 
01:29:24.470 --> 01:29:24.480 align:start position:0%
were talking was
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
I believe we already have a variety of
 
01:29:30.050 --> 01:29:30.060 align:start position:0%
laws that allow the transport of a
 
01:29:31.689 --> 01:29:31.699 align:start position:0%
minimal amount of drugs
 
01:29:34.850 --> 01:29:34.860 align:start position:0%
for various you know for the purpose of
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
various good outcomes ideally and then
 
01:29:40.250 --> 01:29:40.260 align:start position:0%
um acknowledging that the feds are
 
01:29:41.570 --> 01:29:41.580 align:start position:0%
pretty cool with this given that they're
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
handing out money for it and that is
 
01:29:45.950 --> 01:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
just our job to enable you to do that
 
01:29:48.050 --> 01:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
and then um the difference between
 
01:29:50.570 --> 01:29:50.580 align:start position:0%
weight and Lincoln's head yes anything
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
you want to say that but you know I
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
think the community's kind of all set to
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
you think the the Lincoln's head on a
 
01:29:57.530 --> 01:29:57.540 align:start position:0%
penny is slightly difficult we utilize
 
01:29:59.450 --> 01:29:59.460 align:start position:0%
that as just a very quick tool that
 
01:30:01.010 --> 01:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
somebody could utilize if they were
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
using a fentanyl test strip at home if
 
01:30:06.649 --> 01:30:06.659 align:start position:0%
the mass of any substance out there were
 
01:30:08.750 --> 01:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than what we're
 
01:30:12.830 --> 01:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
seeing substances appear as then you're
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
right it would be different but it's
 
01:30:16.610 --> 01:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
kind of just that these are generally
 
01:30:19.010 --> 01:30:19.020 align:start position:0%
going to be a powder that are around the
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
same weight and that weight is going to
 
01:30:23.890 --> 01:30:23.900 align:start position:0%
fit about into Lincoln's head on a penny
 
01:30:26.570 --> 01:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
additionally I I tell this to everybody
 
01:30:29.689 --> 01:30:29.699 align:start position:0%
Amazon sells 10 milligram Scoops if
 
01:30:32.149 --> 01:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
anybody feels like looking them up you
 
01:30:35.270 --> 01:30:35.280 align:start position:0%
are able to gauge very easily how much a
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
powdered scoop would scoop if it was 10
 
01:30:38.159 --> 01:30:39.770 align:start position:0%
powdered scoop would scoop if it was 10
milligrams

01:30:39.770 --> 01:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
milligrams
 
01:30:41.570 --> 01:30:41.580 align:start position:0%
um I just want to speak to the the feds
 
01:30:44.689 --> 01:30:44.699 align:start position:0%
on both bills for fentanyl test strips
 
01:30:46.450 --> 01:30:46.460 align:start position:0%
and all types of test strips
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
benzodiazepine and xylazine
 
01:30:54.229 --> 01:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
um the the so samsa and the CDC in April
 
01:30:57.410 --> 01:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
of 2021 actually made a widespread
 
01:30:59.450 --> 01:30:59.460 align:start position:0%
widespread request to all of their
 
01:31:01.490 --> 01:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
funded agencies to say please start
 
01:31:04.729 --> 01:31:04.739 align:start position:0%
utilizing fentanyl test strips as an
 
01:31:06.830 --> 01:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
overdose prevention tool so that was
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
April of 21.
 
01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:09.590 align:start position:0%
April of 21.
um

01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:13.669 --> 01:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
and while ssps are covered in being able
 
01:31:16.070 --> 01:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
to dispense those I don't see enough
 
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
people each month to make a dent in what
 
01:31:21.950 --> 01:31:21.960 align:start position:0%
would be able to be done if we had a
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
recovery Community organizations doctors
 
01:31:26.990 --> 01:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
offices Med Vans homeless Outreach
 
01:31:29.570 --> 01:31:29.580 align:start position:0%
workers homeless shelters being able to
 
01:31:31.990 --> 01:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
distribute fentanyl test strips as well
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
and then Federal funding
 
01:31:38.689 --> 01:31:38.699 align:start position:0%
are the feds okay with drugs oh okay
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah and so I I think there's many
 
01:31:44.930 --> 01:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
um both Public Health projects research
 
01:31:47.810 --> 01:31:47.820 align:start position:0%
projects that are funded federally
 
01:31:49.070 --> 01:31:49.080 align:start position:0%
um it's very interesting when you
 
01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
comment on like it's up to
 
01:31:54.470 --> 01:31:54.480 align:start position:0%
um states to make their own decision
 
01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:56.219 align:start position:0%
um part of part of what we've seen in
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
other states is when you look at these
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
the the drug paraphernalia law that this
 
01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:02.510 align:start position:0%
the the drug paraphernalia law that this
is

01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:32:04.129 --> 01:32:04.139 align:start position:0%
um amending
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
um it these terms are in almost every
 
01:32:09.350 --> 01:32:09.360 align:start position:0%
state or were at one point in every
 
01:32:10.850 --> 01:32:10.860 align:start position:0%
state that cultivating growing
 
01:32:13.070 --> 01:32:13.080 align:start position:0%
harvesting bill so there's sort of like
 
01:32:15.649 --> 01:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
a template of drug paraphernalia that
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
was enacted in across the states
 
01:32:23.090 --> 01:32:23.100 align:start position:0%
um with a lot of variation and so not
 
01:32:25.610 --> 01:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
anticipating that then drug checking
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
would become this really important
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
overdose prevention tool and so you know
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
then it is up to each state individually
 
01:32:35.330 --> 01:32:35.340 align:start position:0%
to decide to amend them in order to
 
01:32:36.890 --> 01:32:36.900 align:start position:0%
enable it
 
01:32:38.810 --> 01:32:38.820 align:start position:0%
um and the one other thing I wanted to
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
say the the residual piece
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
um you know it that would be fine
 
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
um I think that would be I I don't see
 
01:32:48.890 --> 01:32:48.900 align:start position:0%
an issue for that for nominal going away
 
01:32:51.830 --> 01:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm the only reason it was in there
 
01:32:56.090 --> 01:32:56.100 align:start position:0%
was that residual was in other states
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
got pushed back and they wanted a
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
measurement that was quantifiable and
 
01:33:02.870 --> 01:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
that was that was what we came to for
 
01:33:05.450 --> 01:33:05.460 align:start position:0%
what was needed for testing
 
01:33:07.790 --> 01:33:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you okay I think the committee has
 
01:33:09.709 --> 01:33:09.719 align:start position:0%
enough information at this point um
 
01:33:12.290 --> 01:33:12.300 align:start position:0%
we're going to go ahead and close this
 
01:33:14.810 --> 01:33:14.820 align:start position:0%
work session and we'll take it up at um
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
executive in a little while we need to
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
move on to the next public hearing so
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for helping us again
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to close the work session
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
on 287 470 and open the public hearing
 
01:33:32.030 --> 01:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
on HP 397 and invite the sponsor to
 
01:33:39.490 --> 01:33:39.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.450 --> 01:33:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:46.129 --> 01:33:46.139 align:start position:0%
good morning sorry for making you wait
 
01:33:47.149 --> 01:33:47.159 align:start position:0%
so long
 
01:33:49.610 --> 01:33:49.620 align:start position:0%
it's all right work happens
 
01:33:51.709 --> 01:33:51.719 align:start position:0%
um I apologize I put my kids out the
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
call so um hopefully that wasn't
 
01:33:55.550 --> 01:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
disruptive my name is Emily Phillips I'm
 
01:33:58.930 --> 01:33:58.940 align:start position:0%
uh Rockingham district 7 representative
 
01:34:01.370 --> 01:34:01.380 align:start position:0%
this has already been passed through
 
01:34:04.310 --> 01:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services on consent but
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
what it does is it decriminalizes minor
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
children who handle hypodermic needles
 
01:34:13.370 --> 01:34:13.380 align:start position:0%
or pen tips for say their parents who
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
have an authorized prescription for it
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm a type 1 diabetic so I actually
 
01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
didn't know this was uh
 
01:34:22.070 --> 01:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
you know illegal but my my daughter will
 
01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:24.900 align:start position:0%
deliver my pen needle to me or my hold
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
my purse with my insulin in it or my
 
01:34:26.580 --> 01:34:27.770 align:start position:0%
my purse with my insulin in it or my
syringes

01:34:27.770 --> 01:34:27.780 align:start position:0%
syringes
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
um so the act of her handling that
 
01:34:32.570 --> 01:34:32.580 align:start position:0%
currently is against the law so this
 
01:34:34.850 --> 01:34:34.860 align:start position:0%
will allow minor children to become what
 
01:34:36.290 --> 01:34:36.300 align:start position:0%
we are what we're determining to be
 
01:34:38.870 --> 01:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
called authorized agents and as long as
 
01:34:41.149 --> 01:34:41.159 align:start position:0%
they are doing so under supervision of
 
01:34:43.209 --> 01:34:43.219 align:start position:0%
somebody with a legit prescription need
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
they would be authorized to handle those
 
01:34:48.649 --> 01:34:48.659 align:start position:0%
devices it's been trimmed down from the
 
01:34:51.530 --> 01:34:51.540 align:start position:0%
original version so um
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
the pretty simple Bill I just think it's
 
01:34:55.550 --> 01:34:55.560 align:start position:0%
um a law that shouldn't even exist so
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
we're fixing it
 
01:34:59.390 --> 01:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone have any questions
 
01:35:00.830 --> 01:35:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
01:35:02.149 --> 01:35:02.159 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question has there been any
 
01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
any history of any uh juveniles
 
01:35:08.870 --> 01:35:08.880 align:start position:0%
convicted or charged with a crime of
 
01:35:11.030 --> 01:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
handling a hypodermic needle so if they
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
had been it would be sealed so we
 
01:35:14.930 --> 01:35:14.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't know there'd be no tracking
 
01:35:16.129 --> 01:35:16.139 align:start position:0%
information there correct and it's on
 
01:35:18.370 --> 01:35:18.380 align:start position:0%
their chins correct
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any tracking under
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
your chins
 
01:35:24.890 --> 01:35:24.900 align:start position:0%
I don't know the answer to that so um
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
you know we don't want to
 
01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
leave so I think the law as it exists
 
01:35:31.370 --> 01:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
now there's a flaw there and you
 
01:35:32.330 --> 01:35:32.340 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want it to be used against
 
01:35:35.149 --> 01:35:35.159 align:start position:0%
somebody under you know um
 
01:35:38.450 --> 01:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
child family services as a neglectful
 
01:35:38.460 --> 01:35:39.709 align:start position:0%
child family services as a neglectful
action

01:35:39.709 --> 01:35:39.719 align:start position:0%
action
 
01:35:41.209 --> 01:35:41.219 align:start position:0%
as it's written now I think that
 
01:35:43.610 --> 01:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
corrects it
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
how did this uh come about for a change
 
01:35:49.610 --> 01:35:49.620 align:start position:0%
in legislation it was um I guess last
 
01:35:51.290 --> 01:35:51.300 align:start position:0%
year was submitted and it was there was
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
more to it there was something about
 
01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:55.139 align:start position:0%
um the needle exchange program allowing
 
01:35:56.930 --> 01:35:56.940 align:start position:0%
miners to have access through that
 
01:35:58.070 --> 01:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
program as well and some other
 
01:35:59.510 --> 01:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
information I think it was trying to
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
repeal the entire law and this just adds
 
01:36:04.850 --> 01:36:04.860 align:start position:0%
the authorized agent aspect
 
01:36:06.649 --> 01:36:06.659 align:start position:0%
um so it was presented to me so I'm a
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
type 1 diabetic I carry all my supplies
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
and some none of the representatives
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
says you know that you're breaking the
 
01:36:13.010 --> 01:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
law right like if my daughter holds that
 
01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:14.699 align:start position:0%
and I said no I didn't explain this to
 
01:36:16.430 --> 01:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
me so I was like well I'll I'll sponsor
 
01:36:18.590 --> 01:36:18.600 align:start position:0%
this so that's how I came into my hands
 
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:36:28.189 --> 01:36:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking this question
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
I spent the last two years working at a
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
summer camp
 
01:36:36.410 --> 01:36:36.420 align:start position:0%
and in that summer camp the the campers
 
01:36:38.030 --> 01:36:38.040 align:start position:0%
are required
 
01:36:39.649 --> 01:36:39.659 align:start position:0%
to be buddies
 
01:36:42.530 --> 01:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
so there was always a protection that
 
01:36:44.750 --> 01:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
would be two of them
 
01:36:47.450 --> 01:36:47.460 align:start position:0%
and there were some cases where a person
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
had a nut allergy
 
01:36:52.970 --> 01:36:52.980 align:start position:0%
and his buddy carried his EpiPen what
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
you're telling me is that under state
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
law now as it stands right now that was
 
01:37:00.110 --> 01:37:00.120 align:start position:0%
actually an unlawful Act
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um another example I didn't
 
01:37:03.649 --> 01:37:03.659 align:start position:0%
and I'm sorry I didn't prepare a written
 
01:37:05.870 --> 01:37:05.880 align:start position:0%
statement but a teenage babysitter who
 
01:37:07.790 --> 01:37:07.800 align:start position:0%
had to help administer insulin to a
 
01:37:09.950 --> 01:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
child although the teenage babysitter
 
01:37:11.270 --> 01:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
was given a permission by the parents to
 
01:37:12.770 --> 01:37:12.780 align:start position:0%
help that child that teenage babysitter
 
01:37:14.810 --> 01:37:14.820 align:start position:0%
is breaking the law uh same thing with
 
01:37:17.510 --> 01:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
an EpiPen although the EpiPen thing it's
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
life-saving so you could be covered
 
01:37:20.750 --> 01:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
under the Good Samaritan law or
 
01:37:22.250 --> 01:37:22.260 align:start position:0%
something in that example but there's
 
01:37:24.290 --> 01:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
something called glucagon which is a um
 
01:37:26.110 --> 01:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
a life-saving
 
01:37:28.669 --> 01:37:28.679 align:start position:0%
vial that would be so if I went
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
unconscious I had a low blood sugar I
 
01:37:33.890 --> 01:37:33.900 align:start position:0%
this product is advised to be injected
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
into my thigh when I'm unconscious so
 
01:37:38.090 --> 01:37:38.100 align:start position:0%
I've taught my children who I feel
 
01:37:39.470 --> 01:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
responsible enough to save my life
 
01:37:41.209 --> 01:37:41.219 align:start position:0%
because minutes matter how to use this
 
01:37:43.010 --> 01:37:43.020 align:start position:0%
so if they did save my life they would
 
01:37:45.290 --> 01:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
be covered by Good Samaritan but why I
 
01:37:47.689 --> 01:37:47.699 align:start position:0%
teach them to on how to do it when I'm
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
unconscious while I'm teaching them it's
 
01:37:55.090 --> 01:37:55.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:00.370 --> 01:38:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:03.649 --> 01:38:03.659 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you thank
 
01:38:03.659 --> 01:38:09.649 align:start position:0%
representative yokella thank you thank
you

01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:13.910 --> 01:38:13.920 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh uh committee
 
01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:15.169 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you uh uh committee
for

01:38:15.169 --> 01:38:15.179 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
uh hearing my testimony today
 
01:38:19.370 --> 01:38:19.380 align:start position:0%
um I will be able to bring a little bit
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
more uh history to this because
 
01:38:25.790 --> 01:38:25.800 align:start position:0%
this was my bill from uh two years ago
 
01:38:25.800 --> 01:38:27.530 align:start position:0%
this was my bill from uh two years ago
and

01:38:27.530 --> 01:38:27.540 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:27.540 --> 01:38:29.030 align:start position:0%
and
um I

01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:38:32.270 --> 01:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
found the bill because I was looking in
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy statute for something else
 
01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:36.470 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy statute for something else
um

01:38:36.470 --> 01:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
and I stumbled across this legislation
 
01:38:42.830 --> 01:38:42.840 align:start position:0%
or this part of this the law and didn't
 
01:38:44.629 --> 01:38:44.639 align:start position:0%
understand one why it was in the
 
01:38:46.790 --> 01:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
pharmacy statute that the kids were
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
prohibited from doing stuff because the
 
01:38:51.530 --> 01:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
penalties are the same as a penalty for
 
01:38:54.169 --> 01:38:54.179 align:start position:0%
a pharmacist so that didn't really make
 
01:38:55.550 --> 01:38:55.560 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of sense
 
01:38:57.830 --> 01:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
and so my first
 
01:39:00.110 --> 01:39:00.120 align:start position:0%
um attempt with this law was just to
 
01:39:02.810 --> 01:39:02.820 align:start position:0%
repeal it because in reality the I think
 
01:39:02.820 --> 01:39:04.070 align:start position:0%
repeal it because in reality the I think
that

01:39:04.070 --> 01:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:39:06.770 --> 01:39:06.780 align:start position:0%
um we're kind of moving away from these
 
01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
penalties about syringes and stuff like
 
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
that and just um because uh we saw that
 
01:39:17.810 --> 01:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
when we uh outlawed syringes
 
01:39:21.290 --> 01:39:21.300 align:start position:0%
um the there was an increase of reuse of
 
01:39:22.910 --> 01:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
syringes and stuff like that and that
 
01:39:25.010 --> 01:39:25.020 align:start position:0%
caused other harms and so Most states
 
01:39:26.990 --> 01:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
are moving away from
 
01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:27.890 align:start position:0%
are moving away from
um

01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
forbidding the actual paraphernalia and
 
01:39:32.950 --> 01:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
just concentrating on the drug itself
 
01:39:36.050 --> 01:39:36.060 align:start position:0%
and so I try to repeal it at first
 
01:39:41.870 --> 01:39:41.880 align:start position:0%
but that um was uh too extreme for for
 
01:39:44.629 --> 01:39:44.639 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services so
 
01:39:48.410 --> 01:39:48.420 align:start position:0%
um the bill bill died however in the in
 
01:39:51.050 --> 01:39:51.060 align:start position:0%
the law under uh Pharmacy there's
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
already a definition of
 
01:39:55.370 --> 01:39:55.380 align:start position:0%
um authorized agent
 
01:39:59.870 --> 01:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
so during during this last year I I
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
propose that we just uh
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
add the language of saying hey uh you
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
know there's these children like the
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
example of the the partner or the friend
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
if you're you know you show your friend
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
if they hold it if you
 
01:40:18.470 --> 01:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
if you let your um you know friend hold
 
01:40:21.290 --> 01:40:21.300 align:start position:0%
this these uh the needle or these Auto
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
injectors and stuff like that it was
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
it's currently a crime um it's not
 
01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
always prosecuted however two
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Stone's question there is
 
01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:32.090 align:start position:0%
representative Stone's question there is
data

01:40:32.090 --> 01:40:32.100 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
um we're not sure about
 
01:40:38.110 --> 01:40:38.120 align:start position:0%
um the technicalities of the specific
 
01:40:40.910 --> 01:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
instances but we do have data on how
 
01:40:44.750 --> 01:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
often these are charged
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
at least I did get that data as of 2021
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
when I first put the bill in and I have
 
01:40:55.550 --> 01:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
that uh it was much more charged back in
 
01:40:59.149 --> 01:40:59.159 align:start position:0%
1998 and 1999 there was up to
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
um 117
 
01:41:04.430 --> 01:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
um cases filed against children
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
um but in the more recent years like
 
01:41:09.770 --> 01:41:09.780 align:start position:0%
2015 there was two and then there was
 
01:41:12.770 --> 01:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
nothing until 2018 there was one more
 
01:41:15.169 --> 01:41:15.179 align:start position:0%
and then 2021 there was one more so it
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
was it's been trailing off of
 
01:41:20.810 --> 01:41:20.820 align:start position:0%
um a lot and so we don't those cases are
 
01:41:22.610 --> 01:41:22.620 align:start position:0%
obviously sealed because they involve
 
01:41:26.209 --> 01:41:26.219 align:start position:0%
minor so we don't know like what the
 
01:41:26.219 --> 01:41:27.070 align:start position:0%
minor so we don't know like what the
um

01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:31.790 --> 01:41:31.800 align:start position:0%
the circumstances of the case were but
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
um I felt that this uh that this uh
 
01:41:39.050 --> 01:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
authorized agent language and making it
 
01:41:40.490 --> 01:41:40.500 align:start position:0%
clear that
 
01:41:42.770 --> 01:41:42.780 align:start position:0%
um it has to be for nefarious purposes
 
01:41:46.370 --> 01:41:46.380 align:start position:0%
of the the handling of the of the uh
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needles I thought
 
01:41:52.490 --> 01:41:52.500 align:start position:0%
um would protect from
 
01:41:55.129 --> 01:41:55.139 align:start position:0%
um a zealous prosecution
 
01:41:58.669 --> 01:41:58.679 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why I
 
01:41:58.679 --> 01:41:59.629 align:start position:0%
um and so that's why I
um

01:41:59.629 --> 01:41:59.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:02.330 --> 01:42:02.340 align:start position:0%
I put this this bill in and supported
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
the bill and I'm happy to
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
answer any questions thank you um do you
 
01:42:09.890 --> 01:42:09.900 align:start position:0%
have any uh what was very concerning to
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
me and I hadn't thought of this was the
 
01:42:13.370 --> 01:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
the reference the representative made
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
about um not necessarily criminal
 
01:42:19.129 --> 01:42:19.139 align:start position:0%
charges but you being used by um
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
um youth services or whoever to
 
01:42:22.910 --> 01:42:22.920 align:start position:0%
potentially take children out of a home
 
01:42:24.290 --> 01:42:24.300 align:start position:0%
just because of this because it's
 
01:42:26.450 --> 01:42:26.460 align:start position:0%
illegal do you have any doubt on that or
 
01:42:28.609 --> 01:42:28.619 align:start position:0%
have you heard anything like that
 
01:42:31.129 --> 01:42:31.139 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh for the question
 
01:42:31.139 --> 01:42:32.930 align:start position:0%
um thank you uh for the question
so

01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:37.250 --> 01:42:37.260 align:start position:0%
there there have been a few people so
 
01:42:40.370 --> 01:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
that this bill is has two sections one
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
of them is the child is actually
 
01:42:45.410 --> 01:42:45.420 align:start position:0%
committing a crime when you give the the
 
01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
child or the Buddy
 
01:42:49.370 --> 01:42:49.380 align:start position:0%
um the access to this needle when they
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
have possession of it
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
um but also the person that gave the
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
person uh the needle also is cremating a
 
01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
crime so there's two sections of this
 
01:43:03.490 --> 01:43:03.500 align:start position:0%
law that we are changing and under that
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
law I also have the stats but only since
 
01:43:08.639 --> 01:43:10.070 align:start position:0%
law I also have the stats but only since
2013

01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
2013
 
01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:10.850 align:start position:0%
2013
um

01:43:10.850 --> 01:43:10.860 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:13.850 --> 01:43:13.860 align:start position:0%
and there was
 
01:43:13.860 --> 01:43:14.470 align:start position:0%
and there was
um

01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:18.770 --> 01:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
two in 2013 two in 2014 two or four in
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
2014 to in 2015 and then it skips all
 
01:43:25.010 --> 01:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
the way down to 2018 was one
 
01:43:27.290 --> 01:43:27.300 align:start position:0%
um in circuit court and then Superior
 
01:43:30.229 --> 01:43:30.239 align:start position:0%
Court there was there's like uh one in
 
01:43:34.070 --> 01:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
2013 2016 and then two in 2021. so it
 
01:43:37.070 --> 01:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's not very often that has been used
 
01:43:38.810 --> 01:43:38.820 align:start position:0%
against adults
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:44.990 --> 01:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
um I don't know the exact nature of
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
those cases and and what happened with
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
those those adults if those were dealers
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
or whatever then it it may not have been
 
01:43:54.590 --> 01:43:54.600 align:start position:0%
affected but it's entirely possible that
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
it could be used in in you know against
 
01:44:00.649 --> 01:44:00.659 align:start position:0%
a parent thank you
 
01:44:01.970 --> 01:44:01.980 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry can you see your name
 
01:44:03.890 --> 01:44:03.900 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you uh
 
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
representative yukela for taking my
 
01:44:10.850 --> 01:44:10.860 align:start position:0%
question uh so for me I'm just curious
 
01:44:13.430 --> 01:44:13.440 align:start position:0%
about what if there is a minor driving a
 
01:44:17.689 --> 01:44:17.699 align:start position:0%
vehicle and per se uh there is
 
01:44:22.070 --> 01:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
um a uh a kit for insulin uh use in in
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
the back seat uh could there be a
 
01:44:26.810 --> 01:44:26.820 align:start position:0%
possibility that because they are not
 
01:44:30.470 --> 01:44:30.480 align:start position:0%
being uh directed uh that they could be
 
01:44:32.209 --> 01:44:32.219 align:start position:0%
charged still
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:44:36.530 --> 01:44:36.540 align:start position:0%
um this is not that was not my language
 
01:44:38.209 --> 01:44:38.219 align:start position:0%
this is the health and human services
 
01:44:41.570 --> 01:44:41.580 align:start position:0%
they had some they had some people in it
 
01:44:45.430 --> 01:44:45.440 align:start position:0%
that were uh that were
 
01:44:48.109 --> 01:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
01:44:51.109 --> 01:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
um an authorized agent wasn't
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
too broad for and so they added some
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
language to try and make it more narrow
 
01:45:01.129 --> 01:45:01.139 align:start position:0%
I obviously don't didn't I think that
 
01:45:03.350 --> 01:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
authorized agent is clear enough
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
but yes if if you know Emily left her
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
her needle in the car and and let her
 
01:45:13.010 --> 01:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
kid use the car but didn't remove the
 
01:45:13.020 --> 01:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
kid use the car but didn't remove the
needle

01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
needle
 
01:45:17.090 --> 01:45:17.100 align:start position:0%
um okay or a neighbor's kid use the car
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
technically they're in possession of it
 
01:45:23.090 --> 01:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
and and is it under direct supervision
 
01:45:25.189 --> 01:45:25.199 align:start position:0%
you know all of that stuff it seems like
 
01:45:28.070 --> 01:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
they made it unnecessarily restrictive
 
01:45:30.109 --> 01:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
in health and human services and kind of
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's why we're we're in criminal
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
justice right so you can say like uh
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't really make a whole
 
01:45:36.229 --> 01:45:36.239 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
 
01:45:36.239 --> 01:45:37.250 align:start position:0%
lot of sense
um

01:45:37.250 --> 01:45:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
um but my intention is just that you
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
know if the kid is not using it or not
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
using it for a nefarious purpose if
 
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
there if someone had Elite uh has it
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
um inappropriate purpose then they're
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
not going to be getting charged that's
 
01:45:55.370 --> 01:45:55.380 align:start position:0%
the main goal and thrust of this and to
 
01:45:57.590 --> 01:45:57.600 align:start position:0%
be honest since there already is you
 
01:46:00.050 --> 01:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
know examples of people just being
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
currently committing the crime
 
01:46:04.790 --> 01:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
um I'd rather have something get passed
 
01:46:06.770 --> 01:46:06.780 align:start position:0%
than than
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
um than uh then just keep continuing
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
down this road of people being cremating
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
crimes and then selective prosecution
 
01:46:16.609 --> 01:46:16.619 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you representative
 
01:46:16.619 --> 01:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you representative
Murray

01:46:17.510 --> 01:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
Murray
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:21.050 --> 01:46:21.060 align:start position:0%
um I actually didn't realize that we
 
01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:22.199 align:start position:0%
were the second committee on this until
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned Health Human Services for
 
01:46:25.070 --> 01:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
so thank you for doing that because I
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
was looking at the introduced version of
 
01:46:27.890 --> 01:46:27.900 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
01:46:29.810 --> 01:46:29.820 align:start position:0%
um so with what you're saying you know
 
01:46:31.070 --> 01:46:31.080 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the under direct
 
01:46:33.410 --> 01:46:33.420 align:start position:0%
supervision part with representative
 
01:46:35.570 --> 01:46:35.580 align:start position:0%
Phillips example of like her kids having
 
01:46:39.709 --> 01:46:39.719 align:start position:0%
to revive her with a pen would then they
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
not that this bill not cover them
 
01:46:44.030 --> 01:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
because they're not being supervised
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
because she's unconscious
 
01:46:49.310 --> 01:46:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I think that
 
01:46:52.609 --> 01:46:52.619 align:start position:0%
in the emergency situation there's there
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
is an exception like a Good Samaritan
 
01:46:57.229 --> 01:46:57.239 align:start position:0%
exception kind of stuff and so you you
 
01:46:58.790 --> 01:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
could technically be charged but then
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
have a defense that say oh I was being a
 
01:47:02.990 --> 01:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
Good Samaritan you know I was saving
 
01:47:05.090 --> 01:47:05.100 align:start position:0%
their life they were you know under and
 
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
so you could have an exception but
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
technically yes you would be still under
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
breaking this technical law and so I
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
think you know that's why we're in
 
01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:16.139 align:start position:0%
criminal justice to to make sure the law
 
01:47:18.109 --> 01:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
is correct okay thank you and then I
 
01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:19.199 align:start position:0%
just wanted to clarify
 
01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
you want us to pass this as amended or
 
01:47:23.209 --> 01:47:23.219 align:start position:0%
you would have preferred for us to
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
revert it back to the original language
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I my My
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
ultimate goal is to
 
01:47:34.669 --> 01:47:34.679 align:start position:0%
just clean up the language so that I
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
think that people that there's no
 
01:47:39.770 --> 01:47:39.780 align:start position:0%
possibility of of
 
01:47:42.729 --> 01:47:42.739 align:start position:0%
a child being put in the system
 
01:47:45.410 --> 01:47:45.420 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and for unappropriate
 
01:47:45.420 --> 01:47:46.910 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily and for unappropriate
means

01:47:46.910 --> 01:47:46.920 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:47:50.330 --> 01:47:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and since the law is so broad right
 
01:47:52.970 --> 01:47:52.980 align:start position:0%
now I'm happy with something but
 
01:47:55.729 --> 01:47:55.739 align:start position:0%
obviously I think that the bill I I
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
submitted was good and so but uh I uh
 
01:48:04.370 --> 01:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely opposed to you know I I
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
didn't pull it off of consent and fight
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
it off on the floor if it it got past in
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
consent I was happy to
 
01:48:13.250 --> 01:48:13.260 align:start position:0%
move forward with it so I would prefer
 
01:48:15.950 --> 01:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
the other one but I'm okay with leaving
 
01:48:17.810 --> 01:48:17.820 align:start position:0%
it as
 
01:48:20.510 --> 01:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
or any fixes that you need to pass
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a question of the chair oh
 
01:48:25.990 --> 01:48:26.000 align:start position:0%
go ahead and it has to do with our
 
01:48:28.129 --> 01:48:28.139 align:start position:0%
responsibilities here
 
01:48:30.590 --> 01:48:30.600 align:start position:0%
as the second committee and as I
 
01:48:32.090 --> 01:48:32.100 align:start position:0%
understand it this is a bill that went
 
01:48:33.950 --> 01:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
through and it was amended by Health and
 
01:48:36.709 --> 01:48:36.719 align:start position:0%
Human Services so so this is the bill
 
01:48:38.750 --> 01:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
that this amendment doesn't have to be
 
01:48:40.490 --> 01:48:40.500 align:start position:0%
approved that's what we'll see when we
 
01:48:43.790 --> 01:48:43.800 align:start position:0%
get to a session is that correct
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
well it was amended in health and human
 
01:48:48.290 --> 01:48:48.300 align:start position:0%
services so that's now the bill right so
 
01:48:50.270 --> 01:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have to so we don't have to do
 
01:48:52.490 --> 01:48:52.500 align:start position:0%
it now we could have mend it if we
 
01:48:54.470 --> 01:48:54.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to we could amend it if we wanted
 
01:48:56.050 --> 01:48:56.060 align:start position:0%
to I understand that
 
01:48:58.930 --> 01:48:58.940 align:start position:0%
so it comes to us as a second committee
 
01:49:03.050 --> 01:49:03.060 align:start position:0%
and my understanding has been that it
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
comes to us because we are the committee
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:49:09.290 --> 01:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
involved with the appropriateness of
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
penalties or some other issue that has
 
01:49:14.330 --> 01:49:14.340 align:start position:0%
to do with criminal justice or Public
 
01:49:14.340 --> 01:49:15.709 align:start position:0%
to do with criminal justice or Public
Safety

01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
Safety
 
01:49:15.719 --> 01:49:17.330 align:start position:0%
Safety
so

01:49:17.330 --> 01:49:17.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
we can amend the the policy part of this
 
01:49:22.669 --> 01:49:22.679 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to but for right and I I'm
 
01:49:23.990 --> 01:49:24.000 align:start position:0%
looking at this and I don't see any
 
01:49:25.729 --> 01:49:25.739 align:start position:0%
penalties or anything that we are
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
looking at other than we're talking
 
01:49:29.090 --> 01:49:29.100 align:start position:0%
mostly about policy and trying to
 
01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
understand what what the policy is so
 
01:49:34.010 --> 01:49:34.020 align:start position:0%
I think you've cleared I think I've
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
clarified it enough to myself as I
 
01:49:39.790 --> 01:49:39.800 align:start position:0%
talked good talk thank you
 
01:49:43.129 --> 01:49:43.139 align:start position:0%
I I do want to let you remind you that
 
01:49:45.290 --> 01:49:45.300 align:start position:0%
there are penalties there it's the same
 
01:49:49.430 --> 01:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
penalties as a as a um as a pharmacist
 
01:49:52.609 --> 01:49:52.619 align:start position:0%
and so it is a misdemeanor I believe for
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
uh a person and then a business it's a
 
01:49:57.169 --> 01:49:57.179 align:start position:0%
like a felony
 
01:49:57.179 --> 01:49:58.490 align:start position:0%
like a felony
so

01:49:58.490 --> 01:49:58.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:50:01.010 --> 01:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
this is just a the portion of the
 
01:50:02.450 --> 01:50:02.460 align:start position:0%
statute that's being amended the
 
01:50:05.090 --> 01:50:05.100 align:start position:0%
existing penalty portion remains
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
um question oh representative Murphy I'm
 
01:50:06.960 --> 01:50:08.030 align:start position:0%
um question oh representative Murphy I'm
sorry

01:50:08.030 --> 01:50:08.040 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:50:09.530 --> 01:50:09.540 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chair
 
01:50:11.450 --> 01:50:11.460 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
01:50:12.890 --> 01:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
um in regards to the the child
 
01:50:14.570 --> 01:50:14.580 align:start position:0%
protection concerns
 
01:50:17.270 --> 01:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm I'm hearing like the diabetic
 
01:50:18.590 --> 01:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
issue and I certainly understand that
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
but having worked in child protection
 
01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:21.659 align:start position:0%
you know that sometimes these things
 
01:50:23.689 --> 01:50:23.699 align:start position:0%
aren't quite as obvious
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
um and I wonder about those cases that
 
01:50:28.850 --> 01:50:28.860 align:start position:0%
were actually prosecuted and wonder if
 
01:50:32.149 --> 01:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
it was because there was a child was in
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
possession of a syringe full of an
 
01:50:36.709 --> 01:50:36.719 align:start position:0%
injectable illegal drug
 
01:50:38.810 --> 01:50:38.820 align:start position:0%
um not a you know not a not something
 
01:50:41.570 --> 01:50:41.580 align:start position:0%
that's prescribed for diabetics but
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
um having worked and seen enough of
 
01:50:45.229 --> 01:50:45.239 align:start position:0%
those cases I can certainly see why
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
there are concerns about possession of
 
01:50:52.189 --> 01:50:52.199 align:start position:0%
um of um syringes and with a needle I'm
 
01:50:54.770 --> 01:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
assuming not just the syringe we're
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
talking a needle attachment or that's
 
01:50:59.570 --> 01:50:59.580 align:start position:0%
the the question I have that it sounds a
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
little bit overly broad to me and I just
 
01:51:04.250 --> 01:51:04.260 align:start position:0%
wondering what the reality is of
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
how many cases are actually prosecuted
 
01:51:08.570 --> 01:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
who who's gonna who's gonna the person
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
that'll be prosecuted would I would
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
imagine would be the the parent a
 
01:51:14.629 --> 01:51:14.639 align:start position:0%
guardian right of whoever the the child
 
01:51:17.390 --> 01:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
they're Prosecuting six-year-olds they
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
can yes so thank you for the question
 
01:51:22.669 --> 01:51:22.679 align:start position:0%
um so uh I think
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
we were just giving some examples of
 
01:51:25.199 --> 01:51:27.109 align:start position:0%
we were just giving some examples of
possible

01:51:27.109 --> 01:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:51:29.990 --> 01:51:30.000 align:start position:0%
um things most of the I'm not aware of
 
01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.310 align:start position:0%
um things most of the I'm not aware of
any

01:51:31.310 --> 01:51:31.320 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
um Health and Human Service involvement
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
in any of these cases these would be
 
01:51:38.330 --> 01:51:38.340 align:start position:0%
police charges not necessarily going
 
01:51:40.189 --> 01:51:40.199 align:start position:0%
through health and humans or you know
 
01:51:41.570 --> 01:51:41.580 align:start position:0%
like uh
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
um you know neglect case necessarily
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
um but yes they could charge the
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
six-year-old they could charge a 17 year
 
01:51:50.510 --> 01:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
old they could charge and they do and
 
01:51:51.590 --> 01:51:51.600 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
um that's so those were the numbers that
 
01:51:55.370 --> 01:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
I gave at the beginning whereas back in
 
01:51:59.450 --> 01:51:59.460 align:start position:0%
1997 is the first records that I have it
 
01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:00.410 align:start position:0%
1997 is the first records that I have it
was

01:52:00.410 --> 01:52:00.420 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:52:03.229 --> 01:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
um once 78 cases in circuit court and 14
 
01:52:05.390 --> 01:52:05.400 align:start position:0%
in Superior Court and so I could give
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
you the list and forward this
 
01:52:10.970 --> 01:52:10.980 align:start position:0%
information that I had on the cases for
 
01:52:10.980 --> 01:52:11.750 align:start position:0%
information that I had on the cases for
um

01:52:11.750 --> 01:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:11.760 --> 01:52:13.270 align:start position:0%
um
for

01:52:13.270 --> 01:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:52:16.129 --> 01:52:16.139 align:start position:0%
these that I got from Richard head which
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
is the the um person for kind of liaison
 
01:52:21.950 --> 01:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
for the judicial system I got this
 
01:52:23.870 --> 01:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
information from him and so I could
 
01:52:25.609 --> 01:52:25.619 align:start position:0%
forward it on to you and the in the
 
01:52:28.790 --> 01:52:28.800 align:start position:0%
committee if if that's helpful I mean I
 
01:52:29.930 --> 01:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
think you're going to exec it in a few
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
minutes so I'm not sure how much time
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
you would have time to review it but
 
01:52:36.050 --> 01:52:36.060 align:start position:0%
there are charges um that can be and
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
have been brought but it's it it
 
01:52:41.209 --> 01:52:41.219 align:start position:0%
definitely starts trailing off
 
01:52:44.270 --> 01:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
um to like below 10 cases in 2004 and
 
01:52:47.270 --> 01:52:47.280 align:start position:0%
then it starts trailing way off to like
 
01:52:47.280 --> 01:52:48.050 align:start position:0%
then it starts trailing way off to like
um

01:52:48.050 --> 01:52:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:52:51.169 --> 01:52:51.179 align:start position:0%
um so there was over a hundred and 2018
 
01:52:55.729 --> 01:52:55.739 align:start position:0%
and or or uh sorry in 1998 and 1999
 
01:52:57.350 --> 01:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
there were over a hundred cases against
 
01:52:57.360 --> 01:52:58.910 align:start position:0%
there were over a hundred cases against
minors

01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
minors
 
01:53:00.410 --> 01:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
all the way to 20 2004 then it starts
 
01:53:06.410 --> 01:53:06.420 align:start position:0%
dropping off to like under 10 cases
 
01:53:09.649 --> 01:53:09.659 align:start position:0%
per year per for Miners And so it's not
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
being used readily and uh anymore and a
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
lot of some of the officers that came to
 
01:53:17.990 --> 01:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
the hearing last year were surprised I
 
01:53:21.590 --> 01:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
was even uh uh law they just weren't
 
01:53:23.270 --> 01:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
really aware of it because who would
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
think to look in in the pharmacy statute
 
01:53:27.770 --> 01:53:27.780 align:start position:0%
for you know charging someone
 
01:53:31.370 --> 01:53:31.380 align:start position:0%
so thank you thank you
 
01:53:33.790 --> 01:53:33.800 align:start position:0%
a six-year-old or whatever yeah
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative tenzar and then you got a
 
01:53:38.930 --> 01:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
question right yeah thank you chairman
 
01:53:40.370 --> 01:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
thank you representative those cases
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
that you're referencing are those New
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cases
 
01:53:44.750 --> 01:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
oh yeah absolutely all of these are New
 
01:53:46.550 --> 01:53:46.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cases there so Richard head is
 
01:53:48.890 --> 01:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
the the liaison for the judicial system
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and so all of these are
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
based on what I ask them to do is look
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
up how many cases were uh charged under
 
01:53:59.450 --> 01:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
this statute that I was trying to repeal
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
and so these are all the all the cases
 
01:54:04.370 --> 01:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many of them would be
 
01:54:06.169 --> 01:54:06.179 align:start position:0%
have been covered by this authorized
 
01:54:08.390 --> 01:54:08.400 align:start position:0%
agent exception thank you thank you
 
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
01:54:13.550 --> 01:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify with the you know if
 
01:54:15.830 --> 01:54:15.840 align:start position:0%
there were charges that there were an
 
01:54:17.990 --> 01:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
illegal substance in it that would be a
 
01:54:19.250 --> 01:54:19.260 align:start position:0%
separate charge right it would be a
 
01:54:20.990 --> 01:54:21.000 align:start position:0%
separate charge for the substance and
 
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
you know possession of the substance and
 
01:54:24.290 --> 01:54:24.300 align:start position:0%
then also and then a separate one from
 
01:54:26.750 --> 01:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
having the actual syringe
 
01:54:29.629 --> 01:54:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the um the
 
01:54:31.729 --> 01:54:31.739 align:start position:0%
question and that was the sentiment that
 
01:54:33.169 --> 01:54:33.179 align:start position:0%
I kind of got from Richard head that it
 
01:54:36.350 --> 01:54:36.360 align:start position:0%
was often charged in multiple multiple
 
01:54:39.770 --> 01:54:39.780 align:start position:0%
charges this was very rarely charged in
 
01:54:43.729 --> 01:54:43.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.290 --> 01:54:45.300 align:start position:0%
so it's an additional charge that they
 
01:54:46.669 --> 01:54:46.679 align:start position:0%
could plead down to
 
01:54:48.050 --> 01:54:48.060 align:start position:0%
that looks like that's it all right
 
01:54:50.629 --> 01:54:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you anyone else
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on this
 
01:54:54.950 --> 01:54:54.960 align:start position:0%
bill that has not testified
 
01:54:56.810 --> 01:54:56.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:03.239 align:start position:0%
and at this point we're going to take a
 
01:55:05.209 --> 01:55:05.219 align:start position:0%
30 minute break and then we'll come back
 
01:55:20.810 --> 01:55:20.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.490 --> 01:55:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:34.500 --> 01:56:09.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:56:09.669 --> 01:56:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.270 --> 01:56:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:17.280 --> 01:57:00.430 align:start position:0%
 
tomorrow

01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.010 --> 01:57:04.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:04.020 --> 01:57:18.410 align:start position:0%
 
hey

01:57:18.410 --> 01:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:18.420 --> 01:58:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:04.270 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:58:04.270 --> 01:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:58:07.250 --> 01:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
what about you representative did you
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
pick up any of this I listened to this
 
01:58:10.910 --> 01:58:10.920 align:start position:0%
last one that bill should have never
 
01:58:13.810 --> 01:58:13.820 align:start position:0%
gone to HHS the beginning
 
01:58:16.550 --> 01:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
so because it's Bad Manners to change
 
01:58:18.470 --> 01:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
your policy but they shouldn't have had
 
01:58:20.149 --> 01:58:20.159 align:start position:0%
the policy to begin with it should have
 
01:58:24.490 --> 01:58:24.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:30.589 --> 01:58:30.599 align:start position:0%
it's not a big deal
 
01:58:41.530 --> 01:58:41.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.850 --> 01:58:45.860 align:start position:0%
really like trying to hold and learn
 
01:58:48.290 --> 01:58:48.300 align:start position:0%
I just kind of set a bar at the
 
01:58:48.300 --> 01:58:49.030 align:start position:0%
I just kind of set a bar at the
beginning

01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
01:58:51.070 --> 01:58:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%

01:59:18.490 --> 01:59:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
if you need to you know run them to get
 
01:59:30.290 --> 01:59:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:38.149 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%

02:19:28.740 --> 02:19:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
because

02:19:45.349 --> 02:19:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:48.290 --> 02:19:48.300 align:start position:0%

02:19:51.530 --> 02:19:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:58.070 --> 02:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:07.370 --> 02:20:07.380 align:start position:0%

killer but anyway uh she uh Beth
 
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
sounded like she'd like you to testify
 
02:20:20.889 --> 02:20:20.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:24.849 --> 02:20:24.859 align:start position:0%
oh well okay all right okay all right

02:20:36.170 --> 02:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
oh but by the way I don't know I have no
 
02:20:39.050 --> 02:20:39.060 align:start position:0%
idea uh by the way the stakeholders were
 
02:20:39.060 --> 02:20:43.610 align:start position:0%
idea uh by the way the stakeholders were
telling

02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:46.370 --> 02:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
yeah because Beth was there for me that
 
02:20:48.410 --> 02:20:48.420 align:start position:0%
you don't nobody the only person that
 
02:20:53.570 --> 02:20:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:56.530 --> 02:20:56.540 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee I mean
 
02:20:59.570 --> 02:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
okay I don't well I don't know that they
 
02:21:01.550 --> 02:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
have to maybe post it in the hallway
 
02:21:03.050 --> 02:21:03.060 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know where it's supposed to be
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:10.309 --> 02:21:10.319 align:start position:0%
well okay uh well you can you could
 
02:21:10.319 --> 02:21:11.809 align:start position:0%
well okay uh well you can you could
certainly

02:21:11.809 --> 02:21:11.819 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
02:21:13.670 --> 02:21:13.680 align:start position:0%
well I don't know is it worth something
 
02:21:16.490 --> 02:21:16.500 align:start position:0%
is it worth mentioning but okay
 
02:21:20.929 --> 02:21:20.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:23.510 --> 02:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
I no no he just wanted to go to the
 
02:21:33.849 --> 02:21:33.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:36.290 --> 02:21:36.300 align:start position:0%
I've done even less work than usual
 
02:21:39.110 --> 02:21:39.120 align:start position:0%
which is that's it's a pretty low bar as
 
02:21:41.150 --> 02:21:41.160 align:start position:0%
it is so
 
02:21:43.969 --> 02:21:43.979 align:start position:0%
anyway I just want to pass that on all
 
02:21:43.979 --> 02:21:47.590 align:start position:0%
anyway I just want to pass that on all
right

02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:50.690 --> 02:21:50.700 align:start position:0%
it's like five bills to exactly we
 
02:21:53.690 --> 02:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
haven't exact anything yet
 
02:22:59.870 --> 02:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.990 --> 02:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:31.790 --> 02:38:31.800 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm opening the executive
 
02:38:36.410 --> 02:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 287
 
02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize
 
02:38:42.290 --> 02:38:42.300 align:start position:0%
representative Reed for a motion
 
02:38:46.670 --> 02:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I moved to OTP
 
02:38:48.889 --> 02:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
is there a second
 
02:38:51.830 --> 02:38:51.840 align:start position:0%
representative proof seconds
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to your
 
02:38:55.730 --> 02:38:55.740 align:start position:0%
motion representative yes I think um
 
02:38:59.450 --> 02:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
House Bill 287 is a good harm reduction
 
02:39:02.210 --> 02:39:02.220 align:start position:0%
tool and I can only see positives with
 
02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you representative would
 
02:39:07.070 --> 02:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to you second uh I
 
02:39:09.230 --> 02:39:09.240 align:start position:0%
feel the same way and uh not much else
 
02:39:10.450 --> 02:39:10.460 align:start position:0%
to add
 
02:39:14.690 --> 02:39:14.700 align:start position:0%
I am I'm going to say I I agree I think
 
02:39:18.710 --> 02:39:18.720 align:start position:0%
that this um the clean first step for
 
02:39:21.170 --> 02:39:21.180 align:start position:0%
this is just the test strips
 
02:39:24.950 --> 02:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
however I do see some value in houseboat
 
02:39:28.190 --> 02:39:28.200 align:start position:0%
470 and I'd like to see where where the
 
02:39:31.010 --> 02:39:31.020 align:start position:0%
where they're going with that um there
 
02:39:33.950 --> 02:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
was discussion of a
 
02:39:36.830 --> 02:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
of some kind of testing center and I
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
think that those are interesting ideas
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
but I'd like to see a little more
 
02:39:44.150 --> 02:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
definition in a little more Plan before
 
02:39:46.309 --> 02:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
we legislate and I'd like to legislate
 
02:39:49.969 --> 02:39:49.979 align:start position:0%
to that versus just throwing it open
 
02:39:53.270 --> 02:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
and then figuring out what comes of it
 
02:39:53.280 --> 02:39:53.870 align:start position:0%
and then figuring out what comes of it
um

02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:56.690 --> 02:39:56.700 align:start position:0%
having said that 287 I strongly support
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
anyone else would like to speak
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
02:40:01.680 --> 02:40:03.469 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes thank you Mr
chairman

02:40:03.469 --> 02:40:03.479 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:40:06.170 --> 02:40:06.180 align:start position:0%
I will vote for the Autumn pass motion
 
02:40:06.180 --> 02:40:07.429 align:start position:0%
I will vote for the Autumn pass motion
for

02:40:07.429 --> 02:40:07.439 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:40:10.190 --> 02:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
the test strips I I just feel like I
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
have to say I do actually have concerns
 
02:40:14.330 --> 02:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
about it I I am looking at the other
 
02:40:17.510 --> 02:40:17.520 align:start position:0%
side of the coin and I I almost look at
 
02:40:18.889 --> 02:40:18.899 align:start position:0%
this as we're telling people that it's
 
02:40:20.270 --> 02:40:20.280 align:start position:0%
okay to go out and do drugs as long as
 
02:40:22.790 --> 02:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
you test them first and I I do not agree
 
02:40:23.809 --> 02:40:23.819 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:40:26.389 --> 02:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
if this is going to save somebody's life
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
then great
 
02:40:29.210 --> 02:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that this is going to
 
02:40:32.210 --> 02:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
do anything to stop the drug problem I
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
don't think that this is going to do
 
02:40:35.630 --> 02:40:35.640 align:start position:0%
anything to help get the fentanyl off
 
02:40:37.030 --> 02:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
the streets in any way straight perform
 
02:40:41.510 --> 02:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
and hopefully I'm proved wrong again I
 
02:40:43.070 --> 02:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
will vote for it but I I do have
 
02:40:44.870 --> 02:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
tremendous concerns but
 
02:40:47.389 --> 02:40:47.399 align:start position:0%
I'll take your guys all word that this
 
02:40:48.830 --> 02:40:48.840 align:start position:0%
is the right thing to do
 
02:40:51.950 --> 02:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
thank you I I will say that I share your
 
02:40:54.530 --> 02:40:54.540 align:start position:0%
concerns but for me it's a matter of uh
 
02:40:57.170 --> 02:40:57.180 align:start position:0%
as a parent being able to have something
 
02:40:58.910 --> 02:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
like this at my disposal if I find
 
02:41:01.130 --> 02:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
something in my child's you know stuff
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
to test and see what it is uh just for
 
02:41:06.429 --> 02:41:06.439 align:start position:0%
that alone I think is a good standpoint
 
02:41:08.570 --> 02:41:08.580 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
02:41:11.510 --> 02:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
I just might might mention it's called
 
02:41:17.389 --> 02:41:17.399 align:start position:0%
an attitude that's coloring all of my
 
02:41:19.849 --> 02:41:19.859 align:start position:0%
outlooks on the various bills we're
 
02:41:23.330 --> 02:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
looking at uh Chief last name from
 
02:41:26.270 --> 02:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
Bedford uh pointed out in his testimony
 
02:41:28.070 --> 02:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
they're really not winning the war on
 
02:41:31.190 --> 02:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
drugs so why even bother is it part of
 
02:41:32.770 --> 02:41:32.780 align:start position:0%
me acts that way so I hear
 
02:41:35.389 --> 02:41:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes fighting I I'm
 
02:41:37.730 --> 02:41:37.740 align:start position:0%
ready to say Legalize It make a mic
 
02:41:41.270 --> 02:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
Lifesavers but that's not responsible
 
02:41:43.130 --> 02:41:43.140 align:start position:0%
but it's uh
 
02:41:47.150 --> 02:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's a sense unfortunately that I have
 
02:41:48.429 --> 02:41:48.439 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:41:51.050 --> 02:41:51.060 align:start position:0%
further discussion

consent

that will go on consent
 
02:42:59.030 --> 02:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
with that I'll close the executive
 
02:43:01.969 --> 02:43:01.979 align:start position:0%
session I'll spell 287 open executive
 
02:43:04.910 --> 02:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 470 I will
 
02:43:06.950 --> 02:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
recognize myself to make a motion I'm
 
02:43:08.750 --> 02:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
going to move retain
 
02:43:10.910 --> 02:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
do I have a second
 
02:43:13.910 --> 02:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
by representative gaththright
 
02:43:16.130 --> 02:43:16.140 align:start position:0%
um I'll speak to my motion
 
02:43:18.770 --> 02:43:18.780 align:start position:0%
as I said in the previous executive
 
02:43:21.469 --> 02:43:21.479 align:start position:0%
session I don't think that this bill is
 
02:43:24.530 --> 02:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
quite ready I I think that we need a
 
02:43:27.710 --> 02:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
little more information on on how these
 
02:43:27.720 --> 02:43:28.550 align:start position:0%
little more information on on how these
um

02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:30.650 --> 02:43:30.660 align:start position:0%
if these testing centers are going to
 
02:43:32.150 --> 02:43:32.160 align:start position:0%
set up I'd like to see what they look
 
02:43:34.309 --> 02:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
like I have some grave concerns about
 
02:43:36.170 --> 02:43:36.180 align:start position:0%
what happened with some of the needle
 
02:43:37.610 --> 02:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
exchange programs where it ended up
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
being places where people would go to do
 
02:43:42.230 --> 02:43:42.240 align:start position:0%
drugs and I'd like to see some some
 
02:43:42.240 --> 02:43:43.490 align:start position:0%
drugs and I'd like to see some some
actual

02:43:43.490 --> 02:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
actual
 
02:43:46.010 --> 02:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
information some protection some guard
 
02:43:47.929 --> 02:43:47.939 align:start position:0%
rails I just think it needs a little
 
02:43:51.290 --> 02:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
more work and I think legalizing this
 
02:43:53.150 --> 02:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
ahead of some type of a plan kind of
 
02:43:55.610 --> 02:43:55.620 align:start position:0%
puts the car before the horse which is
 
02:43:57.349 --> 02:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
why I'd like to retain it so that we can
 
02:43:58.969 --> 02:43:58.979 align:start position:0%
maybe do some work on it and come out
 
02:44:01.630 --> 02:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
with a piece of legislation if necessary
 
02:44:03.469 --> 02:44:03.479 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
02:44:10.250 --> 02:44:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:13.070 --> 02:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
speaking to the promise Prime sponsor um
 
02:44:15.770 --> 02:44:15.780 align:start position:0%
and he was okay with the retain I am as
 
02:44:17.570 --> 02:44:17.580 align:start position:0%
well I think there's a little more work
 
02:44:20.210 --> 02:44:20.220 align:start position:0%
that we can do with it
 
02:44:23.389 --> 02:44:23.399 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
02:44:25.190 --> 02:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
seeing nonetheless to clerk to call the
 
02:44:26.750 --> 02:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
roll the motion on floor is to retain
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
how oh did I miss somebody I'm sorry
 
02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
represent means go ahead
 
02:44:33.650 --> 02:44:33.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I just wanted to say I I support uh
 
02:44:35.270 --> 02:44:35.280 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain the bill because it
 
02:44:36.410 --> 02:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
is important
 
02:44:39.410 --> 02:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
um that we get this right
 
02:44:41.510 --> 02:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
and I think uh having a little bit of
 
02:44:45.170 --> 02:44:45.180 align:start position:0%
extra time to do that will help help us
 
02:44:46.730 --> 02:44:46.740 align:start position:0%
not only get the bill right but
 
02:44:49.250 --> 02:44:49.260 align:start position:0%
hopefully to build uh more consensus
 
02:44:50.929 --> 02:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
around the fact that we actually need to
 
02:44:53.090 --> 02:44:53.100 align:start position:0%
do more in New Hampshire uh to save
 
02:44:53.100 --> 02:44:54.230 align:start position:0%
do more in New Hampshire uh to save
lives

02:44:54.230 --> 02:44:54.240 align:start position:0%
lives
 
02:44:58.010 --> 02:44:58.020 align:start position:0%
so what retaining will do essentially is
 
02:44:59.809 --> 02:44:59.819 align:start position:0%
is put us in a position where we're not
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
killing the bill we're not forcing a
 
02:45:04.190 --> 02:45:04.200 align:start position:0%
vote on the floor where people are going
 
02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:05.340 align:start position:0%
to have to make a black and white
 
02:45:07.670 --> 02:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
decision what we what we're going to do
 
02:45:11.270 --> 02:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
is we're we passed 287 that's on its way
 
02:45:14.630 --> 02:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
so legalizing fentanyl test strips is on
 
02:45:16.070 --> 02:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
its way to happening and I believe it's
 
02:45:18.950 --> 02:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
on consent so that's a very positive
 
02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:19.870 align:start position:0%
on consent so that's a very positive
thing

02:45:19.870 --> 02:45:19.880 align:start position:0%
thing
 
02:45:22.490 --> 02:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
and what retaining this bill does is it
 
02:45:25.250 --> 02:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
puts us in a position to actually build
 
02:45:27.309 --> 02:45:27.319 align:start position:0%
on that Good Start
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
later on this year and introduce
 
02:45:32.150 --> 02:45:32.160 align:start position:0%
legislation or not not introduce
 
02:45:34.130 --> 02:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
legislation in the next session but
 
02:45:36.670 --> 02:45:36.680 align:start position:0%
actually to change this legislation
 
02:45:39.910 --> 02:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
so that we we actually can address
 
02:45:42.710 --> 02:45:42.720 align:start position:0%
the issues that have been raised in a in
 
02:45:45.650 --> 02:45:45.660 align:start position:0%
a sensible way and keep making progress
 
02:45:47.809 --> 02:45:47.819 align:start position:0%
and I think that is what we need to do
 
02:45:51.290 --> 02:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
in order to make a dent with uh with the
 
02:45:52.969 --> 02:45:52.979 align:start position:0%
overdose deaths that we're seeing in New
 
02:45:55.610 --> 02:45:55.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so what I have liked to have
 
02:45:59.450 --> 02:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
seen this bill go through yes because
 
02:46:01.849 --> 02:46:01.859 align:start position:0%
there there are probably lives at a bill
 
02:46:04.849 --> 02:46:04.859 align:start position:0%
like this could have saved but it is
 
02:46:06.530 --> 02:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
important to get it right it is
 
02:46:09.170 --> 02:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
important to get consensus and it is
 
02:46:11.630 --> 02:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
really important in this legislature to
 
02:46:14.630 --> 02:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
get it passed so I think that's what
 
02:46:16.550 --> 02:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
we're going to work for
 
02:46:19.070 --> 02:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and and I wholeheartedly agree
 
02:46:21.770 --> 02:46:21.780 align:start position:0%
that um if we were to pass it today all
 
02:46:23.770 --> 02:46:23.780 align:start position:0%
of us still have questions of our own
 
02:46:26.210 --> 02:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
and our colleagues on the floor would
 
02:46:27.710 --> 02:46:27.720 align:start position:0%
have questions and I don't think we'd be
 
02:46:29.389 --> 02:46:29.399 align:start position:0%
able to answer them so I I don't think
 
02:46:31.730 --> 02:46:31.740 align:start position:0%
it would have a positive uh future if we
 
02:46:34.130 --> 02:46:34.140 align:start position:0%
were to just cut it loose like it is so
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
I agree we should do some more work on
 
02:46:35.880 --> 02:46:36.830 align:start position:0%
I agree we should do some more work on
it

02:46:36.830 --> 02:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:46:38.690 --> 02:46:38.700 align:start position:0%
um anyone else
 
02:46:40.309 --> 02:46:40.319 align:start position:0%
see none I'll ask the court to call the
 
02:46:41.870 --> 02:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
roll the motion on the floor is to
 
02:46:44.990 --> 02:46:45.000 align:start position:0%

so House Bill 470 has been retained and

02:47:42.950 --> 02:47:42.960 align:start position:0%

with that I'm going to
 
02:47:48.530 --> 02:47:48.540 align:start position:0%
yes we do yeah and with that I'm going
 
02:47:52.190 --> 02:47:52.200 align:start position:0%
to open executive session on House Bill
 
02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:55.490 align:start position:0%

02:47:58.250 --> 02:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to recognize myself for a
 
02:47:59.510 --> 02:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
motion again
 
02:48:02.150 --> 02:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
I'm going to
 
02:48:06.170 --> 02:48:06.180 align:start position:0%
move on to pass on House Bill 397. do I
 
02:48:10.849 --> 02:48:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:13.490 --> 02:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
I think Peru is first
 
02:48:15.830 --> 02:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah well maybe
 
02:48:17.870 --> 02:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
um and I'll speak to that we had some
 
02:48:17.880 --> 02:48:18.889 align:start position:0%
um and I'll speak to that we had some
discussion

02:48:18.889 --> 02:48:18.899 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:48:21.710 --> 02:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
um that this bill probably is not
 
02:48:24.050 --> 02:48:24.060 align:start position:0%
necessary based on several other bills
 
02:48:24.060 --> 02:48:25.790 align:start position:0%
necessary based on several other bills
that

02:48:25.790 --> 02:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:48:29.570 --> 02:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
um make it legal already
 
02:48:32.450 --> 02:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
with regard to prescriptions
 
02:48:35.090 --> 02:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
um and we also heard that there's
 
02:48:37.090 --> 02:48:37.100 align:start position:0%
probably not been anyone prosecuted
 
02:48:42.230 --> 02:48:42.240 align:start position:0%
recently or for some time just based on
 
02:48:45.530 --> 02:48:45.540 align:start position:0%
the fact that they had needles and it
 
02:48:48.230 --> 02:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
was always some other type of substance
 
02:48:50.690 --> 02:48:50.700 align:start position:0%
involved so it wasn't just a needle
 
02:48:54.170 --> 02:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
having said that I do think that the
 
02:48:56.450 --> 02:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
bills at best it's not going to hurt
 
02:49:00.110 --> 02:49:00.120 align:start position:0%
anyone and that it could possibly help
 
02:49:02.330 --> 02:49:02.340 align:start position:0%
with regard to cases involving custody
 
02:49:04.250 --> 02:49:04.260 align:start position:0%
and things of that nature where someone
 
02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
tries to use that
 
02:49:08.870 --> 02:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so if it's if it's still hanging out
 
02:49:10.969 --> 02:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
there that there's a potential that it's
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
illegal for a child to have their
 
02:49:17.630 --> 02:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
parents EpiPen or their insulin I don't
 
02:49:19.130 --> 02:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
think it will hurt
 
02:49:20.929 --> 02:49:20.939 align:start position:0%
to pass the bill
 
02:49:22.309 --> 02:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to your second
 
02:49:27.170 --> 02:49:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:30.590 --> 02:49:30.600 align:start position:0%
I I agreed that uh
 
02:49:32.210 --> 02:49:32.220 align:start position:0%
one I'm not really sure if this is
 
02:49:35.450 --> 02:49:35.460 align:start position:0%
necessary but if it helps to uh
 
02:49:35.460 --> 02:49:36.830 align:start position:0%
necessary but if it helps to uh
prevent

02:49:36.830 --> 02:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
02:49:38.870 --> 02:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
an innocent person kind of getting
 
02:49:41.450 --> 02:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
sucked up into the system uh I'm okay
 
02:49:43.429 --> 02:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
with that right because
 
02:49:43.439 --> 02:49:45.050 align:start position:0%
with that right because
um

02:49:45.050 --> 02:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:47.090 --> 02:49:47.100 align:start position:0%
I know when I was a kid
 
02:49:49.490 --> 02:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
um my cousin was a diabetic and I used
 
02:49:53.030 --> 02:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
to carry his glucagon form as well so I
 
02:49:54.469 --> 02:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
I get that whole piece that somebody
 
02:49:57.590 --> 02:49:57.600 align:start position:0%
might be holding a syringe and and
 
02:49:59.809 --> 02:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
somebody might look at them and say why
 
02:50:01.250 --> 02:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
do you have that you have no reason to
 
02:50:02.389 --> 02:50:02.399 align:start position:0%
have it but
 
02:50:05.450 --> 02:50:05.460 align:start position:0%
this will cover them and take away all
 
02:50:07.190 --> 02:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
that so
 
02:50:09.830 --> 02:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
that's it thank you
 
02:50:11.929 --> 02:50:11.939 align:start position:0%
um and and I agree as well the first
 
02:50:13.250 --> 02:50:13.260 align:start position:0%
thing I look at on a piece of
 
02:50:16.130 --> 02:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
legislation is Do no harm in um this
 
02:50:17.630 --> 02:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
bill I don't see a way where it's going
 
02:50:19.969 --> 02:50:19.979 align:start position:0%
to do any harm so if it's possible to do
 
02:50:22.910 --> 02:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
a little good then so be it um further
 
02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:28.370 --> 02:50:28.380 align:start position:0%
I just have a question that I don't
 
02:50:31.130 --> 02:50:31.140 align:start position:0%
think was answered in or even asked in
 
02:50:33.290 --> 02:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
the uh public hearing
 
02:50:35.510 --> 02:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
has to do with the last sentence in the
 
02:50:38.030 --> 02:50:38.040 align:start position:0%
first paragraph that says use of a
 
02:50:39.670 --> 02:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needle is
 
02:50:42.230 --> 02:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
hypodermics need a contrary to the
 
02:50:44.530 --> 02:50:44.540 align:start position:0%
intent of of the prescription is not
 
02:50:48.290 --> 02:50:48.300 align:start position:0%
permitted under this statute so I don't
 
02:50:51.590 --> 02:50:51.600 align:start position:0%
know use of by who is that mean or that
 
02:50:55.510 --> 02:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
does that just mean whether when the
 
02:50:59.050 --> 02:50:59.060 align:start position:0%
person uh when the tri when the
 
02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
authorized agent who is a minor
 
02:51:04.270 --> 02:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
is found with a needle that has
 
02:51:06.889 --> 02:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
something in it other than what the
 
02:51:09.410 --> 02:51:09.420 align:start position:0%
intent of the prescription said
 
02:51:13.610 --> 02:51:13.620 align:start position:0%
what exactly does that mean to what's
 
02:51:15.230 --> 02:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
going to happen to that child
 
02:51:18.530 --> 02:51:18.540 align:start position:0%
well um according to all it does as far
 
02:51:21.050 --> 02:51:21.060 align:start position:0%
as the bill is related is it would take
 
02:51:22.969 --> 02:51:22.979 align:start position:0%
away the protections of this bill for
 
02:51:25.070 --> 02:51:25.080 align:start position:0%
that child so whatever would then
 
02:51:27.290 --> 02:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
normally flow from his possession of
 
02:51:29.870 --> 02:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
that illegal substance would happen this
 
02:51:32.690 --> 02:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
bill only covers them if with protection
 
02:51:34.730 --> 02:51:34.740 align:start position:0%
if they have a syringe with the
 
02:51:36.530 --> 02:51:36.540 align:start position:0%
prescription substance in it that's
 
02:51:40.130 --> 02:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in it go ahead
 
02:51:42.230 --> 02:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
so that means
 
02:51:44.990 --> 02:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
it they would be subject to depend to
 
02:51:46.730 --> 02:51:46.740 align:start position:0%
whatever the penalties of the law are
 
02:51:50.630 --> 02:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
whether they are a trusted agent or not
 
02:51:52.910 --> 02:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
thank you as far as I can read it the
 
02:51:54.469 --> 02:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
only protection that this bill gives is
 
02:51:55.969 --> 02:51:55.979 align:start position:0%
someone who is using it the way it's
 
02:51:57.230 --> 02:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
supposed to be according to the
 
02:51:57.240 --> 02:51:58.750 align:start position:0%
supposed to be according to the
prescription

02:51:58.750 --> 02:51:58.760 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
02:52:02.150 --> 02:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
further comments questions
 
02:52:02.160 --> 02:52:03.349 align:start position:0%
further comments questions
uh

02:52:03.349 --> 02:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:52:05.269 --> 02:52:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
02:52:07.790 --> 02:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'll uh be voting
 
02:52:10.250 --> 02:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
against autopass on this bill I don't
 
02:52:11.330 --> 02:52:11.340 align:start position:0%
think the
 
02:52:14.090 --> 02:52:14.100 align:start position:0%
testimony today provided uh really
 
02:52:16.670 --> 02:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
compelling reasons to change anything uh
 
02:52:19.010 --> 02:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
in the juvenile system as some of us
 
02:52:21.710 --> 02:52:21.720 align:start position:0%
know if it's possession of say a
 
02:52:23.630 --> 02:52:23.640 align:start position:0%
resident a residue case involving a
 
02:52:26.090 --> 02:52:26.100 align:start position:0%
syringe that's really the uh selling
 
02:52:28.010 --> 02:52:28.020 align:start position:0%
point and there's still no real
 
02:52:30.130 --> 02:52:30.140 align:start position:0%
disposition at the end of that
 
02:52:33.170 --> 02:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
I just see this is uh problematic if
 
02:52:35.269 --> 02:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to allow miners to have
 
02:52:38.090 --> 02:52:38.100 align:start position:0%
possession of needles Without Really uh
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
having again another mechanism to
 
02:52:41.389 --> 02:52:41.399 align:start position:0%
enforce anything it kind of puts us
 
02:52:46.070 --> 02:52:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:47.929 --> 02:52:47.939 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else
 
02:52:50.269 --> 02:52:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
02:52:52.790 --> 02:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
would somebody refresh my memory what
 
02:52:55.250 --> 02:52:55.260 align:start position:0%
was I thought representative e ocella
 
02:52:57.590 --> 02:52:57.600 align:start position:0%
was talking about an amendment that uh
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
that HHS put in there was what bill was
 
02:53:01.969 --> 02:53:01.979 align:start position:0%
that about because there was no
 
02:53:04.429 --> 02:53:04.439 align:start position:0%
Amendment on this no this is the amended
 
02:53:06.469 --> 02:53:06.479 align:start position:0%
form of the bill they amended it when
 
02:53:08.929 --> 02:53:08.939 align:start position:0%
they had it in their possession and they
 
02:53:14.570 --> 02:53:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:16.969 --> 02:53:16.979 align:start position:0%
the authorized agent
 
02:53:16.979 --> 02:53:18.190 align:start position:0%
the authorized agent
okay

02:53:18.190 --> 02:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:53:21.590 --> 02:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
anyone else our representative um
 
02:53:28.190 --> 02:53:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:28.200 --> 02:53:29.630 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:53:29.630 --> 02:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:31.610 --> 02:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
I don't know I I struggle with the bill
 
02:53:32.809 --> 02:53:32.819 align:start position:0%
as well
 
02:53:34.550 --> 02:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm not going to be voting in favor
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
02:53:38.150 --> 02:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that was brought to
 
02:53:40.370 --> 02:53:40.380 align:start position:0%
our attention was
 
02:53:43.910 --> 02:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
in the bill it uses RSA 318
 
02:53:46.730 --> 02:53:46.740 align:start position:0%
however when the question was asked of
 
02:53:48.769 --> 02:53:48.779 align:start position:0%
the cases
 
02:53:48.779 --> 02:53:49.670 align:start position:0%
the cases
um

02:53:49.670 --> 02:53:49.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:52.969 --> 02:53:52.979 align:start position:0%
there were other charges which led me to
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
believe that they probably were
 
02:53:58.969 --> 02:53:58.979 align:start position:0%
teenagers not like children 12 and under
 
02:53:58.979 --> 02:53:59.630 align:start position:0%
teenagers not like children 12 and under
um

02:53:59.630 --> 02:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:01.429 --> 02:54:01.439 align:start position:0%
I would have liked to
 
02:54:02.750 --> 02:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
um since
 
02:54:04.790 --> 02:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the prom sponsor received it from
 
02:54:07.969 --> 02:54:07.979 align:start position:0%
attorney head I would have liked to had
 
02:54:10.010 --> 02:54:10.020 align:start position:0%
a conversation with him about the
 
02:54:12.650 --> 02:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
information that was given out today
 
02:54:15.170 --> 02:54:15.180 align:start position:0%
so for that reason
 
02:54:18.410 --> 02:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the young people were
 
02:54:18.420 --> 02:54:19.969 align:start position:0%
um I believe that the young people were
charged

02:54:19.969 --> 02:54:19.979 align:start position:0%
charged
 
02:54:23.630 --> 02:54:23.640 align:start position:0%
because of what might have been in the
 
02:54:26.690 --> 02:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
um syringe and um
 
02:54:29.690 --> 02:54:29.700 align:start position:0%
or they might have been users themselves
 
02:54:32.330 --> 02:54:32.340 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm just throwing that out
 
02:54:32.340 --> 02:54:33.469 align:start position:0%
I don't know I'm just throwing that out
there

02:54:33.469 --> 02:54:33.479 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:54:35.750 --> 02:54:35.760 align:start position:0%
so I will not be supporting this thank
 
02:54:37.309 --> 02:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
you and
 
02:54:39.650 --> 02:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
it's also possible that they weren't so
 
02:54:41.750 --> 02:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
I guess we just don't know
 
02:54:44.030 --> 02:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
um representative Howard thank you Mr
 
02:54:47.990 --> 02:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
chair I am in support of OTP I believe
 
02:54:50.630 --> 02:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
that this bill would remove uh the
 
02:54:53.750 --> 02:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity for uh minors to actually
 
02:54:57.110 --> 02:54:57.120 align:start position:0%
become victims and any opportunity to
 
02:55:01.490 --> 02:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
limit a juvenile going into a uh a
 
02:55:04.670 --> 02:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
prison system is beneficial because of
 
02:55:07.910 --> 02:55:07.920 align:start position:0%
course it affects their lives and could
 
02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
potentially uh ruin that life and lead
 
02:55:13.190 --> 02:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
them down a path that we would not like
 
02:55:14.630 --> 02:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
to see them go down
 
02:55:17.330 --> 02:55:17.340 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
02:55:18.590 --> 02:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:55:20.150 --> 02:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
02:55:22.010 --> 02:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to clarify for
 
02:55:24.530 --> 02:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
the committee uh any juvenile who was
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
found in possession of a needle even
 
02:55:28.550 --> 02:55:28.560 align:start position:0%
with say heroin or cocaine residue is
 
02:55:30.590 --> 02:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
not going to go to jail or prison that's
 
02:55:33.230 --> 02:55:33.240 align:start position:0%
reality under New Hampshire law secondly
 
02:55:36.650 --> 02:55:36.660 align:start position:0%
uh in 2001 the state of New Hampshire uh
 
02:55:38.830 --> 02:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
this legislative body ended up
 
02:55:40.910 --> 02:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
decriminalizing uh possession of a
 
02:55:44.030 --> 02:55:44.040 align:start position:0%
needle without a prescription and like I
 
02:55:46.610 --> 02:55:46.620 align:start position:0%
looked it up and it was in 2001 so we
 
02:55:47.870 --> 02:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
haven't really had
 
02:55:49.490 --> 02:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
I think significant issues into
 
02:55:51.889 --> 02:55:51.899 align:start position:0%
involving juvenile population to justify
 
02:55:54.170 --> 02:55:54.180 align:start position:0%
this Bill thank you
 
02:55:57.590 --> 02:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
represent Baldwin
 
02:55:58.849 --> 02:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
I'm just
 
02:56:04.550 --> 02:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:05.990 --> 02:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
were made that simply an arrest or
 
02:56:07.790 --> 02:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
charges can have even if they end up
 
02:56:09.710 --> 02:56:09.720 align:start position:0%
being dropped later
 
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
um and I know that for example in some
 
02:56:14.929 --> 02:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
schools children minors can face
 
02:56:17.870 --> 02:56:17.880 align:start position:0%
disciplinary action on the part of
 
02:56:19.670 --> 02:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
administration just by virtue of having
 
02:56:21.410 --> 02:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
been charged and that can affect their
 
02:56:23.750 --> 02:56:23.760 align:start position:0%
ability to attend classes and continue
 
02:56:25.969 --> 02:56:25.979 align:start position:0%
with their normal curriculum so there's
 
02:56:27.590 --> 02:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
a lot on the line even if we think that
 
02:56:29.150 --> 02:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
someone isn't going to end up in the
 
02:56:31.070 --> 02:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
prison system
 
02:56:34.250 --> 02:56:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:35.990 --> 02:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy
 
02:56:38.450 --> 02:56:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I agree with
 
02:56:40.670 --> 02:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
representative stoned the points that
 
02:56:42.050 --> 02:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
he's made
 
02:56:44.809 --> 02:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh prosecution of
 
02:56:44.819 --> 02:56:46.070 align:start position:0%
um in terms of uh prosecution of
children

02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
children
 
02:56:49.010 --> 02:56:49.020 align:start position:0%
um under 12 I'm not aware
 
02:56:51.830 --> 02:56:51.840 align:start position:0%
um that that that actually happens I
 
02:56:53.809 --> 02:56:53.819 align:start position:0%
know there were a few cases cited but
 
02:56:55.370 --> 02:56:55.380 align:start position:0%
none of the details really available
 
02:56:58.309 --> 02:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
around that so I mean I I think it could
 
02:56:59.929 --> 02:56:59.939 align:start position:0%
lead us to speculate all kinds of things
 
02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:03.359 align:start position:0%
but the reality is that at the at worst
 
02:57:04.610 --> 02:57:04.620 align:start position:0%
case scenario
 
02:57:06.410 --> 02:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
um there were a lot of numbers maybe in
 
02:57:08.990 --> 02:57:09.000 align:start position:0%
1997 or eight that the the sponsor
 
02:57:10.550 --> 02:57:10.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned but they've decreased
 
02:57:12.710 --> 02:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
significantly to be virtually on
 
02:57:12.720 --> 02:57:14.870 align:start position:0%
significantly to be virtually on
non-existent

02:57:14.870 --> 02:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
non-existent
 
02:57:18.349 --> 02:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that um this bill is um
 
02:57:19.849 --> 02:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
you know what's what's being written is
 
02:57:22.250 --> 02:57:22.260 align:start position:0%
already uh it's already legal so I don't
 
02:57:24.349 --> 02:57:24.359 align:start position:0%
I don't think we need to uh to legislate
 
02:57:26.809 --> 02:57:26.819 align:start position:0%
so I'll be voting in opposition
 
02:57:28.730 --> 02:57:28.740 align:start position:0%
thank you I think it's safe to say this
 
02:57:29.990 --> 02:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
bill will not be going on consent
 
02:57:32.389 --> 02:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
representative Prue
 
02:57:34.670 --> 02:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
so with the information that
 
02:57:37.190 --> 02:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative Stone just gave us I I
 
02:57:39.110 --> 02:57:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't think I can support this anymore
 
02:57:41.150 --> 02:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
and if I need to withdraw my second and
 
02:57:42.410 --> 02:57:42.420 align:start position:0%
let somebody else do that I'd be happy
 
02:57:42.420 --> 02:57:45.490 align:start position:0%
let somebody else do that I'd be happy
to

02:57:45.490 --> 02:57:45.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:48.230 --> 02:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:57:51.769 --> 02:57:51.779 align:start position:0%
because if it's already illegal I don't
 
02:57:54.170 --> 02:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
think we need the reason syringes I
 
02:57:55.910 --> 02:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
think we'll just go for it then I don't
 
02:57:58.429 --> 02:57:58.439 align:start position:0%
think this is necessary okay okay well I
 
02:58:00.110 --> 02:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
we don't need to you don't need to
 
02:58:02.030 --> 02:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
withdraw your second unless you want to
 
02:58:03.950 --> 02:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
you just vote against it but I'm going
 
02:58:04.969 --> 02:58:04.979 align:start position:0%
to vote against it okay that's fine
 
02:58:06.769 --> 02:58:06.779 align:start position:0%
representative Newman
 
02:58:08.870 --> 02:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I just have a question about the
 
02:58:10.370 --> 02:58:10.380 align:start position:0%
discussion that we've been having here
 
02:58:13.429 --> 02:58:13.439 align:start position:0%
some I just heard that it's legal for
 
02:58:16.309 --> 02:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
minors to have needles in the state is
 
02:58:17.809 --> 02:58:17.819 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
02:58:20.150 --> 02:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
because the because the answer to my
 
02:58:23.269 --> 02:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
previous question was that this bill
 
02:58:25.969 --> 02:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
doesn't really have an effect because if
 
02:58:27.070 --> 02:58:27.080 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
02:58:29.870 --> 02:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
illegal substance in the needle whether
 
02:58:31.969 --> 02:58:31.979 align:start position:0%
they are a
 
02:58:34.309 --> 02:58:34.319 align:start position:0%
um whatever authorized agent or whether
 
02:58:36.590 --> 02:58:36.600 align:start position:0%
they are just a juvenile
 
02:58:39.050 --> 02:58:39.060 align:start position:0%
that has something that is contrary to
 
02:58:40.610 --> 02:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
the prescription that they are
 
02:58:43.429 --> 02:58:43.439 align:start position:0%
authorized to have they are then subject
 
02:58:45.290 --> 02:58:45.300 align:start position:0%
to whatever the penalties are so I I
 
02:58:47.170 --> 02:58:47.180 align:start position:0%
just don't see
 
02:58:49.070 --> 02:58:49.080 align:start position:0%
what this law is going to do
 
02:58:51.230 --> 02:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
representative Stone would you uh be
 
02:58:53.030 --> 02:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
willing to read us that portion of the
 
02:58:53.040 --> 02:58:54.889 align:start position:0%
willing to read us that portion of the
statute

02:58:54.889 --> 02:58:54.899 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:58:57.550 --> 02:58:57.560 align:start position:0%
Mr chair that would be the portion of
 
02:58:59.750 --> 02:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
the new language
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
no I mean the the one that um says that
 
02:59:05.690 --> 02:59:05.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's currently legal for um for the
 
02:59:08.330 --> 02:59:08.340 align:start position:0%
miners to possess a yes currently not
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
listed as being legal
 
02:59:12.349 --> 02:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
but what it is is the testimony we heard
 
02:59:14.990 --> 02:59:15.000 align:start position:0%
today of a uh say a diabetic parent
 
02:59:17.269 --> 02:59:17.279 align:start position:0%
having a syringe there well I believe
 
02:59:18.650 --> 02:59:18.660 align:start position:0%
the example was they were unconscious
 
02:59:20.990 --> 02:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's competing harms defense and I
 
02:59:23.210 --> 02:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
can't really Envision uh going through
 
02:59:24.710 --> 02:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
the law enforcement process and
 
02:59:27.290 --> 02:59:27.300 align:start position:0%
including going to judicial process of a
 
02:59:28.910 --> 02:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
judge not using a reasonable
 
02:59:30.710 --> 02:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
expectations that that would be a
 
02:59:32.330 --> 02:59:32.340 align:start position:0%
competing harms defense
 
02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
no but I I thought you said that it's
 
02:59:37.190 --> 02:59:37.200 align:start position:0%
currently legal for everyone 2012 that
 
02:59:39.349 --> 02:59:39.359 align:start position:0%
was the adults they decriminalized it in
 
02:59:41.750 --> 02:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
2001 for adults the juvenile statue
 
02:59:43.730 --> 02:59:43.740 align:start position:0%
again though you see if you have the
 
02:59:46.910 --> 02:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
syringe and it's under the law I can't
 
02:59:48.349 --> 02:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
really Envision many Law Enforcement
 
02:59:50.210 --> 02:59:50.220 align:start position:0%
Officers taking action on that unless
 
02:59:51.590 --> 02:59:51.600 align:start position:0%
there's an illegal substance in the
 
02:59:54.290 --> 02:59:54.300 align:start position:0%
syringe itself which makes it illegal
 
02:59:57.170 --> 02:59:57.180 align:start position:0%
okay so we're back to it it is currently
 
02:59:59.570 --> 02:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
illegal just that it most likely will
 
03:00:01.849 --> 03:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
not be prosecuted correct Mr chair
 
03:00:04.250 --> 03:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative scitec I want good
 
03:00:08.150 --> 03:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
legislation not uh prosecutorial uh
 
03:00:08.160 --> 03:00:10.070 align:start position:0%
legislation not uh prosecutorial uh
discretion

03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
discretion
 
03:00:13.670 --> 03:00:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Murray
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:00:16.910 --> 03:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I just want to bring it back to the
 
03:00:18.830 --> 03:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
points made by reps Bolden and Howard
 
03:00:21.889 --> 03:00:21.899 align:start position:0%
that you know even if representative
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
Stone you can't see like law enforcement
 
03:00:25.550 --> 03:00:25.560 align:start position:0%
realistically enforcing these things
 
03:00:27.530 --> 03:00:27.540 align:start position:0%
just having the opportunity to do so
 
03:00:29.510 --> 03:00:29.520 align:start position:0%
still can leave a negative impact to the
 
03:00:31.490 --> 03:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
public as mentioned by representative
 
03:00:34.610 --> 03:00:34.620 align:start position:0%
Bolden and Howard just having charges in
 
03:00:36.590 --> 03:00:36.600 align:start position:0%
and of itself can severely negatively
 
03:00:38.750 --> 03:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
impact especially a child's life
 
03:00:41.690 --> 03:00:41.700 align:start position:0%
um and I think that taking care of your
 
03:00:43.550 --> 03:00:43.560 align:start position:0%
parent and this bill has been very clear
 
03:00:45.530 --> 03:00:45.540 align:start position:0%
that it's about prescription drugs it's
 
03:00:48.050 --> 03:00:48.060 align:start position:0%
not just needles in general I don't
 
03:00:49.309 --> 03:00:49.319 align:start position:0%
think this brings any harm to children
 
03:00:53.389 --> 03:00:53.399 align:start position:0%
and I will be sporting otd thank you I'm
 
03:00:54.889 --> 03:00:54.899 align:start position:0%
representative here Catherine did you
 
03:01:01.370 --> 03:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:05.330 --> 03:01:05.340 align:start position:0%
um you can be an authorized agent and a
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
few of the young men on this team today
 
03:01:09.950 --> 03:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
were authorized agents for family
 
03:01:14.269 --> 03:01:14.279 align:start position:0%
members at young age so by law you can
 
03:01:16.130 --> 03:01:16.140 align:start position:0%
do that but there's training that goes
 
03:01:17.510 --> 03:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:01:20.450 --> 03:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
a lot of training from what I understand
 
03:01:24.170 --> 03:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
so for any any parent or anyone that
 
03:01:26.330 --> 03:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
feel they want their child to do to to
 
03:01:28.370 --> 03:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
be their authorized agent can do that
 
03:01:28.380 --> 03:01:29.510 align:start position:0%
be their authorized agent can do that
today

03:01:29.510 --> 03:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
today
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
so for me I don't know why we have the
 
03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:34.560 align:start position:0%
bill here do you know what that statute
 
03:01:36.469 --> 03:01:36.479 align:start position:0%
is that would authorize authorizations
 
03:01:38.929 --> 03:01:38.939 align:start position:0%
so we can look it up yeah if there is
 
03:01:40.730 --> 03:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
such a statute I think that would have a
 
03:01:41.990 --> 03:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
bearing because that would make this
 
03:01:42.000 --> 03:01:43.969 align:start position:0%
bearing because that would make this
duplicative

03:01:43.969 --> 03:01:43.979 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
03:01:46.610 --> 03:01:46.620 align:start position:0%
um representative Bolden
 
03:01:49.670 --> 03:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
I'm just wanting to provide some input
 
03:01:51.410 --> 03:01:51.420 align:start position:0%
on the whole discussion over whether or
 
03:01:53.450 --> 03:01:53.460 align:start position:0%
not it is illegal the bill
 
03:01:56.210 --> 03:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
has the RSA that says that it's illegal
 
03:01:58.210 --> 03:01:58.220 align:start position:0%
to furnish
 
03:02:00.830 --> 03:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
hypodermic syringe to a person under 18.
 
03:02:03.650 --> 03:02:03.660 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the law that's being
 
03:02:06.710 --> 03:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
edited by this bill so it says
 
03:02:09.110 --> 03:02:09.120 align:start position:0%
the law currently says now no person
 
03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
shall sell furnish or give to any person
 
03:02:13.429 --> 03:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
under 18 years of age an instrument
 
03:02:16.510 --> 03:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
commonly known as a hypodermic syringe
 
03:02:18.710 --> 03:02:18.720 align:start position:0%
hypodermic needle or any other
 
03:02:20.030 --> 03:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
instrument adapted for the
 
03:02:22.330 --> 03:02:22.340 align:start position:0%
administration of drugs by injection
 
03:02:26.690 --> 03:02:26.700 align:start position:0%
and so the bill scratches a bunch of
 
03:02:28.670 --> 03:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
that out and then adds unless the
 
03:02:30.530 --> 03:02:30.540 align:start position:0%
recipient is acting as an authorized
 
03:02:32.990 --> 03:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
agent for another as defined in RSA 318
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
colon 42.
 
03:02:37.490 --> 03:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
so I don't know if that's obvious to
 
03:02:40.370 --> 03:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
anyone else but it seems obvious to me
 
03:02:43.070 --> 03:02:43.080 align:start position:0%
that the intent of the bill is to
 
03:02:45.950 --> 03:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
maintain that it is illegal for minors
 
03:02:47.630 --> 03:02:47.640 align:start position:0%
to access syringes that are not being
 
03:02:49.790 --> 03:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
used for medical purposes
 
03:02:51.530 --> 03:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
thank you and for pointing out the
 
03:02:54.050 --> 03:02:54.060 align:start position:0%
obvious as we did not look at it
 
03:02:55.849 --> 03:02:55.859 align:start position:0%
um so yes the current state of affairs
 
03:02:58.969 --> 03:02:58.979 align:start position:0%
is it is illegal to give a minor a
 
03:03:01.370 --> 03:03:01.380 align:start position:0%
syringe and this bill would just carve
 
03:03:03.410 --> 03:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
that out and say unless they are an
 
03:03:05.510 --> 03:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
authorized agent and this is the only
 
03:03:07.550 --> 03:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
place in statute where that is dealt
 
03:03:10.849 --> 03:03:10.859 align:start position:0%
with so I do not see the harm in in
 
03:03:13.550 --> 03:03:13.560 align:start position:0%
carving that out I think
 
03:03:16.429 --> 03:03:16.439 align:start position:0%
go ahead and representative Newman I
 
03:03:18.769 --> 03:03:18.779 align:start position:0%
also don't see the the harm in carving
 
03:03:20.450 --> 03:03:20.460 align:start position:0%
that out because it protects the
 
03:03:22.790 --> 03:03:22.800 align:start position:0%
authorized agent now from the
 
03:03:24.710 --> 03:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
possibility of being arrested because
 
03:03:26.870 --> 03:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's carved out if in fact they're an
 
03:03:29.150 --> 03:03:29.160 align:start position:0%
authorized agent and if in fact there is
 
03:03:31.969 --> 03:03:31.979 align:start position:0%
no illegal substances in the and and it
 
03:03:34.790 --> 03:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
may may be as representative Stone said
 
03:03:37.550 --> 03:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
that even if there is they're not going
 
03:03:39.290 --> 03:03:39.300 align:start position:0%
to be arrested or not but I think this
 
03:03:41.809 --> 03:03:41.819 align:start position:0%
gives specifics where people might be
 
03:03:44.990 --> 03:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
get a benefit from having the miners
 
03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
available to help them with their
 
03:03:47.870 --> 03:03:47.880 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs
 
03:03:50.269 --> 03:03:50.279 align:start position:0%
and where they you would take away for
 
03:03:52.429 --> 03:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
that authorized agent the possibility of
 
03:03:55.610 --> 03:03:55.620 align:start position:0%
being uh in con having to be in contact
 
03:03:59.389 --> 03:03:59.399 align:start position:0%
with the criminal justice system
 
03:04:02.510 --> 03:04:02.520 align:start position:0%
okay I think we've pretty much beat this
 
03:04:03.889 --> 03:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
up pretty good
 
03:04:05.630 --> 03:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I would ask the clerk to call the
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
roll at this point the motion on the
 
03:04:09.110 --> 03:04:09.120 align:start position:0%
floor is ought to pass
 
03:04:12.230 --> 03:04:12.240 align:start position:0%

chair I'm sorry if I may be
 
03:05:26.809 --> 03:05:26.819 align:start position:0%
the recommendation that you would have
 
03:05:35.929 --> 03:05:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:37.309 --> 03:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
with that I will close the public
 
03:05:40.309 --> 03:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on HP 397. excuse me the
 
03:05:45.349 --> 03:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:47.690 --> 03:05:47.700 align:start position:0%
and I will open the executive session on

and I will open the executive session on

03:05:53.269 --> 03:05:53.279 align:start position:0%
relative to the options for violations
 
03:05:58.730 --> 03:05:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:05.530 --> 03:06:05.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:11.830 --> 03:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:13.910 --> 03:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
who was that
 
03:06:15.889 --> 03:06:15.899 align:start position:0%
I think it was town so I can see
 
03:06:18.170 --> 03:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
representative was this the subcommittee
 
03:06:20.150 --> 03:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
that you did
 
03:06:22.730 --> 03:06:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chairman yes it was and do
 
03:06:24.650 --> 03:06:24.660 align:start position:0%
you have a motion you'd like to make on
 
03:06:27.590 --> 03:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
the bill uh we had a motion of itl okay
 
03:06:30.950 --> 03:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:32.809 --> 03:06:32.819 align:start position:0%
it means I speak to your motion yes
 
03:06:35.030 --> 03:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman well this bill did
 
03:06:38.269 --> 03:06:38.279 align:start position:0%
have good intent uh it was a bill that
 
03:06:40.610 --> 03:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
took a lot to pass last year if this was
 
03:06:42.370 --> 03:06:42.380 align:start position:0%
amendment 2 I believe
 
03:06:45.349 --> 03:06:45.359 align:start position:0%
1778 I may have the incorrect uh House
 
03:06:48.230 --> 03:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
Bill uh but the intent of this was to
 
03:06:50.030 --> 03:06:50.040 align:start position:0%
increase the
 
03:06:52.610 --> 03:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
level of violation from a violation to a
 
03:06:54.110 --> 03:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
class a felony we thought the amount of
 
03:06:55.910 --> 03:06:55.920 align:start position:0%
time and effort that it took to even
 
03:06:57.769 --> 03:06:57.779 align:start position:0%
squeeze by the bill it passed last year
 
03:07:00.950 --> 03:07:00.960 align:start position:0%
would almost be a slap into the face of
 
03:07:02.630 --> 03:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
everyone who tried to work on this last
 
03:07:04.790 --> 03:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
year so we think that at this time that
 
03:07:07.010 --> 03:07:07.020 align:start position:0%
it should be ideal
 
03:07:11.210 --> 03:07:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:15.590 --> 03:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:16.790 --> 03:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
I want to speak to your second
 
03:07:16.800 --> 03:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
I want to speak to your second
representative

03:07:17.990 --> 03:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:07:23.330 --> 03:07:23.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:29.450 --> 03:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative tenzar could you help us
 
03:07:32.450 --> 03:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
out um with regard to this bill just a
 
03:07:34.910 --> 03:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
little explanation so this was a a very
 
03:07:37.010 --> 03:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
confusing Bill to begin with and while
 
03:07:39.650 --> 03:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
we were in the subcommittee speaking
 
03:07:41.269 --> 03:07:41.279 align:start position:0%
with representative Manion he did do a
 
03:07:42.950 --> 03:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
good job to try to explain it the best
 
03:07:45.230 --> 03:07:45.240 align:start position:0%
he could but you may know Jim and Roy
 
03:07:46.790 --> 03:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
this the bill that was passed last year
 
03:07:48.950 --> 03:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
that I think uh Senator Abbas was the
 
03:07:50.929 --> 03:07:50.939 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor on that this went through
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
so many different committees Judiciary
 
03:07:54.889 --> 03:07:54.899 align:start position:0%
and they got the best that they could
 
03:07:56.630 --> 03:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
get and they think that if we tried to
 
03:07:58.550 --> 03:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
introduce this that there's going to be
 
03:08:00.050 --> 03:08:00.060 align:start position:0%
a problem going forward with all the
 
03:08:01.910 --> 03:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
bills so we think that while it may look
 
03:08:04.250 --> 03:08:04.260 align:start position:0%
like a good bill now it's too much to
 
03:08:06.170 --> 03:08:06.180 align:start position:0%
put forward at this particular time okay
 
03:08:08.269 --> 03:08:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:08:09.710 --> 03:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
um so you know further discussion I will
 
03:08:10.969 --> 03:08:10.979 align:start position:0%
ask the clerk to call the roll the
 
03:08:13.250 --> 03:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is inexpedient to
 
03:08:13.260 --> 03:08:15.290 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor is inexpedient to
legislate

03:08:15.290 --> 03:08:15.300 align:start position:0%
legislate
 
03:08:17.630 --> 03:08:17.640 align:start position:0%

Amendment yes thank you Mr chairman
 
03:16:54.050 --> 03:16:54.060 align:start position:0%
um the basic tenant of this bill is is
 
03:16:56.570 --> 03:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
not to punish our police officers our
 
03:16:58.190 --> 03:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the state of New
 
03:16:58.200 --> 03:16:59.090 align:start position:0%
law enforcement in the state of New
Hampshire

03:16:59.090 --> 03:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:16:59.100 --> 03:17:00.830 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
uh

03:17:00.830 --> 03:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:17:03.650 --> 03:17:03.660 align:start position:0%
or remove them from Office what we would
 
03:17:06.769 --> 03:17:06.779 align:start position:0%
like to do is to recognize that under
 
03:17:09.170 --> 03:17:09.180 align:start position:0%
the entire State Commerce Clause of the
 
03:17:11.630 --> 03:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution that a
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
something is manufactured in the state
 
03:17:14.570 --> 03:17:14.580 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire sold in New Hampshire
 
03:17:16.969 --> 03:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
never leaves the state of New Hampshire
 
03:17:20.450 --> 03:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
is not subject to Federal oversight and
 
03:17:24.050 --> 03:17:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:26.570 --> 03:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
represented yep representative would you
 
03:17:28.309 --> 03:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
like to speak to you a second
 
03:17:32.750 --> 03:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
sure I tend to agree that an officer may
 
03:17:32.760 --> 03:17:33.590 align:start position:0%
sure I tend to agree that an officer may
be

03:17:33.590 --> 03:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:17:35.750 --> 03:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
put in a position where he has to act on
 
03:17:38.450 --> 03:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
them and to penalize him for doing his
 
03:17:41.990 --> 03:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
job I don't agree with
 
03:17:46.670 --> 03:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:50.210 --> 03:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:52.250 --> 03:17:52.260 align:start position:0%
representative Pratt
 
03:17:53.870 --> 03:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
so I don't believe in penalizing police
 
03:17:55.849 --> 03:17:55.859 align:start position:0%
officers maybe from an office uh they
 
03:17:57.410 --> 03:17:57.420 align:start position:0%
may have an order from somebody higher
 
03:17:59.269 --> 03:17:59.279 align:start position:0%
up and they have to follow the order
 
03:18:01.550 --> 03:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
but what what teeth are now left in this
 
03:18:02.990 --> 03:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
bill is there any teeth left in this
 
03:18:03.000 --> 03:18:06.590 align:start position:0%
bill is there any teeth left in this
bill

03:18:06.590 --> 03:18:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:09.230 --> 03:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
yeah that again the basic tenant of the
 
03:18:11.210 --> 03:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
bill was to make it so that New
 
03:18:14.150 --> 03:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire recognizes as a policy that
 
03:18:16.790 --> 03:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
something made and sold in the state of
 
03:18:17.990 --> 03:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire never leaves the state of
 
03:18:19.370 --> 03:18:19.380 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not subject to Federal
 
03:18:19.380 --> 03:18:21.410 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is not subject to Federal
oversight

03:18:21.410 --> 03:18:21.420 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:18:23.510 --> 03:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:18:25.130 --> 03:18:25.140 align:start position:0%
so to be clear
 
03:18:26.870 --> 03:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
um it's your intent that this bill is
 
03:18:29.990 --> 03:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
actually more of a policy statement
 
03:18:32.510 --> 03:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
than um anything with actual teeth
 
03:18:36.349 --> 03:18:36.359 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct thank you
 
03:18:39.170 --> 03:18:39.180 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:18:40.969 --> 03:18:40.979 align:start position:0%
representative Stone
 
03:18:42.349 --> 03:18:42.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I'd also like to
 
03:18:43.969 --> 03:18:43.979 align:start position:0%
point out that a similar bill was passed
 
03:18:47.510 --> 03:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
Texas house bill number 957's passing
 
03:18:50.570 --> 03:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
2021 that expressly exempts Federal
 
03:18:52.370 --> 03:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
Regulation firearms
 
03:18:54.349 --> 03:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
that are made in a state from being
 
03:18:57.410 --> 03:18:57.420 align:start position:0%
entered into Commerce as well
 
03:18:59.389 --> 03:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
and was that Bill signed in the law in
 
03:18:59.399 --> 03:19:00.530 align:start position:0%
and was that Bill signed in the law in
Texas

03:19:00.530 --> 03:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
Texas
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:11.450 --> 03:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:15.290 --> 03:19:15.300 align:start position:0%
how do I say this um I think that
 
03:19:18.769 --> 03:19:18.779 align:start position:0%
this to say that
 
03:19:20.389 --> 03:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:19:20.399 --> 03:19:21.110 align:start position:0%
you can't
um

03:19:21.110 --> 03:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:22.969 --> 03:19:22.979 align:start position:0%
everything that's manufactured here must
 
03:19:25.130 --> 03:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
stay here how do you know that because
 
03:19:27.410 --> 03:19:27.420 align:start position:0%
once I purchase once I purchase
 
03:19:29.809 --> 03:19:29.819 align:start position:0%
something I can do what I want
 
03:19:32.750 --> 03:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's a reality
 
03:19:35.630 --> 03:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
I can try to answer that if you'd allow
 
03:19:36.849 --> 03:19:36.859 align:start position:0%
me to
 
03:19:39.170 --> 03:19:39.180 align:start position:0%
just let's stick to the amendment first
 
03:19:42.410 --> 03:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
okay okay yeah
 
03:19:45.530 --> 03:19:45.540 align:start position:0%

03:19:48.050 --> 03:19:48.060 align:start position:0%

03:21:25.790 --> 03:21:25.800 align:start position:0%
motion on the underlying bill
 
03:21:29.269 --> 03:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely once again the the bill as
 
03:21:32.570 --> 03:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
amended would allow
 
03:21:34.910 --> 03:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
an item manufactured in the state of New
 
03:21:36.349 --> 03:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire sold in New Hampshire and
 
03:21:37.969 --> 03:21:37.979 align:start position:0%
remains in New Hampshire and I I can
 
03:21:40.130 --> 03:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
explain that to the question of the
 
03:21:41.750 --> 03:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative earlier
 
03:21:44.929 --> 03:21:44.939 align:start position:0%
um to to not be subject to that we
 
03:21:46.969 --> 03:21:46.979 align:start position:0%
acknowledge it is not subject to Federal
 
03:21:50.030 --> 03:21:50.040 align:start position:0%
oversight and by that I mean I'll give
 
03:21:53.570 --> 03:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
you two examples uh again as I've stated
 
03:21:56.150 --> 03:21:56.160 align:start position:0%
many times in committee I served the
 
03:21:58.010 --> 03:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
last two summers working in a camp
 
03:22:01.070 --> 03:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
setting Where I Was A I am a Firearms
 
03:22:03.590 --> 03:22:03.600 align:start position:0%
instructor teaching youth to safely
 
03:22:05.870 --> 03:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
utilize firearms and one of the problems
 
03:22:08.570 --> 03:22:08.580 align:start position:0%
that we've realized early on was that
 
03:22:10.190 --> 03:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
the ear protection
 
03:22:13.370 --> 03:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
uh was not suitable for a youth it's
 
03:22:16.190 --> 03:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
made for an adult and therefore the
 
03:22:18.290 --> 03:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
youth were actually exposed to high
 
03:22:20.090 --> 03:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
levels of noise
 
03:22:23.630 --> 03:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
the whole idea purpose is to reduce harm
 
03:22:26.349 --> 03:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
reduction in the ear protection so
 
03:22:30.050 --> 03:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
utilizing a suppressed firearm would be
 
03:22:32.510 --> 03:22:32.520 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of those Scouts I
 
03:22:34.010 --> 03:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be using the word Scouts for
 
03:22:35.330 --> 03:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
those youth
 
03:22:38.929 --> 03:22:38.939 align:start position:0%
and that this bill would allow
 
03:22:41.929 --> 03:22:41.939 align:start position:0%
a suppressor made in New Hampshire
 
03:22:44.690 --> 03:22:44.700 align:start position:0%
sold or donated to the camp to be
 
03:22:46.790 --> 03:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
utilized in the camp setting and never
 
03:22:51.889 --> 03:22:51.899 align:start position:0%
leave that camp without any federal tax
 
03:22:56.349 --> 03:22:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh being against the camp the second
 
03:22:59.150 --> 03:22:59.160 align:start position:0%
situation would be
 
03:23:02.630 --> 03:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
a Firearms School where they have a
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
range an indoor range and I can think of
 
03:23:07.190 --> 03:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
at least four of them that I know of in
 
03:23:09.229 --> 03:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire where the
 
03:23:11.510 --> 03:23:11.520 align:start position:0%
person that owns that range
 
03:23:13.849 --> 03:23:13.859 align:start position:0%
could go to a manufacturer that makes a
 
03:23:13.859 --> 03:23:14.870 align:start position:0%
could go to a manufacturer that makes a
suppressor

03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
suppressor
 
03:23:17.389 --> 03:23:17.399 align:start position:0%
purchase that suppressor have it on the
 
03:23:19.429 --> 03:23:19.439 align:start position:0%
Range and it never leaves the range and
 
03:23:20.929 --> 03:23:20.939 align:start position:0%
it would not be subject to the federal
 
03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
tax so that's basically what this bill
 
03:23:26.030 --> 03:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
is trying to do is to acknowledge that
 
03:23:28.490 --> 03:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
if it's made in New Hampshire sold in
 
03:23:29.990 --> 03:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and remains in New
 
03:23:31.910 --> 03:23:31.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is not subject to Federal
 
03:23:31.920 --> 03:23:33.229 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it is not subject to Federal
oversight

03:23:33.229 --> 03:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
03:23:34.490 --> 03:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
I hope that answered the
 
03:23:36.889 --> 03:23:36.899 align:start position:0%
representative's question well if it did
 
03:23:39.290 --> 03:23:39.300 align:start position:0%
it didn't answer for me I'm I'm curious
 
03:23:41.929 --> 03:23:41.939 align:start position:0%
how does this how do you keep
 
03:23:44.450 --> 03:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
in other words so the representative's
 
03:23:46.670 --> 03:23:46.680 align:start position:0%
point if I purchase if I go to Zig and
 
03:23:49.190 --> 03:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
buy a gun from them directly because
 
03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
they're manufactured here in New
 
03:23:53.929 --> 03:23:53.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire how does the law contemplate
 
03:23:56.870 --> 03:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
me moving to Florida with that and thus
 
03:24:00.349 --> 03:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
bringing into interstate commerce
 
03:24:00.359 --> 03:24:02.030 align:start position:0%
bringing into interstate commerce
um

03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:24:03.469 --> 03:24:03.479 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:24:03.479 --> 03:24:05.630 align:start position:0%
you can't
representative

03:24:05.630 --> 03:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:24:07.729 --> 03:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
isn't there something with full faith
 
03:24:11.510 --> 03:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
and full faith and recognition Clause of
 
03:24:13.309 --> 03:24:13.319 align:start position:0%
the Constitution if you get married in
 
03:24:14.809 --> 03:24:14.819 align:start position:0%
Connecticut you're married in New
 
03:24:17.450 --> 03:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so if you had bought this
 
03:24:19.490 --> 03:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
legally had it all done here legally
 
03:24:21.469 --> 03:24:21.479 align:start position:0%
you're not doing any Commerce you're
 
03:24:23.450 --> 03:24:23.460 align:start position:0%
transporting your personal property to
 
03:24:25.550 --> 03:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
Florida so
 
03:24:28.490 --> 03:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
I don't like the you know never mind
 
03:24:31.130 --> 03:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
I've said it
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
representative Stone in the case of
 
03:24:35.750 --> 03:24:35.760 align:start position:0%
firearms it would be similar to uh
 
03:24:39.229 --> 03:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
you're required by ATF to manufacture it
 
03:24:40.490 --> 03:24:40.500 align:start position:0%
with markings saying that it was
 
03:24:43.070 --> 03:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
manufactured in the state of origin and
 
03:24:44.750 --> 03:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
your manufacturer's name that you're on
 
03:24:48.410 --> 03:24:48.420 align:start position:0%
file with uh generally some states do
 
03:24:50.389 --> 03:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
not allow suppressors so if you were to
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
move to a state that specifically by
 
03:24:53.809 --> 03:24:53.819 align:start position:0%
state law prohibits them you would not
 
03:24:54.769 --> 03:24:54.779 align:start position:0%
be allowed to bring your personal
 
03:25:01.490 --> 03:25:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:03.410 --> 03:25:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Newell
 
03:25:05.510 --> 03:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
um just a point of clarification on on
 
03:25:05.520 --> 03:25:06.769 align:start position:0%
um just a point of clarification on on
that

03:25:06.769 --> 03:25:06.779 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:25:06.779 --> 03:25:07.670 align:start position:0%
that
um

03:25:07.670 --> 03:25:07.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:11.269 --> 03:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
is that a Federal Regulation
 
03:25:13.670 --> 03:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
which part for it to be labeled that
 
03:25:14.990 --> 03:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
it's made in New Hampshire yes that's a
 
03:25:16.790 --> 03:25:16.800 align:start position:0%
requirement of marking variants through
 
03:25:19.670 --> 03:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
ATF and all firearm manufacturers are
 
03:25:21.530 --> 03:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
required to do that by federal law right
 
03:25:23.389 --> 03:25:23.399 align:start position:0%
but if I'm not mistaken what this bill
 
03:25:25.309 --> 03:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
says is that these things would not be
 
03:25:27.170 --> 03:25:27.180 align:start position:0%
subject to Federal Regulation so would
 
03:25:29.210 --> 03:25:29.220 align:start position:0%
they be subject to that Federal
 
03:25:31.130 --> 03:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
Regulation to be labeled you would not
 
03:25:32.630 --> 03:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
be able to manufacture it without a
 
03:25:35.809 --> 03:25:35.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:38.809 --> 03:25:38.819 align:start position:0%
so you'd have to comply with it
 
03:25:40.309 --> 03:25:40.319 align:start position:0%
but you're not entering into Commerce
 
03:25:42.170 --> 03:25:42.180 align:start position:0%
but what this Bill is saying is that
 
03:25:43.610 --> 03:25:43.620 align:start position:0%
that things that are made here are
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
exempt from Federal Regulation and
 
03:25:46.550 --> 03:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying that a Federal Regulation
 
03:25:48.530 --> 03:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
would ensure that it's labeled that way
 
03:25:50.570 --> 03:25:50.580 align:start position:0%
yeah just follow-up clarification most
 
03:25:52.729 --> 03:25:52.739 align:start position:0%
manufacturers will sell their products
 
03:25:55.790 --> 03:25:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh to other members in different states
 
03:25:57.590 --> 03:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
that therefore you're taxed on that
 
03:25:59.450 --> 03:25:59.460 align:start position:0%
based on how many units you you make
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
individually and there's a reporting
 
03:26:02.929 --> 03:26:02.939 align:start position:0%
element at the end of every year where
 
03:26:05.210 --> 03:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
in April you have to fill it out so at
 
03:26:06.290 --> 03:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
03:26:08.750 --> 03:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
if you're manufacturing it it's marked
 
03:26:10.010 --> 03:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
where it's made
 
03:26:11.450 --> 03:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
and if you're entering into Commerce
 
03:26:13.250 --> 03:26:13.260 align:start position:0%
you're taxed accordingly if these are
 
03:26:15.050 --> 03:26:15.060 align:start position:0%
subject I believe not to be taxed if
 
03:26:16.309 --> 03:26:16.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to be residing in New
 
03:26:18.769 --> 03:26:18.779 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and not entered into Commerce
 
03:26:22.429 --> 03:26:22.439 align:start position:0%
if you look at page two line 10 through
 
03:26:26.450 --> 03:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
13 I'm sorry 10 through 12.
 
03:26:30.170 --> 03:26:30.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:32.630 --> 03:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
the state law would be a firearm
 
03:26:34.070 --> 03:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer sold in New Hampshire under
 
03:26:35.690 --> 03:26:35.700 align:start position:0%
this chapter shall have the words made
 
03:26:37.010 --> 03:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire clearly stamped
 
03:26:39.050 --> 03:26:39.060 align:start position:0%
inscribed or otherwise marked on the
 
03:26:41.510 --> 03:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
central part of the firearm such as the
 
03:26:43.370 --> 03:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
receiver refrain so
 
03:26:46.670 --> 03:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:48.290 --> 03:26:48.300 align:start position:0%
representative Muse and then
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:54.110 --> 03:26:54.120 align:start position:0%
okay well I appreciate the removal of
 
03:26:57.769 --> 03:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
the penalty uh penalty part of the of
 
03:27:00.349 --> 03:27:00.359 align:start position:0%
the of the bill uh I think there are
 
03:27:01.550 --> 03:27:01.560 align:start position:0%
some other things that we need to be
 
03:27:03.550 --> 03:27:03.560 align:start position:0%
very much aware of
 
03:27:06.889 --> 03:27:06.899 align:start position:0%
during our conversation one is I
 
03:27:09.050 --> 03:27:09.060 align:start position:0%
understand that the the new intention of
 
03:27:11.150 --> 03:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
the bill is really to serve more as a
 
03:27:13.010 --> 03:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
policy statement in New Hampshire but
 
03:27:15.710 --> 03:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
the reality is is this would do
 
03:27:19.309 --> 03:27:19.319 align:start position:0%
something that HB 1178 which we've
 
03:27:22.309 --> 03:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
passed last year did not do which is I
 
03:27:24.889 --> 03:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
would write nullify federal law in New
 
03:27:24.899 --> 03:27:25.910 align:start position:0%
would write nullify federal law in New
Hampshire

03:27:25.910 --> 03:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:27:29.389 --> 03:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
the courts have consistently ruled uh
 
03:27:31.870 --> 03:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
that nullification laws are not
 
03:27:35.590 --> 03:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
constitutional when States pass them
 
03:27:39.229 --> 03:27:39.239 align:start position:0%
Missouri's law which is different from
 
03:27:41.210 --> 03:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
the one we passed last year but similar
 
03:27:44.110 --> 03:27:44.120 align:start position:0%
in some ways was actually found
 
03:27:47.330 --> 03:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional last week
 
03:27:51.170 --> 03:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
um one of the ways uh that uh folks
 
03:27:55.090 --> 03:27:55.100 align:start position:0%
treaded around that issue uh in in 2022
 
03:27:58.550 --> 03:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh in New Hampshire uh was to take
 
03:28:00.590 --> 03:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
advantage of some earlier Court rulings
 
03:28:03.229 --> 03:28:03.239 align:start position:0%
uh that that basically
 
03:28:06.110 --> 03:28:06.120 align:start position:0%
uh said that uh the federal government
 
03:28:10.610 --> 03:28:10.620 align:start position:0%
couldn't commandeer State resources so
 
03:28:14.389 --> 03:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh one of the reasons why uh that
 
03:28:16.969 --> 03:28:16.979 align:start position:0%
particular bill passed the muster of the
 
03:28:19.729 --> 03:28:19.739 align:start position:0%
Attorney General was because it wasn't
 
03:28:22.190 --> 03:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
likely to be immediately overturned by a
 
03:28:22.200 --> 03:28:23.690 align:start position:0%
likely to be immediately overturned by a
court

03:28:23.690 --> 03:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
another issue that I see is it's
 
03:28:28.670 --> 03:28:28.680 align:start position:0%
extremely broad if you look at the bill
 
03:28:32.450 --> 03:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
it encompasses Springs screws nuts and
 
03:28:35.450 --> 03:28:35.460 align:start position:0%
pins you're going to need a pretty small
 
03:28:37.610 --> 03:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
stamp to stamp made in New Hampshire on
 
03:28:40.309 --> 03:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
on some of those things the other thing
 
03:28:43.990 --> 03:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
is what is to prevent somebody in China
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
from stamping made in New Hampshire on a
 
03:28:49.790 --> 03:28:49.800 align:start position:0%
firearm and claiming the protection of
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law how do we have any way
 
03:28:56.690 --> 03:28:56.700 align:start position:0%
of really knowing uh where a firearm is
 
03:28:56.700 --> 03:28:57.969 align:start position:0%
of really knowing uh where a firearm is
from

03:28:57.969 --> 03:28:57.979 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:28:59.750 --> 03:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
perhaps some of the in-state
 
03:29:01.969 --> 03:29:01.979 align:start position:0%
manufacturers can prove it maybe not it
 
03:29:04.550 --> 03:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
makes it very difficult to enforcement
 
03:29:07.309 --> 03:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
to enforce it one of the issues that
 
03:29:09.710 --> 03:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
comes up with a lot of the laws and
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
proposals that we we discuss is well how
 
03:29:15.290 --> 03:29:15.300 align:start position:0%
how would it be enforced
 
03:29:16.510 --> 03:29:16.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
03:29:19.250 --> 03:29:19.260 align:start position:0%
how would it how would it be enforced
 
03:29:21.170 --> 03:29:21.180 align:start position:0%
it's a policy statement so when it
 
03:29:23.090 --> 03:29:23.100 align:start position:0%
whenever a bill is framed as a policy
 
03:29:25.790 --> 03:29:25.800 align:start position:0%
statement it almost infers that it
 
03:29:28.370 --> 03:29:28.380 align:start position:0%
really doesn't matter how it's enforced
 
03:29:30.710 --> 03:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
which which tells me maybe this
 
03:29:32.150 --> 03:29:32.160 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be a bill it should be more of
 
03:29:34.429 --> 03:29:34.439 align:start position:0%
a house resolution which is uh what the
 
03:29:38.929 --> 03:29:38.939 align:start position:0%
folks who had the house resolution uh in
 
03:29:42.050 --> 03:29:42.060 align:start position:0%
the one of our previous session days on
 
03:29:44.170 --> 03:29:44.180 align:start position:0%
urging Congress to ban assault weapons
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do
 
03:29:48.710 --> 03:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
um the other thing and the last thing
 
03:29:50.870 --> 03:29:50.880 align:start position:0%
that I'll point out is I think there's a
 
03:29:53.570 --> 03:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
difference between supporting
 
03:29:56.750 --> 03:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
a constitutional right and creating
 
03:29:59.690 --> 03:29:59.700 align:start position:0%
special rights
 
03:30:02.450 --> 03:30:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and I think that if we pass this bill
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
we actually kind of cross the line when
 
03:30:08.450 --> 03:30:08.460 align:start position:0%
it comes to that so it just urge there's
 
03:30:10.190 --> 03:30:10.200 align:start position:0%
just a lot of reasons to sort of slow
 
03:30:12.769 --> 03:30:12.779 align:start position:0%
down on this one and I would just urge
 
03:30:15.410 --> 03:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
my colleagues to maybe take a step back
 
03:30:18.050 --> 03:30:18.060 align:start position:0%
and and take another look at it thank
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
you representative Bolden
 
03:30:23.630 --> 03:30:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't think I was present
 
03:30:25.250 --> 03:30:25.260 align:start position:0%
for the hearing on this bill and I was
 
03:30:26.929 --> 03:30:26.939 align:start position:0%
wondering if anyone recalls whether any
 
03:30:26.939 --> 03:30:28.250 align:start position:0%
wondering if anyone recalls whether any
manufacturers

03:30:28.250 --> 03:30:28.260 align:start position:0%
manufacturers
 
03:30:30.110 --> 03:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire gave testimony
 
03:30:33.290 --> 03:30:33.300 align:start position:0%
because I've found an interesting um to
 
03:30:34.729 --> 03:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
hear that Texas
 
03:30:38.690 --> 03:30:38.700 align:start position:0%
uh passed a similar bill and I just
 
03:30:40.969 --> 03:30:40.979 align:start position:0%
tried to find it Google this was the top
 
03:30:43.729 --> 03:30:43.739 align:start position:0%
search result this is not selective
 
03:30:46.250 --> 03:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
Googling but in this article they're
 
03:30:48.769 --> 03:30:48.779 align:start position:0%
saying that it was passed in 2021 and as
 
03:30:50.809 --> 03:30:50.819 align:start position:0%
of January 2022 when this was written
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers in Texas were pretty
 
03:30:55.610 --> 03:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
frustrated because it was affecting
 
03:30:57.710 --> 03:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
their ability to have out-of-state sales
 
03:31:00.050 --> 03:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
in some way and I'm not going to claim
 
03:31:01.550 --> 03:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
to understand anything about this
 
03:31:01.560 --> 03:31:03.710 align:start position:0%
to understand anything about this
industry

03:31:03.710 --> 03:31:03.720 align:start position:0%
industry
 
03:31:07.070 --> 03:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
um but I guess it's because
 
03:31:07.080 --> 03:31:08.269 align:start position:0%
um but I guess it's because
if

03:31:08.269 --> 03:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:31:10.969 --> 03:31:10.979 align:start position:0%
the manufacturers
 
03:31:13.969 --> 03:31:13.979 align:start position:0%
worked in state the ATF said we're going
 
03:31:16.429 --> 03:31:16.439 align:start position:0%
to impose
 
03:31:19.250 --> 03:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
um sanctions anyway and they and they
 
03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
didn't care and then the state law said
 
03:31:24.650 --> 03:31:24.660 align:start position:0%
well ATF we're going to put you in jail
 
03:31:26.570 --> 03:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and then the ATF said well that's
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
fine because we just won't let you run
 
03:31:30.229 --> 03:31:30.239 align:start position:0%
your operation outside of the State of
 
03:31:32.990 --> 03:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
Texas and so it's been a Tit for Tat
 
03:31:33.000 --> 03:31:34.550 align:start position:0%
Texas and so it's been a Tit for Tat
thing

03:31:34.550 --> 03:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:31:36.710 --> 03:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
um that's kind of seems to have resulted
 
03:31:39.650 --> 03:31:39.660 align:start position:0%
in a Stranglehold on the silencer or
 
03:31:43.070 --> 03:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
suppressor manufacturers in Texas and as
 
03:31:46.610 --> 03:31:46.620 align:start position:0%
of this January 2022 article
 
03:31:48.469 --> 03:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
they're waiting for the law to be
 
03:31:50.150 --> 03:31:50.160 align:start position:0%
changed and they're not happy with the
 
03:31:51.769 --> 03:31:51.779 align:start position:0%
result that they got and I thought that
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
it would be worth throwing that info out
 
03:31:53.760 --> 03:31:54.530 align:start position:0%
it would be worth throwing that info out
there

03:31:54.530 --> 03:31:54.540 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I actually
 
03:32:01.130 --> 03:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm tending to agree I I don't see
 
03:32:02.990 --> 03:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
um Zig zauer who
 
03:32:05.929 --> 03:32:05.939 align:start position:0%
has a billion dollar contracts providing
 
03:32:09.050 --> 03:32:09.060 align:start position:0%
weapons to our military and selling
 
03:32:11.389 --> 03:32:11.399 align:start position:0%
Firearms around the world would limit
 
03:32:14.750 --> 03:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
themselves by engaging in this where
 
03:32:16.790 --> 03:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
they have the potential to lose billions
 
03:32:18.950 --> 03:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
of dollars of business
 
03:32:21.110 --> 03:32:21.120 align:start position:0%
um by not being able to ship their
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
firearms out of state because of a few
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
suppressors sold here
 
03:32:29.450 --> 03:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes thank you Mr
 
03:32:29.460 --> 03:32:31.309 align:start position:0%
um representative Rhodes thank you Mr
chairman

03:32:31.309 --> 03:32:31.319 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
03:32:36.050 --> 03:32:36.060 align:start position:0%
I I may be looking at this wrong and
 
03:32:37.790 --> 03:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think that there there has to be a
 
03:32:40.429 --> 03:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
level of standard on anything that is
 
03:32:42.050 --> 03:32:42.060 align:start position:0%
that is made
 
03:32:42.060 --> 03:32:43.490 align:start position:0%
that is made
and

03:32:43.490 --> 03:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:32:45.410 --> 03:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
the concern that I'm having is you know
 
03:32:47.269 --> 03:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
if you use a product
 
03:32:49.610 --> 03:32:49.620 align:start position:0%
incorrectly you know then that's just
 
03:32:51.050 --> 03:32:51.060 align:start position:0%
the product if I use my pen wrong it's
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
not it's not the manufacturer of the
 
03:32:53.809 --> 03:32:53.819 align:start position:0%
Pen's fault if I use my opinion
 
03:32:56.690 --> 03:32:56.700 align:start position:0%
correctly however if there's an if there
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
is a defect with a product
 
03:33:01.610 --> 03:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
I don't you know we wouldn't tell a car
 
03:33:03.290 --> 03:33:03.300 align:start position:0%
manufacturer that if their seat belts
 
03:33:06.170 --> 03:33:06.180 align:start position:0%
weren't you know properly installed that
 
03:33:08.510 --> 03:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
that the user is at fault
 
03:33:10.849 --> 03:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
um so again I may be looking at it
 
03:33:12.710 --> 03:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
differently or not understanding it but
 
03:33:12.720 --> 03:33:14.210 align:start position:0%
differently or not understanding it but
I

03:33:14.210 --> 03:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
I
 
03:33:16.250 --> 03:33:16.260 align:start position:0%
I have concern with it
 
03:33:19.849 --> 03:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
I don't could you follow what do you
 
03:33:21.530 --> 03:33:21.540 align:start position:0%
what does it have to do with defects I'm
 
03:33:21.540 --> 03:33:24.590 align:start position:0%
what does it have to do with defects I'm
confused

03:33:24.590 --> 03:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.600 --> 03:33:25.849 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:33:25.849 --> 03:33:25.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
so let me go back and read it because I
 
03:33:28.260 --> 03:33:29.330 align:start position:0%
so let me go back and read it because I
was

03:33:29.330 --> 03:33:29.340 align:start position:0%
was
 
03:33:31.190 --> 03:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that the testimony
 
03:33:33.469 --> 03:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
they were talking about
 
03:33:35.330 --> 03:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
The Testament that was given was was
 
03:33:35.340 --> 03:33:36.290 align:start position:0%
The Testament that was given was was
about

03:33:36.290 --> 03:33:36.300 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:33:36.300 --> 03:33:40.370 align:start position:0%
about
um

03:33:40.370 --> 03:33:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:42.650 --> 03:33:42.660 align:start position:0%
they were talking about them not having
 
03:33:44.809 --> 03:33:44.819 align:start position:0%
to be if they want to make manufacture
 
03:33:46.849 --> 03:33:46.859 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire it didn't have to
 
03:33:48.889 --> 03:33:48.899 align:start position:0%
have the same standard as
 
03:33:50.450 --> 03:33:50.460 align:start position:0%
as something else you'd have to follow
 
03:33:51.710 --> 03:33:51.720 align:start position:0%
the same roles
 
03:33:54.110 --> 03:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
however that was a long time ago but
 
03:33:55.550 --> 03:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
those are the notes that I have written
 
03:33:57.710 --> 03:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
down so in representative James looking
 
03:33:59.630 --> 03:33:59.640 align:start position:0%
at me with crazy faces but that's what I
 
03:34:01.490 --> 03:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
wrote down so I'm not really sure where
 
03:34:01.500 --> 03:34:03.590 align:start position:0%
wrote down so I'm not really sure where
I'm

03:34:03.590 --> 03:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
03:34:05.269 --> 03:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative Jennifer do you have any
 
03:34:07.370 --> 03:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
response I don't I didn't see anything
 
03:34:08.510 --> 03:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
about that
 
03:34:11.630 --> 03:34:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
um well first I think what
 
03:34:13.910 --> 03:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative Rhodes is trying to say
 
03:34:15.410 --> 03:34:15.420 align:start position:0%
is if we're taking away the standard
 
03:34:17.210 --> 03:34:17.220 align:start position:0%
then there could be defects and stuff
 
03:34:19.010 --> 03:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
that are not going to be addressed um
 
03:34:21.410 --> 03:34:21.420 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm misinterpreting that but I
 
03:34:22.670 --> 03:34:22.680 align:start position:0%
feel like
 
03:34:25.190 --> 03:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh your intent representative Jan Wren
 
03:34:28.190 --> 03:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
was it sounds like more of the taxes
 
03:34:29.750 --> 03:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the regulations and the
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
standards of how these weapons are
 
03:34:34.969 --> 03:34:34.979 align:start position:0%
manufactured so is it possible that we
 
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
could get an amendment that would
 
03:34:37.910 --> 03:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
clarify language in the bill or like
 
03:34:40.490 --> 03:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
retain it so you could amend that
 
03:34:42.590 --> 03:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
language and make it more pertinent to
 
03:34:48.650 --> 03:34:48.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:51.469 --> 03:34:51.479 align:start position:0%
quite frankly
 
03:34:54.530 --> 03:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
if we were to go in and strip every
 
03:34:58.250 --> 03:34:58.260 align:start position:0%
single thing except for the number one
 
03:35:01.309 --> 03:35:01.319 align:start position:0%
definitions and two
 
03:35:05.150 --> 03:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.849 --> 03:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
line 17
 
03:35:09.950 --> 03:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
through 20.
 
03:35:11.510 --> 03:35:11.520 align:start position:0%
that was the only thing that this this
 
03:35:14.330 --> 03:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
committee decided to pass I'd be happy
 
03:35:16.130 --> 03:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
as I think it would cover the situation
 
03:35:21.410 --> 03:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:27.130 --> 03:35:27.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:29.809 --> 03:35:29.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair at the heart of this
 
03:35:32.750 --> 03:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
bill just like in Texas it's an issue of
 
03:35:35.809 --> 03:35:35.819 align:start position:0%
uh taxation that is what it boils down
 
03:35:37.190 --> 03:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
to is taxation by the federal government
 
03:35:39.410 --> 03:35:39.420 align:start position:0%
on requiring 200 tax to have to be paid
 
03:35:42.469 --> 03:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
for any suppressor or uh NFA item uh
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
Texas's uh Bill if you actually read the
 
03:35:45.950 --> 03:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
bill is actually a lot more
 
03:35:47.570 --> 03:35:47.580 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than what's been presented
 
03:35:47.580 --> 03:35:48.590 align:start position:0%
comprehensive than what's been presented
here

03:35:48.590 --> 03:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:35:51.610 --> 03:35:51.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:54.650 --> 03:35:54.660 align:start position:0%
based on the e-reading of that bill do
 
03:35:56.210 --> 03:35:56.220 align:start position:0%
you feel like this bill would benefit
 
03:35:59.090 --> 03:35:59.100 align:start position:0%
from a more comprehensive uh look at it
 
03:35:59.100 --> 03:36:00.769 align:start position:0%
from a more comprehensive uh look at it
or

03:36:00.769 --> 03:36:00.779 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:36:02.450 --> 03:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
if we wanted to clean the bill up I
 
03:36:08.170 --> 03:36:08.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.670 --> 03:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.610 --> 03:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'll withdraw my motion of otpa if if
 
03:36:19.370 --> 03:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
you want to retain
 
03:36:19.380 --> 03:36:21.950 align:start position:0%
you want to retain
ER

03:36:21.950 --> 03:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.950 --> 03:36:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I just want to comment I I I'm not
 
03:36:27.469 --> 03:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
sure that I agree with the routine but I
 
03:36:29.690 --> 03:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
do I if I look at the definition in the
 
03:36:31.550 --> 03:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
first paragraph it has bump stocks in it
 
03:36:33.229 --> 03:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
now I I don't I've forgotten whether
 
03:36:35.570 --> 03:36:35.580 align:start position:0%
they're illegal or not or presidential
 
03:36:38.510 --> 03:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
ladder or but they happen to be in there
 
03:36:43.969 --> 03:36:43.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:46.429 --> 03:36:46.439 align:start position:0%
um bump stocks are are actually legal
 
03:36:47.690 --> 03:36:47.700 align:start position:0%
again I believe
 
03:36:50.450 --> 03:36:50.460 align:start position:0%
after a short hiatus
 
03:36:54.349 --> 03:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative um scitec I'd like to see
 
03:36:57.530 --> 03:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
retain because look for me what's at
 
03:36:58.849 --> 03:36:58.859 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:37:02.090 --> 03:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
in this bill is it's it's a stalking
 
03:37:04.610 --> 03:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
horse for the overreach of the federal
 
03:37:04.620 --> 03:37:05.830 align:start position:0%
horse for the overreach of the federal
government

03:37:05.830 --> 03:37:05.840 align:start position:0%
government
 
03:37:09.950 --> 03:37:09.960 align:start position:0%
and the over the elastic clause and
 
03:37:11.870 --> 03:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
everything that's
 
03:37:14.030 --> 03:37:14.040 align:start position:0%
that I dislike about the federal
 
03:37:16.910 --> 03:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
government and we're not able New
 
03:37:19.429 --> 03:37:19.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to put our thumb effectively
 
03:37:21.769 --> 03:37:21.779 align:start position:0%
in the eye of a beat
 
03:37:21.779 --> 03:37:22.729 align:start position:0%
in the eye of a beat
um

03:37:22.729 --> 03:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:25.490 --> 03:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
the federal government so as much as I
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
would like to do this symbolic gesture
 
03:37:30.830 --> 03:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's useless and I just as soon have it
 
03:37:33.050 --> 03:37:33.060 align:start position:0%
retained and walk out the back door
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to really win
 
03:37:34.439 --> 03:37:40.809 align:start position:0%
because we're not going to really win
anything

03:37:40.809 --> 03:37:40.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
representative James would you like to
 
03:37:45.410 --> 03:37:45.420 align:start position:0%

um or I'll ask the clerk to call the
 
03:38:09.290 --> 03:38:09.300 align:start position:0%

03:39:44.570 --> 03:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
-0586h I passed out a copy of that to
 
03:39:46.910 --> 03:39:46.920 align:start position:0%
everybody this morning
 
03:39:50.929 --> 03:39:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:53.510 --> 03:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
by representative Rhodes
 
03:39:55.010 --> 03:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
representative Manning would you like to
 
03:39:57.290 --> 03:39:57.300 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion on the amendment
 
03:39:59.750 --> 03:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair uh this amendment
 
03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
uh came out of uh subcommittee we did
 
03:40:05.389 --> 03:40:05.399 align:start position:0%
extensive work on this I thank the group
 
03:40:09.050 --> 03:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
uh what this amendment does is
 
03:40:11.210 --> 03:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
uh addresses the concerns we had
 
03:40:13.190 --> 03:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
initially with this bill being overly
 
03:40:16.670 --> 03:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
Broad and also putting a giant burden on
 
03:40:18.790 --> 03:40:18.800 align:start position:0%
the employer as opposed to the employee
 
03:40:21.130 --> 03:40:21.140 align:start position:0%
so I think we've addressed those
 
03:40:22.969 --> 03:40:22.979 align:start position:0%
essentially the loophole that we're
 
03:40:24.950 --> 03:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
looking to close or that the response
 
03:40:26.630 --> 03:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
was looking to close was Regis
 
03:40:28.670 --> 03:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
registered sex offenders employing
 
03:40:31.370 --> 03:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
minors or supervising minors or having
 
03:40:35.389 --> 03:40:35.399 align:start position:0%
direct one-on-one uh alone contact or or
 
03:40:37.670 --> 03:40:37.680 align:start position:0%
work with a minor and he mentioned the
 
03:40:40.429 --> 03:40:40.439 align:start position:0%
landscaper scenario and I believe that
 
03:40:43.010 --> 03:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
this this this new language addresses
 
03:40:46.010 --> 03:40:46.020 align:start position:0%
that and then in addition it removes the
 
03:40:48.110 --> 03:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
part where it would require the employer
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
to have a background check for all
 
03:40:53.269 --> 03:40:53.279 align:start position:0%
employees and that would be overburden
 
03:40:55.849 --> 03:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
for you know fast food restaurants or if
 
03:40:58.210 --> 03:40:58.220 align:start position:0%
you have 10 separate
 
03:41:01.250 --> 03:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
applicants for a job for one job you
 
03:41:02.870 --> 03:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
have to get 10 separate background
 
03:41:04.610 --> 03:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
checks so it eliminates that portion
 
03:41:06.229 --> 03:41:06.239 align:start position:0%
altogether which is not part of the
 
03:41:13.610 --> 03:41:13.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
representative priv would you like to
 
03:41:21.830 --> 03:41:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.110 --> 03:41:24.120 align:start position:0%
did a great job
 
03:41:25.849 --> 03:41:25.859 align:start position:0%
further discussion
 
03:41:29.090 --> 03:41:29.100 align:start position:0%
representative Bolden yes representative
 
03:41:31.550 --> 03:41:31.560 align:start position:0%
I also want to piggyback on that that um
 
03:41:32.870 --> 03:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
we looked it up and child care
 
03:41:34.729 --> 03:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
facilities are already required by law
 
03:41:37.130 --> 03:41:37.140 align:start position:0%
to do background checks so by
 
03:41:37.140 --> 03:41:38.450 align:start position:0%
to do background checks so by
eliminating

03:41:38.450 --> 03:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
eliminating
 
03:41:39.590 --> 03:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
um that part of the bill with the
 
03:41:39.600 --> 03:41:41.030 align:start position:0%
um that part of the bill with the
amendment

03:41:41.030 --> 03:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:41:42.830 --> 03:41:42.840 align:start position:0%
um that required background checks we're
 
03:41:44.510 --> 03:41:44.520 align:start position:0%
not making it so that nobody has to do
 
03:41:45.590 --> 03:41:45.600 align:start position:0%
them there's already a bunch of
 
03:41:47.269 --> 03:41:47.279 align:start position:0%
businesses that are required by allowed
 
03:41:49.429 --> 03:41:49.439 align:start position:0%
to do them in other areas the law
 
03:41:50.630 --> 03:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like those are
 
03:41:52.610 --> 03:41:52.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate we don't need to do it too
 
03:41:56.990 --> 03:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
the entire State and um also the
 
03:41:58.729 --> 03:41:58.739 align:start position:0%
um I thought it's worth mentioning that
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
the handouts that we got during the
 
03:42:01.969 --> 03:42:01.979 align:start position:0%
hearing for those specific situations
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
the guy who was a landscaper
 
03:42:08.030 --> 03:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
his case was overturned because so like
 
03:42:10.729 --> 03:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
he um he was he was initially convicted
 
03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
of violating the law that requires him
 
03:42:13.200 --> 03:42:14.870 align:start position:0%
of violating the law that requires him
to

03:42:14.870 --> 03:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:42:17.150 --> 03:42:17.160 align:start position:0%
um not have a job that involves children
 
03:42:20.510 --> 03:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
this law and then the conviction was
 
03:42:23.150 --> 03:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
overturned because the court very
 
03:42:26.210 --> 03:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
specifically said that it didn't make it
 
03:42:28.190 --> 03:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
at least we had never made it illegal
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
for us a registered sex offender to hire
 
03:42:33.710 --> 03:42:33.720 align:start position:0%
a minor and so that's what the that's
 
03:42:35.389 --> 03:42:35.399 align:start position:0%
the loophole that the sponsor was
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
originally trying to close and I think
 
03:42:39.290 --> 03:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
along the way with the changes in the
 
03:42:40.670 --> 03:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
wording in the amendment we also
 
03:42:43.670 --> 03:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
addressed the conversation about like
 
03:42:46.370 --> 03:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
being an employee but having Authority
 
03:42:49.309 --> 03:42:49.319 align:start position:0%
in the workplace over a minor and coming
 
03:42:50.929 --> 03:42:50.939 align:start position:0%
back to like the way that the law is
 
03:42:50.939 --> 03:42:52.250 align:start position:0%
back to like the way that the law is
structured

03:42:52.250 --> 03:42:52.260 align:start position:0%
structured
 
03:42:53.990 --> 03:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
um it's the responsibility of the
 
03:42:56.389 --> 03:42:56.399 align:start position:0%
offender and not the employer and it
 
03:42:57.710 --> 03:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
always has been
 
03:42:58.910 --> 03:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
um because it's just too much for
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
employers every sex offender knows
 
03:43:01.610 --> 03:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
they're registered
 
03:43:03.349 --> 03:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
and it's their job and they know that
 
03:43:04.969 --> 03:43:04.979 align:start position:0%
it's their job to make sure that they
 
03:43:06.769 --> 03:43:06.779 align:start position:0%
don't enter certain types of employment
 
03:43:09.050 --> 03:43:09.060 align:start position:0%
and the agency that manages them would
 
03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
communicate these changes in a lot of
 
03:43:12.170 --> 03:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
them so I don't know if that's helpful
 
03:43:13.610 --> 03:43:13.620 align:start position:0%
information anyone but I think it's a
 
03:43:16.610 --> 03:43:16.620 align:start position:0%
pretty solid Amendment and um
 
03:43:18.530 --> 03:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
and I know that there's buy-in from
 
03:43:22.309 --> 03:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
everybody who was really gung-ho either
 
03:43:24.410 --> 03:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
way on the bill initially
 
03:43:26.330 --> 03:43:26.340 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful thank you I know
 
03:43:27.830 --> 03:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
that there were a couple different
 
03:43:30.530 --> 03:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
factions going into that competing and I
 
03:43:32.269 --> 03:43:32.279 align:start position:0%
think that they seem to have merged and
 
03:43:36.769 --> 03:43:36.779 align:start position:0%
found a way to do it representative Muse
 
03:43:39.830 --> 03:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
you know just wanted to say that um an
 
03:43:41.030 --> 03:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
amendment like this is one of the
 
03:43:43.309 --> 03:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
reasons why the legislature occasionally
 
03:43:43.319 --> 03:43:44.570 align:start position:0%
reasons why the legislature occasionally
Works

03:43:44.570 --> 03:43:44.580 align:start position:0%
Works
 
03:43:49.250 --> 03:43:49.260 align:start position:0%
um so we actually passed a very similar
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
bill in the house last year HB 408 that
 
03:43:55.130 --> 03:43:55.140 align:start position:0%
had some problems and I think we kind of
 
03:43:56.809 --> 03:43:56.819 align:start position:0%
knew it had some problems when we sent
 
03:43:58.450 --> 03:43:58.460 align:start position:0%
it over to the Senate
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
and the Senate thought it had so many
 
03:44:02.929 --> 03:44:02.939 align:start position:0%
problems that they sent it to interim
 
03:44:04.250 --> 03:44:04.260 align:start position:0%
study where it was never actually
 
03:44:06.170 --> 03:44:06.180 align:start position:0%
interim studied
 
03:44:06.180 --> 03:44:06.769 align:start position:0%
interim studied
um

03:44:06.769 --> 03:44:06.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:10.490 --> 03:44:10.500 align:start position:0%
so so addressing some of the issues like
 
03:44:13.070 --> 03:44:13.080 align:start position:0%
the background check issue addressing
 
03:44:16.130 --> 03:44:16.140 align:start position:0%
the broadness of the bill that was
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
probably problematic in HP 408 is a is a
 
03:44:21.910 --> 03:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
good thing
 
03:44:25.190 --> 03:44:25.200 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we put a
 
03:44:27.710 --> 03:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
pretty bright line between people who
 
03:44:31.250 --> 03:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
are child sex offenders and children and
 
03:44:33.050 --> 03:44:33.060 align:start position:0%
what what the bill and what this
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
amendment do is they do that the other
 
03:44:37.969 --> 03:44:37.979 align:start position:0%
the last thing I wanted to point out in
 
03:44:39.710 --> 03:44:39.720 align:start position:0%
the spirit of maybe having a little fun
 
03:44:42.769 --> 03:44:42.779 align:start position:0%
with a very serious bill is this
 
03:44:45.050 --> 03:44:45.060 align:start position:0%
amendment may be putting the single
 
03:44:46.490 --> 03:44:46.500 align:start position:0%
longest sentence in New Hampshire
 
03:44:48.769 --> 03:44:48.779 align:start position:0%
statute into law
 
03:44:51.349 --> 03:44:51.359 align:start position:0%
so if you actually do a word count on
 
03:44:56.110 --> 03:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
that long long sentence it's 141 Words
 
03:44:59.570 --> 03:44:59.580 align:start position:0%
which is somebody who's a I'm a big
 
03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
advocate of plain language
 
03:45:05.210 --> 03:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
so it bothers me
 
03:45:07.250 --> 03:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
um but trying to dissect it and put it
 
03:45:09.170 --> 03:45:09.180 align:start position:0%
back together in a way that addresses
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
that issue I think would cause more
 
03:45:12.670 --> 03:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
problems than it solves so
 
03:45:16.729 --> 03:45:16.739 align:start position:0%
congratulations maybe on on having done
 
03:45:18.469 --> 03:45:18.479 align:start position:0%
something that no one else has done with
 
03:45:19.849 --> 03:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
this amendment has anyone called
 
03:45:24.170 --> 03:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:26.330 --> 03:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
now I want to pass it just because of
 
03:45:26.340 --> 03:45:27.349 align:start position:0%
now I want to pass it just because of
that

03:45:27.349 --> 03:45:27.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:45:29.630 --> 03:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
um any other discussion uh
 
03:45:31.969 --> 03:45:31.979 align:start position:0%
representative scitec
 
03:45:34.849 --> 03:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
uh the problem I this it's it's fine
 
03:45:37.550 --> 03:45:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's great but problem that I have and
 
03:45:40.429 --> 03:45:40.439 align:start position:0%
it's one we should think about is the a
 
03:45:42.889 --> 03:45:42.899 align:start position:0%
sex offender does this person wear The
 
03:45:46.370 --> 03:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
Mark of Cain if he opens it I did this
 
03:45:49.330 --> 03:45:49.340 align:start position:0%
when he's 26 years old and opens a
 
03:45:53.090 --> 03:45:53.100 align:start position:0%
landscape business when he's 56 is he
 
03:45:57.889 --> 03:45:57.899 align:start position:0%
carry that Mark forever and I just
 
03:46:00.590 --> 03:46:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's not enough to sink the ship but
 
03:46:03.050 --> 03:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
I don't like it I think that that
 
03:46:03.060 --> 03:46:05.090 align:start position:0%
I don't like it I think that that
particular

03:46:05.090 --> 03:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
particular
 
03:46:07.190 --> 03:46:07.200 align:start position:0%
particular aspect is actually important
 
03:46:09.170 --> 03:46:09.180 align:start position:0%
but I think it's addressed in in another
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
statute as far as how long they have to
 
03:46:13.729 --> 03:46:13.739 align:start position:0%
be a sex offender itself
 
03:46:15.769 --> 03:46:15.779 align:start position:0%
I think that's where we should if that
 
03:46:17.210 --> 03:46:17.220 align:start position:0%
needs fixing that's where it would be
 
03:46:17.220 --> 03:46:18.229 align:start position:0%
needs fixing that's where it would be
done

03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
done
 
03:46:20.150 --> 03:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
um who had their hand up representative
 
03:46:20.160 --> 03:46:23.630 align:start position:0%
um who had their hand up representative
Murray

03:46:23.630 --> 03:46:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:24.830 --> 03:46:24.840 align:start position:0%
um I was just hoping to get some
 
03:46:26.990 --> 03:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
clarification on
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
does this amendment cover
 
03:46:33.050 --> 03:46:33.060 align:start position:0%
all kinds of sexual offenders
 
03:46:34.969 --> 03:46:34.979 align:start position:0%
um just because I I do agree with the
 
03:46:36.469 --> 03:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
point brought up by my colleague
 
03:46:38.929 --> 03:46:38.939 align:start position:0%
representative scitec um you know you
 
03:46:41.570 --> 03:46:41.580 align:start position:0%
can get on the sex offender list for you
 
03:46:41.580 --> 03:46:42.370 align:start position:0%
can get on the sex offender list for you
know

03:46:42.370 --> 03:46:42.380 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:46:44.990 --> 03:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
peeing outside or being on the beach
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
topless or I you know there are even
 
03:46:49.910 --> 03:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
cases of minors getting charged as
 
03:46:52.870 --> 03:46:52.880 align:start position:0%
sexual offenders just for like having
 
03:46:57.530 --> 03:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
been undressed around other minors
 
03:47:00.110 --> 03:47:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and there are severe severe severe
 
03:47:02.809 --> 03:47:02.819 align:start position:0%
issues with our sexual offender
 
03:47:02.819 --> 03:47:03.710 align:start position:0%
issues with our sexual offender
um

03:47:03.710 --> 03:47:03.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:05.630 --> 03:47:05.640 align:start position:0%
um registry list and how it affects
 
03:47:08.150 --> 03:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
people for the rest of their lives
 
03:47:10.729 --> 03:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
um and yeah I'm just concerned about how
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
this could make it harder for someone
 
03:47:16.070 --> 03:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
who may not even have a victim to get a
 
03:47:16.080 --> 03:47:18.830 align:start position:0%
who may not even have a victim to get a
job

03:47:18.830 --> 03:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:18.840 --> 03:47:19.870 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:22.309 --> 03:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
I'll let the sponsor or I'll let
 
03:47:24.110 --> 03:47:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative Manion address that I
 
03:47:26.450 --> 03:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
would just again what I said to
 
03:47:28.550 --> 03:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
representative scitec I think that's a
 
03:47:31.969 --> 03:47:31.979 align:start position:0%
valid point and it's one that if a
 
03:47:33.889 --> 03:47:33.899 align:start position:0%
representative has concerns about then
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
we would look at or they should look at
 
03:47:38.150 --> 03:47:38.160 align:start position:0%
the statute that classifies sex
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
offenders and for how long and such this
 
03:47:42.590 --> 03:47:42.600 align:start position:0%
bill just discusses with someone who's
 
03:47:44.330 --> 03:47:44.340 align:start position:0%
already been put in that bucket whether
 
03:47:47.450 --> 03:47:47.460 align:start position:0%
they belong there or not so um I don't
 
03:47:49.429 --> 03:47:49.439 align:start position:0%
think that this bill addresses the
 
03:47:52.070 --> 03:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
underlying whole concept of who is a sex
 
03:47:53.330 --> 03:47:53.340 align:start position:0%
offender and how long they have to be
 
03:47:55.610 --> 03:47:55.620 align:start position:0%
registered I think that needs to be done
 
03:47:57.229 --> 03:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
in another bill representative Bolden
 
03:47:59.030 --> 03:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
seems to want to say something
 
03:48:00.530 --> 03:48:00.540 align:start position:0%
I can address that we talked about that
 
03:48:02.630 --> 03:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee and specifically we
 
03:48:04.250 --> 03:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
talked about it with the representative
 
03:48:05.990 --> 03:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
from the sex offender registry
 
03:48:08.090 --> 03:48:08.100 align:start position:0%
Department here
 
03:48:11.630 --> 03:48:11.640 align:start position:0%
um and uh it says the existing law if
 
03:48:14.330 --> 03:48:14.340 align:start position:0%
you look at the the amendment
 
03:48:16.870 --> 03:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
um you know existing law is in regular
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
font for the new people
 
03:48:22.130 --> 03:48:22.140 align:start position:0%
um and it says a person's guilty of a
 
03:48:23.769 --> 03:48:23.779 align:start position:0%
class a felony if
 
03:48:26.389 --> 03:48:26.399 align:start position:0%
uh this is line eight on the first page
 
03:48:28.370 --> 03:48:28.380 align:start position:0%
having been convicted in this or any
 
03:48:30.830 --> 03:48:30.840 align:start position:0%
other jurisdiction of a felonious
 
03:48:33.290 --> 03:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
offense involving child sex abuse images
 
03:48:36.050 --> 03:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
or of a felonious physical assault on a
 
03:48:39.889 --> 03:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
minor or of any sexual assault
 
03:48:42.110 --> 03:48:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and so the there there's a lot of
 
03:48:43.849 --> 03:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
weird and potentially dumb reasons to
 
03:48:45.650 --> 03:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
end up on the sex offender registry sure
 
03:48:48.170 --> 03:48:48.180 align:start position:0%
this does not apply to everyone it
 
03:48:51.710 --> 03:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
applies to people who have violated
 
03:48:55.130 --> 03:48:55.140 align:start position:0%
um in certain ways and um obviously it's
 
03:48:57.590 --> 03:48:57.600 align:start position:0%
broad because we can't go updating this
 
03:49:00.590 --> 03:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
every time we add a leader crime you
 
03:49:00.600 --> 03:49:01.910 align:start position:0%
every time we add a leader crime you
know

03:49:01.910 --> 03:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
know
 
03:49:04.070 --> 03:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Bolden for once
 
03:49:05.630 --> 03:49:05.640 align:start position:0%
again pointing out the obvious that's
 
03:49:08.510 --> 03:49:08.520 align:start position:0%
written in the bill in front of us
 
03:49:09.830 --> 03:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
I don't know what we would do without
 
03:49:11.990 --> 03:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
you today representative Manion thank
 
03:49:13.490 --> 03:49:13.500 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and just quickly that that
 
03:49:15.410 --> 03:49:15.420 align:start position:0%
language is current language see this
 
03:49:16.849 --> 03:49:16.859 align:start position:0%
bill only addresses
 
03:49:19.550 --> 03:49:19.560 align:start position:0%
the who and what not not the actual
 
03:49:22.130 --> 03:49:22.140 align:start position:0%
underlying offenses so that language is
 
03:49:23.750 --> 03:49:23.760 align:start position:0%
in the bill I mean in the laws it is
 
03:49:25.250 --> 03:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
currently and that wasn't addressed at
 
03:49:25.260 --> 03:49:27.050 align:start position:0%
currently and that wasn't addressed at
all

03:49:27.050 --> 03:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
okay at this point I'm going to ask the
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role on the amendment
 
03:49:32.269 --> 03:49:32.279 align:start position:0%

second second about representative
Rhodes

03:50:32.210 --> 03:50:32.220 align:start position:0%
Rhodes
 
03:50:33.830 --> 03:50:33.840 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to briefly
 
03:50:36.830 --> 03:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
just uh speak to this one more time
 
03:50:39.110 --> 03:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
yes as I said I think this amended bill
 
03:50:40.910 --> 03:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
now addresses all of the concerns and
 
03:50:43.610 --> 03:50:43.620 align:start position:0%
issues we had with the overly broad
 
03:50:47.090 --> 03:50:47.100 align:start position:0%
initial bill it was worked on by both
 
03:50:49.550 --> 03:50:49.560 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and uh representative who
 
03:50:51.229 --> 03:50:51.239 align:start position:0%
oppose the language they worked on it
 
03:50:54.410 --> 03:50:54.420 align:start position:0%
together I think it's a great uh
 
03:50:56.870 --> 03:50:56.880 align:start position:0%
a great Bill put together and uh even
 
03:50:59.090 --> 03:50:59.100 align:start position:0%
though it has the longest sentence
 
03:51:02.690 --> 03:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:05.389 --> 03:51:05.399 align:start position:0%
yeah as I said I I want to pass it just
 
03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
because of that now
 
03:51:09.349 --> 03:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
um any any other further discussion I
 
03:51:10.910 --> 03:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
think representative Bolden one more
 
03:51:14.269 --> 03:51:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:17.389 --> 03:51:17.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
overturned that conviction is
 
03:51:23.450 --> 03:51:23.460 align:start position:0%
Representative Bob Lin and he agreed so
 
03:51:24.769 --> 03:51:24.779 align:start position:0%
when I when I'm saying the person wrote
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
the opinion I'm saying the person who
 
03:51:27.830 --> 03:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
overturned that conviction saying that
 
03:51:29.510 --> 03:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
our laws were insufficient is a current
 
03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
rep and he's the one who came in here
 
03:51:33.050 --> 03:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
and we're seeing you had concerns about
 
03:51:34.250 --> 03:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
the way the bill was written and he
 
03:51:36.410 --> 03:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
signed off on the amended version thank
 
03:51:38.510 --> 03:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
you and for uh Representatives who don't
 
03:51:40.250 --> 03:51:40.260 align:start position:0%
know Representative Bob Lin was the
 
03:51:41.630 --> 03:51:41.640 align:start position:0%
former Chief Justice of the New
 
03:51:43.370 --> 03:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court
 
03:51:45.590 --> 03:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
yeah until we forced him out with a law
 
03:51:47.269 --> 03:51:47.279 align:start position:0%
that said he was too old
 
03:51:49.130 --> 03:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
um but he is an excellent source of
 
03:51:50.929 --> 03:51:50.939 align:start position:0%
information so
 
03:51:52.250 --> 03:51:52.260 align:start position:0%
um having said that did you have
 
03:51:55.070 --> 03:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
represent scitec I'm not convinced that
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
this uh that the
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
sex offender ever expires but it's not
 
03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
enough to stop this bill or to ask for a
 
03:52:06.050 --> 03:52:06.060 align:start position:0%
carve out for this so I I just want to
 
03:52:08.450 --> 03:52:08.460 align:start position:0%
jump up and down and that's enough
 
03:52:11.450 --> 03:52:11.460 align:start position:0%
thank you we appreciate that
 
03:52:13.790 --> 03:52:13.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh I agree that the sex offender
 
03:52:15.710 --> 03:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
registry uh probably does need a lot of
 
03:52:17.570 --> 03:52:17.580 align:start position:0%
work and if anybody wants to sponsor
 
03:52:19.610 --> 03:52:19.620 align:start position:0%
legislation uh for next year let's talk
 
03:52:20.570 --> 03:52:20.580 align:start position:0%
about it
 
03:52:21.650 --> 03:52:21.660 align:start position:0%
um did you have something you want to
 
03:52:23.389 --> 03:52:23.399 align:start position:0%
say yeah with that I'll ask clerk to
 
03:52:26.510 --> 03:52:26.520 align:start position:0%
call the roll ought to pass as amended
 
03:52:31.729 --> 03:52:31.739 align:start position:0%

committee even the ones of us who are
 
03:53:39.769 --> 03:53:39.779 align:start position:0%
against each other we gave dignified
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
professional debates and even if you
 
03:53:45.050 --> 03:53:45.060 align:start position:0%
lost the committee one because it was us
 
03:53:48.170 --> 03:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
against each other so it was upsides
 
03:53:49.429 --> 03:53:49.439 align:start position:0%
everywhere to that and it's been great
 
03:53:51.170 --> 03:53:51.180 align:start position:0%

this
 
03:53:56.330 --> 03:53:56.340 align:start position:0%
one two weeks I don't know until I get
