training great thank you thank you
 
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
everyone so I want to have a discussion
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
I had put in a bill this year well I've
 
00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:37.639 align:start position:0%
actually put it in in a couple different
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
formats and um I don't know if you I'm
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
sure you've all seen the bill it was to
 
00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:47.479 align:start position:0%
require a one sheriff or Deputy in each
 
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 align:start position:0%
County and one state trooper in each
 
00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 align:start position:0%
County be trained in animal cruelty uh
 
00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:56.360 align:start position:0%
specifically the laws
 
00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759 align:start position:0%
um we're finding
 
00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
that there's a
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
disconnect um and local law enforcement
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
does not have is isn't always up on
 
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
everything and I thought a minimum of 20
 
00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
people in law
 
00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement would be important to have
 
00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 align:start position:0%
trained so that they could be a resource
 
00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 align:start position:0%
not that you would be
 
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
responsible but for contact or or maybe
 
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
possible assistance um I don't know if
 
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:31.960 align:start position:0%
that's the right approach um but I know
 
00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 align:start position:0%
that something definitely needs to be
 
00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
done in this state um I mean we had
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
someone here from law enforcement
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
testify and earlier in the original
 
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
testimony and when asked about did he
 
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 align:start position:0%
realize that you had a have a
 
00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 align:start position:0%
veterinarian accompanying law
 
00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 align:start position:0%
enforcement they didn't know that uh for
 
00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
removal of
 
00:05:59.029 --> 00:05:59.039 align:start position:0%
animals um so there's some things and I
 
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:00.880 align:start position:0%
would like to you know Jerry if you
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
don't mind I would love to have you
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
speak on this because I know you have
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
done offered courses at New Hampshire
 
00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:08.479 align:start position:0%
standards and training and you are have
 
00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
been immersed in this issue for a long
 
00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
time so um why don't you give us your
 
00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
thoughts on what you think should be
 
00:06:17.909 --> 00:06:17.919 align:start position:0%
done and how we should handle this at
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.749 --> 00:06:24.759 align:start position:0%
level first I'd like to
 
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:28.360 align:start position:0%
um give you a little bit of a background
 
00:06:31.150 --> 00:06:31.160 align:start position:0%
um in
 
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 align:start position:0%
when I taught at UNH I taught in the
 
00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
animal science program and uh I had
 
00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440 align:start position:0%
started on the governor's commission and
 
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:41.120 align:start position:0%
it became very clear that police
 
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.000 align:start position:0%
officers were not trained in animal
 
00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.110 align:start position:0%
officers were not trained in animal
cruelty

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:44.120 align:start position:0%
cruelty
 
00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 align:start position:0%
investigations so I actually started an
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
online class for both UNH students and
 
00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:55.759 align:start position:0%
anyone else that wanted to take it
 
00:06:59.749 --> 00:06:59.759 align:start position:0%
um well back about 2005
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
and uh I actually had some police
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
officers take it uh Animal Control
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
Officers members of the public UNH
 
00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:09.639 align:start position:0%
students didn't want it because it was
 
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
online at the time it was not the big
 
00:07:15.230 --> 00:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
deal online so they didn't want it so um
 
00:07:17.790 --> 00:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
I was actually contacted by New
 
00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:20.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
 
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
to put together a course a two-hour
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
course for the recruits and I
 
00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
started the preliminary discussions were
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
in 2007
 
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:33.080 align:start position:0%
um the First Co course I taught I
 
00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:38.080 align:start position:0%
believe was in 2008 at the 146th Academy
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
um long time ago very basic an overview
 
00:07:44.589 --> 00:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
of what the issues are in New Hampshire
 
00:07:45.830 --> 00:07:45.840 align:start position:0%
what they might
 
00:07:49.589 --> 00:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
see the laws um
 
00:07:54.189 --> 00:07:54.199 align:start position:0%
and some investigative techniques uh and
 
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of resources who's out there to
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
help um
 
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
the it in
 
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:06.440 align:start position:0%
2023 because of all the changes at at
 
00:08:08.909 --> 00:08:08.919 align:start position:0%
the police academy had became an online
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
class and I put that one together I'm
 
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:13.560 align:start position:0%
assuming they're still using the same
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
one I don't know if they've upgraded
 
00:08:23.070 --> 00:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
it in um 2009 I started I was invited to
 
00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:26.120 align:start position:0%
teach a two-day in service class which
 
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
was much more
 
00:08:31.589 --> 00:08:31.599 align:start position:0%
comprehensive um um and I actually
 
00:08:33.589 --> 00:08:33.599 align:start position:0%
called it animal cruelty the law
 
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
investigation and case
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
resolution and um I taught that from
 
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
2009 to
 
00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
2014 then we had some issues with the
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
tend having enough attendance then I
 
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
taught it in 2017 and 2019 and I haven't
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
taught it since then um I learned a lot
 
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:58.720 align:start position:0%
from that class from officers in the
 
00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.190 align:start position:0%
from that class from officers in the
field

00:09:00.190 --> 00:09:00.200 align:start position:0%
field
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
the we had regular police officers
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
taking it they allowed Animal Control
 
00:09:08.069 --> 00:09:08.079 align:start position:0%
Officers to come into the class they
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
even allowed a couple
 
00:09:13.310 --> 00:09:13.320 align:start position:0%
Humane investigators to take the class
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
so um I learned a lot from that I
 
00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
revised it just about every year as I
 
00:09:22.269 --> 00:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
did the twoyear the two-hour one I
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
changed that as things changed and um
 
00:09:30.069 --> 00:09:30.079 align:start position:0%
because um
 
00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:32.360 align:start position:0%
involved with all of this at one point
 
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:34.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's commission had a website
 
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240 align:start position:0%
with a lot of resources on animal
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigations I moved that over
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire police standards and
 
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
training because it had a lot of police
 
00:09:45.389 --> 00:09:45.399 align:start position:0%
procedure and stuff in it I didn't think
 
00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.670 align:start position:0%
procedure and stuff in it I didn't think
it

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
was appropriate for the general public
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
so um that is up there now under your
 
00:09:52.519 --> 00:09:53.670 align:start position:0%
so um that is up there now under your
benchmark

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:53.680 align:start position:0%
benchmark
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
program available to any certified
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
police officer but it's like um you can
 
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:02.920 align:start position:0%
take a horse to water but you can't make
 
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
them drink so and we have a very
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
comprehensive cruelty manual um
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
so the 2-hour course is
 
00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
mandated is
 
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
it so at the um at the Academy level yes
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh so we we do uh hold the recruits to
 
00:10:29.710 --> 00:10:29.720 align:start position:0%
complete that kind of an introductory
 
00:10:32.949 --> 00:10:32.959 align:start position:0%
uh program and then the doctor's program
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
that is on Benchmark uh which is our uh
 
00:10:39.509 --> 00:10:39.519 align:start position:0%
Statewide learning management system uh
 
00:10:42.150 --> 00:10:42.160 align:start position:0%
is in the format of a asynchronous
 
00:10:45.389 --> 00:10:45.399 align:start position:0%
online learning program so literally a
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
police officer on duty or off duty at 2
 
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
o'clock in the morning can sign in and
 
00:10:53.790 --> 00:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
complete the class uh if they choose to
 
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
it's not mandated for inservice officers
 
00:10:59.310 --> 00:10:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh inservice officers would be those off
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
officers that have already graduated
 
00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
from the police academy and they're out
 
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
there you know working um so do you have
 
00:11:09.269 --> 00:11:09.279 align:start position:0%
any way to track who actually takes
 
00:11:13.430 --> 00:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
those courses absolutely we do
 
00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
and how many people have actually taken
 
00:11:18.389 --> 00:11:18.399 align:start position:0%
it in the last say five years I I wish I
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
had that answer for you I do not but I
 
00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
can certainly get that answer for this
 
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee uh we can just run uh some
 
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
analytics and Benchmark and it'll it'll
 
00:11:29.949 --> 00:11:29.959 align:start position:0%
tell us okay I would like to
 
00:11:35.629 --> 00:11:35.639 align:start position:0%
it's not actually a course it's it's a
 
00:11:39.389 --> 00:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
composite broken down by categories of
 
00:11:41.949 --> 00:11:41.959 align:start position:0%
resources some of them
 
00:11:44.629 --> 00:11:44.639 align:start position:0%
are courses that I put together my
 
00:11:47.030 --> 00:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
PowerPoints that are narrated some of
 
00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:49.160 align:start position:0%
them are just documents that they can
 
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
refer to so again um they it's it's not
 
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:56.480 align:start position:0%
something they sign into and take a
 
00:11:59.310 --> 00:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
course but if they have if they need
 
00:12:01.389 --> 00:12:01.399 align:start position:0%
information on anything related to
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty it's there and I also put
 
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:05.880 align:start position:0%
up the changes in the law because it's
 
00:12:08.710 --> 00:12:08.720 align:start position:0%
the only way that they're going to be uh
 
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:11.160 align:start position:0%
aware of some of those things so then
 
00:12:14.790 --> 00:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm speaking to the recruit block
 
00:12:17.590 --> 00:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
exactly is the asynchronous block that
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
they can access anytime uh whether they
 
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
were at the Academy or not the recruits
 
00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:26.560 align:start position:0%
they can uh the general police force uh
 
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:30.120 align:start position:0%
as well no so that you know that might
 
00:12:31.949 --> 00:12:31.959 align:start position:0%
be something that we can do is just put
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
that block of
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
instruction on uh the learning
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
management system for everyone to look
 
00:12:41.829 --> 00:12:41.839 align:start position:0%
at yeah uh because technically anybody
 
00:12:45.389 --> 00:12:45.399 align:start position:0%
that went through before 2008 has not
 
00:12:48.189 --> 00:12:48.199 align:start position:0%
had that so so let
 
00:12:48.199 --> 00:12:51.110 align:start position:0%
had that so so let
me

00:12:51.110 --> 00:12:51.120 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
now you just so that everyone
 
00:12:56.310 --> 00:12:56.320 align:start position:0%
understands there's a 2-hour course
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's required if you as going through
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
the current current Academy that's just
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
basically an
 
00:13:05.150 --> 00:13:05.160 align:start position:0%
introduction then you at one point were
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
teaching a two-day course it was that 16
 
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:12.720 align:start position:0%
hours is it two full days or just so
 
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:18.240 align:start position:0%
16 okay a 12-h hour course okay and now
 
00:13:21.350 --> 00:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
there is information online what how
 
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:23.680 align:start position:0%
does the information online differ from
 
00:13:26.910 --> 00:13:26.920 align:start position:0%
a two-day course and what would what is
 
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:28.360 align:start position:0%
what can someone get out of a two-day
 
00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:33.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
online it was originally designed as
 
00:13:40.470 --> 00:13:40.480 align:start position:0%
resource material for the two-day
 
00:13:45.949 --> 00:13:45.959 align:start position:0%
class so um the class was designed to go
 
00:13:49.870 --> 00:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
with the manual so if somebody wants to
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
do a self-study it's all there but it's
 
00:13:56.749 --> 00:13:56.759 align:start position:0%
not guided anymore if you know if I were
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
to teach the course it would be guided I
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
actually would give them some homework
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
to go look at some of that stuff um and
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
make sure they knew how to use it and
 
00:14:10.629 --> 00:14:10.639 align:start position:0%
those kinds of things so
 
00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:13.959 align:start position:0%
um it's not actually a course and it
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
would require somebody with the
 
00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
wherewithal to do some preliminary
 
00:14:22.269 --> 00:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
background work to know what they could
 
00:14:26.350 --> 00:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
resources okay um Kurt Rob do you have
 
00:14:32.150 --> 00:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
anything that you'd like to add about
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
this um your thoughts on on this
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
training uh you know do you think it's
 
00:14:39.990 --> 00:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
essential for law enforcement to be
 
00:14:43.030 --> 00:14:43.040 align:start position:0%
involved in this Kurt
 
00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.749 align:start position:0%
involved in this Kurt
please

00:14:45.749 --> 00:14:45.759 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:14:48.910 --> 00:14:48.920 align:start position:0%
so speaking for my organization and I
 
00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
think for some members of the commission
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
what what what our
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
goal immediate goal would be is to make
 
00:15:01.749 --> 00:15:01.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
name I apologize for that
 
00:15:21.670 --> 00:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
Interruption I appreciate that that's
 
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.269 align:start position:0%
Interruption I appreciate that that's
okay

00:15:24.269 --> 00:15:24.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:15:28.110 --> 00:15:28.120 align:start position:0%
um so our Our concern is that if there's
 
00:15:30.150 --> 00:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
an animal
 
00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
in in distress because someone is acting
 
00:15:38.829 --> 00:15:38.839 align:start position:0%
cruy criminal criminally Cru cruy to
 
00:15:38.839 --> 00:15:39.749 align:start position:0%
cruy criminal criminally Cru cruy to
this

00:15:39.749 --> 00:15:39.759 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:15:44.389 --> 00:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
animal that there is a police officer
 
00:15:46.910 --> 00:15:46.920 align:start position:0%
trained in animal cruelty that can
 
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:51.680 align:start position:0%
respond to that case no matter where and
 
00:15:55.710 --> 00:15:55.720 align:start position:0%
when in the state it takes place
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
so it seems that what we need is some
 
00:16:01.550 --> 00:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
sort of a
 
00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:04.399 align:start position:0%
protocol through law enforcement
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
channels that if I'm in pitfield New
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or any other
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
location and I call someone and saying
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's a cruelty
 
00:16:20.030 --> 00:16:20.040 align:start position:0%
case that is responded to in some way as
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
an animal cruelty case that will be
 
00:16:23.399 --> 00:16:24.509 align:start position:0%
an animal cruelty case that will be
dealt

00:16:24.509 --> 00:16:24.519 align:start position:0%
dealt
 
00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:27.309 align:start position:0%
dealt
with

00:16:27.309 --> 00:16:27.319 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839 align:start position:0%
accordingly and how that pertains to
 
00:16:33.910 --> 00:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
training is that there should be someone
 
00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:37.560 align:start position:0%
available either on a state County local
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
level maybe it's that's in reverse
 
00:16:45.269 --> 00:16:45.279 align:start position:0%
order but to respond to that call who
 
00:16:48.829 --> 00:16:48.839 align:start position:0%
understands what Jerry was just talking
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
about that would be our goal as soon as
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
possible I appreciate that uh having had
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
some constituent call me and complained
 
00:17:02.069 --> 00:17:02.079 align:start position:0%
that they didn't feel like uh issues
 
00:17:04.909 --> 00:17:04.919 align:start position:0%
were being addressed and when I got
 
00:17:07.590 --> 00:17:07.600 align:start position:0%
called the state fat um they said well
 
00:17:09.870 --> 00:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have jurisdiction it's local
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
law enforcement I called the sheriff he
 
00:17:15.789 --> 00:17:15.799 align:start position:0%
goes I can't get involved um and the
 
00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
police department
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
responded they they thought they
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
remedied it and
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
then they said okay it's being taken
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
care of and
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
um they
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
um to gave it back to the uh owner the
 
00:17:37.549 --> 00:17:37.559 align:start position:0%
person called me again I called the
 
00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:39.080 align:start position:0%
state vets office and they said well
 
00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:40.320 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get someone out there for
 
00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.830 align:start position:0%
they couldn't get someone out there for
10

00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
10
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
days um you know when we're talking 100
 
00:17:48.270 --> 00:17:48.280 align:start position:0%
degree weather and a horse can't get to
 
00:17:54.590 --> 00:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.870 --> 00:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
so that is why this bill is here because
 
00:18:00.310 --> 00:18:00.320 align:start position:0%
law enforcement doesn't didn't
 
00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:02.480 align:start position:0%
understand the protocol on what needed
 
00:18:05.870 --> 00:18:05.880 align:start position:0%
to be done and you law enforcement is
 
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:08.440 align:start position:0%
the only one that can go in and serve a
 
00:18:11.270 --> 00:18:11.280 align:start position:0%
warrant or really do investigation
 
00:18:12.870 --> 00:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
unless you have an animal control
 
00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
officer I guess on in your town a lot of
 
00:18:18.510 --> 00:18:18.520 align:start position:0%
towns in New Hampshire do not have
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
acos so I know in my town personally
 
00:18:24.029 --> 00:18:24.039 align:start position:0%
they deal with the uh local
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
sbca um you know if they confiscate
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
animals or whatever
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
but I really think that there is a lack
 
00:18:35.350 --> 00:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
of knowledge of the laws and I don't
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
think it's something that PE when you go
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
into law enforcement that you think this
 
00:18:41.230 --> 00:18:41.240 align:start position:0%
is going to be like oh gee this is you
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
know that's not what they're going to
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
law enforcement for but animal cruelty
 
00:18:49.230 --> 00:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
in is is a big deal in this state when
 
00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:51.280 align:start position:0%
it happens we need people that
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
understand the laws and can react
 
00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:54.950 align:start position:0%
understand the laws and can react
quickly

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
00:19:00.990 --> 00:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
um so uh uh ma'am uh please turn on your
 
00:19:03.549 --> 00:19:03.559 align:start position:0%
mic and introduce yourself and where
 
00:19:03.559 --> 00:19:05.430 align:start position:0%
mic and introduce yourself and where
you're

00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
from hi I'm Mary Rose De I'm from
 
00:19:11.110 --> 00:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
conquered New
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I'm just don't have any
 
00:19:16.750 --> 00:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
feelings one way or the other about the
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
bill I just um the only thing I would
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
worry about with this law is there are
 
00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:25.480 align:start position:0%
people who bring their pets to these
 
00:19:25.480 --> 00:19:26.710 align:start position:0%
people who bring their pets to these
grocery

00:19:26.710 --> 00:19:26.720 align:start position:0%
grocery
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
stores and they are uh emotional support
 
00:19:33.390 --> 00:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
animals and under the law now they can
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
be fined
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
$1,200 because uh they spread parasites
 
00:19:42.669 --> 00:19:42.679 align:start position:0%
to the food and stuff that like uh blood
 
00:19:44.950 --> 00:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
worms and stuff like that to people's
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
food so that would I would not consider
 
00:19:50.830 --> 00:19:50.840 align:start position:0%
if you ask the person to take their dog
 
00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
and leave the store a grocery store or
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
something like that I wouldn't consider
 
00:19:59.230 --> 00:19:59.240 align:start position:0%
that to be animal cruelty no so
 
00:20:02.110 --> 00:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
um thank you for that ma'am this this
 
00:20:05.549 --> 00:20:05.559 align:start position:0%
bill is about getting training this has
 
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with enforcement this is
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
about training law enforcement
 
00:20:14.190 --> 00:20:14.200 align:start position:0%
specifically so that they do understand
 
00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
specifically so that they do understand
the

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
law okay um Rob would you like to chime
 
00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.710 align:start position:0%
law okay um Rob would you like to chime
in

00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:20:24.590 --> 00:20:24.600 align:start position:0%
please this this was a an idea as the
 
00:20:26.470 --> 00:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
the chair knows they came up and was
 
00:20:29.390 --> 00:20:29.400 align:start position:0%
discussed at our County our uh State
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
annual meeting where our we have
 
00:20:32.310 --> 00:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
delegates from each of the we're we're
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
an organization of 10 County F beer
 
00:20:36.029 --> 00:20:36.039 align:start position:0%
organizations and our that we have
 
00:20:38.110 --> 00:20:38.120 align:start position:0%
delegates to to our annual meeting and
 
00:20:40.789 --> 00:20:40.799 align:start position:0%
and this is a a discussion that we had
 
00:20:43.870 --> 00:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
that the thought being that similar to
 
00:20:46.149 --> 00:20:46.159 align:start position:0%
again as the chair said that there would
 
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:49.280 align:start position:0%
be uh law enforcement officials widely
 
00:20:51.029 --> 00:20:51.039 align:start position:0%
dispersed throughout the state that had
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
a a more in-depth knowledge of the
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty statutes that basically
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
other law enforcement could rely on to
 
00:21:01.070 --> 00:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
when they came up and and the issue is
 
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
certainly the the uh uh prop dealing
 
00:21:06.870 --> 00:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
with issues arising from the the care of
 
00:21:09.990 --> 00:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
animals but also in particular the due
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
process for the owners themselves that
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
all that's kind of where where we were
 
00:21:17.110 --> 00:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
uh uh coming with and and we
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that as as uh law
 
00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:21.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement officials I mean you've got
 
00:21:23.710 --> 00:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
an awful lot on your plate and that
 
00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
probably not every every office or even
 
00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:28.760 align:start position:0%
every agency especially in a smaller
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
Department of the state would have the
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
time to take a you know a course and to
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
be up to date so I thinking was being if
 
00:21:36.789 --> 00:21:36.799 align:start position:0%
the you Kurt mentioned Pittsfield that
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
if they didn't have an officer on on in
 
00:21:42.190 --> 00:21:42.200 align:start position:0%
the department or on duty that that felt
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that they had somebody
 
00:21:46.350 --> 00:21:46.360 align:start position:0%
they could call on who was a like-minded
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
you know person that you know kind of
 
00:21:49.269 --> 00:21:49.279 align:start position:0%
walk them through okay this is what you
 
00:21:50.950 --> 00:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
need to be doing be looking out for and
 
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:52.360 align:start position:0%
be a resource to them that that's kind
 
00:21:54.110 --> 00:21:54.120 align:start position:0%
of what we were we were coming from and
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
I did have one question for the director
 
00:21:58.909 --> 00:21:58.919 align:start position:0%
um I'm a I'm a graduate of police St is
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
way back 106 class so I'm I'm curious
 
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
you said is it R all online because the
 
00:22:05.830 --> 00:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
way I understood
 
00:22:11.430 --> 00:22:11.440 align:start position:0%
the no it's uh um it is a 16 week uh
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar uh just like you went
 
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:16.120 align:start position:0%
through still okay yeah uh the
 
00:22:18.350 --> 00:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
unfortunate truth is that the length of
 
00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:19.110 align:start position:0%
unfortunate truth is that the length of
the

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
academy uh has not changed over the last
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh bunch of years and yet uh there has
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
been a significant amount of pressure
 
00:22:31.470 --> 00:22:31.480 align:start position:0%
pressure to add extra things to the
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
academy and so uh we found that uh there
 
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
are certain times and I'm sure you can
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
remember like when you were waiting to
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
get on the Range uh you you would sit
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
outside the range and you'd be filling
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
your magazines or or speed loaders maybe
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
back in those days I don't know whe you
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
had a wheel gun or semi-automatic but uh
 
00:22:54.830 --> 00:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
same thing with scenario training
 
00:22:58.190 --> 00:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
driving uh we you can't put 30 people in
 
00:22:59.710 --> 00:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
police police cars and have them drive
 
00:23:01.029 --> 00:23:01.039 align:start position:0%
all at the same time so they have to
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
wait their turn and so we saw that
 
00:23:07.269 --> 00:23:07.279 align:start position:0%
time uh you know let's let's leverage
 
00:23:10.390 --> 00:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
this time and and make it of some value
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
some training value uh and at the same
 
00:23:15.269 --> 00:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
time we could take some of the
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
programming and put that into a online
 
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:21.760 align:start position:0%
program so that the recruits could uh
 
00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
asynchronously jump in there while they
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
were waiting to go to a another block of
 
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
instruction and get through that train
 
00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
as well so so so they're doing that
 
00:23:32.430 --> 00:23:32.440 align:start position:0%
while they're at the Academy that is
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
correct yeah but candidly they can they
 
00:23:37.190 --> 00:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
can be home at two o'clock in the
 
00:23:40.830 --> 00:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
morning and and use our system to get to
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
that training and complete it on their
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
own so thank you yes would you like to
 
00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
chime in you in the field and this would
 
00:23:51.789 --> 00:23:51.799 align:start position:0%
affect your troops so
 
00:23:54.669 --> 00:23:54.679 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate you having me here I was
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
not here for um the original testimony
 
00:23:58.990 --> 00:23:59.000 align:start position:0%
of the biller for the last work group I
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
believe but I do appreciate being able
 
00:24:02.789 --> 00:24:02.799 align:start position:0%
to sit here today uh I know that Captain
 
00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:05.159 align:start position:0%
amuchi already spoke on some of this so
 
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.520 align:start position:0%
if there's something that I've missed or
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
something that I can add obviously
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
um our view on this is that obviously
 
00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
we're looking to be compatible with our
 
00:24:19.029 --> 00:24:19.039 align:start position:0%
local partners and with you to to
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
accomplish whatever it is U that is laid
 
00:24:24.350 --> 00:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
out in front of us from from what I hear
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
and if it's been spoken to uh prior to
 
00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
then I apologize but from what I hear
 
00:24:31.149 --> 00:24:31.159 align:start position:0%
here it's looking for that realistic
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
realtime response that when there's an
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
investigation or an allegation made that
 
00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:37.720 align:start position:0%
somebody from law enforcement can
 
00:24:40.269 --> 00:24:40.279 align:start position:0%
respond and while I think that notion is
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
is commendable and and something that we
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
all hope to achieve I don't know that if
 
00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:48.080 align:start position:0%
ass signing one Trooper Per County or
 
00:24:50.750 --> 00:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
one sheriff is realistically going to
 
00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:53.480 align:start position:0%
accomplish that the reason that I say
 
00:24:56.110 --> 00:24:56.120 align:start position:0%
that is for for a number of reasons um
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
one it's a 247 job when these calls come
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
in and one Trooper in one County
 
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
covering you know a vast area isn't
 
00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:05.559 align:start position:0%
going to be that one Trooper that's
 
00:25:07.710 --> 00:25:07.720 align:start position:0%
going to be trained that can respond to
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
to a call for service in that real time
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
manner it may be that a a trooper on
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
patrol response gathers the information
 
00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:16.960 align:start position:0%
and then goes back and has to refer to
 
00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
somebody on what are my next steps or
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
what exactly do I have going on and that
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
may be a phone
 
00:25:25.710 --> 00:25:25.720 align:start position:0%
call that company by the fact that often
 
00:25:27.870 --> 00:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
times especially given our vacancy rates
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
right now which are approaching 20%
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
vacancy rates to then task one Trooper
 
00:25:35.430 --> 00:25:35.440 align:start position:0%
Per County with the responsibility of
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
all animal cool investigations that come
 
00:25:40.269 --> 00:25:40.279 align:start position:0%
in um while I wouldn't say is unfair I
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
just I don't know if I can sit here and
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
say that that's a realistic possibility
 
00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
that somebody could immediately respond
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
in a state police capacity in that very
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
moment from what I understand and from
 
00:25:53.549 --> 00:25:53.559 align:start position:0%
what this group is I do lend more
 
00:25:55.470 --> 00:25:55.480 align:start position:0%
towards the fact that and from things
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
that I've heard from Members today is it
 
00:26:00.990 --> 00:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
it's not just that the person responding
 
00:26:03.549 --> 00:26:03.559 align:start position:0%
has intimate knowledge of what needs to
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
take place for the investigation but
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
more so that they know where to go to
 
00:26:09.789 --> 00:26:09.799 align:start position:0%
get the information of how to proceed so
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that um falls directly
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
on a local agency or a sheriff's
 
00:26:16.590 --> 00:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
department or the state police certainly
 
00:26:18.029 --> 00:26:18.039 align:start position:0%
we're we're willing to help and we're
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
we're always willing to help with
 
00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
whatever the investigations are as we
 
00:26:22.389 --> 00:26:22.399 align:start position:0%
would with any other type of criminal
 
00:26:25.029 --> 00:26:25.039 align:start position:0%
investigation throughout the state but
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
uh the notion that one Trooper in one
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
County would be able to handle be that
 
00:26:31.230 --> 00:26:31.240 align:start position:0%
one that one voice for anybody that had
 
00:26:33.110 --> 00:26:33.120 align:start position:0%
an issue I don't know if that would hit
 
00:26:35.269 --> 00:26:35.279 align:start position:0%
the mark of of really what the root of
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
what it is that we're trying to achieve
 
00:26:39.590 --> 00:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
which I think is as great as a as a
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
12year can9 Handler myself and someone
 
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
who's been involved in animal felty
 
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:47.640 align:start position:0%
investigations somebody who's um charged
 
00:26:50.190 --> 00:26:50.200 align:start position:0%
persons for assaults on my own canine
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
Partners uh I I'm I'm rooted in this and
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
I I believe in in in what we're trying
 
00:26:58.830 --> 00:26:58.840 align:start position:0%
to achieve here I I I would agree that I
 
00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:00.799 align:start position:0%
think there just may be other ways to go
 
00:27:02.990 --> 00:27:03.000 align:start position:0%
about it but but certainly we're willing
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be involved in whatever capacity is
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
decided okay I I just oh oh
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman please thank you
 
00:27:12.710 --> 00:27:12.720 align:start position:0%
and um I I want to apologize to the
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
committee for um being late um I did
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
want to ask you a question sir over the
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
years that you've had reported animal
 
00:27:24.269 --> 00:27:24.279 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases or suspected animal
 
00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
cruelty cases how has your department
 
00:27:28.470 --> 00:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
handled it thus far again I'm coming in
 
00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
late to the conversation so I I
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
apologize if it's if this question is
 
00:27:35.149 --> 00:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
redundant how how typically are you
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
handling it right now so I can speak to
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
ones that I'm aware of I can't speak to
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
all cases throughout throughout the
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
state that State Police has been a
 
00:27:44.310 --> 00:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
primary on or maybe a secondary or just
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
a phone call um I had the opportunity
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
throughout my career this being my 20th
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
year uh in in this state and in another
 
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:53.880 align:start position:0%
to be involved in in situations like
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
this I'll speak specifically to New
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire most recently uh I was
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
assigned as the commander of Troop C
 
00:28:02.669 --> 00:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
which is our westernmost troop based out
 
00:28:05.310 --> 00:28:05.320 align:start position:0%
of Keane which is a rural troop 38
 
00:28:07.269 --> 00:28:07.279 align:start position:0%
communities State Police is primary for
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
almost 20 Towns now in that area
 
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
providing law all law enforcement
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
Services the experiences that I had were
 
00:28:17.590 --> 00:28:17.600 align:start position:0%
were very positive in handling those
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
cases again specific to M what I can say
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
is in the initial response from State
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
Police the foundation of a criminal
 
00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.830 align:start position:0%
Police the foundation of a criminal
investigation

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
investigation
 
00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:31.960 align:start position:0%
for the most part is is very very
 
00:28:34.909 --> 00:28:34.919 align:start position:0%
similar in nature gathering information
 
00:28:38.070 --> 00:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
looking up uh rsas to see what the
 
00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
Baseline is of what's what's a violation
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
uh what crosses it into a misdemeanor or
 
00:28:44.789 --> 00:28:44.799 align:start position:0%
a felony so on and so
 
00:28:47.549 --> 00:28:47.559 align:start position:0%
forth where it was nice in my experience
 
00:28:49.549 --> 00:28:49.559 align:start position:0%
moving beyond is you spoke to the Animal
 
00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
Control Officers in the in certain towns
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a lot of Animal Control
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
Officers in any of the towns around us
 
00:28:57.509 --> 00:28:57.519 align:start position:0%
but the ones that we did have were more
 
00:29:00.029 --> 00:29:00.039 align:start position:0%
than willing to lend a hand come up to
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
whatever scene we were at and at least
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
give an advice and assistance so that we
 
00:29:05.350 --> 00:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
knew what the next step would be and I
 
00:29:07.110 --> 00:29:07.120 align:start position:0%
found that to be the same with any of
 
00:29:10.590 --> 00:29:10.600 align:start position:0%
the animal groups in ASPCA and our state
 
00:29:13.029 --> 00:29:13.039 align:start position:0%
vet uh to include local veterinarians
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
who are willing to give their expertise
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
and help out so my experience was um
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
knowing that we had an issue and we may
 
00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.120 align:start position:0%
not necessarily um be deeply trained in
 
00:29:25.310 --> 00:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
one specific area but that could also be
 
00:29:26.909 --> 00:29:26.919 align:start position:0%
be true for a lot of different areas
 
00:29:29.509 --> 00:29:29.519 align:start position:0%
where we receed tring at the Academy and
 
00:29:31.389 --> 00:29:31.399 align:start position:0%
then it's up to the agency or it's up to
 
00:29:33.190 --> 00:29:33.200 align:start position:0%
the The Troop Commander or it's up to
 
00:29:34.990 --> 00:29:35.000 align:start position:0%
the ship supervisor or the officer
 
00:29:36.750 --> 00:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
themselves the trooping themselves to
 
00:29:38.909 --> 00:29:38.919 align:start position:0%
further their own education knowing what
 
00:29:40.470 --> 00:29:40.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to come across in their
 
00:29:43.269 --> 00:29:43.279 align:start position:0%
specific control areas so my experience
 
00:29:45.470 --> 00:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
was very positive and that I had those
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
resources albe it it may not be into
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
I'll say pitsfield only because it was
 
00:29:51.070 --> 00:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
brought up earlier I don't want to
 
00:29:54.669 --> 00:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
include or exclude any specific town but
 
00:29:57.310 --> 00:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
uh Pittsfield in a silo I don't know
 
00:29:58.470 --> 00:29:58.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's true or not I don't know if
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
they have an animal control officer but
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
if I was the trooper that was in that
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
town I would I'd feel very comfortable
 
00:30:05.549 --> 00:30:05.559 align:start position:0%
knowing that I could pick up the phone
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
call a multitude of resources and get
 
00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:08.950 align:start position:0%
call a multitude of resources and get
that

00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:30:10.870 --> 00:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
information the power was in knowing
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
that I had access to the information not
 
00:30:15.669 --> 00:30:15.679 align:start position:0%
that I necessarily had specific training
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
in everything that I was going to come I
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
should say specialized training in every
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
specific thing that I was going to come
 
00:30:24.590 --> 00:30:24.600 align:start position:0%
up upon I have no doubt that there are
 
00:30:27.070 --> 00:30:27.080 align:start position:0%
instances where there are local officers
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
sheriffs State Troopers that respond to
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
a call uh regarding animal cruelty and
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's probably the first time that
 
00:30:34.870 --> 00:30:34.880 align:start position:0%
they've had to respond to something like
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
that and they're unaware of what their
 
00:30:40.470 --> 00:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
next step is the next step can't be well
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
I tried my best and I turned and I I
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
left that that's unacceptable on all
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
fronts but a lot of it is knowing where
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
do I go to find that information what
 
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
resources do I have available thank you
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
following up on what uh representative
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
Freeman just said how do we get that
 
00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%
information out there and into the hands
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement that isn't aware I
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
mean for instance how did you know where
 
00:31:08.269 --> 00:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
to go and how did you find the
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
information that you
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
needed again for me specifically there
 
00:31:14.269 --> 00:31:14.279 align:start position:0%
was a little bit of an awareness having
 
00:31:16.110 --> 00:31:16.120 align:start position:0%
to have researched some of the state
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
laws because of my involvement in the K9
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
unit um however though I had incidences
 
00:31:23.789 --> 00:31:23.799 align:start position:0%
before I was involved in the can9 unit
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
and a lot of that was just self-growth
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
self-education of things that I knew I
 
00:31:30.470 --> 00:31:30.480 align:start position:0%
was going to come across within my
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
specific Patrol area you may have a a a
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
primarily Highway troop if you will an
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
interstate troop it doesn't necessarily
 
00:31:42.149 --> 00:31:42.159 align:start position:0%
go into the county often or agencies
 
00:31:44.549 --> 00:31:44.559 align:start position:0%
within that County are large full-time
 
00:31:47.350 --> 00:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
PDS that are uh seemingly adequate to
 
00:31:50.269 --> 00:31:50.279 align:start position:0%
handle things like that assigning a
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
trooper one per County signing a trooper
 
00:31:54.990 --> 00:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
in that area may not be as useful as if
 
00:31:56.909 --> 00:31:56.919 align:start position:0%
there were more people trained in the
 
00:31:58.590 --> 00:31:58.600 align:start position:0%
western part of the state or the
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
northern part of the state which again
 
00:32:03.269 --> 00:32:03.279 align:start position:0%
would bring me back to the idea
 
00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:05.710 align:start position:0%
would bring me back to the idea
of

00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:05.720 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:08.200 align:start position:0%
um the Troopers knowing that there's
 
00:32:09.750 --> 00:32:09.760 align:start position:0%
resources available to them that they
 
00:32:11.909 --> 00:32:11.919 align:start position:0%
can reach out to so no matter where they
 
00:32:14.070 --> 00:32:14.080 align:start position:0%
are or what time of the day it is it's
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
just a phone call away to
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
them and in furtherance of answering
 
00:32:21.590 --> 00:32:21.600 align:start position:0%
that your question um the block of
 
00:32:24.669 --> 00:32:24.679 align:start position:0%
instruction that the recruits receive is
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
really uh it is more
 
00:32:31.070 --> 00:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
awareness and more these are the
 
00:32:34.149 --> 00:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
resources that you would turn to uh for
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
help if you come into one of these cases
 
00:32:41.310 --> 00:32:41.320 align:start position:0%
so uh it is to be candid it is not a
 
00:32:43.470 --> 00:32:43.480 align:start position:0%
robust it's not like the two-day class
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
that the doctor uh uh used to teach uh
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
on how to conduct the investigations it
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
is much more an awareness class and a uh
 
00:32:58.430 --> 00:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
identification of experts uh and and uh
 
00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:00.519 align:start position:0%
you know resources that the officer can
 
00:33:04.750 --> 00:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
turn to uh to further an
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
investigation the original in intent of
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
the bill was not to have the sheriff's
 
00:33:13.789 --> 00:33:13.799 align:start position:0%
department and State Police be the
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
primary person to go in and be
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
responsible for these but to be a
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
resource or
 
00:33:24.789 --> 00:33:24.799 align:start position:0%
assist um local law enforcement um but
 
00:33:28.029 --> 00:33:28.039 align:start position:0%
like you said in in 20 towns you are the
 
00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
primary source of law
 
00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.789 align:start position:0%
primary source of law
enforcement

00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
so you know I
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
think I'm not sure which way to go and I
 
00:33:41.110 --> 00:33:41.120 align:start position:0%
I'd like to hear everyone's thoughts I
 
00:33:42.950 --> 00:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
don't know if two hours is enough
 
00:33:47.509 --> 00:33:47.519 align:start position:0%
training I don't know um you
 
00:33:50.190 --> 00:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
know how we handle this but this is a
 
00:33:52.190 --> 00:33:52.200 align:start position:0%
real issue in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
that we need to address um because you
 
00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.350 align:start position:0%
that we need to address um because you
know

00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:34:01.549 --> 00:34:01.559 align:start position:0%
there are cases that get pushed down the
 
00:34:05.310 --> 00:34:05.320 align:start position:0%
road you know uh yeah it's a problem but
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
we're not going to deal with it so then
 
00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
it goes this way or there's some issues
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
where it's handled very wrongly and it
 
00:34:17.310 --> 00:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
has devastating effects um the opposite
 
00:34:20.349 --> 00:34:20.359 align:start position:0%
way because they're too aggressive um
 
00:34:22.710 --> 00:34:22.720 align:start position:0%
and not understanding the laws I mean we
 
00:34:26.230 --> 00:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
have some changes coming up to uh that
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing that we had changed uh
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
put into legislation through this
 
00:34:33.030 --> 00:34:33.040 align:start position:0%
committee as a cost of care because uh
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
towns were afraid to look at animal
 
00:34:38.310 --> 00:34:38.320 align:start position:0%
cruelty because of the cost that it
 
00:34:40.629 --> 00:34:40.639 align:start position:0%
would do therefore we created a cost of
 
00:34:43.349 --> 00:34:43.359 align:start position:0%
care fund at the state level to assist
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
so that people would not be afraid of
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
the cost to the taxpayer for for dealing
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
with these
 
00:34:54.869 --> 00:34:54.879 align:start position:0%
situations so I am open to suggestions
 
00:34:57.150 --> 00:34:57.160 align:start position:0%
on how we handle this but this is
 
00:35:00.030 --> 00:35:00.040 align:start position:0%
something that really needs to be dealt
 
00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
with and we keep kicking this can down
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
the road and I don't
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
know the right
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
answer but I'm hoping that with everyone
 
00:35:13.430 --> 00:35:13.440 align:start position:0%
here that's been involved that's in
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
training that has taught classes that's
 
00:35:19.710 --> 00:35:19.720 align:start position:0%
in been involved in animal cruelty cases
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh where it's worked well where it
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't what is I would love to come up
 
00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
with a solution that's best for everyone
 
00:35:31.910 --> 00:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
that also protects you know does what
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do real time enforcement
 
00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
with the understanding you know of the
 
00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
law uh when an animal can be taken when
 
00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
it cannot be taken things like that
 
00:35:47.470 --> 00:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
because sometimes the animal doesn't
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
need to be taken but it's an education
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
piece sometimes it's not and you need to
 
00:35:53.920 --> 00:35:54.990 align:start position:0%
piece sometimes it's not and you need to
enforce

00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
enforce
 
00:35:59.270 --> 00:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
things so um
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
um hi this is Mary Rose De again um well
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
even though um you mentioned the western
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
part of the state um there's a growing
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
problem with the homeless population in
 
00:36:16.910 --> 00:36:16.920 align:start position:0%
the urban areas lots of them have
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
dogs and um they go out in this weather
 
00:36:24.910 --> 00:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's extremely cold the dog's paws are
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
not covered with any kind of shoes the
 
00:36:31.589 --> 00:36:31.599 align:start position:0%
dogs are um emaciated because they
 
00:36:35.790 --> 00:36:35.800 align:start position:0%
have oh okay the dogs are suffering from
 
00:36:39.430 --> 00:36:39.440 align:start position:0%
the cold in the winter and uh they can't
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
go to a shelter with the dogs so um
 
00:36:46.589 --> 00:36:46.599 align:start position:0%
there's this Urban problem of what do
 
00:36:52.630 --> 00:36:52.640 align:start position:0%
you do take the dogs U do you have to do
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
homeless um interventions with the
 
00:37:00.750 --> 00:37:00.760 align:start position:0%
person that owns the dog um but I have
 
00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:03.640 align:start position:0%
given like $20 to somebody that had a
 
00:37:06.430 --> 00:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
dog a few years ago that it was like
 
00:37:10.190 --> 00:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
around 0 degre out and the dog's Paws
 
00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
were right on the ice and I said here's
 
00:37:16.430 --> 00:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
$20 I don't know if you can get your dog
 
00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
some dog
 
00:37:21.710 --> 00:37:21.720 align:start position:0%
slippers um but I was really concerned
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
the dog was very
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
skinny and so I don't know if they were
 
00:37:29.349 --> 00:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
it wasn't deliberate cruelty but it was
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
the animal was really
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
suffering kind of a so M mixed social
 
00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:41.200 align:start position:0%
issue and uh uh economic issue but also
 
00:37:43.750 --> 00:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
the dog was in immediate
 
00:37:47.230 --> 00:37:47.240 align:start position:0%
danger of dying but then on the other
 
00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
hand you have this issue with people in
 
00:37:52.550 --> 00:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
their pets and the grocery stores that
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
the pets do have parasites and the
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
governor has already P passed some
 
00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:02.240 align:start position:0%
legislation that these people they're
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
not service animals if they're emotional
 
00:38:09.790 --> 00:38:09.800 align:start position:0%
support pets and as such can't go with
 
00:38:13.150 --> 00:38:13.160 align:start position:0%
the owner to the grocery store um it's
 
00:38:16.829 --> 00:38:16.839 align:start position:0%
only for service animals that I I guess
 
00:38:18.910 --> 00:38:18.920 align:start position:0%
they have to be licensed by the health
 
00:38:22.109 --> 00:38:22.119 align:start position:0%
and human services department so I would
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
excluding that piece I would say that
 
00:38:27.589 --> 00:38:27.599 align:start position:0%
the rest I don't know I have don't I
 
00:38:29.710 --> 00:38:29.720 align:start position:0%
know how the law is defined as far as
 
00:38:33.550 --> 00:38:33.560 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty but like endangering the
 
00:38:37.990 --> 00:38:38.000 align:start position:0%
life of an animal um attacking an
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
animal would be how I would Define it it
 
00:38:46.589 --> 00:38:46.599 align:start position:0%
is defined in statute under RSA 644 okay
 
00:38:49.230 --> 00:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
all right represent Freeman and then
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
Jerry thank you representative comot so
 
00:38:57.069 --> 00:38:57.079 align:start position:0%
um what I think I'm hearing a lot of
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
what are saying is that we need to work
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
up a protocol on how to handle these
 
00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
complaints so I'm just going to make a a
 
00:39:06.270 --> 00:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
real quick suggestion um I know Leos
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
have their protocols anytime a call
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
comes in there's a certain there's a
 
00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
certain rubric you follow um in order to
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
address whatever the complaint is
 
00:39:17.230 --> 00:39:17.240 align:start position:0%
investigate Etc so I think maybe if we
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
work up a protocol um that would include
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
the Humane Society because they're so
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
heavily involved with this um that they
 
00:39:27.510 --> 00:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
could assist the Leos in these types of
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
investigation so it doesn't fall all in
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
the Leos to make a determination about
 
00:39:34.270 --> 00:39:34.280 align:start position:0%
whether there is a valid complaint about
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty and um you know one of
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
the things I am hearing Leo say is they
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
don't know every law that's on the books
 
00:39:43.750 --> 00:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
they can't know every law that's on the
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
books they they're intelligent enough to
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
research those laws but it's technically
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
it's not their job to know all the laws
 
00:39:53.950 --> 00:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
so I think if if if we sat down and
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
looked at working up um a protocol where
 
00:39:59.950 --> 00:39:59.960 align:start position:0%
it would satisfy the need of having that
 
00:40:02.710 --> 00:40:02.720 align:start position:0%
extra layer of protection for those
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
complaints that are filed but also
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
doesn't pull Leos in seven different
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
directions um I'm that that's just my
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
suggestion because again most things
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
that especially with law enforcement
 
00:40:18.190 --> 00:40:18.200 align:start position:0%
there is a protocol and protocols work
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
because you follow that protocol so um
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
and there's no there's there's no
 
00:40:25.069 --> 00:40:25.079 align:start position:0%
there's really very small margin for
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
error when it comes to protocols um
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
I would just interject on one thing and
 
00:40:33.069 --> 00:40:33.079 align:start position:0%
that is I would think
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
that I don't think there is that
 
00:40:41.230 --> 00:40:41.240 align:start position:0%
many well I shouldn't say this how many
 
00:40:43.990 --> 00:40:44.000 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty laws do we have per year
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
in the state how many how how many
 
00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:48.520 align:start position:0%
complaints do we have you know that of
 
00:40:51.430 --> 00:40:51.440 align:start position:0%
true animal cruelty true animal cruelty
 
00:40:55.069 --> 00:40:55.079 align:start position:0%
not um you know there's some people that
 
00:40:57.309 --> 00:40:57.319 align:start position:0%
think that a cow because their bones are
 
00:40:59.069 --> 00:40:59.079 align:start position:0%
sticking out is animal cruelty but
 
00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
that's just the way the cow looks and
 
00:41:03.950 --> 00:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
versus livestock so I'm
 
00:41:07.109 --> 00:41:07.119 align:start position:0%
just you understand what I'm saying
 
00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:14.109 --> 00:41:14.119 align:start position:0%
something if there is a
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
complaint comes into any Leo it needs to
 
00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:19.950 align:start position:0%
complaint comes into any Leo it needs to
be

00:41:19.950 --> 00:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:22.920 align:start position:0%
investigated and if the officer is
 
00:41:25.230 --> 00:41:25.240 align:start position:0%
trained they're going to know whether
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
there's Merit or not to start with and
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's what this is all
 
00:41:33.510 --> 00:41:33.520 align:start position:0%
about this is the manual that is on our
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
website the governor's commission
 
00:41:37.670 --> 00:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
website it's on the resources website
 
00:41:40.510 --> 00:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
it's on the Attorney General's website
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
it's everything is here okay and that's
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
that's the information that they were
 
00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
saying that they could go on and and
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
search there's a lot more online okay
 
00:41:53.309 --> 00:41:53.319 align:start position:0%
all the nitty-gritty that's not in here
 
00:41:57.390 --> 00:41:57.400 align:start position:0%
with how to investigate how to do um
 
00:41:59.430 --> 00:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
body condition scoring on lots of
 
00:42:01.790 --> 00:42:01.800 align:start position:0%
different species and the difference
 
00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240 align:start position:0%
between livestock and companion animals
 
00:42:07.470 --> 00:42:07.480 align:start position:0%
and all of that it's all available now
 
00:42:11.230 --> 00:42:11.240 align:start position:0%
you asked about possible
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
solutions and I don't know how um how to
 
00:42:19.710 --> 00:42:19.720 align:start position:0%
go about this but if there was a way
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
that we could get a voluntary group both
 
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:26.200 align:start position:0%
in maybe the southern part of the state
 
00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
or the northern part of the state that
 
00:42:32.270 --> 00:42:32.280 align:start position:0%
would get additional training and now
 
00:42:34.150 --> 00:42:34.160 align:start position:0%
one of the other issues I had with the
 
00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill as you've written it
 
00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:43.240 align:start position:0%
6448 is um just the animal cruelty law
 
00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
your law did not take into account
 
00:42:48.910 --> 00:42:48.920 align:start position:0%
animal fighting and beastiality which
 
00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:52.240 align:start position:0%
are separate laws and those require a
 
00:42:54.309 --> 00:42:54.319 align:start position:0%
lot of specific training if you get
 
00:42:56.750 --> 00:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
involved with any one of those cases
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
which would involve the forensics lab
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
and things like that as well so um
 
00:43:04.910 --> 00:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more to this but if you
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
could get a voluntary group that would
 
00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:10.920 align:start position:0%
and there are I know there are ACO uh
 
00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
acos and police officers out there that
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
have a passion about cruelty to animals
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
they would sign up and they could be a
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
resource either just for advice or this
 
00:43:26.270 --> 00:43:26.280 align:start position:0%
is what you need to do or this is the
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
information you need or if they had time
 
00:43:31.589 --> 00:43:31.599 align:start position:0%
and some of them will do it on their own
 
00:43:33.630 --> 00:43:33.640 align:start position:0%
time to go out and help with an
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
investigation and this would
 
00:43:40.390 --> 00:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
include um acos many of whom do not have
 
00:43:43.750 --> 00:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
any law enforcement
 
00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
any law enforcement
Authority

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:43:48.309 --> 00:43:48.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarians we need to get some
 
00:43:50.990 --> 00:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
livestock large animal veterinarians on
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
board this would include police officers
 
00:43:57.510 --> 00:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps state police officers I I think
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
almost any can9 Handler would love to
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
would be amenable to being on this
 
00:44:09.510 --> 00:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
resource um and
 
00:44:11.710 --> 00:44:11.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutors right and I know that there
 
00:44:13.109 --> 00:44:13.119 align:start position:0%
are some people in the sheriff's
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
department that you know also are you
 
00:44:19.549 --> 00:44:19.559 align:start position:0%
know have are passionate about the
 
00:44:22.390 --> 00:44:22.400 align:start position:0%
animals um you know we've had uh we
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
always have someone on the governor's
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
commission so um
 
00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:32.240 align:start position:0%
so setting up a task force in the
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
southern I know you're talking voluntary
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
but if we do voluntary how long will
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
that take to do H if we did a task force
 
00:44:44.109 --> 00:44:44.119 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to look at you over there
 
00:44:46.950 --> 00:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
to answer that what would that look like
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
and what kind of resources would that
 
00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
pull so thank you for that question and
 
00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:55.710 align:start position:0%
pull so thank you for that question and
and

00:44:55.710 --> 00:44:55.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:44:58.670 --> 00:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
um there there are the doctor's correct
 
00:45:00.190 --> 00:45:00.200 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a number of police
 
00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
officers across the state that uh have
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh a passion for this and candidly
 
00:45:09.750 --> 00:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh I'll I'll share I'm an AGR brother
 
00:45:13.230 --> 00:45:13.240 align:start position:0%
from UNH and uh a couple of my uh
 
00:45:15.470 --> 00:45:15.480 align:start position:0%
fraternity brothers are police officers
 
00:45:18.230 --> 00:45:18.240 align:start position:0%
and they they graduated with degrees in
 
00:45:22.270 --> 00:45:22.280 align:start position:0%
in uh uh you know from T school and and
 
00:45:26.390 --> 00:45:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know four four-year uh so uh the
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
there there are pops out in in the state
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that have deep subject
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
matter expertise in these areas probably
 
00:45:37.990 --> 00:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
not many right uh the there's a there's
 
00:45:40.510 --> 00:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
a couple of different ways that this
 
00:45:43.109 --> 00:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
could be you know
 
00:45:46.069 --> 00:45:46.079 align:start position:0%
addressed uh I don't know that a
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
volunteer program is going to work in
 
00:45:51.069 --> 00:45:51.079 align:start position:0%
this day and age uh it it it just it
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
will not work uh notwithstanding
 
00:45:56.270 --> 00:45:56.280 align:start position:0%
people's passion uh these are uh
 
00:45:58.630 --> 00:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
legitimate criminal investigations that
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
would need to have the full backing
 
00:46:01.950 --> 00:46:01.960 align:start position:0%
authority of the agencies that are going
 
00:46:05.630 --> 00:46:05.640 align:start position:0%
to be digging into them uh couple of
 
00:46:07.790 --> 00:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
different models can be looked at uh the
 
00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:12.520 align:start position:0%
first model would be that local agencies
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
identify uh people within their agency
 
00:46:17.470 --> 00:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
that are both willing and have the
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
training to be called upon as a resource
 
00:46:24.109 --> 00:46:24.119 align:start position:0%
uh a great example is uh presently the
 
00:46:26.190 --> 00:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire keeps a list of
 
00:46:29.670 --> 00:46:29.680 align:start position:0%
available drug recognition experts
 
00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
Dres uh and those Dres are made
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
available uh by the hiring authority to
 
00:46:40.150 --> 00:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
respond to help with a a uh impaired
 
00:46:43.510 --> 00:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
driver crash or or an impaired driver
 
00:46:45.870 --> 00:46:45.880 align:start position:0%
arrest but somebody has to write the
 
00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
check for that who's going to pay the
 
00:46:51.309 --> 00:46:51.319 align:start position:0%
officer to uh to go and assist that Dr
 
00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:55.000 align:start position:0%
has to be compensated for their their um
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
investigative efforts that would be one
 
00:47:00.549 --> 00:47:00.559 align:start position:0%
way to do it is is to create a list
 
00:47:03.950 --> 00:47:03.960 align:start position:0%
of uh not drug recognition experts but
 
00:47:07.549 --> 00:47:07.559 align:start position:0%
create a list of animal cruelty
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
investigators uh that could be made
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
available throughout the
 
00:47:14.670 --> 00:47:14.680 align:start position:0%
state I think the big piece there uh
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
would be twofold one training and and we
 
00:47:18.990 --> 00:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
can do the training I I just need some
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
money to hire uh people like Dr Z or or
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
you know the folks that that are
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
represented here to build out that
 
00:47:28.470 --> 00:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
curriculum and it's going to be a big
 
00:47:30.309 --> 00:47:30.319 align:start position:0%
curriculum right you got to talk about
 
00:47:31.910 --> 00:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
every animal specifically there's going
 
00:47:35.430 --> 00:47:35.440 align:start position:0%
to be some you know specifics to that
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
and then this the second piece to the
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
list of animal cruelty investigators
 
00:47:43.470 --> 00:47:43.480 align:start position:0%
would be who is going to compensate them
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
is does the home agency compensate them
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
does the requesting agency compensate
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
them does the state compensate them that
 
00:47:55.109 --> 00:47:55.119 align:start position:0%
would be one way to do it an alternative
 
00:47:57.790 --> 00:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
way to do it would be to create
 
00:47:59.150 --> 00:47:59.160 align:start position:0%
a task
 
00:48:02.309 --> 00:48:02.319 align:start position:0%
force uh there are task forces that are
 
00:48:04.710 --> 00:48:04.720 align:start position:0%
created throughout the state and what
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
happens is a a police agency will take
 
00:48:09.549 --> 00:48:09.559 align:start position:0%
somebody who's very good at this
 
00:48:12.030 --> 00:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
particular thing and will use drug
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
investigations as an example and uh they
 
00:48:17.390 --> 00:48:17.400 align:start position:0%
go to specialized training and and a lot
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
of it quite frankly and then that home
 
00:48:22.910 --> 00:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
agency gives up the officer for a period
 
00:48:24.870 --> 00:48:24.880 align:start position:0%
of time they might serve six months they
 
00:48:27.069 --> 00:48:27.079 align:start position:0%
might serve a year
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
and their full-time job is just doing
 
00:48:30.990 --> 00:48:31.000 align:start position:0%
the task
 
00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
force again and uh the captain spoke of
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
this uh we see we are seeing shortages
 
00:48:39.870 --> 00:48:39.880 align:start position:0%
of police officers across the state of
 
00:48:42.430 --> 00:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and and generally one of
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
the first places that a police chief or
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh the colonel of State Police will look
 
00:48:50.190 --> 00:48:50.200 align:start position:0%
to to get their their roles kind of back
 
00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
up would be to pull those task off uh
 
00:48:55.950 --> 00:48:55.960 align:start position:0%
Task Force officers back to the road and
 
00:48:57.510 --> 00:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
back to the home AG
 
00:49:02.670 --> 00:49:02.680 align:start position:0%
gency a third option might be to create
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh a couple of few positions within the
 
00:49:08.030 --> 00:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Agriculture at the state
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
level and and I'll I'll give you an
 
00:49:14.309 --> 00:49:14.319 align:start position:0%
example and uh look at the Fire
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
Marshal's Office the Fire Marshal's
 
00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:19.160 align:start position:0%
Office is responsible for investigating
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
cases of
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
arson uh there is nobody else in the
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that that
 
00:49:25.710 --> 00:49:25.720 align:start position:0%
oversees those
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
investigations uh arson is a very very
 
00:49:32.190 --> 00:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
specific crime that takes not only law
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement experience but firefighting
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
experience and you have to put those two
 
00:49:38.910 --> 00:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
things together and there's very few
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
people that have a foot on either side
 
00:49:43.470 --> 00:49:43.480 align:start position:0%
of that fence right and that's why the
 
00:49:46.549 --> 00:49:46.559 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshal's Office exists to do those
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
investigations uh you could maybe mirror
 
00:49:53.670 --> 00:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
that under the Department of Agriculture
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
and have you know two or four
 
00:50:01.750 --> 00:50:01.760 align:start position:0%
officers assigned specifically to
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
address the the very crimes that uh the
 
00:50:05.910 --> 00:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
doctor just outline not only animal
 
00:50:08.910 --> 00:50:08.920 align:start position:0%
cruelty but any crime that involves
 
00:50:11.390 --> 00:50:11.400 align:start position:0%
either a domestic animal or a farm
 
00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:13.720 align:start position:0%
animal so I think those are three ways
 
00:50:16.430 --> 00:50:16.440 align:start position:0%
that you could kind of skin this cat uh
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
but again you know in this day and age
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
it it really is about the money and and
 
00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
how does that get funded and how does
 
00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:27.119 align:start position:0%
that get sustained over a period of time
 
00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay um so just a one I don't think the
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
task force is really the way to go
 
00:50:35.470 --> 00:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
because I don't think we need someone
 
00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated for six you know we're pulling
 
00:50:39.549 --> 00:50:39.559 align:start position:0%
someone from law enforcement for six
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
months I just don't see that as as as
 
00:50:47.109 --> 00:50:47.119 align:start position:0%
viable um however I did like your first
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
option um because it's really we want to
 
00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:54.680 align:start position:0%
have people that are trained and we want
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
there to be resources it's all about the
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
the resources right and understanding
 
00:51:01.750 --> 00:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
the law and you know whether it's local
 
00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:04.960 align:start position:0%
law enforcement that responds but can
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
draw on that expertise or it it's
 
00:51:10.230 --> 00:51:10.240 align:start position:0%
someone from the actual uh that's in
 
00:51:12.190 --> 00:51:12.200 align:start position:0%
that group that
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
responds um you know and as you said you
 
00:51:17.510 --> 00:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
know you might have some acos but acos
 
00:51:21.109 --> 00:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
don't not all acos you know can go in
 
00:51:23.630 --> 00:51:23.640 align:start position:0%
and deal with this uh and it could be
 
00:51:25.309 --> 00:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
veterinarians but veterinarians don't
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
have that component
 
00:51:31.430 --> 00:51:31.440 align:start position:0%
so I really liked your first option and
 
00:51:34.789 --> 00:51:34.799 align:start position:0%
um I don't know ballpark wise how much
 
00:51:36.910 --> 00:51:36.920 align:start position:0%
training would cost and what you know
 
00:51:39.030 --> 00:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
and how many people would volunteer to
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
sign up for that so I guess that's one
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
component of it but the other thing I'm
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
thinking about
 
00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
and I know I'm probably going to uh I'm
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
going to just say it but the cost of
 
00:51:54.309 --> 00:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
care fund is all about
 
00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
compensating the municipality for cost
 
00:52:01.349 --> 00:52:01.359 align:start position:0%
of care um and part of that I would
 
00:52:04.309 --> 00:52:04.319 align:start position:0%
think we could include
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
is the actual legal part of that because
 
00:52:11.069 --> 00:52:11.079 align:start position:0%
that all becomes I mean I it it seems to
 
00:52:14.109 --> 00:52:14.119 align:start position:0%
be tied together um and you know maybe
 
00:52:15.870 --> 00:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
we need to change some of the language
 
00:52:19.030 --> 00:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
about that um but that that's just a
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
thought um so I'd like to hear from Rob
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
about what your thoughts are because
 
00:52:28.910 --> 00:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'd agree of the options that the
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
director mentioned I mean that's kind of
 
00:52:36.309 --> 00:52:36.319 align:start position:0%
the what
 
00:52:38.670 --> 00:52:38.680 align:start position:0%
our least our thought was behind the
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
bill um the the cost of care fund is I
 
00:52:43.990 --> 00:52:44.000 align:start position:0%
think you know that would I don't know
 
00:52:47.109 --> 00:52:47.119 align:start position:0%
is we have um I think the department
 
00:52:49.950 --> 00:52:49.960 align:start position:0%
would have some concerns with that I
 
00:52:55.030 --> 00:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:57.630 --> 00:52:57.640 align:start position:0%
but hey we're all just talking here
 
00:52:58.910 --> 00:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
right we're just trying to figure things
 
00:53:01.549 --> 00:53:01.559 align:start position:0%
out right I mean obviously if when we're
 
00:53:03.470 --> 00:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
dealing with dollars right dollars and
 
00:53:08.470 --> 00:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
cents um and uh in in this ye budget
 
00:53:13.309 --> 00:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
year um you know Kurt
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
please just one point I want to make
 
00:53:18.270 --> 00:53:18.280 align:start position:0%
clear is that there's a lot of talk
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
about resources which is terrific but
 
00:53:24.470 --> 00:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
the response for the
 
00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
animal is a is a concern that needs to
 
00:53:30.430 --> 00:53:30.440 align:start position:0%
be addressed that when we have an animal
 
00:53:33.870 --> 00:53:33.880 align:start position:0%
in distress because of Cruelty of from a
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
human um that that animal deserves a
 
00:53:39.710 --> 00:53:39.720 align:start position:0%
response that
 
00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
will if if deserving put put that animal
 
00:53:46.630 --> 00:53:46.640 align:start position:0%
right into a a care situation which is
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
covered by the cost of care fund
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any comments about the
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
cost of care fund otherwise at this
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
point but I mean I do think the respon
 
00:53:59.349 --> 00:53:59.359 align:start position:0%
resp is is as
 
00:54:02.109 --> 00:54:02.119 align:start position:0%
important certainly for the animal at
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
the time which is my concern here that
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
that animal get police response
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
immediately no matter where in the state
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
so that's kind of
 
00:54:15.870 --> 00:54:15.880 align:start position:0%
the the
 
00:54:18.150 --> 00:54:18.160 align:start position:0%
inequality if you're in a if you're in a
 
00:54:20.789 --> 00:54:20.799 align:start position:0%
community that is served well by an
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
animal control officer or more than one
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
like I think of nasua or other cities in
 
00:54:29.589 --> 00:54:29.599 align:start position:0%
this state um then you're you're you're
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
as an animal you're you're at a great
 
00:54:35.390 --> 00:54:35.400 align:start position:0%
Advantage but if you live in a town or
 
00:54:37.910 --> 00:54:37.920 align:start position:0%
location that does not have those
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
resources in terms of
 
00:54:44.470 --> 00:54:44.480 align:start position:0%
response then you could be left to even
 
00:54:47.230 --> 00:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
die in that situation so that's that's
 
00:54:49.549 --> 00:54:49.559 align:start position:0%
where I just want to see some kind of
 
00:54:52.829 --> 00:54:52.839 align:start position:0%
protocol as the representative was
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
saying in place as soon as possible so
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
those animal are taken care of right and
 
00:54:59.950 --> 00:54:59.960 align:start position:0%
and that's why I think the first option
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
would work best because you're going to
 
00:55:04.470 --> 00:55:04.480 align:start position:0%
get people that are invested in care
 
00:55:08.230 --> 00:55:08.240 align:start position:0%
about animals um you're not asking you
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
know just every law enforcement officer
 
00:55:12.470 --> 00:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
do you're asking people that have a
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
passion um for animals um and I and I
 
00:55:18.829 --> 00:55:18.839 align:start position:0%
think when you have a passion for
 
00:55:21.109 --> 00:55:21.119 align:start position:0%
something it makes a huge
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
difference um Jerry did you have
 
00:55:27.349 --> 00:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
something yes um I wanted to to um speak
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
about possible training type things
 
00:55:33.190 --> 00:55:33.200 align:start position:0%
there are some excellent training
 
00:55:35.109 --> 00:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
National training programs that are
 
00:55:38.910 --> 00:55:38.920 align:start position:0%
accredited that um in addition it's not
 
00:55:41.230 --> 00:55:41.240 align:start position:0%
necessary that you would need to hire
 
00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone to teach at the Academy either
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
myself or anyone else but there are um
 
00:55:49.789 --> 00:55:49.799 align:start position:0%
great programs the University of uh
 
00:55:53.789 --> 00:55:53.799 align:start position:0%
Missouri has the um animal cont animal
 
00:55:56.549 --> 00:55:56.559 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigator course some of it's
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
a hybrid some of it's in person some of
 
00:55:58.799 --> 00:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
a hybrid some of it's in person some of
it's

00:55:59.510 --> 00:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:56:03.510 --> 00:56:03.520 align:start position:0%
online um code three
 
00:56:07.510 --> 00:56:07.520 align:start position:0%
Associates um there is a lot of online
 
00:56:09.549 --> 00:56:09.559 align:start position:0%
resource material and the Justice
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
clearing house there's a lot of
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
resources out there that could be tapped
 
00:56:17.390 --> 00:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
into and um there are depending on how
 
00:56:21.349 --> 00:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
many people you needed to train um it's
 
00:56:23.309 --> 00:56:23.319 align:start position:0%
possible that we could get some grants
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
for that through h s us uh ASPCA animal
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
legal defense fund so that we can
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
perhaps um Spread spread the costs out
 
00:56:41.270 --> 00:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
somewhat so uh it might be that
 
00:56:44.150 --> 00:56:44.160 align:start position:0%
you create a list of appropriate
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
programs for training and and and and we
 
00:56:50.910 --> 00:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
find some resources for that yeah and I
 
00:56:53.630 --> 00:56:53.640 align:start position:0%
agree uh it would just uh that would
 
00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
necessitate that this bill be amended
 
00:56:58.870 --> 00:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
yeah because as it's written now it it
 
00:57:03.309 --> 00:57:03.319 align:start position:0%
clearly puts uh the uh impetus on police
 
00:57:04.990 --> 00:57:05.000 align:start position:0%
standers and training to develop and
 
00:57:07.270 --> 00:57:07.280 align:start position:0%
deliver the program and and I agree with
 
00:57:09.309 --> 00:57:09.319 align:start position:0%
you that you know it why reinvent the
 
00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:13.640 align:start position:0%
wheel if there are uh very esoteric very
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
specific uh types of trainings that
 
00:57:19.349 --> 00:57:19.359 align:start position:0%
people uh could use and it's already
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
been built uh in those particular cases
 
00:57:25.870 --> 00:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh why wouldn't we leverage that right
 
00:57:30.190 --> 00:57:30.200 align:start position:0%
and and use those but but here again um
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
there is a cost involved to engage uh
 
00:57:37.309 --> 00:57:37.319 align:start position:0%
those programs uh to send New Hampshire
 
00:57:40.990 --> 00:57:41.000 align:start position:0%
officers to if if it is uh the first one
 
00:57:43.069 --> 00:57:43.079 align:start position:0%
you spoke to is University of Missouri
 
00:57:45.950 --> 00:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
yep yeah so does the officer have to be
 
00:57:48.910 --> 00:57:48.920 align:start position:0%
on site in Missouri to attend the
 
00:57:51.470 --> 00:57:51.480 align:start position:0%
program and obviously there's travel
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
costs there's uh back costs um they will
 
00:57:56.870 --> 00:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
come to you
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
uh they're actually having an online
 
00:58:01.589 --> 00:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
Zoom for part of it in
 
00:58:04.150 --> 00:58:04.160 align:start position:0%
March it's uh
 
00:58:07.510 --> 00:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
$450 for one officer yeah if you have
 
00:58:11.349 --> 00:58:11.359 align:start position:0%
three plus it's 50% off yeah might be
 
00:58:13.870 --> 00:58:13.880 align:start position:0%
able to get grants for that yeah that's
 
00:58:15.349 --> 00:58:15.359 align:start position:0%
the kind of thing yeah the point I'm
 
00:58:17.789 --> 00:58:17.799 align:start position:0%
making though is that it costs there's
 
00:58:20.309 --> 00:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
going to be there's going to be cost
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
involved right so however those costs uh
 
00:58:26.630 --> 00:58:26.640 align:start position:0%
could be handled uh I think would go a
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
long way in moving this initiative
 
00:58:31.630 --> 00:58:31.640 align:start position:0%
forward we just can't lose sight of and
 
00:58:33.430 --> 00:58:33.440 align:start position:0%
and I I'm speaking from experience here
 
00:58:35.950 --> 00:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
because uh a couple of few years ago uh
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
police s and training was asked to do a
 
00:58:39.829 --> 00:58:39.839 align:start position:0%
bunch of extra
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
training and uh we didn't get any
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
resources to help you know move that
 
00:58:48.109 --> 00:58:48.119 align:start position:0%
along and we suffered from it we had to
 
00:58:49.829 --> 00:58:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh you know really move a lot of other
 
00:58:51.870 --> 00:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
things around so I just want to make
 
00:58:53.789 --> 00:58:53.799 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody kind of keeps that
 
00:58:56.109 --> 00:58:56.119 align:start position:0%
in mind okay so just based on what you
 
00:58:58.069 --> 00:58:58.079 align:start position:0%
said I could you could probably Train
 
00:58:58.079 --> 00:58:59.309 align:start position:0%
said I could you could probably Train
100

00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:58:59.319 --> 00:59:01.309 align:start position:0%
100
officers

00:59:01.309 --> 00:59:01.319 align:start position:0%
officers
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
uh the two two day one no on the
 
00:59:07.150 --> 00:59:07.160 align:start position:0%
Missouri one for for cuz you said it was
 
00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:10.280 align:start position:0%
half 225 per officer is that
 
00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
correct no if you three or more is 50%
 
00:59:16.190 --> 00:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
off it it would be so if you had a 100
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
that's three or
 
00:59:22.349 --> 00:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
more no it is so um you know I'm just
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
going big right absolutely if you know
 
00:59:27.430 --> 00:59:27.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to talk numbers right so
 
00:59:29.190 --> 00:59:29.200 align:start position:0%
you're talking like 25 you know less
 
00:59:29.200 --> 00:59:30.270 align:start position:0%
you're talking like 25 you know less
than

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:30.280 align:start position:0%
than
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
$25,000 they'll also come to you so you
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
could so um you know that's a that's not
 
00:59:40.230 --> 00:59:40.240 align:start position:0%
to me that's not a lot of
 
00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.870 align:start position:0%
to me that's not a lot of
dollars

00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:59:48.990 --> 00:59:49.000 align:start position:0%
um please question John when you are not
 
00:59:51.190 --> 00:59:51.200 align:start position:0%
if there was something you were told you
 
00:59:54.430 --> 00:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
had to include a new
 
00:59:58.390 --> 00:59:58.400 align:start position:0%
curriculum and it's an unfunded mandate
 
01:00:00.109 --> 01:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
so that's what you're talking about that
 
01:00:01.470 --> 01:00:01.480 align:start position:0%
that's happened to
 
01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
you do you ever get a request that is
 
01:00:07.950 --> 01:00:07.960 align:start position:0%
funded and how does that work how do if
 
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
you were told to add on
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
training does it ever get is there ever
 
01:00:16.589 --> 01:00:16.599 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for funding there that we
 
01:00:16.599 --> 01:00:17.670 align:start position:0%
a mechanism for funding there that we
could

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:17.680 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:00:21.549 --> 01:00:21.559 align:start position:0%
replicate yeah so it uh just discussions
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
like this sometimes uh a bill is is put
 
01:00:26.349 --> 01:00:26.359 align:start position:0%
in play and and then there's some
 
01:00:28.109 --> 01:00:28.119 align:start position:0%
funding attached to it to help support
 
01:00:31.990 --> 01:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
it uh un the term unfunded mandate is
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
more kind of a a the state causing a
 
01:00:37.510 --> 01:00:37.520 align:start position:0%
municipality to have to do something
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
right uh if the state tells me concept
 
01:00:42.549 --> 01:00:42.559 align:start position:0%
of if the state tells me to do something
 
01:00:46.630 --> 01:00:46.640 align:start position:0%
job do it yeah uh but
 
01:00:48.789 --> 01:00:48.799 align:start position:0%
um I think the other thing to keep in
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
mind too and and uh the doctor uh talked
 
01:00:55.710 --> 01:00:55.720 align:start position:0%
about it very early on is you can uh you
 
01:00:58.349 --> 01:00:58.359 align:start position:0%
can lead the horse to the water and you
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
can give him a cup or a straw or a
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
bucket or uh but you still can't make
 
01:01:06.430 --> 01:01:06.440 align:start position:0%
him drink and and again I I just think
 
01:01:10.990 --> 01:01:11.000 align:start position:0%
the reality of uh staffing issues right
 
01:01:15.430 --> 01:01:15.440 align:start position:0%
now uh we cannot uh we have to keep that
 
01:01:18.630 --> 01:01:18.640 align:start position:0%
as part of this conversation and I would
 
01:01:21.190 --> 01:01:21.200 align:start position:0%
love to I I'll call the University of
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
Missouri when I get back to the office
 
01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:25.720 align:start position:0%
and find out what it takes to get them
 
01:01:28.270 --> 01:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
to to come out here and and deliver that
 
01:01:29.549 --> 01:01:29.559 align:start position:0%
block of
 
01:01:29.559 --> 01:01:31.270 align:start position:0%
block of
instruction

01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
instruction
 
01:01:33.630 --> 01:01:33.640 align:start position:0%
uh but I can't guarantee you that
 
01:01:36.549 --> 01:01:36.559 align:start position:0%
anybody's going to attend yeah well well
 
01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
I guess I guess the thing is
 
01:01:42.390 --> 01:01:42.400 align:start position:0%
is um so we don't want to really create
 
01:01:43.789 --> 01:01:43.799 align:start position:0%
a task force because we don't want to
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
have a dedicated law enforcement
 
01:01:49.710 --> 01:01:49.720 align:start position:0%
officer you know to that because because
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
of Staffing and other
 
01:01:55.309 --> 01:01:55.319 align:start position:0%
issues and hate to mandate volunteers
 
01:01:57.630 --> 01:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:02:02.630 --> 01:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
maybe know um we're close to volunteers
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:09.750 --> 01:02:09.760 align:start position:0%
elected um but how do
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
we get say
 
01:02:16.269 --> 01:02:16.279 align:start position:0%
50 passionate people in the
 
01:02:16.279 --> 01:02:18.630 align:start position:0%
50 passionate people in the
state

01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:02:22.670 --> 01:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
that right law enforcement to under to
 
01:02:25.470 --> 01:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
take this course and be part of a group
 
01:02:28.829 --> 01:02:28.839 align:start position:0%
as a resource they're not act you know
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
they would be the resource because
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
that's what we're looking for right so
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
that at the county level at the local
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
level we have a case going
 
01:02:42.269 --> 01:02:42.279 align:start position:0%
on you know it could be local law
 
01:02:43.990 --> 01:02:44.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement that wants to be part of
 
01:02:46.390 --> 01:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
this training it doesn't have to be the
 
01:02:48.589 --> 01:02:48.599 align:start position:0%
state police or the
 
01:02:52.109 --> 01:02:52.119 align:start position:0%
county but I'm just thinking if we get a
 
01:02:52.119 --> 01:02:54.829 align:start position:0%
county but I'm just thinking if we get a
volunteer

01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
group because that's we need the
 
01:02:59.309 --> 01:02:59.319 align:start position:0%
resources so that local law enforcement
 
01:03:02.309 --> 01:03:02.319 align:start position:0%
understands so when they get the call
 
01:03:04.630 --> 01:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
they can go in and take
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
action and understand what they're
 
01:03:10.589 --> 01:03:10.599 align:start position:0%
looking for or how to how to handle it
 
01:03:14.230 --> 01:03:14.240 align:start position:0%
um Rob I'm just thinking here I want to
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
ask Jerry the Missouri course yeah how
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
do they intertwine New Hampshire law
 
01:03:24.190 --> 01:03:24.200 align:start position:0%
local law that's what I I guess for
 
01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:26.039 align:start position:0%
that's one of the things that I thought
 
01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
about and I would say that and that's
 
01:03:31.950 --> 01:03:31.960 align:start position:0%
the issue that I've one of the things
 
01:03:34.269 --> 01:03:34.279 align:start position:0%
that I also did um when I was teaching
 
01:03:38.549 --> 01:03:38.559 align:start position:0%
at UNH was I was one of the founders and
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
um uh coordinator for the New England
 
01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Humane Academy now that
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
was for Animal Control Officers and
 
01:03:48.670 --> 01:03:48.680 align:start position:0%
people that worked in Humane Society so
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
it wasn't all animal cruelty it was a
 
01:03:52.870 --> 01:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
lot of animal handling and that kind of
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
stuff um but
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
that was the issue that I had when I
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
would have speakers come in talking
 
01:04:03.069 --> 01:04:03.079 align:start position:0%
about animal cruelty the laws are so
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
different and people would leave those
 
01:04:07.309 --> 01:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
classes thinking they could do things
 
01:04:09.510 --> 01:04:09.520 align:start position:0%
that they can't do because our laws are
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
so different so I would say that
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
anything that we would do would have to
 
01:04:17.870 --> 01:04:17.880 align:start position:0%
incorporate that two-hour class which
 
01:04:21.069 --> 01:04:21.079 align:start position:0%
goes over New Hampshire law and that may
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
need to be modified but um it has to
 
01:04:26.230 --> 01:04:26.240 align:start position:0%
apply to new hampsh
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
the most successful Workshop that I had
 
01:04:32.430 --> 01:04:32.440 align:start position:0%
when I was coordinating the New England
 
01:04:35.269 --> 01:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
Animal Control Humane Academy was I
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to
 
01:04:40.269 --> 01:04:40.279 align:start position:0%
get an equin veterinarian in to discuss
 
01:04:43.829 --> 01:04:43.839 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty and ecoin and I got it
 
01:04:45.910 --> 01:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
approved for veterinary
 
01:04:50.269 --> 01:04:50.279 align:start position:0%
CE but I got an excellent speaker but I
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
gave him New Hampshire laws and I said
 
01:04:54.069 --> 01:04:54.079 align:start position:0%
anything you discuss has to fit New
 
01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire laws and he did that we had
 
01:04:58.870 --> 01:04:58.880 align:start position:0%
veterinarians there as well as
 
01:05:01.789 --> 01:05:01.799 align:start position:0%
acos um we didn't have any police
 
01:05:05.430 --> 01:05:05.440 align:start position:0%
officers but um that's just the way but
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire law is is unique
 
01:05:09.359 --> 01:05:10.750 align:start position:0%
that's New Hampshire law is is unique
and

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:10.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:14.349 --> 01:05:14.359 align:start position:0%
confusing to say the least so aside from
 
01:05:16.150 --> 01:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
statute and law what does the Missouri
 
01:05:19.910 --> 01:05:19.920 align:start position:0%
course do what does it teach um it uh
 
01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.589 align:start position:0%
course do what does it teach um it uh
cover

01:05:21.589 --> 01:05:21.599 align:start position:0%
cover
 
01:05:24.670 --> 01:05:24.680 align:start position:0%
it the other thing is and as you
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned police officers are trained in
 
01:05:29.549 --> 01:05:29.559 align:start position:0%
all of this but they need to know how to
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
apply it to animals so they're taking
 
01:05:34.829 --> 01:05:34.839 align:start position:0%
the stuff that the police officers
 
01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
already know and applying it to animals
 
01:05:40.750 --> 01:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
so that it makes more sense now they
 
01:05:42.910 --> 01:05:42.920 align:start position:0%
have different
 
01:05:47.349 --> 01:05:47.359 align:start position:0%
levels and um they have level
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
one which is uh professional animal
 
01:05:52.829 --> 01:05:52.839 align:start position:0%
cruelty investigator level two is
 
01:05:57.269 --> 01:05:57.279 align:start position:0%
Advanced and uh level three is
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
expert and they get into some of the
 
01:06:03.870 --> 01:06:03.880 align:start position:0%
specializations because um the the level
 
01:06:03.880 --> 01:06:05.549 align:start position:0%
specializations because um the the level
one

01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
is animal law constitutional law
 
01:06:11.430 --> 01:06:11.440 align:start position:0%
nutrition photography Communications all
 
01:06:14.109 --> 01:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
stuff you've had but then when we get
 
01:06:18.269 --> 01:06:18.279 align:start position:0%
into advanced um they talk about body
 
01:06:18.279 --> 01:06:19.109 align:start position:0%
into advanced um they talk about body
condition

01:06:19.109 --> 01:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
condition
 
01:06:23.230 --> 01:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
scoring um crime scene investigations
 
01:06:25.710 --> 01:06:25.720 align:start position:0%
with animal things in mind it's amazing
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
what you're doing with DNA now and
 
01:06:30.549 --> 01:06:30.559 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty investigations which you
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
know you
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
can't it's talked about but it's not the
 
01:06:37.510 --> 01:06:37.520 align:start position:0%
procedures for taking DNA samples and
 
01:06:40.269 --> 01:06:40.279 align:start position:0%
where to send them and all of that stuff
 
01:06:42.829 --> 01:06:42.839 align:start position:0%
um it talks about equin agricultural
 
01:06:45.510 --> 01:06:45.520 align:start position:0%
animals and confinement operations and
 
01:06:47.349 --> 01:06:47.359 align:start position:0%
so I'm hesitant when I hear body
 
01:06:48.510 --> 01:06:48.520 align:start position:0%
conditioning I mean I've raised
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
livestock my whole life I know and I
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
find it tough when somebody asks me the
 
01:06:54.670 --> 01:06:54.680 align:start position:0%
weight of my cattle and all and you make
 
01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
you guess and then you put them on the
 
01:06:58.510 --> 01:06:58.520 align:start position:0%
scale and you're like wow these These
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
are these
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
are scientific scores that are taught by
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
agricultural experts to determine
 
01:07:11.829 --> 01:07:11.839 align:start position:0%
whether it's normal for that species or
 
01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
not what we often hear about you know
 
01:07:18.789 --> 01:07:18.799 align:start position:0%
the the livestock is entirely different
 
01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:21.480 align:start position:0%
and even within livestock beef is
 
01:07:23.470 --> 01:07:23.480 align:start position:0%
different from dairy and so on but it
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
goes over all of that and they have the
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
they have the experts that cover it now
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
I have some of those resources up on our
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
website but somebody that doesn't know
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
what they're doing is still going to be
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
confused by the
 
01:07:40.870 --> 01:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
resources right I I I think so one of
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
the things that in our law it says that
 
01:07:46.150 --> 01:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
if you're going to remove an animal you
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
have to have a licensed
 
01:07:52.750 --> 01:07:52.760 align:start position:0%
veterinarian with you it's live for
 
01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
livestock correct um so and speaking of
 
01:07:59.510 --> 01:07:59.520 align:start position:0%
and I understand what Rob is saying
 
01:08:02.109 --> 01:08:02.119 align:start position:0%
about body conditioning I had a horse I
 
01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
I had a couple of drafts one all he did
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
was look at food and put on weight the
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
other one we
 
01:08:11.349 --> 01:08:11.359 align:start position:0%
did all special food we separated them
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
we fed him more than any other animal
 
01:08:16.669 --> 01:08:16.679 align:start position:0%
and he still looked this you know his
 
01:08:19.309 --> 01:08:19.319 align:start position:0%
body conditioning was people would look
 
01:08:20.789 --> 01:08:20.799 align:start position:0%
at him and say you know he's not healthy
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
and it's like he eats three times as
 
01:08:25.269 --> 01:08:25.279 align:start position:0%
much as the other one who just looks at
 
01:08:31.149 --> 01:08:31.159 align:start position:0%
the food um so um there's that aspect
 
01:08:34.189 --> 01:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
also but if it's a proper investigation
 
01:08:35.309 --> 01:08:35.319 align:start position:0%
they're going to ask for your
 
01:08:37.510 --> 01:08:37.520 align:start position:0%
documentation that's the end of that
 
01:08:39.789 --> 01:08:39.799 align:start position:0%
you've been taking care of your animal
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
so right and and and but but the
 
01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
veterinarians portion I think is is key
 
01:08:46.910 --> 01:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
for for law enforcement because we're
 
01:08:50.510 --> 01:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
not going to expect law enforcement to
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
understand all of that and I think in
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
because of our law um and maybe do we
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
need to leave it at just livestock that
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
a veterinarian companies or is question
 
01:09:05.789 --> 01:09:05.799 align:start position:0%
well um even with the livestock if a
 
01:09:08.910 --> 01:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
police officer goes out they can still
 
01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:12.960 align:start position:0%
do or or Humane agent goes out they can
 
01:09:15.030 --> 01:09:15.040 align:start position:0%
do the preliminary
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
investigation and in in many cases it's
 
01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
solved right there you know they go to
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
your house you got a skinny horse and
 
01:09:23.709 --> 01:09:23.719 align:start position:0%
they see the documentation by see you
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
you're fine it's only when there's
 
01:09:30.510 --> 01:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
probable cause that those people are not
 
01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:32.279 align:start position:0%
taking care of the animals that they're
 
01:09:33.550 --> 01:09:33.560 align:start position:0%
going to go
 
01:09:37.550 --> 01:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
back with a veterinarian who says yes I
 
01:09:40.149 --> 01:09:40.159 align:start position:0%
agree with you you have probable cause
 
01:09:41.789 --> 01:09:41.799 align:start position:0%
they still have to go back and get a
 
01:09:44.189 --> 01:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
warrant they can't just take it because
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
the veterinarian says so there's a
 
01:09:49.070 --> 01:09:49.080 align:start position:0%
procedure to all of that and if you've
 
01:09:52.349 --> 01:09:52.359 align:start position:0%
never done it before or have not looked
 
01:09:54.310 --> 01:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
at the law since you took the academy
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
course to 20 years ago um it's not going
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be fresh in your mind at
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
all and I agree with you um on that I
 
01:10:06.229 --> 01:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
just wanted to bring up that issue so
 
01:10:10.750 --> 01:10:10.760 align:start position:0%
that people can understand and you know
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
as I explained earlier the thing I had
 
01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:17.159 align:start position:0%
with the horse is getting a veterinarian
 
01:10:19.830 --> 01:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
out and that's the other piece um on
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
some of it is making sure we have
 
01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
veterinarians that are willing to go out
 
01:10:26.669 --> 01:10:26.679 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement um um when they
 
01:10:26.679 --> 01:10:27.510 align:start position:0%
with law enforcement um um when they
need

01:10:27.510 --> 01:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
need
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
them um because I you know I had one
 
01:10:31.910 --> 01:10:31.920 align:start position:0%
where it's like yeah I can't get there
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
for 10 days I'm like well 10 days that's
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
not good enough you know the horses need
 
01:10:39.990 --> 01:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
water um
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how to address that but
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
I would love for this group um this is
 
01:10:49.470 --> 01:10:49.480 align:start position:0%
an early Bill we either have to amend it
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
and get it done by March
 
01:10:54.910 --> 01:10:54.920 align:start position:0%
6th or we're going to have to wait and I
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
know that we don't really want to wait
 
01:11:02.390 --> 01:11:02.400 align:start position:0%
on this and I am open to any and all
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
amendments that people would deem
 
01:11:06.030 --> 01:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
necessary for
 
01:11:09.830 --> 01:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
this um you
 
01:11:12.870 --> 01:11:12.880 align:start position:0%
know so I'm just going to leave it there
 
01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.470 align:start position:0%
know so I'm just going to leave it there
and

01:11:15.470 --> 01:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:11:20.990 --> 01:11:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.830 --> 01:11:23.840 align:start position:0%
something well I was just wondering if
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
uh there was an idea to try
 
01:11:29.070 --> 01:11:29.080 align:start position:0%
to write something
 
01:11:32.030 --> 01:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
up on one of these suggestions that we
 
01:11:35.790 --> 01:11:35.800 align:start position:0%
could maybe agree to expore it or have
 
01:11:40.669 --> 01:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
another meeting to to to agree on
 
01:11:40.679 --> 01:11:42.510 align:start position:0%
another meeting to to to agree on
some

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:11:45.430 --> 01:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
uh one of these proposals to move
 
01:11:48.189 --> 01:11:48.199 align:start position:0%
forward on or something like that but
 
01:11:52.990 --> 01:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
unless it's your bill oh oh no uh I am
 
01:11:55.629 --> 01:11:55.639 align:start position:0%
we're having this subcommittee and
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
everyone is here so we can come up with
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
something that works that is right I I'd
 
01:12:04.149 --> 01:12:04.159 align:start position:0%
rather get something I don't want to
 
01:12:06.270 --> 01:12:06.280 align:start position:0%
keep coming back I mean I brought
 
01:12:10.350 --> 01:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
something last term it didn't
 
01:12:14.430 --> 01:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
fly to me like the first model of uh
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
trying to bring together
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
resources I mean you probably should
 
01:12:22.149 --> 01:12:22.159 align:start position:0%
restate it John what you the first
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
proposal there before you said the T TK
 
01:12:28.910 --> 01:12:28.920 align:start position:0%
Force right the training model with uh
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
that you would need compensation uh for
 
01:12:32.910 --> 01:12:32.920 align:start position:0%
officers going out or however they
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
responded so yes
 
01:12:40.470 --> 01:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
that uh I I wonder if and I know this
 
01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:42.320 align:start position:0%
isn't helpful
 
01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:44.629 align:start position:0%
isn't helpful
TimeWise

01:12:44.629 --> 01:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
TimeWise
 
01:12:44.639 --> 01:12:46.510 align:start position:0%
TimeWise
uh

01:12:46.510 --> 01:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:12:50.070 --> 01:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
to would a bill that establishes a a
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
study committee to to look at this and
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know really bring I think it
 
01:12:58.870 --> 01:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
would be important to bring
 
01:13:00.709 --> 01:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
representatives from the New Hampshire
 
01:13:00.719 --> 01:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
representatives from the New Hampshire
Chiefs

01:13:01.750 --> 01:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
Chiefs
 
01:13:04.070 --> 01:13:04.080 align:start position:0%
Association uh representatives from the
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Sheriff's
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
Association uh uh folks from the the uh
 
01:13:13.870 --> 01:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
Veterinary uh uh Community uh and
 
01:13:16.350 --> 01:13:16.360 align:start position:0%
prosecutors quite frankly I think uh the
 
01:13:19.629 --> 01:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
prosecutors really hold a pretty judges
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh yeah uh you know that I I wonder if
 
01:13:28.430 --> 01:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
that would be uh something that in the
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
long run would would help
 
01:13:34.390 --> 01:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
get uh get done what we're trying to get
 
01:13:38.229 --> 01:13:38.239 align:start position:0%
done I think that that would proba I
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
know it's not accomplishing what people
 
01:13:43.149 --> 01:13:43.159 align:start position:0%
want done as quickly as possible but I
 
01:13:45.629 --> 01:13:45.639 align:start position:0%
think if we want to do this right I
 
01:13:50.390 --> 01:13:50.400 align:start position:0%
think that it would be the way to go um
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
and you know I I think um that we will I
 
01:14:00.149 --> 01:14:00.159 align:start position:0%
think having it as a retaining the bill
 
01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:03.280 align:start position:0%
and having it as not necessarily A study
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
committee but retaining the
 
01:14:08.950 --> 01:14:08.960 align:start position:0%
bill um we can continue to work in this
 
01:14:11.390 --> 01:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
format where if we create a study
 
01:14:12.910 --> 01:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
committee it's going to be so many
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
people and I'd rather have the
 
01:14:17.110 --> 01:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
representatives on the environment and
 
01:14:19.790 --> 01:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
agriculture be the ones really looking
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
at this and working with all of you and
 
01:14:25.030 --> 01:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
the other people that should be in
 
01:14:27.430 --> 01:14:27.440 align:start position:0%
included uh so I think retaining this
 
01:14:31.189 --> 01:14:31.199 align:start position:0%
bill and doing work sessions like this
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
um as opposed to creating an actual
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
study committee might may be um the way
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
to go but either way I think it needs I
 
01:14:41.470 --> 01:14:41.480 align:start position:0%
think we can come up with
 
01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
something uh good for the state that
 
01:14:47.590 --> 01:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
works for everybody um and I'd rather
 
01:14:49.350 --> 01:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
take a little bit more time to get it
 
01:14:53.149 --> 01:14:53.159 align:start position:0%
right um I may please thank you madam
 
01:14:55.590 --> 01:14:55.600 align:start position:0%
chair um so when people hear the word
 
01:14:57.430 --> 01:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
study committee they automatically think
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
that the bill is DOA and that's not the
 
01:15:02.430 --> 01:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
case here because the there is a valid
 
01:15:04.270 --> 01:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
need for this but there's so many
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
stakeholders in this that we have to
 
01:15:08.390 --> 01:15:08.400 align:start position:0%
address everyone's concern so I think a
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
study committee is completely
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate and with that um Madame
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
chair and members of this group I must
 
01:15:16.430 --> 01:15:16.440 align:start position:0%
leave because I have to take my shelter
 
01:15:18.830 --> 01:15:18.840 align:start position:0%
dog to the vet so thank you for having
 
01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:22.070 align:start position:0%
dog to the vet so thank you for having
me

01:15:22.070 --> 01:15:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
late thank you happy Valentine's Day
 
01:15:24.639 --> 01:15:27.390 align:start position:0%
late thank you happy Valentine's Day
repres

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.550 --> 01:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
representative um so thoughts from
 
01:15:33.550 --> 01:15:33.560 align:start position:0%
everybody else um on re either retaining
 
01:15:35.709 --> 01:15:35.719 align:start position:0%
this bill or uh putting it into a study
 
01:15:37.910 --> 01:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
committee so that all the stakeholders
 
01:15:42.030 --> 01:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
can be involved and we can all together
 
01:15:44.430 --> 01:15:44.440 align:start position:0%
craft a piece of legislation that
 
01:15:47.870 --> 01:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
works um love to hear thoughts I I would
 
01:15:52.629 --> 01:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
only ask that if if the bill were to uh
 
01:15:55.270 --> 01:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
kind of still stay in play and I refer
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
to you madam on this I I don't know I
 
01:15:59.270 --> 01:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
don't understand this side of the house
 
01:16:02.189 --> 01:16:02.199 align:start position:0%
so much I'm just a cop but uh I would
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
just ask that an amendment be made that
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
uh uh in line uh six uh that basically
 
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
says uh uh through instruction in a
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
course uh uh approved by the New
 
01:16:20.189 --> 01:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
 
01:16:20.199 --> 01:16:26.310 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standards and training
Council

01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:30.270 --> 01:16:30.280 align:start position:0%
and I think that uh just that simple
 
01:16:33.709 --> 01:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh would help open the door to
 
01:16:36.430 --> 01:16:36.440 align:start position:0%
to bring in those uh programs that are
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
already there that that Dr Z has has
 
01:16:41.590 --> 01:16:41.600 align:start position:0%
kind of identified so okay and I had
 
01:16:43.030 --> 01:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
brought forth another amendment to
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
include um all of the other rsas the
 
01:16:48.110 --> 01:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
beastiality and everything else uh that
 
01:16:50.830 --> 01:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
you had discussed um earlier um
 
01:16:52.550 --> 01:16:52.560 align:start position:0%
obviously it never got introduced
 
01:16:55.790 --> 01:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
because we're actually having this
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
so um anybody else want to chime in have
 
01:17:03.430 --> 01:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts please uh I think it's better
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
to hold off I I think it needs more
 
01:17:11.189 --> 01:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
collaboration before we can actually
 
01:17:13.669 --> 01:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
have something that's going to
 
01:17:13.679 --> 01:17:15.590 align:start position:0%
have something that's going to
sustain

01:17:15.590 --> 01:17:15.600 align:start position:0%
sustain
 
01:17:17.950 --> 01:17:17.960 align:start position:0%
Rob just the the I guess the one
 
01:17:19.950 --> 01:17:19.960 align:start position:0%
advantage over a
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
study versus retaining is with a study
 
01:17:25.310 --> 01:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
you can actually get the wording down
 
01:17:27.590 --> 01:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
exactly what we're looking at you know
 
01:17:29.750 --> 01:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
the duties of what we've talked about as
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
opposed to what's what everybody sees
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
here we go either way I'm just just
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
making that point that a study you could
 
01:17:40.910 --> 01:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
drill down to exactly what we're what is
 
01:17:42.430 --> 01:17:42.440 align:start position:0%
going to be looked
 
01:17:46.590 --> 01:17:46.600 align:start position:0%
at okay um I will discuss that with
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
folks to see which way they'd prefer to
 
01:17:48.199 --> 01:17:49.669 align:start position:0%
folks to see which way they'd prefer to
go

01:17:49.669 --> 01:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
go
 
01:17:52.510 --> 01:17:52.520 align:start position:0%
Kurt just to be clear are you talking
 
01:17:55.590 --> 01:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
about amending the bill to
 
01:17:58.030 --> 01:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
have the bill then uh create a study
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
committee or just put the bill into
 
01:18:04.149 --> 01:18:04.159 align:start position:0%
interim study so there's two things we
 
01:18:06.870 --> 01:18:06.880 align:start position:0%
can do we can amend the bill to make it
 
01:18:09.390 --> 01:18:09.400 align:start position:0%
to create a study committee or we can
 
01:18:11.310 --> 01:18:11.320 align:start position:0%
put it into
 
01:18:14.470 --> 01:18:14.480 align:start position:0%
intrum so yeah I think it'd be probably
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
be better to actually amend the bill and
 
01:18:19.590 --> 01:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
then you spell out what you want that
 
01:18:21.390 --> 01:18:21.400 align:start position:0%
study committee to highight it's
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
comprised and you actually create the
 
01:18:27.510 --> 01:18:27.520 align:start position:0%
study Committee in the bill rather than
 
01:18:29.470 --> 01:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
all right well let let's talk about that
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
okay yeah it would be retained correct
 
01:18:34.350 --> 01:18:34.360 align:start position:0%
if you were you wouldn't be inum because
 
01:18:36.910 --> 01:18:36.920 align:start position:0%
it's not it would be retained correct
 
01:18:39.950 --> 01:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
that that is the correct word okay so I
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
want to go around the table what do you
 
01:18:43.629 --> 01:18:43.639 align:start position:0%
want to see in the study committee what
 
01:18:45.830 --> 01:18:45.840 align:start position:0%
what and I'll start with you
 
01:18:45.840 --> 01:18:48.950 align:start position:0%
what and I'll start with you
John

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'm still looking at the menu can you
 
01:18:52.790 --> 01:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
go to somebody
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
else well I mean if I'm going to do this
 
01:18:57.110 --> 01:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
and we're going to create this study
 
01:19:01.750 --> 01:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:05.950 --> 01:19:05.960 align:start position:0%
say so uh uh specifically Madam chair
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
are you asking what the uh the charge of
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
the commit of the study committee would
 
01:19:14.430 --> 01:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
be I'm asking what your thoughts are on
 
01:19:15.750 --> 01:19:15.760 align:start position:0%
what the charge of the study committee
 
01:19:18.229 --> 01:19:18.239 align:start position:0%
should be what you needed to
 
01:19:20.680 --> 01:19:20.690 align:start position:0%
say from your point of
 
01:19:20.690 --> 01:19:22.310 align:start position:0%
say from your point of
[Music]

01:19:22.310 --> 01:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
view so I I I would just I would say
 
01:19:28.350 --> 01:19:28.360 align:start position:0%
that uh the the charge of the committee
 
01:19:32.189 --> 01:19:32.199 align:start position:0%
would be to uh you know in investigate
 
01:19:32.199 --> 01:19:33.030 align:start position:0%
would be to uh you know in investigate
and

01:19:33.030 --> 01:19:33.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
identify uh a uh
 
01:19:36.679 --> 01:19:38.910 align:start position:0%
identify uh a uh
sustainable

01:19:38.910 --> 01:19:38.920 align:start position:0%
sustainable
 
01:19:42.870 --> 01:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
uh Statewide resource to assist with the
 
01:19:46.110 --> 01:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
investigation of animal cruelty
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
investigations uh and from from my own
 
01:19:52.270 --> 01:19:52.280 align:start position:0%
perspective uh representing New
 
01:19:54.830 --> 01:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire police standers and training I
 
01:20:00.430 --> 01:20:00.440 align:start position:0%
I would uh just ask that uh any training
 
01:20:04.229 --> 01:20:04.239 align:start position:0%
uh that uh ultimately is identified uh
 
01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
as necessary to move this forward
 
01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
uh that the language would say that uh a
 
01:20:15.910 --> 01:20:15.920 align:start position:0%
a block of training that is approved by
 
01:20:17.110 --> 01:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire police sers and
 
01:20:19.950 --> 01:20:19.960 align:start position:0%
training Council and then I would just I
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
would just want to make sure that there
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
would be uh some kind of uh funding
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
source whether that came from
 
01:20:31.510 --> 01:20:31.520 align:start position:0%
um you know from the state or whether
 
01:20:33.590 --> 01:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
there was grants involved but we would
 
01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:35.480 align:start position:0%
just need to have a secure funding
 
01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:39.719 align:start position:0%
source to to uh offset the costs of that
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
training and it could
 
01:20:44.950 --> 01:20:44.960 align:start position:0%
be uh something as easy as a
 
01:20:46.830 --> 01:20:46.840 align:start position:0%
reimbursement right so if there was a
 
01:20:49.510 --> 01:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
fund that allowed police standards and
 
01:20:51.149 --> 01:20:51.159 align:start position:0%
training and we do this all the time
 
01:20:52.990 --> 01:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
statutorily we we have the authority to
 
01:20:55.270 --> 01:20:55.280 align:start position:0%
do this where we would re reimburse the
 
01:20:58.950 --> 01:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
home agency uh for costs associated with
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
that person attending the
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
training um you know right now we do
 
01:21:05.790 --> 01:21:05.800 align:start position:0%
that with uh Crisis Intervention
 
01:21:08.270 --> 01:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
training so any any agency that sends
 
01:21:10.669 --> 01:21:10.679 align:start position:0%
one of their officers to a a weeklong
 
01:21:13.709 --> 01:21:13.719 align:start position:0%
CIT training we cover the cost of the
 
01:21:17.229 --> 01:21:17.239 align:start position:0%
training we cover uh any travel expense
 
01:21:19.229 --> 01:21:19.239 align:start position:0%
you know we we take care of all of that
 
01:21:22.270 --> 01:21:22.280 align:start position:0%
to support getting as many uh police
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
officers as possible trained in crisis
 
01:21:27.790 --> 01:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
center vention so okay thank you and
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
studied other than a seat at the table
 
01:21:37.870 --> 01:21:37.880 align:start position:0%
at the moment I don't have a whole lot
 
01:21:40.070 --> 01:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
to add again it I I appreciate you
 
01:21:41.629 --> 01:21:41.639 align:start position:0%
allowing me to to sit through it today
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
this is has been enlightening um I
 
01:21:47.030 --> 01:21:47.040 align:start position:0%
certainly have
 
01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts on you know on the topic uh
 
01:21:52.390 --> 01:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
from from law enforcement perspective
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
not personally but just from what can
 
01:21:57.470 --> 01:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer realistically manage
 
01:22:01.070 --> 01:22:01.080 align:start position:0%
and handle and investigate um by him or
 
01:22:02.709 --> 01:22:02.719 align:start position:0%
herself while out of the scene I think
 
01:22:05.470 --> 01:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate that a lot of other
 
01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
stakeholders are brought to the table to
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
see where they can weigh in and see
 
01:22:13.110 --> 01:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
where that burden lies um of sharing
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
that investigative responsibility of
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
when somebody uh for lack of better
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
words kind of gets tagged into that
 
01:22:22.189 --> 01:22:22.199 align:start position:0%
investigation um I think there needs to
 
01:22:25.270 --> 01:22:25.280 align:start position:0%
be uh maybe some more discussion
 
01:22:28.470 --> 01:22:28.480 align:start position:0%
in in that aspect of it so I se the
 
01:22:33.870 --> 01:22:33.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
Rob effect of
 
01:22:39.910 --> 01:22:39.920 align:start position:0%
microphone thank you something to the
 
01:22:43.590 --> 01:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
effect of the the best way to provide
 
01:22:47.149 --> 01:22:47.159 align:start position:0%
training uh to law enforcement and and
 
01:22:50.310 --> 01:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
and and make them aware of resources
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
available um regarding animal cruelty
 
01:22:55.830 --> 01:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
investigations something that okay um
 
01:22:59.229 --> 01:22:59.239 align:start position:0%
anything specific that uh would the Farm
 
01:23:00.910 --> 01:23:00.920 align:start position:0%
Bureau want to seat at the table in the
 
01:23:05.149 --> 01:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
study committee certainly okay
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
Kurt so again I think it's important to
 
01:23:12.470 --> 01:23:12.480 align:start position:0%
say that we're looking to have a prompt
 
01:23:16.790 --> 01:23:16.800 align:start position:0%
response by trained animal cruelty
 
01:23:20.669 --> 01:23:20.679 align:start position:0%
officer and resources
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
necessary uh through protocols set out
 
01:23:25.350 --> 01:23:25.360 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:23:29.750 --> 01:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
in any any locality would be uh that
 
01:23:31.750 --> 01:23:31.760 align:start position:0%
these resources would be
 
01:23:35.590 --> 01:23:35.600 align:start position:0%
available but but again it's a prompt
 
01:23:38.830 --> 01:23:38.840 align:start position:0%
response is important as well as the
 
01:23:41.990 --> 01:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
resources absolutely and
 
01:23:46.990 --> 01:23:47.000 align:start position:0%
Jerry um I would also like to uh include
 
01:23:49.310 --> 01:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
not only investigation but
 
01:23:52.669 --> 01:23:52.679 align:start position:0%
prosecution okay because um a lot of
 
01:23:55.030 --> 01:23:55.040 align:start position:0%
times when we're talking the misdemeanor
 
01:23:57.030 --> 01:23:57.040 align:start position:0%
animal cruelty it's a police prosecutor
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
or often the officer themselves that are
 
01:24:03.990 --> 01:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
bringing the ca case to the court so um
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
we need to cover that as well and also
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
provide resources for County Prosecutors
 
01:24:13.030 --> 01:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of get these dumped in their
 
01:24:14.870 --> 01:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
lap when they're not
 
01:24:17.310 --> 01:24:17.320 align:start position:0%
even they're further away than the
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
police officers are from what the laws
 
01:24:23.270 --> 01:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
are and how to enforce them uh and in
 
01:24:25.590 --> 01:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
addition be careful you do not create
 
01:24:27.790 --> 01:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
any new definitions we don't want to
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
talk about a animal cruelty officer
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
because there is no such thing in the
 
01:24:34.750 --> 01:24:34.760 align:start position:0%
state okay so
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
so I am going to set if I do an a when I
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
do the amendment on creating a study
 
01:24:42.709 --> 01:24:42.719 align:start position:0%
committee I would assume that I'm going
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
to want someone from police training and
 
01:24:48.750 --> 01:24:48.760 align:start position:0%

Sheriff are you Crea a stud commission
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
or stud committee
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
committee so you know how you use your
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
usual verage to invite any
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
stakers I like that you're listing it
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
out so that will bring people to the
 
01:25:37.189 --> 01:25:37.199 align:start position:0%
table so I look at your list of your
 
01:25:39.350 --> 01:25:39.360 align:start position:0%
Governor commission now it should
 
01:25:41.510 --> 01:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
include all of
 
01:25:41.520 --> 01:25:43.470 align:start position:0%
include all of
those

01:25:43.470 --> 01:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
believe uh the statee would like to hear
 
01:25:54.470 --> 01:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
from interested stakeholders including
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
and just
 
01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:05.390 align:start position:0%
and just
out

01:26:05.390 --> 01:26:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay I'm gonna have to ask you to come
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
up to the mic unfortunately because
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
you're sorry that's okayu yourself I
 
01:26:16.109 --> 01:26:16.119 align:start position:0%
know everybody's ready to leave um
 
01:26:18.030 --> 01:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
Elizabeth Sergeant shanin Capital group
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%

Sheriff's Association and the New
 
01:26:24.629 --> 01:26:24.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Chiefs of police um so just in
 
01:26:26.750 --> 01:26:26.760 align:start position:0%
your study committee I would probably
 
01:26:29.109 --> 01:26:29.119 align:start position:0%
just mirror your current Governor's
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
commission since you're working on some
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
of these issues now I would just add
 
01:26:35.470 --> 01:26:35.480 align:start position:0%
them in as as stakeholders you'll call
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
as resources and then the only other
 
01:26:39.629 --> 01:26:39.639 align:start position:0%
thing which I'll talk to you about
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
offline is but there's a uh a driver
 
01:26:45.510 --> 01:26:45.520 align:start position:0%
visor card we call it so the commission
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
on De hard of hearing many years ago
 
01:26:51.430 --> 01:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
with the cooperation of State Police um
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
drafted a roadside card that that you
 
01:26:56.430 --> 01:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
could hand to someone for resources
 
01:26:57.750 --> 01:26:57.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the commission could work on
 
01:27:00.430 --> 01:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
drafting something like this once once
 
01:27:03.070 --> 01:27:03.080 align:start position:0%
you do your work then you could have
 
01:27:06.109 --> 01:27:06.119 align:start position:0%
this for um officers once you get your
 
01:27:08.629 --> 01:27:08.639 align:start position:0%
resour your people and your resources
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
then maybe you have something simple
 
01:27:11.669 --> 01:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
then there's your resource that you've
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
been looking for Statewide great idea um
 
01:27:17.109 --> 01:27:17.119 align:start position:0%
Rob Madam chair Beth just brought up a
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
good point I mean if if the study is
 
01:27:21.070 --> 01:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
going to be more than just legislators
 
01:27:23.109 --> 01:27:23.119 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a commission or you just
 
01:27:24.990 --> 01:27:25.000 align:start position:0%
looking for a study committee and you're
 
01:27:27.430 --> 01:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
looking for the entities that that
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
committee is going to be yes calling yes
 
01:27:31.870 --> 01:27:31.880 align:start position:0%
so it is a study committee with with I
 
01:27:33.790 --> 01:27:33.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to do a commission I agree no
 
01:27:36.189 --> 01:27:36.199 align:start position:0%
I I I'm glad you already have a
 
01:27:37.790 --> 01:27:37.800 align:start position:0%
commission yeah I just wanted to be
 
01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:41.480 align:start position:0%
clear right but but I just want to see
 
01:27:44.430 --> 01:27:44.440 align:start position:0%
who everyone thinks should be here um I
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
want to make sure all stakeholders are
 
01:27:50.550 --> 01:27:50.560 align:start position:0%
here um at all the meetings um Jerry
 
01:27:56.310 --> 01:27:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:58.629 --> 01:27:58.639 align:start position:0%
okay um the Department of Agriculture
 
01:27:58.639 --> 01:28:03.910 align:start position:0%
okay um the Department of Agriculture
state

01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
v

01:28:06.229 --> 01:28:06.239 align:start position:0%
v
 
01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.990 align:start position:0%
v
um

01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:12.590 --> 01:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I think that retaining this bill or
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
turning it into amending it turning it
 
01:28:17.430 --> 01:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
into a study committee is the way to go
 
01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think this way we can get this right
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully this time around and next
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
year pass some really good legislation
 
01:28:30.189 --> 01:28:30.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can start addressing the
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
issue of animal cruelty with prompt
 
01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
