number of pieces of paper related to the
 
00:19:23.230 --> 00:19:23.240 align:start position:0%
quarterly report that's performed um by
 
00:19:25.430 --> 00:19:25.440 align:start position:0%
administrative services on all the
 
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:27.230 align:start position:0%
administrative services on all the
capital

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
capital
 
00:19:30.669 --> 00:19:30.679 align:start position:0%
projects so I gave you it's um titled
 
00:19:30.679 --> 00:19:32.310 align:start position:0%
projects so I gave you it's um titled
capap

00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
capap
 
00:19:36.669 --> 00:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
23021 it's got a folded page on
 
00:19:39.029 --> 00:19:39.039 align:start position:0%
it that was the report that was in your
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
packet last
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
meeting and just in way of description
 
00:19:46.430 --> 00:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
of the report the folded pages so it
 
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:48.000 align:start position:0%
looks like an Excel
 
00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:50.200 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that's the old quarterly
 
00:19:51.950 --> 00:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
report where you would have all your
 
00:19:54.510 --> 00:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget projects listed so
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
anything that was in House Bill 25 or in
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
a legislative special that was a capital
 
00:20:00.270 --> 00:20:00.280 align:start position:0%
appropriation would have been listed in
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
that portion of the court of the
 
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
report um during this last session law
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
was changed to expand it from the
 
00:20:10.510 --> 00:20:10.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget to all capital projects
 
00:20:12.430 --> 00:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
so if you go beyond the spreadsheet
 
00:20:15.630 --> 00:20:15.640 align:start position:0%
there's a an eight pages of agency
 
00:20:18.510 --> 00:20:18.520 align:start position:0%
listing of projects including arpa
 
00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
related projects uh self-funded types of
 
00:20:24.669 --> 00:20:24.679 align:start position:0%
projects where they have restricted
 
00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:26.840 align:start position:0%
revenue and then when you so that's all
 
00:20:28.430 --> 00:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
the other agencies and it's only eight
 
00:20:30.149 --> 00:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
pages and then you get beyond that and
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
there's the dot
 
00:20:35.350 --> 00:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
report um and for the quarterly report
 
00:20:37.870 --> 00:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
that was done do put together at the
 
00:20:40.510 --> 00:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
time what um they had quickly available
 
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
today they present you an alternative to
 
00:20:44.149 --> 00:20:44.159 align:start position:0%
that report because the number of
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
projects um that they do manage that
 
00:20:49.950 --> 00:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
they consider capital is significant um
 
00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
and it would require a little bit more
 
00:20:53.750 --> 00:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
um effort and and work on their part to
 
00:20:56.310 --> 00:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
get things done in a timely fashion and
 
00:20:57.669 --> 00:20:57.679 align:start position:0%
they're here today to kind of discuss
 
00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
their alter alternative report to you
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%
and what they could provide the
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
committee for the uh future quarterly
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.230 align:start position:0%

00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
you all um as um as uh Mr Shay had noted
 
00:23:49.830 --> 00:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
we we have a substantial amount of of
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
projects and the change in reporting
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
requirements from just the capital
 
00:23:57.870 --> 00:23:57.880 align:start position:0%
budget to all capital projects you know
 
00:24:01.029 --> 00:24:01.039 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of questions in in our mind
 
00:24:01.039 --> 00:24:03.149 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of questions in in our mind
um

00:24:03.149 --> 00:24:03.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
everything everything that we end up
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
doing tends to be um Project based and
 
00:24:13.990 --> 00:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
we have uh a lot of projects to soort to
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
say in our system that are whether
 
00:24:20.110 --> 00:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
they're fully projects or programs but
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
tracking all of the FTA all of the FAA
 
00:24:25.510 --> 00:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
in addition to our Highway and Bridge
 
00:24:29.789 --> 00:24:29.799 align:start position:0%
projects um and all of kind of our um on
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
call type of um consultant uh design
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
contracts they're all tracked and
 
00:24:39.990 --> 00:24:40.000 align:start position:0%
referenced in our system as as separate
 
00:24:42.990 --> 00:24:43.000 align:start position:0%
projects so the initial report to be
 
00:24:45.990 --> 00:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
responsive that that we gave to um and I
 
00:24:48.389 --> 00:24:48.399 align:start position:0%
think is included with that comprised
 
00:24:52.190 --> 00:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
about close to 600 individual lines and
 
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:57.840 align:start position:0%
individual um uh projects and uh myself
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
looking at it I questioned how useful it
 
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:02.840 align:start position:0%
was I I don't know if you all would find
 
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:08.240 align:start position:0%
that very very useful but um so mainly
 
00:25:10.830 --> 00:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
my intent we just want to be um
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
responsive but we also want to make sure
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
that the information that we're
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
providing is is useful and what the uh
 
00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:19.760 align:start position:0%
committee intended so um we have as I
 
00:25:21.389 --> 00:25:21.399 align:start position:0%
said we have an awful lot of projects
 
00:25:23.110 --> 00:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
through our Capital program a highway
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
and bridge program uh numbers of them in
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
various um
 
00:25:31.230 --> 00:25:31.240 align:start position:0%
um phases of of completion whether
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're just beginning in Project
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
scoping whether they're in active design
 
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
and and development or whether they're
 
00:25:41.669 --> 00:25:41.679 align:start position:0%
in construction or just finishing up
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
construction um also I'd also want to
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
just point out we do a lot of other um
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
reporting um and wanted to just uh
 
00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
double check if some of that had could
 
00:25:57.870 --> 00:25:57.880 align:start position:0%
have dual purposes so for for our
 
00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:00.440 align:start position:0%
Highway and bridge program for our um
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
you know Capital um transportation
 
00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559 align:start position:0%
program um in addition to the 10-year
 
00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
plan which we report on an update every
 
00:26:11.830 --> 00:26:11.840 align:start position:0%
every two years the first four years of
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
the of the 10year plan become What's
 
00:26:16.190 --> 00:26:16.200 align:start position:0%
called the the stip the State
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
Transportation Improvement plan um and
 
00:26:21.389 --> 00:26:21.399 align:start position:0%
through Federal requirements and stuff
 
00:26:25.110 --> 00:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
we we are uh reporting on that to a
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
broad bunch of of people the regional
 
00:26:28.990 --> 00:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
planning commissions and the federal
 
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
agencies every every quarter on on on
 
00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
that as well too um which contain mostly
 
00:26:40.029 --> 00:26:40.039 align:start position:0%
the the the active projects and things
 
00:26:42.269 --> 00:26:42.279 align:start position:0%
that are going on in the immediate uh
 
00:26:42.279 --> 00:26:43.190 align:start position:0%
that are going on in the immediate uh
four

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
four
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
years um and that's that goes to a
 
00:26:48.070 --> 00:26:48.080 align:start position:0%
public process of of approval and sign
 
00:26:50.149 --> 00:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
off by the federal agencies and and well
 
00:26:53.549 --> 00:26:53.559 align:start position:0%
too so it looks very similar to um to
 
00:26:56.430 --> 00:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan that you've probably
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
seen in the past and a listing of
 
00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.120 align:start position:0%
projects but it is kept up um very um um
 
00:27:06.269 --> 00:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
very frequently with quarterly
 
00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
updates um with with all that said um
 
00:27:11.669 --> 00:27:11.679 align:start position:0%
one of the things we'd like to suggest
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
and you have in front of you and and
 
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:15.720 align:start position:0%
Danielle and her team had put together
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
you know kind of a a subset from the 600
 
00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
projects that we had um originally
 
00:27:25.269 --> 00:27:25.279 align:start position:0%
presented to be responsive and and I
 
00:27:28.110 --> 00:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
think you know we we feel
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
that this may be of more value to you
 
00:27:34.230 --> 00:27:34.240 align:start position:0%
than than what we had provided um this
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
this is really uh what we would consider
 
00:27:38.590 --> 00:27:38.600 align:start position:0%
if you ask our opinion these are really
 
00:27:40.269 --> 00:27:40.279 align:start position:0%
our capital projects these are the
 
00:27:42.669 --> 00:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
highway and Bridge projects it doesn't
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
contain all of the um FTA programs uh it
 
00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:50.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't include like the FAA funding and
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
things like that which which go to
 
00:27:54.070 --> 00:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
projects but they aren't projects that
 
00:27:58.350 --> 00:27:58.360 align:start position:0%
that we as the do or as a state agency
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
um um manage or oversee we provide
 
00:28:05.549 --> 00:28:05.559 align:start position:0%
funding uh towards those agencies uh for
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
their own projects and their own
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
programs we report and I mean we we
 
00:28:14.430 --> 00:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
Monitor and track those um but reporting
 
00:28:17.070 --> 00:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
on those I don't know if we would have
 
00:28:18.669 --> 00:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
the most current and accurate
 
00:28:20.389 --> 00:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
information and I'm and I'm not sure if
 
00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:22.840 align:start position:0%
that's the type of information that the
 
00:28:25.549 --> 00:28:25.559 align:start position:0%
committee is looking for so this report
 
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:27.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't include any of the federal train
 
00:28:30.509 --> 00:28:30.519 align:start position:0%
Transit um programs or the FAA programs
 
00:28:33.789 --> 00:28:33.799 align:start position:0%
this is um really all of our state
 
00:28:35.110 --> 00:28:35.120 align:start position:0%
highway and Bridge type of
 
00:28:37.470 --> 00:28:37.480 align:start position:0%
Transportation projects state funded
 
00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
Turnpike funded federally funded um this
 
00:28:43.990 --> 00:28:44.000 align:start position:0%
does not contain any of the um
 
00:28:46.590 --> 00:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
municipally managed projects so these
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
this is a report of just do managed
 
00:28:52.750 --> 00:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
projects um we do provide through
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
various programs funding to cities and
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
towns for for there um municipally
 
00:29:02.549 --> 00:29:02.559 align:start position:0%
managed projects which again we uh track
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
and and and monitor but we're not the
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
active managers of that um so this
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
report um that you have in front of you
 
00:29:14.710 --> 00:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh I I we we we would recommend this if
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
this meets your needs um we have this
 
00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:20.600 align:start position:0%
the queries and stuff uh set up from
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
from some of those other reports that I
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
had mentioned and uh we can provide this
 
00:29:31.549 --> 00:29:31.559 align:start position:0%
uh quartly uh and um but I just wanted
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
to make sure it was clear what it
 
00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:35.600 align:start position:0%
contained and and and what it um what it
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
didn't contained and I should also say
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
we also did put a threshold on this
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
report that it's every everything over a
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars is that right yeah
 
00:29:47.789 --> 00:29:47.799 align:start position:0%
so so that would be our suggestion I
 
00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:49.600 align:start position:0%
gave you some of the background of why
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
we wanted to address the committee um
 
00:29:53.669 --> 00:29:53.679 align:start position:0%
and if you have any questions of us
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
we're um happy to answer them
 
00:30:00.909 --> 00:30:00.919 align:start position:0%
delandro please well thank you Mr
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
chairman bill this is really terrific
 
00:30:07.230 --> 00:30:07.240 align:start position:0%
for for for me and I call I call you a
 
00:30:10.509 --> 00:30:10.519 align:start position:0%
lot then I speak to to your staff a
 
00:30:14.149 --> 00:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
lot projects you know where are
 
00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:16.760 align:start position:0%
they how can we address them we never
 
00:30:18.870 --> 00:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
have enough money right I mean that's
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
that's the bottom line we never have
 
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:23.000 align:start position:0%
enough money and as a result of that we
 
00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
see projects but but we see projects
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
scheduled and and pushed down and and
 
00:30:30.509 --> 00:30:30.519 align:start position:0%
and so forth but uh my hats off to you
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
for the job that do does you know given
 
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
given the constraints and I've been
 
00:30:36.750 --> 00:30:36.760 align:start position:0%
looking at the numbers and the numbers
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
aren't favorable to us as we we that we
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
just don't look good the gas tax money
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
is not on target the registrations are
 
00:30:47.350 --> 00:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
not on target the license renewals are
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
not on target I mean the kinds of places
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
where we got the money uh they're
 
00:30:54.549 --> 00:30:54.559 align:start position:0%
diminishing and so where's the money
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
going to come
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
from that's
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
problem now what what we did with the
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles helps to some extent
 
00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:05.519 align:start position:0%
all right to some extent but generally
 
00:31:07.950 --> 00:31:07.960 align:start position:0%
speaking all of all of these projects
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
have a cost associated with them and
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
I've been on the case for exit 6 in
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
Manchester all right came up this
 
00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:18.360 align:start position:0%
morning I was late I apologized another
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
goddamn accident another one this
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
morning there was there was another one
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
on Thursday morning when I came up car
 
00:31:27.310 --> 00:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
across the road here's a woman with a
 
00:31:30.029 --> 00:31:30.039 align:start position:0%
child uh getting getting out of getting
 
00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
out of the car that that's a death trap
 
00:31:35.149 --> 00:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
and we've been talking about that as
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
long as I've been here that's that's I
 
00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
know there's a cost associated with it
 
00:31:43.909 --> 00:31:43.919 align:start position:0%
it's a toll road it's the F return Pike
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
well if you don't increase the tolls
 
00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:47.080 align:start position:0%
there's never going to be enough money
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
to fix
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
it I'm I'm very concerned about these
 
00:31:53.789 --> 00:31:53.799 align:start position:0%
projects falling falling
 
00:31:57.149 --> 00:31:57.159 align:start position:0%
behind I think what we do we do well and
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
and I compliment us doing well but we we
 
00:32:02.750 --> 00:32:02.760 align:start position:0%
have a tough time hiring people we have
 
00:32:05.870 --> 00:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
a tough time youve been on the god rails
 
00:32:09.029 --> 00:32:09.039 align:start position:0%
forever you know I know and we're
 
00:32:11.230 --> 00:32:11.240 align:start position:0%
replacing God rails all the time people
 
00:32:12.509 --> 00:32:12.519 align:start position:0%
are driving
 
00:32:15.389 --> 00:32:15.399 align:start position:0%
crazy uh they're smashing them up and so
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
and I don't want to go on a DI it's it's
 
00:32:20.590 --> 00:32:20.600 align:start position:0%
great information but the implementation
 
00:32:23.230 --> 00:32:23.240 align:start position:0%
is really the issue and as we sit around
 
00:32:26.190 --> 00:32:26.200 align:start position:0%
this this table we're thinking about
 
00:32:28.629 --> 00:32:28.639 align:start position:0%
safety security for for the roads
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
bridges in our in our system we did we
 
00:32:34.110 --> 00:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
did give the municipalities some money
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
in this this budget I was able to get 10
 
00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:40.760 align:start position:0%
million and so forth but look at the
 
00:32:44.190 --> 00:32:44.200 align:start position:0%
roads are Fallen apart they are they are
 
00:32:48.549 --> 00:32:48.559 align:start position:0%
falling apart so uh the report's great
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
but the bottom line is when are we going
 
00:32:55.110 --> 00:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
to have enough resources to do these
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
jobs and and we have resp responsible
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
for that we keep reducing our ability to
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
to to have resources and if we if we
 
00:33:05.549 --> 00:33:05.559 align:start position:0%
keep doing that then we have nobody to
 
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:08.360 align:start position:0%
blame but but ourselves but I I like I
 
00:33:11.190 --> 00:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
think the report's great it's great
 
00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:14.200 align:start position:0%
information and uh you know data
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
everybody wants a lot of data now so but
 
00:33:19.629 --> 00:33:19.639 align:start position:0%
this takes time and effort to put
 
00:33:23.509 --> 00:33:23.519 align:start position:0%
together it's a cumbersome task to to do
 
00:33:26.070 --> 00:33:26.080 align:start position:0%
all of this and to upgrade upgrade all
 
00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:29.240 align:start position:0%
of this and if you can't fill positions
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
that means people are doing more than
 
00:33:33.430 --> 00:33:33.440 align:start position:0%
than they have to do they're taking on
 
00:33:35.789 --> 00:33:35.799 align:start position:0%
other responsibilities so I PL you for
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
that uh long way of saying I think
 
00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:39.149 align:start position:0%
that uh long way of saying I think
everything

00:33:39.149 --> 00:33:39.159 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:33:43.070 --> 00:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
is here but I my my fear is for the
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
future I I really am fearful of the of
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
the future and uh we we're we're keeping
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
killing people in the highways they
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
they're driving too fast we're fixing
 
00:33:56.590 --> 00:33:56.600 align:start position:0%
the guard rails but they keep breaking
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
them yeah and I we got I think we have
 
00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
some real we have good information but
 
00:34:04.669 --> 00:34:04.679 align:start position:0%
we have to react to it in a positive
 
00:34:06.669 --> 00:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
sense that's all thank you Mr thank you
 
00:34:09.349 --> 00:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
Senator um
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
represent commissioner I like the uh the
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
format and the layout and it's certainly
 
00:34:19.349 --> 00:34:19.359 align:start position:0%
far more easy to read through than the
 
00:34:22.950 --> 00:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
um one in the packet my only Proviso is
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
consider to stay more with within the
 
00:34:31.149 --> 00:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
spirit of the legislation passed have we
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:39.190 --> 00:34:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay Chris to representative Eaton's
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
point that this committee um in this
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
fall had adopted the million dooll
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
threshold so that would be if you want
 
00:34:48.030 --> 00:34:48.040 align:start position:0%
to change the threshold it would be for
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
all agencies not just for the do
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily um but the million dollar
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
threshold for your information from Mr
 
00:34:57.470 --> 00:34:57.480 align:start position:0%
meet was suggested by by the committee
 
00:35:00.190 --> 00:35:00.200 align:start position:0%
as a way to um kind of limit the number
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
and types of projects that might be
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
captured because there's a lot of
 
00:35:05.750 --> 00:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
projects that are a few hundred, that
 
00:35:07.230 --> 00:35:07.240 align:start position:0%
maybe this committee doesn't necessarily
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
need to look at um on a regular basis
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
you're more interested in those larger
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
larger projects prior to my joining and
 
00:35:15.990 --> 00:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
I go with that Spirit thanks for the
 
00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:18.560 align:start position:0%
update yep thank you representative
 
00:35:21.430 --> 00:35:21.440 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Shay representative please
 
00:35:23.950 --> 00:35:23.960 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um thanks very much for
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
doing this this is one of these things
 
00:35:28.829 --> 00:35:28.839 align:start position:0%
where we when we originally moved from
 
00:35:30.870 --> 00:35:30.880 align:start position:0%
the capital budget oversight committee
 
00:35:33.190 --> 00:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
to the capital project oversight
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
committee I don't think we were thinking
 
00:35:38.589 --> 00:35:38.599 align:start position:0%
of the many many do uh projects that
 
00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
would be affected by the change in the
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements so clearly you
 
00:35:44.990 --> 00:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
have a lot of projects that fell within
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
the million dollars um I I think this is
 
00:35:52.630 --> 00:35:52.640 align:start position:0%
a great way of formatting it um my only
 
00:35:54.550 --> 00:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
question to you would be is this causing
 
00:35:57.270 --> 00:35:57.280 align:start position:0%
you another huge amount of time time to
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
prepare this report
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
or we hate for you to do a lot of uh I
 
00:36:04.950 --> 00:36:04.960 align:start position:0%
mean things were percolating along
 
00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:07.640 align:start position:0%
anyway so I was just curious um so we
 
00:36:11.790 --> 00:36:11.800 align:start position:0%
found a way to automate this um process
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
there is still it's not 100% automated
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
but the amount of time is far less than
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
the original Pro product that we had
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
provided so we believe that we can do
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
this on a quarterly
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:27.230 align:start position:0%
this on a quarterly
basis

00:36:27.230 --> 00:36:27.240 align:start position:0%
basis
 
00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:29.319 align:start position:0%
follow please I mean is it useful for
 
00:36:31.910 --> 00:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
you in some way to see the information
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
compiled in this way I'm just curious uh
 
00:36:39.790 --> 00:36:39.800 align:start position:0%
I would say um it's it's it's it's it's
 
00:36:42.910 --> 00:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
another review but um quite frankly um
 
00:36:44.670 --> 00:36:44.680 align:start position:0%
this would be a report just just for the
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
capital budget uh Capital project
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
oversight committee um the other reports
 
00:36:51.349 --> 00:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
that that I mentioned are are much more
 
00:36:54.150 --> 00:36:54.160 align:start position:0%
uh scrutinized and we work with the stip
 
00:36:57.630 --> 00:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
which we which everybody um deal deals
 
00:36:59.309 --> 00:36:59.319 align:start position:0%
with in uh you know the regional
 
00:37:00.950 --> 00:37:00.960 align:start position:0%
planning commissions and and the
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
approval process and you know that that
 
00:37:07.550 --> 00:37:07.560 align:start position:0%
reporting in that that process is much
 
00:37:07.560 --> 00:37:08.950 align:start position:0%
reporting in that that process is much
more

00:37:08.950 --> 00:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:37:12.790 --> 00:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
um our level of focus um you know part
 
00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:14.440 align:start position:0%
of that is federal requirements we
 
00:37:16.710 --> 00:37:16.720 align:start position:0%
cannot we cannot work on a project we
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
cannot spend money on a certain phase of
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
a project unless unless it is reflected
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
in in the step so we have a lot of um
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
time and effort and and focus and
 
00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
scrutiny on on that report um we also
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
provide to the industry a three-year
 
00:37:34.990 --> 00:37:35.000 align:start position:0%
look ahead of of construction
 
00:37:37.710 --> 00:37:37.720 align:start position:0%
projects um it's called our advertising
 
00:37:41.390 --> 00:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
schedule we meet monthly to review the
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
um advertising schedule and that's the
 
00:37:46.710 --> 00:37:46.720 align:start position:0%
list of projects that uh that we're
 
00:37:48.510 --> 00:37:48.520 align:start position:0%
anticipating going out to Construction
 
00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
in the next um two to three years um
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
that's another publicly available report
 
00:37:56.430 --> 00:37:56.440 align:start position:0%
we publish it every every month to the
 
00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:57.349 align:start position:0%
we publish it every every month to the
uh

00:37:57.349 --> 00:37:57.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:59.270 --> 00:37:59.280 align:start position:0%
to the industry so they see and know
 
00:38:02.030 --> 00:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
what's what's coming so that's a kind of
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
a long answer to you know we're more
 
00:38:06.069 --> 00:38:06.079 align:start position:0%
focused on some of those other other
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
other reports for the reasons i' I've
 
00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:11.599 align:start position:0%
noted this is all the same information
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's um reformatted a a little
 
00:38:20.829 --> 00:38:20.839 align:start position:0%
bit um to hopefully make it easier and
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
uh more trackable but
 
00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
um okay so it's and and as Danielle said
 
00:38:30.750 --> 00:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
we we have put some time into the the
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
queries and the reporting from from our
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh project information system that
 
00:38:39.870 --> 00:38:39.880 align:start position:0%
that uh that we feel it isn't terribly
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
burdensome to report to to um um issu
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
this report quarterly along with some
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
some of the other ones it's all the same
 
00:38:50.550 --> 00:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
database and it's we've got the the
 
00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
format and the um uh stuff set up to
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
produce this report relatively
 
00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:57.430 align:start position:0%
produce this report relatively
straightforward

00:38:57.430 --> 00:38:57.440 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:39:00.309 --> 00:39:00.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Shay did you have a comment
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
I just had a question if I might have
 
00:39:03.950 --> 00:39:03.960 align:start position:0%
the commissioner um in terms of the
 
00:39:05.230 --> 00:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
report I just want to make sure that the
 
00:39:07.390 --> 00:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
Committees what's the number State
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
reference is that the um number that you
 
00:39:12.630 --> 00:39:12.640 align:start position:0%
find in the 10-year plan yes yeah that
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
is a state project number and as I said
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
everything everything we do we start
 
00:39:19.750 --> 00:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
with a assigning a project number and
 
00:39:21.349 --> 00:39:21.359 align:start position:0%
that's how it's generally tracked
 
00:39:23.190 --> 00:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
through our financial systems and so
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
forth yeah so further comment is this
 
00:39:27.069 --> 00:39:27.079 align:start position:0%
this report
 
00:39:28.589 --> 00:39:28.599 align:start position:0%
though it's coming to this committee may
 
00:39:30.349 --> 00:39:30.359 align:start position:0%
be useful to like the Public Works
 
00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
committee when you're thinking about the
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
10-year plan and and members are asking
 
00:39:36.430 --> 00:39:36.440 align:start position:0%
about the status of a project it's kind
 
00:39:38.710 --> 00:39:38.720 align:start position:0%
of the cliffnote version of the 10-year
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
plan to say the project and Alton this
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
number this is where it's at and when
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
you're asking questions of the
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
department might be a little bit more
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
focused um so I just wanted to point
 
00:39:50.230 --> 00:39:50.240 align:start position:0%
that out to the committee members I
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
agree with that I think it could be
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
handy for you guys for like uh division
 
00:39:57.230 --> 00:39:57.240 align:start position:0%
two US SC
 
00:39:59.190 --> 00:39:59.200 align:start position:0%
you guys sorry I used to be part of you
 
00:40:02.430 --> 00:40:02.440 align:start position:0%
guys you Public Works folks yes no I uh
 
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
I'm very appreciative of this report
 
00:40:06.230 --> 00:40:06.240 align:start position:0%
really am I think it's a good thing are
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
there further questions of the
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner um Mr Shay would would we
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
need a motion to accept this new format
 
00:40:19.470 --> 00:40:19.480 align:start position:0%
or just an understanding that I I I
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
would um like that just so that it's
 
00:40:23.190 --> 00:40:23.200 align:start position:0%
clear that the committee does approve of
 
00:40:24.589 --> 00:40:24.599 align:start position:0%
the new format there's no questions
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%

between the between citizens in the
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
state um as I originally when we
 
00:42:51.349 --> 00:42:51.359 align:start position:0%
approach this project to begin with I
 
00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
originally warned folks um right now
 
00:42:58.510 --> 00:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
fishing game is going through a major U
 
00:43:00.870 --> 00:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
upheaval in our computer systems this is
 
00:43:03.109 --> 00:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
just one of the issues that we are
 
00:43:06.309 --> 00:43:06.319 align:start position:0%
facing um because of that uh in this
 
00:43:10.270 --> 00:43:10.280 align:start position:0%
year's budget we worked with doit and we
 
00:43:12.870 --> 00:43:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh created um for the first time we're
 
00:43:14.950 --> 00:43:14.960 align:start position:0%
going to have a doit lead position at
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
fishing game it's a new position it's a
 
00:43:20.390 --> 00:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
part-time position we split this person
 
00:43:22.589 --> 00:43:22.599 align:start position:0%
with a veterans hospital and today is
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
her first day on the job so um this
 
00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
person will will be helpful to us and
 
00:43:30.630 --> 00:43:30.640 align:start position:0%
help coordinate activities between our
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
folks that work with our registrations
 
00:43:35.349 --> 00:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
as well as our doit staff so this is a
 
00:43:37.190 --> 00:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
step forward on this project and all the
 
00:43:40.750 --> 00:43:40.760 align:start position:0%
other projects right now pay is um
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
steadily working on updating our license
 
00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.349 align:start position:0%
steadily working on updating our license
uh

00:43:45.349 --> 00:43:45.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:43:49.349 --> 00:43:49.359 align:start position:0%
software um I believe in 2012 the
 
00:43:53.510 --> 00:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
legislature passed um um a
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
law where we we join the um North
 
00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
law where we we join the um North
American

00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
American
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
compact um so if you have your hunting
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
or fishing license suspended in any
 
00:44:07.230 --> 00:44:07.240 align:start position:0%
state and now all 50 states belong so if
 
00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:08.240 align:start position:0%
you have your hunting and fishing
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
license suspended in any of the 50
 
00:44:12.710 --> 00:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
states uh you can't buy a license in a
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
different state if it's if there's a
 
00:44:16.710 --> 00:44:16.720 align:start position:0%
similar charge in that
 
00:44:21.670 --> 00:44:21.680 align:start position:0%
state um and we just we we joined the
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
compact in 2012 but we never actually
 
00:44:26.430 --> 00:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
instituted the software to make that
 
00:44:29.190 --> 00:44:29.200 align:start position:0%
happen so right now that's what uh pay's
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
working um spending the bulk of their
 
00:44:34.589 --> 00:44:34.599 align:start position:0%
time on they will be working on this
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
they they are also working on this
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
project and when when that gets done
 
00:44:40.069 --> 00:44:40.079 align:start position:0%
this project will become their main
 
00:44:42.790 --> 00:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
focus on on the work we're doing you're
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
going to be seeing us in the very near
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
future uh we need to uh extend the
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
contract um with uh S3 pay it so that we
 
00:44:58.150 --> 00:44:58.160 align:start position:0%
we will uh we had a 5-year renewable
 
00:44:59.790 --> 00:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
contract and we're going to we're going
 
00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
to plan on extending that contract
 
00:45:04.510 --> 00:45:04.520 align:start position:0%
fairly shortly my folks are uh my staff
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%

00:45:09.710 --> 00:45:09.720 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee um I do and
 
00:45:12.950 --> 00:45:12.960 align:start position:0%

are you 70% of your business is people
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
are sitting at their home P you know
 
00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.670 align:start position:0%
are sitting at their home P you know
purchasing

00:46:48.670 --> 00:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
purchasing
 
00:46:51.030 --> 00:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
licensing uh I do not have that figure
 
00:46:52.990 --> 00:46:53.000 align:start position:0%
on top of my head I I do have a figure
 
00:46:54.349 --> 00:46:54.359 align:start position:0%
this year because it's the first year we
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
did online deer registration
 
00:46:58.510 --> 00:46:58.520 align:start position:0%
and we were over 50% with online deer
 
00:47:00.910 --> 00:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
registration this year thank you so you
 
00:47:03.790 --> 00:47:03.800 align:start position:0%
know year one we hit 50% so I'm guessing
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%

00:47:08.870 --> 00:47:08.880 align:start position:0%

00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
my son made me aware of the fact that
 
00:47:15.150 --> 00:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
the lifetime reg uh license possibility
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
make sure thank you further questions
 
00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
the director
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you could you continue
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
on another part to your presentation so
 
00:48:05.190 --> 00:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
I'm G to have um uh Diane Timmons give
 
00:48:07.549 --> 00:48:07.559 align:start position:0%
the presentation today one thing I will
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
say is is that um we cut the
 
00:48:12.390 --> 00:48:12.400 align:start position:0%
presentation down to 15 minutes and and
 
00:48:14.309 --> 00:48:14.319 align:start position:0%
um we were requested to do that for you
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
folks today uh so um we may have left
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
out a few details that like we presented
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
the other day to the uh GNC we did a
 
00:48:24.349 --> 00:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
half an hour presentation with the
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
governor and Council
 
00:48:29.710 --> 00:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
um we are going out
 
00:48:31.910 --> 00:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
what for those of you that know me
 
00:48:33.790 --> 00:48:33.800 align:start position:0%
realize keeping my mouth shut is not a
 
00:48:36.349 --> 00:48:36.359 align:start position:0%
natural thing for me and one of the
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
issues with the Hatchery uh situation
 
00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
was is we were we were being sued by
 
00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
Seal you know we'd gone in to get a
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
permit EPA NEP permit down at the new
 
00:48:48.270 --> 00:48:48.280 align:start position:0%
Durham Hatchery and and through that
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
process we ended up getting sued it's
 
00:48:53.390 --> 00:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
been a long settlement case that is now
 
00:48:56.990 --> 00:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
settled um we've gotten the final decree
 
00:49:00.030 --> 00:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
uh while they they've issued the uh the
 
00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:03.839 align:start position:0%
decree on that uh I'm sorry consent
 
00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:07.480 align:start position:0%
decree um so now we're out talking and
 
00:49:10.270 --> 00:49:10.280 align:start position:0%
um uh Diane and I have been before you

00:49:29.950 --> 00:49:29.960 align:start position:0%
wildlife uh Federation will be speaking
 
00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
before them we're going to be having two
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
public meetings one in conquered one in
 
00:49:38.309 --> 00:49:38.319 align:start position:0%
Lancaster um I got there was a issue
 
00:49:40.109 --> 00:49:40.119 align:start position:0%
with somebody out sick and I got called
 
00:49:41.870 --> 00:49:41.880 align:start position:0%
up on a nine o'clock on a Saturday
 
00:49:43.549 --> 00:49:43.559 align:start position:0%
morning at noon time I was presenting to
 
00:49:45.710 --> 00:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
the gron fishing game club about the
 
00:49:48.190 --> 00:49:48.200 align:start position:0%
Hatchery about our Hatchery uh stuff so
 
00:49:49.829 --> 00:49:49.839 align:start position:0%
we are starting to get out and talk to
 
00:49:52.829 --> 00:49:52.839 align:start position:0%
folks um we have made arrangements we'll
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
be speaking to the um house fishing game
 
00:49:59.109 --> 00:49:59.119 align:start position:0%
committee and I've made a request to the
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
chairman of the Senate A&amp;E um for us to
 
00:50:05.430 --> 00:50:05.440 align:start position:0%
speak be you know before that committee
 
00:50:07.390 --> 00:50:07.400 align:start position:0%
too thank
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
you okay hi so thank you for this did
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
Sor the two of us together are a bad mix
 
00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:19.960 align:start position:0%
I have no problems talking for a long
 
00:50:21.789 --> 00:50:21.799 align:start position:0%
period of time as well so I always get
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
the warning you know 15 minutes 15
 
00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:26.040 align:start position:0%
minutes so
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
I will keep it toight um so thank you
 
00:50:31.109 --> 00:50:31.119 align:start position:0%
for the opportunity to speak today uh
 
00:50:33.470 --> 00:50:33.480 align:start position:0%
the Hatchery project is a very
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
passionate subject for me personally
 
00:50:38.270 --> 00:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
because I have been working for the
 
00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
state for almost 30 years and um have
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
done all sorts of things related
 
00:50:45.390 --> 00:50:45.400 align:start position:0%
Fisheries so started in keen and worked
 
00:50:47.710 --> 00:50:47.720 align:start position:0%
my way all up and now in this position
 
00:50:50.510 --> 00:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
so um staff is very excited about this
 
00:50:53.349 --> 00:50:53.359 align:start position:0%
opportunity and so thank you for letting
 
00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359 align:start position:0%
us speak about it today so why do we
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
care about the Hatchery modernization
 
00:51:01.910 --> 00:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
project and we care because fishing is a
 
00:51:04.589 --> 00:51:04.599 align:start position:0%
huge part of New Hampshire in the most
 
00:51:08.829 --> 00:51:08.839 align:start position:0%
recent study done by norc uh in 2022 it
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
determined that anglers in New Hampshire
 
00:51:15.309 --> 00:51:15.319 align:start position:0%
spent 3.5 million days fishing and they
 
00:51:17.430 --> 00:51:17.440 align:start position:0%
contributed to the economy of New
 
00:51:21.990 --> 00:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 1.4 billion dollars in 2022 so
 
00:51:24.950 --> 00:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
angling is a huge deal and part of that
 
00:51:27.430 --> 00:51:27.440 align:start position:0%
is stocking stocking will always be a
 
00:51:29.710 --> 00:51:29.720 align:start position:0%
part of New Hampshire which leads us
 
00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
into the Hatchery
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
situation so you can I'll turn as you
 
00:51:36.990 --> 00:51:37.000 align:start position:0%
guys can turn as I turn um I'm not used
 
00:51:38.950 --> 00:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
to doing this on paper I'll just refresh
 
00:51:40.589 --> 00:51:40.599 align:start position:0%
that I'm used to a PowerPoint so just
 
00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:42.440 align:start position:0%
bear with me if I Stumble a little bit
 
00:51:45.789 --> 00:51:45.799 align:start position:0%
in between Pages um so we have six
 
00:51:48.030 --> 00:51:48.040 align:start position:0%
facilities uh four of which are a 100
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
years old one is 75 years old and the
 
00:51:53.710 --> 00:51:53.720 align:start position:0%
last one the youngest is over 50 years
 
00:51:57.150 --> 00:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
old so a lot of of old facilities that
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
now are all in the historic possibility
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
realm and um we a lot of them have
 
00:52:05.829 --> 00:52:05.839 align:start position:0%
failing infrastructure they have failing
 
00:52:08.510 --> 00:52:08.520 align:start position:0%
raceways we have mended concrete to the
 
00:52:10.349 --> 00:52:10.359 align:start position:0%
point where you try to mend it and it
 
00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
crumbles continues to crumble we have
 
00:52:15.150 --> 00:52:15.160 align:start position:0%
issues with buildings we have issues
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
with roofs windows and of course
 
00:52:20.670 --> 00:52:20.680 align:start position:0%
Predator control and so um lots of
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
things going on at our facilities one of
 
00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
the biggest things that powder mil for
 
00:52:27.789 --> 00:52:27.799 align:start position:0%
example is we have major major issues
 
00:52:29.710 --> 00:52:29.720 align:start position:0%
with predation because we just have
 
00:52:31.870 --> 00:52:31.880 align:start position:0%
netting over those raceways and
 
00:52:33.789 --> 00:52:33.799 align:start position:0%
unfortunately all sorts of predators can
 
00:52:36.430 --> 00:52:36.440 align:start position:0%
get in and predators are a problem
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
because we feed fish you think there's a
 
00:52:41.670 --> 00:52:41.680 align:start position:0%
certain amount in that pool and long and
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
short they get eaten you're still
 
00:52:45.390 --> 00:52:45.400 align:start position:0%
feeding until you do the next sample and
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
all that food turns into waste so and
 
00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
part of the issue as Scott had director
 
00:52:55.390 --> 00:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
Mason had mentioned is that the um waste
 
00:52:57.349 --> 00:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
water is an issue for us we got sued at
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
Powder Mill by clf part of that
 
00:53:02.829 --> 00:53:02.839 align:start position:0%
Wastewater issue is that our phosphorus
 
00:53:06.230 --> 00:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
levels are too high and so we um long
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
and short we having issues with that
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
feed with the predation and it's not
 
00:53:13.030 --> 00:53:13.040 align:start position:0%
just poop it's actually the breakdown of
 
00:53:15.190 --> 00:53:15.200 align:start position:0%
the food as well so being able to
 
00:53:16.829 --> 00:53:16.839 align:start position:0%
control those Predators is really
 
00:53:19.910 --> 00:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
important so it's not just a failing
 
00:53:22.589 --> 00:53:22.599 align:start position:0%
infrastructure situation it's also um a
 
00:53:26.349 --> 00:53:26.359 align:start position:0%
lack of control on the covers
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
so next slide um so what we're hoping to
 
00:53:33.230 --> 00:53:33.240 align:start position:0%
do our proposed summary here is that um
 
00:53:35.430 --> 00:53:35.440 align:start position:0%
two of our facilities two of our largest
 
00:53:38.230 --> 00:53:38.240 align:start position:0%
facilities part of Mill and Berlin have
 
00:53:40.910 --> 00:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
um issues with impaired water so as we
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned the downstream of mar meeting
 
00:53:46.109 --> 00:53:46.119 align:start position:0%
the downstream of Powder Mill Hatchery
 
00:53:49.789 --> 00:53:49.799 align:start position:0%
the mar meting River has three ponded
 
00:53:52.710 --> 00:53:52.720 align:start position:0%
areas that have been deemed impaired by
 
00:53:56.069 --> 00:53:56.079 align:start position:0%
Dees and impaired as a category that um
 
00:53:58.270 --> 00:53:58.280 align:start position:0%
usually leads to elevated
 
00:54:01.549 --> 00:54:01.559 align:start position:0%
cyanobacteria and other issues that um
 
00:54:04.589 --> 00:54:04.599 align:start position:0%
our effluent is not helping of course
 
00:54:07.630 --> 00:54:07.640 align:start position:0%
and so po Mill we did a year and a half
 
00:54:10.109 --> 00:54:10.119 align:start position:0%
long feasibility study with HDR
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
engineering and in that feasibility
 
00:54:15.589 --> 00:54:15.599 align:start position:0%
study it determined that powder Mill's
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
wastewater treatment was going to cost
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
67 million dollar so much much much
 
00:54:25.789 --> 00:54:25.799 align:start position:0%
higher than our budgeted amount and so
 
00:54:27.829 --> 00:54:27.839 align:start position:0%
um that was an issue and they also
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't guarantee our EPA permited
 
00:54:34.069 --> 00:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
level of 12 parts per billion so it was
 
00:54:37.549 --> 00:54:37.559 align:start position:0%
a no possibility option for us and so
 
00:54:40.950 --> 00:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
then we were looking at an alternative
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
um so Berlin also has an impaired water
 
00:54:47.870 --> 00:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
body York Pond and at Berlin it's in the
 
00:54:51.109 --> 00:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
process of its EPA permit renewal it's
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
nip removal I mean sorry renewal and so
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
right now we're not sure where we're
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
going to be at Berlin and um so in
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
anticipation uh to be good faith we
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
actually moved some of our production
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
and changed how we do things there we
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
actually removed our brood stock and so
 
00:55:13.630 --> 00:55:13.640 align:start position:0%
now our brood stock fish which is our
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%
breeder fish so where we get our eggs
 
00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
how it worked is in New Hampton we have
 
00:55:21.349 --> 00:55:21.359 align:start position:0%
brown and brook trout eggs we have
 
00:55:23.430 --> 00:55:23.440 align:start position:0%
breeders that breed and we take those
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
eggs on station within station
 
00:55:27.829 --> 00:55:27.839 align:start position:0%
and then Berlin covered the North
 
00:55:29.870 --> 00:55:29.880 align:start position:0%
Country for brook trout and so what we
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
did was take those breeders away we
 
00:55:33.470 --> 00:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
actually stocked them out it was a nice
 
00:55:36.510 --> 00:55:36.520 align:start position:0%
fall this year um but stocked them out
 
00:55:39.309 --> 00:55:39.319 align:start position:0%
and then moved fish that were actually
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
discharging into York Pond move those
 
00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:44.200 align:start position:0%
fish out of those raceways and put them
 
00:55:46.150 --> 00:55:46.160 align:start position:0%
down where the Breeders were so right
 
00:55:48.589 --> 00:55:48.599 align:start position:0%
now in good faith we took those fish so
 
00:55:52.589 --> 00:55:52.599 align:start position:0%
there's no affluent going into York Pond
 
00:55:55.069 --> 00:55:55.079 align:start position:0%
from our fish and so those raceways are
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
empty and then also you'll see here that
 
00:56:01.750 --> 00:56:01.760 align:start position:0%
um we reduced the proposed poundage our
 
00:56:05.390 --> 00:56:05.400 align:start position:0%
Productions by 10,000 and that was just
 
00:56:08.109 --> 00:56:08.119 align:start position:0%
a a potential guess we're anticipating
 
00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
that we're going to have a limit right
 
00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:13.480 align:start position:0%
now we do not um but we're anticipating
 
00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:15.400 align:start position:0%
that we're going to in the other parts
 
00:56:18.270 --> 00:56:18.280 align:start position:0%
of the Hatchery so we were just again
 
00:56:20.829 --> 00:56:20.839 align:start position:0%
just trying in good faith to see what we
 
00:56:23.950 --> 00:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
could do so that's Berlin um again
 
00:56:25.789 --> 00:56:25.799 align:start position:0%
unknown on What's happen happening uh
 
00:56:27.309 --> 00:56:27.319 align:start position:0%
the other thing I failed to mention with
 
00:56:29.349 --> 00:56:29.359 align:start position:0%
powder mill is that it's actually a year
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
ahead of arpa um the Gopher funding and
 
00:56:36.190 --> 00:56:36.200 align:start position:0%
so in 2025 we have to remain compliant
 
00:56:39.069 --> 00:56:39.079 align:start position:0%
with that and so what we've decided to
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
do since we can't afford the wastewater
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
treatment um is actually reduce our
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
production down to 30% and so that or
 
00:56:49.230 --> 00:56:49.240 align:start position:0%
roughly 30% so that's the
 
00:56:52.349 --> 00:56:52.359 align:start position:0%
30,000 so we can maintain that facility
 
00:56:55.549 --> 00:56:55.559 align:start position:0%
open in the consent decree clf and EPA
 
00:56:58.069 --> 00:56:58.079 align:start position:0%
have agreed to those conditions as well
 
00:56:59.750 --> 00:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
so we don't really want to close it
 
00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
either so um that's our opportunity at
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
this point in time um to kind of save
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
some time and um obviously under the
 
00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances it's just not economically
 
00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:11.960 align:start position:0%
feasible to move forward without a
 
00:57:14.950 --> 00:57:14.960 align:start position:0%
guarantee of 12 parts per Vilan so at
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
30,000 pounds HDR in the feasibility
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
study determined that they think we can
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
meet that so um that's the issue with
 
00:57:25.910 --> 00:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
part of Mill still but um which leads us
 
00:57:28.549 --> 00:57:28.559 align:start position:0%
to New Hampton so New Hampton is our
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
centralized location M could I stop for
 
00:57:33.870 --> 00:57:33.880 align:start position:0%
one second sure could the proposed
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
pounds what pounds of what fish fish
 
00:57:39.789 --> 00:57:39.799 align:start position:0%
fish well that's what we thought but
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
before we you went on I thought I would
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
ask to make sure no thank you and please
 
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:46.039 align:start position:0%
do because I you know this is my brain
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
so if something seems weird definitely
 
00:57:50.870 --> 00:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask okay thanks my world is
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
probably different from yours um yes no
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you uh yes so pounds of fish
 
00:57:58.510 --> 00:57:58.520 align:start position:0%
that's all species brck Browns rainbows
 
00:58:00.990 --> 00:58:01.000 align:start position:0%
Etc that's our stocked out fish poundage
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
that we need to maintain to reach our
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
Targets in respective water bodies um so
 
00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:07.549 align:start position:0%
Targets in respective water bodies um so
New

00:58:07.549 --> 00:58:07.559 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:58:11.150 --> 00:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
Hampton centralized location um right
 
00:58:13.549 --> 00:58:13.559 align:start position:0%
now justes is under the general permit
 
00:58:15.190 --> 00:58:15.200 align:start position:0%
uh those permits just got renewed in
 
00:58:16.950 --> 00:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
October so we don't have an issue of
 
00:58:20.789 --> 00:58:20.799 align:start position:0%
having to renew anything um and it has
 
00:58:24.029 --> 00:58:24.039 align:start position:0%
the capacity it has the space to be able
 
00:58:27.309 --> 00:58:27.319 align:start position:0%
to have a facility constructed that can
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
produce 150,000 PBS and what we'd like
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
to do um as you can note here with the
 
00:58:34.990 --> 00:58:35.000 align:start position:0%
math that we're still going to be short
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
even with this new facility but in
 
00:58:40.270 --> 00:58:40.280 align:start position:0%
future phases we're constructing this
 
00:58:43.029 --> 00:58:43.039 align:start position:0%
facility to be able to expand to up to
 
00:58:45.750 --> 00:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
250,000 pounds which would of course put
 
00:58:48.270 --> 00:58:48.280 align:start position:0%
us in a very good place as far as
 
00:58:51.230 --> 00:58:51.240 align:start position:0%
production and um determining other
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
things going on at the other facilities
 
00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
in future phases so um that and also we
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
would at that point um the reason we
 
00:59:01.069 --> 00:59:01.079 align:start position:0%
couldn't go right into
 
00:59:03.710 --> 00:59:03.720 align:start position:0%
250,000 is we would be looking at and
 
00:59:06.150 --> 00:59:06.160 align:start position:0%
garnering permits and research for
 
00:59:08.750 --> 00:59:08.760 align:start position:0%
release into the pem joasa river versus
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
the dickerman brook that it currently
 
00:59:13.750 --> 00:59:13.760 align:start position:0%
goes into um and then the other
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
facilities Milford and Warren are kind
 
00:59:18.589 --> 00:59:18.599 align:start position:0%
of on hold and twin we're hoping at some
 
00:59:20.829 --> 00:59:20.839 align:start position:0%
point in a future phase um with
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
additional funding to move forward with
 
00:59:24.710 --> 00:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
a broodstock program for our rainbow
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
trout right now we bring our rainbows in
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
from out of other states and it is not
 
00:59:32.309 --> 00:59:32.319 align:start position:0%
cost effective it can be very uh
 
00:59:33.950 --> 00:59:33.960 align:start position:0%
problematic we've had issues with
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
rainbows in the past huge Statewide
 
00:59:39.470 --> 00:59:39.480 align:start position:0%
shortages because we get the secondary
 
00:59:42.309 --> 00:59:42.319 align:start position:0%
eggs the timing of the eggs is different
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
we um have had issues with FedEx
 
00:59:46.789 --> 00:59:46.799 align:start position:0%
shipping the eggs and so it's very
 
00:59:49.230 --> 00:59:49.240 align:start position:0%
costly for us to do that and so having
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
our own brood would be excellent um
 
00:59:54.789 --> 00:59:54.799 align:start position:0%
again an additional cost for future
 
00:59:57.549 --> 00:59:57.559 align:start position:0%
phases but um and powder milk I mean I'm
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
sorry and um twin is an area that
 
01:00:02.029 --> 01:00:02.039 align:start position:0%
actually has really good water quality
 
01:00:05.710 --> 01:00:05.720 align:start position:0%
it has great alkalinities for rainbow
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
trout so New Hampton our golden child at
 
01:00:12.430 --> 01:00:12.440 align:start position:0%
this point um this is our conceptual
 
01:00:14.710 --> 01:00:14.720 align:start position:0%
design uh right now it's three
 
01:00:17.109 --> 01:00:17.119 align:start position:0%
additional buildings we would demolish
 
01:00:20.069 --> 01:00:20.079 align:start position:0%
what was there on site now and we would
 
01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.039 align:start position:0%
have a hatchery building that would be
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
completely enclosed and um running on
 
01:00:28.150 --> 01:00:28.160 align:start position:0%
New running on freshwater and then the
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
intermediate rearing and growout
 
01:00:32.069 --> 01:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
buildings would be what are called Raz
 
01:00:35.470 --> 01:00:35.480 align:start position:0%
systems so it's recirculating
 
01:00:37.870 --> 01:00:37.880 align:start position:0%
aquaculture and but those two buildings
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
would actually be um the middle one is
 
01:00:42.670 --> 01:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
sort of a pavilion style and then the
 
01:00:45.230 --> 01:00:45.240 align:start position:0%
growout building will be covered with um
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
a fabric material and so that would help
 
01:00:51.270 --> 01:00:51.280 align:start position:0%
us with of course the predation control
 
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
and it would also help us with um
 
01:00:55.109 --> 01:00:55.119 align:start position:0%
outside source
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh contaminants that can happen so with
 
01:01:01.069 --> 01:01:01.079 align:start position:0%
that um it enables us to control
 
01:01:03.029 --> 01:01:03.039 align:start position:0%
bacteria and other things that we
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
currently don't have the capacity to do
 
01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
right now um so next slide we'll talk
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
about Raz um so the Raz facility is much
 
01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
much much more efficient it's exactly
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
what it says recirculating aquaculture
 
01:01:20.750 --> 01:01:20.760 align:start position:0%
meaning that it uses 95% of the water
 
01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
you can have different rad systems 75%
 
01:01:27.230 --> 01:01:27.240 align:start position:0%
90% 95 what they're talking about for us
 
01:01:31.430 --> 01:01:31.440 align:start position:0%
here is 95% recirculating and so it
 
01:01:34.349 --> 01:01:34.359 align:start position:0%
basically is starts in your influent
 
01:01:36.750 --> 01:01:36.760 align:start position:0%
building it then goes through a whole
 
01:01:39.870 --> 01:01:39.880 align:start position:0%
bunch of filtration it allows us to have
 
01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:42.960 align:start position:0%
much better control on a ton of ton of
 
01:01:45.270 --> 01:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
issues so your predation is obviously
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
not an issue it's covered your um
 
01:01:50.549 --> 01:01:50.559 align:start position:0%
bacteria that you have we can treat with
 
01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
UV light uh so that's a whole system
 
01:01:55.510 --> 01:01:55.520 align:start position:0%
that's Incorporated ated into this you
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
can manipulate your temperatures for
 
01:02:00.789 --> 01:02:00.799 align:start position:0%
growth and you can control growth so if
 
01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
you need it to be a little bit warmer
 
01:02:04.109 --> 01:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
faster growth you can increase temps if
 
01:02:05.910 --> 01:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
you need to slow things down you can do
 
01:02:08.910 --> 01:02:08.920 align:start position:0%
that as well um but again all helping
 
01:02:10.910 --> 01:02:10.920 align:start position:0%
with in a hatchery system it's really
 
01:02:13.549 --> 01:02:13.559 align:start position:0%
important to have uniformity so a lot of
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
people think you know in the wild
 
01:02:17.349 --> 01:02:17.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of different heterogeneity
 
01:02:19.630 --> 01:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
but here in a hatchery we want it's much
 
01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:21.680 align:start position:0%
easier to do things that are under the
 
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:23.960 align:start position:0%
same timeline and so that temperature
 
01:02:26.589 --> 01:02:26.599 align:start position:0%
enables us to do that and so some other
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
things oxygen Etc you can increase your
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
production so as I said with the
 
01:02:32.750 --> 01:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
development of this structure we're
 
01:02:36.230 --> 01:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
building it at 150,000 pounds but it has
 
01:02:38.470 --> 01:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
that capacity with increased oxygen and
 
01:02:41.870 --> 01:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.150 --> 01:02:45.160 align:start position:0%
higher so the next slide here's where
 
01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:48.720 align:start position:0%
the money is right um so with this
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
particular project we're doing it a
 
01:02:52.430 --> 01:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
little bit different we're doing a
 
01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:55.720 align:start position:0%
construction manager at risk and versus
 
01:02:58.710 --> 01:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
just your design bid build design bid
 
01:03:00.510 --> 01:03:00.520 align:start position:0%
and then you get your whole process for
 
01:03:02.589 --> 01:03:02.599 align:start position:0%
a manager Etc we're actually going to
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
tie that process together um it was
 
01:03:07.670 --> 01:03:07.680 align:start position:0%
actually an opportunity that DPW
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
suggested and um in this particular case
 
01:03:14.069 --> 01:03:14.079 align:start position:0%
it will work fantastically for us to
 
01:03:15.589 --> 01:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
obviously meet the timelines that we
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
need to meet for gopher but it will also
 
01:03:20.309 --> 01:03:20.319 align:start position:0%
enable us to have the design Engineers
 
01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
working directly with that construction
 
01:03:25.510 --> 01:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
manager and so they can work out details
 
01:03:27.670 --> 01:03:27.680 align:start position:0%
of products that way we can get a much
 
01:03:29.990 --> 01:03:30.000 align:start position:0%
better idea on what the actual value
 
01:03:32.510 --> 01:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
will be what those costs are we can lock
 
01:03:34.710 --> 01:03:34.720 align:start position:0%
those costs in so it'll be a lot more
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
efficient and we can also pre-order on
 
01:03:39.870 --> 01:03:39.880 align:start position:0%
items that we know that we're going to
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
um need so that we can actually lock
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
those prices in get those items on hand
 
01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:46.400 align:start position:0%
and get that money encumbered I'm
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I'm running really tight
 
01:03:51.150 --> 01:03:51.160 align:start position:0%
here yep and leave leave a couple
 
01:03:54.309 --> 01:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
moments for questions yep sure and so um
 
01:03:56.309 --> 01:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
um that's really the basis of that it
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
just allows us to get that timeline in
 
01:04:02.630 --> 01:04:02.640 align:start position:0%
and um and I think that was yep and then
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
the last slide is just the critical
 
01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:07.240 align:start position:0%
dates that um we need to meet as far as
 
01:04:09.430 --> 01:04:09.440 align:start position:0%
the project goes and where we'll be so
 
01:04:12.750 --> 01:04:12.760 align:start position:0%
the key part for um you folks is that
 
01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:13.720 align:start position:0%
the May
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
2024 timeline is is when we will get our
 
01:04:20.190 --> 01:04:20.200 align:start position:0%
maximum bid from our maximum price from
 
01:04:22.829 --> 01:04:22.839 align:start position:0%
the construction manager that is chosen
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
at the time and then the GNC approval
 
01:04:28.910 --> 01:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
will occur in August and then um 100%
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
design and construction at the beginning
 
01:04:34.589 --> 01:04:34.599 align:start position:0%
of 2025 and then completion in 2026
 
01:04:36.910 --> 01:04:36.920 align:start position:0%
thank you I sincerely appreciate that
 
01:04:40.349 --> 01:04:40.359 align:start position:0%
update of questions from the committee
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
thank you absolutely
 
01:04:49.029 --> 01:04:49.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:51.910 --> 01:04:51.920 align:start position:0%
you we haven't determined that yet right
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
we will have um in order it's not just
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
abil raise effici ability to get
 
01:05:11.950 --> 01:05:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.029 align:start position:0%
 
minimum

01:05:14.029 --> 01:05:14.039 align:start position:0%
minimum
 
01:05:17.470 --> 01:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
end once the project built um there may
 
01:05:18.990 --> 01:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
be some discussion on whether we
 
01:05:21.150 --> 01:05:21.160 align:start position:0%
increase the number of fish we ra or
 
01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:24.760 align:start position:0%
whether we close Main
 
01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:25.549 align:start position:0%
whether we close Main
thank

01:05:25.549 --> 01:05:25.559 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:05:27.829 --> 01:05:27.839 align:start position:0%
you m Shay do you have anything else
 
01:05:29.910 --> 01:05:29.920 align:start position:0%
before setting a date for our next
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
meeting so um I'd like to propose so we
 
01:05:37.150 --> 01:05:37.160 align:start position:0%
have for planning purposes uh April 5th
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
is our next meeting and we can adjust
 
01:05:41.510 --> 01:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
that depending on what uh and it would
 
01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:44.559 align:start position:0%
be nine o'clock again for Capital
 
01:05:48.589 --> 01:05:48.599 align:start position:0%
project and um long range for 10 o'clock
 
01:05:50.990 --> 01:05:51.000 align:start position:0%
we'll bring that up at the next meeting
 
01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:51.910 align:start position:0%
we'll bring that up at the next meeting
all

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
right with that uh is there any any
 
01:05:56.589 --> 01:05:56.599 align:start position:0%
questions of the
 
01:05:56.599 --> 01:05:58.150 align:start position:0%
questions of the
committee

01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:06:01.549 --> 01:06:01.559 align:start position:0%
Senator Mr cheber the costs of all of
 
01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
these projects are these going to be
 
01:06:06.750 --> 01:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
Capital expenditures that will occur in
 
01:06:08.510 --> 01:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
the next capital
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
budget for hatcheries I I I believe
 
01:06:13.470 --> 01:06:13.480 align:start position:0%
you're correct in your assumption we had
 
01:06:15.029 --> 01:06:15.039 align:start position:0%
we had appropriate a certain amount you
 
01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
speaking of the hatcheries yes
 
01:06:20.390 --> 01:06:20.400 align:start position:0%
yes that's Mr chair yes the hatcheries
 
01:06:24.549 --> 01:06:24.559 align:start position:0%
were provided 50 50 or 55 million of
 
01:06:26.710 --> 01:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
arpa funds so that's part of the reason
 
01:06:28.309 --> 01:06:28.319 align:start position:0%
for the time frame that she was talking
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
about as well as there was an
 
01:06:33.470 --> 01:06:33.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation for Powder Mill of $4.6
 
01:06:36.230 --> 01:06:36.240 align:start position:0%
million in the two Capital budgets ago
 
01:06:38.190 --> 01:06:38.200 align:start position:0%
the most recent capital budget um
 
01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:40.640 align:start position:0%
expanded the scope of that so they had
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
to apply those funds towards Powder Mill
 
01:06:44.589 --> 01:06:44.599 align:start position:0%
and if there was anything left over they
 
01:06:45.910 --> 01:06:45.920 align:start position:0%
could use it towards the rest of the
 
01:06:48.230 --> 01:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
Statewide project so that you shouldn't
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
see too much going forward okay good
 
01:06:53.510 --> 01:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Chris thank you Mr
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
um further questions motion to adjourn
 
01:06:58.430 --> 01:06:58.440 align:start position:0%
all those in favor signify by saying I I
 
01:06:58.440 --> 01:06:59.230 align:start position:0%
all those in favor signify by saying I I
thank

01:06:59.230 --> 01:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:07:02.069 --> 01:07:02.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you uh for
 
01:07:04.589 --> 01:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
weathering to be here I really
 
01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:08.319 align:start position:0%
appreciate it yeah we'll go slow this
 
01:07:11.230 --> 01:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
time okay all right we will uh we will
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
