representative Cahill representative
 
00:17:12.169 --> 00:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
power would you like to speak thank you
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman House Bill 95 enables
 
00:17:17.809 --> 00:17:17.819 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt bylaws to be
 
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:20.220 align:start position:0%
able to regulate the notice required
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
prior to any rent increases on
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
Residential Properties and also to
 
00:17:31.970 --> 00:17:31.980 align:start position:0%
regulate the allowable rental increases
 
00:17:31.980 --> 00:17:33.130 align:start position:0%
regulate the allowable rental increases
um

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:33.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:37.190 --> 00:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
we heard in testimony on this bill
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
um from several people that such a bill
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
if it were signed into a law would be
 
00:17:46.490 --> 00:17:46.500 align:start position:0%
akin to rent control and we have seen in
 
00:17:48.350 --> 00:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
other municipalities across the country
 
00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
that rent control is a failed concept
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
for example we heard in testimony that
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
in 1994 Massachusetts repealed their
 
00:18:00.710 --> 00:18:00.720 align:start position:0%
rent control additionally presently
 
00:18:03.409 --> 00:18:03.419 align:start position:0%
municipalities do have the ability to
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
work with developers to build the
 
00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
housing that's needed in their
 
00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.950 align:start position:0%
housing that's needed in their
municipalities

00:18:08.950 --> 00:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
and last year we had a bill
 
00:18:18.770 --> 00:18:18.780 align:start position:0%
2022 Senate Bill 400 that that um
 
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
makes Provisions
 
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.409 align:start position:0%
makes Provisions
um

00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:24.909 --> 00:18:24.919 align:start position:0%
in that legis that bill that became law
 
00:18:27.529 --> 00:18:27.539 align:start position:0%
to address the housing needs in our
 
00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.510 align:start position:0%
to address the housing needs in our
state

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
additionally we're heard during the
 
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
hearing that Senate Bill 47 established
 
00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
a commission to review affordability and
 
00:18:40.870 --> 00:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
the inventory of housing in our state
 
00:18:45.289 --> 00:18:45.299 align:start position:0%
it may be prudent to wait to get to to
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
see the results of that Commission
 
00:18:51.950 --> 00:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
um we also heard in in during the
 
00:18:53.990 --> 00:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
hearing that this bill would would in
 
00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:57.480 align:start position:0%
fact hurt landlords who provide housing
 
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
for people in our state
 
00:19:03.529 --> 00:19:03.539 align:start position:0%
um by essentially regulating their
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
incomes and their ability to
 
00:19:08.990 --> 00:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
um be landlords and to be able to
 
00:19:13.669 --> 00:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
provide housing stock and lastly I I
 
00:19:19.549 --> 00:19:19.559 align:start position:0%
might add that it was also we heard
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
in the hearing in testimony that it's a
 
00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:27.780 align:start position:0%
supply and demand issue and that perhaps
 
00:19:30.529 --> 00:19:30.539 align:start position:0%
a better place to look would be at the
 
00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:33.360 align:start position:0%
zoning side of this issue
 
00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
so for those reasons
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
um I will be voting in expedient to
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you representative any
 
00:19:42.049 --> 00:19:42.059 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
 
00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:44.090 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative
Gallagher

00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:19:49.970 --> 00:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
I as a co-sponsor of this legislation
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
I support this legislation it's enabling
 
00:19:55.730 --> 00:19:55.740 align:start position:0%
legislation which
 
00:19:58.610 --> 00:19:58.620 align:start position:0%
means that municipalities can choose
 
00:20:02.330 --> 00:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
whether they want to adopt it or not so
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't make sense for communities
 
00:20:08.570 --> 00:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
then let me probably won't adopt it and
 
00:20:10.789 --> 00:20:10.799 align:start position:0%
there will be no harm done but
 
00:20:12.770 --> 00:20:12.780 align:start position:0%
if it does make sense then they can
 
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
adopt in there are many places where it
 
00:20:16.610 --> 00:20:16.620 align:start position:0%
is in fact
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh needed as for the case of
 
00:20:24.650 --> 00:20:24.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts being brought up
 
00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
um yes they did repeal their rent
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
control and
 
00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:31.610 align:start position:0%
control and
um

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.950 align:start position:0%
um
but

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:32.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:35.100 align:start position:0%
they're actually
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
considering bringing it back now and
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
that debate is still ongoing because so
 
00:20:44.150 --> 00:20:44.160 align:start position:0%
far repealing their rent control has
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
led to rents going up too much and now
 
00:20:49.370 --> 00:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
they need it back
 
00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:50.150 align:start position:0%
they need it back
um

00:20:50.150 --> 00:20:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:51.950 align:start position:0%
um
S4

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
S4
 
00:20:55.610 --> 00:20:55.620 align:start position:0%
the part about landlords I I think it's
 
00:20:58.850 --> 00:20:58.860 align:start position:0%
a mistake to consider them
 
00:21:02.090 --> 00:21:02.100 align:start position:0%
housing providers I think a more
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
accurate term would be housing deniers
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
because the landlords
 
00:21:09.770 --> 00:21:09.780 align:start position:0%
landlords hoard housing and then deny it
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
to anyone who can't pay the rent to them
 
00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:15.169 align:start position:0%
to anyone who can't pay the rent to them
so

00:21:15.169 --> 00:21:15.179 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:17.950 --> 00:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
we need
 
00:21:19.730 --> 00:21:19.740 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:21.900 align:start position:0%
instead of putting landlords concerns
 
00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
first we should be putting tenants
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
concerns first
 
00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:27.299 align:start position:0%
and tenants
 
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:30.380 align:start position:0%
need to have rent that's payable
 
00:21:34.070 --> 00:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
landlords should not be making money off
 
00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:35.090 align:start position:0%
landlords should not be making money off
of

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:37.789 --> 00:21:37.799 align:start position:0%
other people's basic need for housing
 
00:21:40.490 --> 00:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
that's just immoral
 
00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.470 align:start position:0%
that's just immoral
um so

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
it's for those reasons that
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
I support
 
00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.990 --> 00:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Gallagher
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
representative priests
 
00:21:57.590 --> 00:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm also
 
00:22:03.049 --> 00:22:03.059 align:start position:0%
um in favor of this spill and I come
 
00:22:07.190 --> 00:22:07.200 align:start position:0%
from District 17 or Ward 2 in the city
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
of Manchester where half of the housing
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
in my district is Apartments
 
00:22:18.890 --> 00:22:18.900 align:start position:0%
and I saw firsthand in the last three
 
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:20.049 align:start position:0%
and I saw firsthand in the last three
years

00:22:20.049 --> 00:22:20.059 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:24.049 --> 00:22:24.059 align:start position:0%
of massive evictions by predatory
 
00:22:27.049 --> 00:22:27.059 align:start position:0%
landlords in my area
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
and as you know in that in this housing
 
00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:32.400 align:start position:0%
market there isn't
 
00:22:35.510 --> 00:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings available for these
 
00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.649 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings available for these
people

00:22:36.649 --> 00:22:36.659 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:40.020 align:start position:0%
and I know one case when I when I was
 
00:22:41.409 --> 00:22:41.419 align:start position:0%
out um
 
00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
with the election campaign and Jordan
 
00:22:47.570 --> 00:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
knocking I met a man who lived in these
 
00:22:52.130 --> 00:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
apartments for 17 years he was a veteran
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
he was 77 years old and they basically
 
00:22:59.090 --> 00:22:59.100 align:start position:0%
increased his rent by a hundred and
 
00:23:00.710 --> 00:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
fifty percent
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
he was not able to do that and he was
 
00:23:06.350 --> 00:23:06.360 align:start position:0%
evicted from this home that he had his
 
00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:07.669 align:start position:0%
evicted from this home that he had his
established

00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
established
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
for 17 years
 
00:23:15.169 --> 00:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
I agree with Mr Gallagher I think this
 
00:23:18.049 --> 00:23:18.059 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about a segment of our
 
00:23:21.649 --> 00:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
population of our Workforce that cannot
 
00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:26.039 align:start position:0%
afford to buy housing they have to rent
 
00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
housing and we need a mechanism
 
00:23:31.690 --> 00:23:31.700 align:start position:0%
four communities
 
00:23:35.930 --> 00:23:35.940 align:start position:0%
to address this issue and because it's
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
not being addressed they have no place
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
to go right now to address their
 
00:23:44.149 --> 00:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
concerns and their problems
 
00:23:47.210 --> 00:23:47.220 align:start position:0%
and again this legislation is not
 
00:23:51.370 --> 00:23:51.380 align:start position:0%
setting rental prices it's not dictating
 
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:53.700 align:start position:0%
landlords what to do
 
00:23:56.930 --> 00:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
it's basically enabling communities like
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester if they choose to
 
00:24:04.310 --> 00:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
do so to enact a rental board to address
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
these issues
 
00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.149 align:start position:0%
these issues
um

00:24:08.149 --> 00:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:24:12.230 --> 00:24:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:24:14.810 --> 00:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
Russ Davis
 
00:24:17.090 --> 00:24:17.100 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:24:19.970 --> 00:24:19.980 align:start position:0%
um I do not support this bill
 
00:24:22.730 --> 00:24:22.740 align:start position:0%
but the reasons for my not supporting it
 
00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:23.930 align:start position:0%
but the reasons for my not supporting it
are

00:24:23.930 --> 00:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:26.340 align:start position:0%
are different from what the vice chair
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
articulated I think that this is a
 
00:24:32.930 --> 00:24:32.940 align:start position:0%
conversation that we as a state and as a
 
00:24:36.409 --> 00:24:36.419 align:start position:0%
society badly need to have I am the
 
00:24:38.210 --> 00:24:38.220 align:start position:0%
senior member on the planning board in
 
00:24:42.529 --> 00:24:42.539 align:start position:0%
Lebanon New Hampshire which is a city of
 
00:24:45.649 --> 00:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
approximately fifteen thousand people we
 
00:24:45.659 --> 00:24:46.549 align:start position:0%
approximately fifteen thousand people we
have

00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
on average five or six developers coming
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
before our planning board at every
 
00:24:53.039 --> 00:24:54.250 align:start position:0%
before our planning board at every
meeting

00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:54.260 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:57.020 align:start position:0%
proposing Apartments
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
450 units 500 units 200 units and they
 
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
all want to take advantage of the the
 
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:06.840 align:start position:0%
state law that allows them a tax
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
exemption or a tax stabilization for
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
providing a certain percentage of
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
affordable units but that state that tax
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
stabilization goes away and after it
 
00:25:21.529 --> 00:25:21.539 align:start position:0%
goes away those rents shoot up and they
 
00:25:24.169 --> 00:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
shoot up far beyond market value and the
 
00:25:26.390 --> 00:25:26.400 align:start position:0%
people who could previously have
 
00:25:29.630 --> 00:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
afforded to live in them are evicted I
 
00:25:32.390 --> 00:25:32.400 align:start position:0%
have a friend who's 82 years old she
 
00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
lives by herself she has lived in a
 
00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
one-bedroom apartment for 13 years her
 
00:25:42.409 --> 00:25:42.419 align:start position:0%
rent was just increased by 60 percent
 
00:25:45.049 --> 00:25:45.059 align:start position:0%
and she now has to go out in the dead of
 
00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
winter by herself looking for another
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
place to live in Lebanon which is well
 
00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:52.620 align:start position:0%
my impossible so I do not support this
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
bill because I believe it is to blunt an
 
00:25:56.810 --> 00:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
instrument and I believe that this
 
00:25:59.570 --> 00:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
conversation needs to be carried forward
 
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
perhaps in a in a series of of meetings
 
00:26:06.470 --> 00:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
between our committee and the special
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
committee on housing I don't want to let
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
this issue go but I do not support this
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
bill in its current form thank you
 
00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:19.380 align:start position:0%
yeah representative
 
00:26:21.370 --> 00:26:21.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:24.769 --> 00:26:24.779 align:start position:0%
I am in support of the bill partly
 
00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
because of the need for housing and it's
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
a crisis and one of the uh testifying
 
00:26:33.769 --> 00:26:33.779 align:start position:0%
person was from legal assistance for
 
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
housing attorney I come from Nashua
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
which has
 
00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a city of 90 000 people
 
00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:42.950 align:start position:0%
um you know it's a city of 90 000 people
and

00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:48.130 --> 00:26:48.140 align:start position:0%
a lucky I mean homelessness or houseless
 
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:50.700 align:start position:0%
individuals we are trying to provide
 
00:26:53.690 --> 00:26:53.700 align:start position:0%
shelter temporary sheltered transitional
 
00:26:56.090 --> 00:26:56.100 align:start position:0%
homes and stuff how do we transition
 
00:26:59.810 --> 00:26:59.820 align:start position:0%
them out of that place so I understand
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
this is not an answer to all the
 
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:05.210 align:start position:0%
this is not an answer to all the
um

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
salute it's not the only solution for
 
00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
the problem we face in the state and in
 
00:27:15.010 --> 00:27:15.020 align:start position:0%
cities and communities of homeless
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
houseless individuals in it it's not a
 
00:27:23.210 --> 00:27:23.220 align:start position:0%
crime being houseless or being poor is
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
not a crime so we can't treat it that
 
00:27:29.570 --> 00:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
way so at least this creates the
 
00:27:33.110 --> 00:27:33.120 align:start position:0%
conversation so at least we can address
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
it I totally agree with my colleague
 
00:27:39.350 --> 00:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
representative stavis about save us
 
00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:40.740 align:start position:0%
about uh
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
continuing the dialogue work from all
 
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
angles and with that spirit I will be
 
00:27:52.669 --> 00:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:54.240 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative
 
00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:55.850 align:start position:0%
for the discussion representative
Gallagher

00:27:55.850 --> 00:27:55.860 align:start position:0%
Gallagher
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
um so just to follow up on what
 
00:28:02.269 --> 00:28:02.279 align:start position:0%
representative mangaputi said um yeah I
 
00:28:07.250 --> 00:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
agree with her that being unhoused is
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
not a crime on the part of the person
 
00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:14.960 align:start position:0%
who is unhoused I would argue though
 
00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
that it's a crime on the part of society
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
for failing to house them and if not a
 
00:28:25.190 --> 00:28:25.200 align:start position:0%
legal crime at least it's a moral
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
the moral of equivalent of a crime and I
 
00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:31.140 align:start position:0%
I agree with her that we shouldn't be
 
00:28:33.169 --> 00:28:33.179 align:start position:0%
criminalized criminalizing homelessness
 
00:28:35.810 --> 00:28:35.820 align:start position:0%
but instead be criminalizing the people
 
00:28:39.110 --> 00:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
who refuse to provide housing for those
 
00:28:43.510 --> 00:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.830 --> 00:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Holland
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
so um I understand uh the the concern
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
particularly right now in my district uh
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
the vacancy rate in apartments is less
 
00:28:57.590 --> 00:28:57.600 align:start position:0%
than half a percent and in a healthy
 
00:29:00.010 --> 00:29:00.020 align:start position:0%
Market it's about five percent and so
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
the need to build more units is really
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
Paramount and I while I understand the
 
00:29:08.450 --> 00:29:08.460 align:start position:0%
concern and it was really compelling as
 
00:29:10.730 --> 00:29:10.740 align:start position:0%
we've heard about people whose rent has
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
increased I don't think you can control
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
the rent if you have such a slow Supply
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
if we had reached the five percent
 
00:29:20.810 --> 00:29:20.820 align:start position:0%
healthy Market I could understand and
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
and there still was these excessive rent
 
00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:26.340 align:start position:0%
increases occurring I can understand the
 
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:28.260 align:start position:0%
need then for municipalities to step in
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
and begin to regulate it but under
 
00:29:31.730 --> 00:29:31.740 align:start position:0%
current conditions I think that this
 
00:29:34.010 --> 00:29:34.020 align:start position:0%
will be counter to us developing the
 
00:29:36.049 --> 00:29:36.059 align:start position:0%
housing stock that we need to get to
 
00:29:38.269 --> 00:29:38.279 align:start position:0%
that point so as a result I'm going to
 
00:29:41.470 --> 00:29:41.480 align:start position:0%
vote in Expedia to legislate
 
00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:44.100 align:start position:0%
thank you representative uh
 
00:29:45.649 --> 00:29:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative Hicks
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair I um agree with my
 
00:29:51.710 --> 00:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
colleagues Representatives Davis and
 
00:29:53.330 --> 00:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
representative Howland that this is not
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
the ants answer and actually has a
 
00:29:58.190 --> 00:29:58.200 align:start position:0%
potential to prevent uh future Supply
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
which will exacerbate the problem of
 
00:30:06.370 --> 00:30:06.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.510 --> 00:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:30:13.490 --> 00:30:13.500 align:start position:0%
so in response to the issue of Supply I
 
00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
do agree that Supply is an issue
 
00:30:20.630 --> 00:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
but we have other bills that will help
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
increase Supply and I think we should
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
pass those as well and if we pass those
 
00:30:30.230 --> 00:30:30.240 align:start position:0%
as well then any Supply concerns about
 
00:30:33.409 --> 00:30:33.419 align:start position:0%
this bill will be negated
 
00:30:35.769 --> 00:30:35.779 align:start position:0%
which will just leave the positive
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
effects of giving security to
 
00:30:39.779 --> 00:30:41.210 align:start position:0%
effects of giving security to
renters

00:30:41.210 --> 00:30:41.220 align:start position:0%

representative Gilman yes uh this bill
 
00:34:16.669 --> 00:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
while well-intentioned leaves a lot to
 
00:34:19.970 --> 00:34:19.980 align:start position:0%
leaves a lot of questions one for the
 
00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:22.080 align:start position:0%
registry there is no mechanism no
 
00:34:24.409 --> 00:34:24.419 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to start this new kind of
 
00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:25.490 align:start position:0%
infrastructure to start this new kind of
registry

00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
registry
 
00:34:28.849 --> 00:34:28.859 align:start position:0%
uh two we don't know what kind of units
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
or how though there's no breakdown of uh
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
whether it's seasonal rinsing uh
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
short-term renting uh uh how many units
 
00:34:40.450 --> 00:34:40.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:34:44.570 --> 00:34:44.580 align:start position:0%
Let's see we don't know what happens
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
with a unit that has Services provided
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
such as heat and hot water or
 
00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.210 align:start position:0%
such as heat and hot water or
electricity

00:34:50.210 --> 00:34:50.220 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
00:34:54.290 --> 00:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
there's no way to enforce it
 
00:34:57.170 --> 00:34:57.180 align:start position:0%
and uh and there's no there's no
 
00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339 align:start position:0%
breakdown no columns for the different
 
00:35:01.010 --> 00:35:01.020 align:start position:0%
information that we need I feel that
 
00:35:03.410 --> 00:35:03.420 align:start position:0%
this is not ready in the registry of
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
deeds was against it because they don't
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
have the infrastructure to complete it
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:22.020 align:start position:0%
do we have a second
 
00:39:25.069 --> 00:39:25.079 align:start position:0%

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:27.410 align:start position:0%
speak to my motion representative go
ahead

00:39:27.410 --> 00:39:27.420 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
um I I think that the intent of this
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
bill is positive
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
and it would be a good thing a very good
 
00:39:37.490 --> 00:39:37.500 align:start position:0%
thing and would Advance the cause of
 
00:39:40.010 --> 00:39:40.020 align:start position:0%
transparency in government across our
 
00:39:43.550 --> 00:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
state for all town councils and other
 
00:39:45.230 --> 00:39:45.240 align:start position:0%
and school boards and other public
 
00:39:47.150 --> 00:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
bodies to have
 
00:39:50.329 --> 00:39:50.339 align:start position:0%
live streaming or Video available for
 
00:39:52.490 --> 00:39:52.500 align:start position:0%
their meeting processes and I see that
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
we we also have an amendment that just
 
00:39:55.790 --> 00:39:55.800 align:start position:0%
came in today
 
00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359 align:start position:0%
which um which adds in addition to
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
school boards and budget committees
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
um public body meetings and hearings
 
00:40:07.790 --> 00:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
which is which is a vast Improvement on
 
00:40:10.069 --> 00:40:10.079 align:start position:0%
the original bill because it include it
 
00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's a catchment for all public bodies
 
00:40:15.170 --> 00:40:15.180 align:start position:0%
so increases transparency
 
00:40:18.970 --> 00:40:18.980 align:start position:0%
I do have some concerns though about
 
00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:21.780 align:start position:0%
what my colleague representative power
 
00:40:24.829 --> 00:40:24.839 align:start position:0%
described as an unfunded mandates
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony from people in towns
 
00:40:30.589 --> 00:40:30.599 align:start position:0%
that do not have the kind of broadband
 
00:40:33.109 --> 00:40:33.119 align:start position:0%
access that this legislation would
 
00:40:35.870 --> 00:40:35.880 align:start position:0%
require them to install to purchase and
 
00:40:39.950 --> 00:40:39.960 align:start position:0%
install and maintain an update uh and
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
and so I'm concerned about those towns
 
00:40:45.290 --> 00:40:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned about in effect
 
00:40:48.290 --> 00:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
levying a burden a cost burden on them
 
00:40:52.250 --> 00:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
they may not be able to sustain
 
00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
but I think because the intent of the
 
00:40:58.010 --> 00:40:58.020 align:start position:0%
bill is a positive intent could yield
 
00:41:00.530 --> 00:41:00.540 align:start position:0%
very beneficial results for New
 
00:41:02.990 --> 00:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens I would like to
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
retain the bill work on it further with
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
the sponsor and with others and and make
 
00:41:11.690 --> 00:41:11.700 align:start position:0%
it ready for passage thank you thank you
 
00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:13.380 align:start position:0%
representative for the discussion
 
00:41:15.290 --> 00:41:15.300 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I would like to
 
00:41:19.310 --> 00:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
Echo some of the points that my
 
00:41:22.550 --> 00:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
colleague just made and to re reiterate
 
00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:25.500 align:start position:0%
the point that as the bill is is written
 
00:41:28.190 --> 00:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
as written it does violate the New
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution part one article
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
28a as an unfunded mandate
 
00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:35.450 align:start position:0%
28a as an unfunded mandate
um

00:41:35.450 --> 00:41:35.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:39.349 --> 00:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
yes many towns do not have Broadband
 
00:41:42.890 --> 00:41:42.900 align:start position:0%
capabilities of at this time and such a
 
00:41:45.410 --> 00:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
bill if it were to become law would
 
00:41:48.290 --> 00:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
require equipment purchases to be made
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
by municipalities
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
so um The Spill is is is not ready at
 
00:41:57.530 --> 00:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
Manchester thank you Mr chair I do
 
00:42:04.190 --> 00:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
um I do agree with both of my colleagues
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
who made the comment about it it is a
 
00:42:10.849 --> 00:42:10.859 align:start position:0%
good intention it will open up the
 
00:42:14.530 --> 00:42:14.540 align:start position:0%
public I mean democracy or the public uh
 
00:42:18.770 --> 00:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
debate and participation but it's one
 
00:42:22.970 --> 00:42:22.980 align:start position:0%
way in terms of it's a passive observing
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
and there's no way uh in a town
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
town meeting where the voters come and
 
00:42:33.609 --> 00:42:33.619 align:start position:0%
vote there's no way of voting back
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
electronically they can participate by
 
00:42:39.950 --> 00:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
watching it or public testimony but not
 
00:42:46.130 --> 00:42:46.140 align:start position:0%
because that's not available uh in our
 
00:42:49.849 --> 00:42:49.859 align:start position:0%
uh like with the Odyssey 91 which would
 
00:42:54.010 --> 00:42:54.020 align:start position:0%
allow for electronic or virtual
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
participation that's not in existence
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
right now so this is a good bill needs
 
00:43:03.050 --> 00:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
work and I would fully support the
 
00:43:05.930 --> 00:43:05.940 align:start position:0%
retaining of it and work on it to
 
00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:08.520 align:start position:0%
increase the participation
 
00:43:11.450 --> 00:43:11.460 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative ukella
 
00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you um I kind of wish that this
 
00:43:17.390 --> 00:43:17.400 align:start position:0%
motion was made after a discussing of
 
00:43:20.270 --> 00:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
the amendment to understand why
 
00:43:22.849 --> 00:43:22.859 align:start position:0%
um the amendment doesn't doesn't reach
 
00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
the concerns of of the people since it
 
00:43:28.569 --> 00:43:28.579 align:start position:0%
hasn't been uh
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
proposed then we can't really discuss
 
00:43:33.890 --> 00:43:33.900 align:start position:0%
the merits and demerits of the uh
 
00:43:36.109 --> 00:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I think
 
00:43:36.119 --> 00:43:36.730 align:start position:0%
Amendment and I think
um

00:43:36.730 --> 00:43:36.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
that is kind of I think that this motion
 
00:43:43.550 --> 00:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
is kind of premature so thank you
 
00:43:46.270 --> 00:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Hicks
 
00:43:50.809 --> 00:43:50.819 align:start position:0%
so seeing that thank you Mr chair um
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
if we are to retain this I think that
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
the point of increasing the visibility
 
00:43:58.970 --> 00:43:58.980 align:start position:0%
of our public meetings is is Paramount
 
00:43:58.980 --> 00:43:59.690 align:start position:0%
of our public meetings is is Paramount
um

00:43:59.690 --> 00:43:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
we need more people to see our meetings
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
we need full transparency in government
 
00:44:07.190 --> 00:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
and so whatever we can do including
 
00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:08.150 align:start position:0%
and so whatever we can do including
um

00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:10.130 --> 00:44:10.140 align:start position:0%
researching how to fund this to help our
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
smallest towns I would be in support of
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
that because I think that is only going
 
00:44:16.329 --> 00:44:16.339 align:start position:0%
to serve the people of New Hampshire
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
by allowing them to participate
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
00:44:24.470 --> 00:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative Gallagher
 
00:44:25.430 --> 00:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:44:27.710 --> 00:44:27.720 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
00:44:27.720 --> 00:44:29.150 align:start position:0%
about the um
or

00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
minor Point slash question about process
 
00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:33.770 align:start position:0%
minor Point slash question about process
so

00:44:33.770 --> 00:44:33.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
if we retain it we'll still be able to
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
pick up the amendment again after
 
00:44:48.589 --> 00:44:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:44:54.170 --> 00:44:54.180 align:start position:0%
yes okay so yeah um
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
so I I do think the amendment deserves
 
00:45:01.370 --> 00:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
consideration but um I I don't really
 
00:45:04.790 --> 00:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
see why that's an argument against
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
retaining it though since we can still
 
00:45:10.609 --> 00:45:10.619 align:start position:0%
discuss the amendment
 
00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
um after the bill comes back from
 
00:45:12.660 --> 00:45:15.230 align:start position:0%
um after the bill comes back from
retaining

00:45:15.230 --> 00:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
retaining
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:21.829 --> 00:45:21.839 align:start position:0%
seeing none well I will call the world

I'm making the motion to RTL because it
violates

00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
violates
 
00:47:04.250 --> 00:47:04.260 align:start position:0%
article one
 
00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.069 align:start position:0%
article one
28a

00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
28a
 
00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:13.730 --> 00:47:13.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:47:16.490 --> 00:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
for the discussion
 
00:47:18.710 --> 00:47:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative yukela
 
00:47:21.470 --> 00:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you um I don't believe that
 
00:47:27.849 --> 00:47:27.859 align:start position:0%
um that 91a is a violation of of uh 28a
 
00:47:31.730 --> 00:47:31.740 align:start position:0%
and this is just an extension of 91a in
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
in making things public uh you know
 
00:47:41.390 --> 00:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
I would say that actually we need to be
 
00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319 align:start position:0%
um you know open and transparent is
 
00:47:46.250 --> 00:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
another part of the uh Constitution and
 
00:47:48.770 --> 00:47:48.780 align:start position:0%
so in that sense
 
00:47:50.630 --> 00:47:50.640 align:start position:0%
um it is required by the Constitution
 
00:47:52.250 --> 00:47:52.260 align:start position:0%
that they
 
00:47:54.109 --> 00:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
um be open and transparent and we are
 
00:47:55.790 --> 00:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
just defining what open and transparent
 
00:47:58.309 --> 00:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
means so therefore
 
00:48:01.069 --> 00:48:01.079 align:start position:0%
um it is required
 
00:48:03.950 --> 00:48:03.960 align:start position:0%
um that they pay to be open and
 
00:48:07.309 --> 00:48:07.319 align:start position:0%
transparent and so it's not an unfunded
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
mandate it's required in the
 
00:48:10.910 --> 00:48:10.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution that they be that way
 
00:48:12.770 --> 00:48:12.780 align:start position:0%
so I disagree with that argument thank
 
00:48:17.690 --> 00:48:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to make one quick comment
 
00:48:20.510 --> 00:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
on this
 
00:48:20.520 --> 00:48:22.609 align:start position:0%
on this
um

00:48:22.609 --> 00:48:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:25.069 --> 00:48:25.079 align:start position:0%
while the overall intent on transparency
 
00:48:29.450 --> 00:48:29.460 align:start position:0%
I think is very good the bill itself and
 
00:48:31.849 --> 00:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
then a last minute
 
00:48:31.859 --> 00:48:33.710 align:start position:0%
then a last minute
Amendment

00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:37.020 align:start position:0%
um is not ready uh
 
00:48:40.309 --> 00:48:40.319 align:start position:0%
I my my thought would be to come back
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
next next year with something that's a
 
00:48:45.230 --> 00:48:45.240 align:start position:0%
little bit uh
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
a little bit more tight
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
um as a committee and just for future
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
references I'm not a huge fan of
 
00:48:54.670 --> 00:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
operating on the Fly representative
 
00:48:57.109 --> 00:48:57.119 align:start position:0%
yokella mentioned a last minute
 
00:48:57.119 --> 00:48:57.710 align:start position:0%
yokella mentioned a last minute
um

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment on this
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
I I know occasionally we're going to see
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
that with a few minor word changes but
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
it's best when you have a major
 
00:49:09.050 --> 00:49:09.060 align:start position:0%
amendment to try to get that to the
 
00:49:11.089 --> 00:49:11.099 align:start position:0%
committee as soon as possible so for
 
00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:13.140 align:start position:0%
those reason I do believe we should I
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
tell it I'm not opposed to more
 
00:49:17.750 --> 00:49:17.760 align:start position:0%
transparency in government obviously
 
00:49:19.790 --> 00:49:19.800 align:start position:0%
everybody wants that but this bill here
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
does not do it in the proper way thank
 
00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.470 align:start position:0%
does not do it in the proper way thank
you

00:49:24.470 --> 00:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
for the comments
 
00:49:28.790 --> 00:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
yeah no
 
00:49:30.170 --> 00:49:30.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair the only thing I
 
00:49:32.450 --> 00:49:32.460 align:start position:0%
would add which is to add to what you
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
just said I agree with everything I down
 
00:49:37.130 --> 00:49:37.140 align:start position:0%
in Northampton has has a very uh
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
vigorous and and robust uh system to
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
broadcast and I think that that should
 
00:49:43.910 --> 00:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
be I would hope that that could be in
 
00:49:46.130 --> 00:49:46.140 align:start position:0%
every town but even the amendment which
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
we just received says the bill takes
 
00:49:49.790 --> 00:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage had we
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
considered that it would have been
 
00:49:52.430 --> 00:49:52.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely impossible for any Community
 
00:49:55.250 --> 00:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
to be able to build these things in for
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
instance Northampton how to negotiate
 
00:49:58.010 --> 00:49:58.020 align:start position:0%
that through our cable franchise
 
00:50:01.010 --> 00:50:01.020 align:start position:0%
contract which took the better part of a
 
00:50:04.069 --> 00:50:04.079 align:start position:0%
year so I agree the intent a hundred
 
00:50:05.270 --> 00:50:05.280 align:start position:0%
percent it just needs a little work
 
00:50:07.609 --> 00:50:07.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:50:09.710 --> 00:50:09.720 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:50:14.089 --> 00:50:14.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:16.309 --> 00:50:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:50:16.319 --> 00:50:18.829 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
um

00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:21.589 --> 00:50:21.599 align:start position:0%
I wanted to say that online
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
um 14 where they're talking about
 
00:50:24.119 --> 00:50:25.849 align:start position:0%
um 14 where they're talking about
archives

00:50:25.849 --> 00:50:25.859 align:start position:0%
archives
 
00:50:28.130 --> 00:50:28.140 align:start position:0%
oh what are we doing
 
00:50:29.630 --> 00:50:29.640 align:start position:0%
yes we're not talking about an amendment
 
00:50:31.609 --> 00:50:31.619 align:start position:0%
we're on the we've got a motion on the
 
00:50:34.690 --> 00:50:34.700 align:start position:0%
Florida itl the bill itself
 
00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:39.180 align:start position:0%
oh very sorry very sorry misunderstood
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
representative Gallagher
 
00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
um so I think
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether the amendment was
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
made last minute or not or
 
00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I do think we at least deserve to be
 
00:50:57.890 --> 00:50:57.900 align:start position:0%
able to talk about it and have a
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
separate vote on it so I will be
 
00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:04.609 align:start position:0%
separate vote on it so I will be
opposing

00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
opposing
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
um opposing the motion to itl
 
00:51:11.089 --> 00:51:11.099 align:start position:0%
not because I think we should pass it
 
00:51:13.609 --> 00:51:13.619 align:start position:0%
but I think we should just have a chance
 
00:51:15.650 --> 00:51:15.660 align:start position:0%

Member here and so the text of the bill
 
00:54:25.370 --> 00:54:25.380 align:start position:0%
was interesting and the committee was
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
unable to ask questions of the Prime

people present to provide testimony

184. I don't know where I got that
 
00:58:50.650 --> 00:58:50.660 align:start position:0%
184. uh do I have a motion

representative Brown yes Mr chairman I'd
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
like to make a motion to itl House Bill
 
00:58:58.430 --> 00:58:58.440 align:start position:0%
184 relative to public notice
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
requirements for Zoning Board of
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
adjustment parents thank you do we have

a second the second representative L
 
00:59:05.870 --> 00:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
word seconds the motion representative
 
00:59:07.730 --> 00:59:07.740 align:start position:0%
Brown would you like to speak
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
uh yes Mr chairman uh the the issue
 
00:59:12.710 --> 00:59:12.720 align:start position:0%
really is that a lot of people in the
 
00:59:16.270 --> 00:59:16.280 align:start position:0%
state do not have access to the internet
 
00:59:20.089 --> 00:59:20.099 align:start position:0%
and we feel that it's better to post it
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
both uh online and publish it continue
 
00:59:26.510 --> 00:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
to publish it newspapers
 
00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you representative further
 
00:59:30.710 --> 00:59:30.720 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Hicks will I
 
00:59:32.990 --> 00:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
support the motion I do think that at
 
00:59:34.730 --> 00:59:34.740 align:start position:0%
some point we are going to have to
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
modernize and understand that not
 
00:59:39.530 --> 00:59:39.540 align:start position:0%
everybody else has newspapers uh and
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
there are public libraries available for
 
00:59:44.690 --> 00:59:44.700 align:start position:0%
people to visit to go on to websites uh
 
00:59:47.990 --> 00:59:48.000 align:start position:0%
probably more cheaply than it is to get
 
00:59:49.849 --> 00:59:49.859 align:start position:0%
a subscription to the newspaper
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Hicks
 
01:00:05.410 --> 01:00:05.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:08.089 --> 01:00:08.099 align:start position:0%
is that better okay thank you so much
 
01:00:08.099 --> 01:00:09.349 align:start position:0%
is that better okay thank you so much
Josh

01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
Josh
 
01:00:13.309 --> 01:00:13.319 align:start position:0%
um I think it's very important that um
 
01:00:15.770 --> 01:00:15.780 align:start position:0%
we try to
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
protect you know our freedom of speech
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
and one of the ways we're doing it is to
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
protecting our local newspapers in this
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
state and by putting in these
 
01:00:27.720 --> 01:00:30.010 align:start position:0%
state and by putting in these
um

01:00:30.010 --> 01:00:30.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:32.809 --> 01:00:32.819 align:start position:0%
requirements for public hearings is a
 
01:00:35.089 --> 01:00:35.099 align:start position:0%
source of income for them
 
01:00:37.010 --> 01:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I think we should do everything we
 
01:00:39.650 --> 01:00:39.660 align:start position:0%
can to support them and to keep them
 
01:00:43.730 --> 01:00:43.740 align:start position:0%
alive as long as possible and that's why
 
01:00:46.549 --> 01:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
I am voting the way I am thank you thank
 
01:00:48.230 --> 01:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
you representative further discussion
 
01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
representative elwin
 
01:00:53.210 --> 01:00:53.220 align:start position:0%
uh I don't believe this is about
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
newspapers and income
 
01:00:59.870 --> 01:00:59.880 align:start position:0%
I believe this RSA regarding notice
 
01:01:02.750 --> 01:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
is about due process
 
01:01:06.049 --> 01:01:06.059 align:start position:0%
and it is also about standing
 
01:01:10.069 --> 01:01:10.079 align:start position:0%
so the term a butter can mean for
 
01:01:12.349 --> 01:01:12.359 align:start position:0%
purpose of certified mail
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
those properties of budding the subject
 
01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:15.829 align:start position:0%
those properties of budding the subject
property

01:01:15.829 --> 01:01:15.839 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:01:17.329 --> 01:01:17.339 align:start position:0%
but then we have
 
01:01:19.910 --> 01:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
a further definition of a butter
 
01:01:23.450 --> 01:01:23.460 align:start position:0%
which means people who can prove that
 
01:01:25.910 --> 01:01:25.920 align:start position:0%
there is a going to be an impact on
 
01:01:28.309 --> 01:01:28.319 align:start position:0%
their property and it's presumptuous to
 
01:01:30.710 --> 01:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
assume that
 
01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:32.809 align:start position:0%
assume that
any

01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
everyone lives within a local newspaper
 
01:01:37.789 --> 01:01:37.799 align:start position:0%
distribution area
 
01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
so I'm opposed to the bill
 
01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:44.700 align:start position:0%
um I do believe that we need to
 
01:01:49.430 --> 01:01:49.440 align:start position:0%
protect uh legal notice and do it right
 
01:01:52.970 --> 01:01:52.980 align:start position:0%
and this bill is not it
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:01:57.170 --> 01:01:57.180 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:00.170 --> 01:02:00.180 align:start position:0%
I hope to see this bill come back in
 
01:02:01.970 --> 01:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
some iteration at some future date
 
01:02:04.670 --> 01:02:04.680 align:start position:0%
because in the last session we in fact
 
01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.930 align:start position:0%
because in the last session we in fact
did

01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
bring up into the 20th maybe even the
 
01:02:11.329 --> 01:02:11.339 align:start position:0%
21st century
 
01:02:14.030 --> 01:02:14.040 align:start position:0%
some bills about public noticing of
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
meetings and elect using Electronic
 
01:02:19.190 --> 01:02:19.200 align:start position:0%
media Etc in addition to newspapers
 
01:02:21.890 --> 01:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
which are failing all over the state
 
01:02:25.730 --> 01:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
and so I hope that at some point perhaps
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
this committee might be instrumental in
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
crafting a bill that unifies all of the
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
various public notice requirements in
 
01:02:36.770 --> 01:02:36.780 align:start position:0%
the rsas pertaining to different public
 
01:02:40.309 --> 01:02:40.319 align:start position:0%
bodies so there is less confusion so
 
01:02:41.990 --> 01:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't become an unfunded
 
01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:43.309 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't become an unfunded
mandate

01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
mandate
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
when the New Hampshire Constitution was
 
01:02:48.890 --> 01:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
written I do not believe that every
 
01:02:50.390 --> 01:02:50.400 align:start position:0%
town in New Hampshire had a daily
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
newspaper so
 
01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:56.700 align:start position:0%
um times change circumstances change and
 
01:02:58.609 --> 01:02:58.619 align:start position:0%
I do hope to see this build back again
 
01:03:00.289 --> 01:03:00.299 align:start position:0%
sometime and we could do some really
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
good work on it thank you Mr chair thank
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
you representative I'm going to make a
 
01:03:06.109 --> 01:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
comment quickly here maybe that'll
 
01:03:08.390 --> 01:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate the need for prolonged
 
01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:09.960 align:start position:0%
discussions I've spoken with the the
 
01:03:13.130 --> 01:03:13.140 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor he understands that the
 
01:03:15.230 --> 01:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
bill needs some refining and I believe
 
01:03:18.049 --> 01:03:18.059 align:start position:0%
he will most likely bring a
 
01:03:22.370 --> 01:03:22.380 align:start position:0%
another bill that is refined back next
 
01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:24.000 align:start position:0%
year there's a further discussion on
 
01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:24.950 align:start position:0%
year there's a further discussion on
this

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
