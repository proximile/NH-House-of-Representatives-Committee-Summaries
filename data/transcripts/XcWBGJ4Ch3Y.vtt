and representative lynn is recognized to
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
discuss his
 
00:08:00.629 --> 00:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
amendment yes uh thank you mr chair um
 
00:08:04.230 --> 00:08:04.240 align:start position:0%
yesterday um i voted against uh the
 
00:08:06.710 --> 00:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
the earlier proposal that dealt with
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
this because
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
i felt that there were there were some
 
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
problems the chief wanted among
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
among them for me was that i thought
 
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.000 align:start position:0%
there was some inconsistency in the
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
language of the uh
 
00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
of the motion in that it didn't make
 
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.270 align:start position:0%
of the motion in that it didn't make
clear

00:08:21.270 --> 00:08:21.280 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:08:24.550 --> 00:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
um whether uh
 
00:08:27.909 --> 00:08:27.919 align:start position:0%
undertakings or or uh services that were
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
to be provided pursuant to the existing
 
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
700 000 contract but which might not yet
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
have been
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
arranged for um were to be were to be
 
00:08:40.870 --> 00:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
prohibited under the earlier proposal or
 
00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.190 align:start position:0%
prohibited under the earlier proposal or
not

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:42.880 align:start position:0%
i i think the intent was probably that
 
00:08:44.470 --> 00:08:44.480 align:start position:0%
they weren't to be but it wasn't clear
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
to me that that
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
that the language would accomplish that
 
00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:48.389 align:start position:0%
that the language would accomplish that
um

00:08:48.389 --> 00:08:48.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:49.829 --> 00:08:49.839 align:start position:0%
so working together with uh
 
00:08:51.829 --> 00:08:51.839 align:start position:0%
representative edwards um
 
00:08:53.829 --> 00:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
we came up with some some alternative
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
language that i think makes it clear
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
that the the department is entitled to
 
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
to carry out the the full terms of the
 
00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
existing contract for 700 000
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
even if they haven't sort of committed
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
the funds at the point where this
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
amendment uh becomes law if it does
 
00:09:13.430 --> 00:09:13.440 align:start position:0%
become law
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
um but that there's to be no further
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
uh contracts uh undertaken by
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
by uh the department until uh the
 
00:09:25.509 --> 00:09:25.519 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee
 
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:29.200 align:start position:0%
has an opportunity to uh review
 
00:09:31.990 --> 00:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
uh the particular in particular that
 
00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:33.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's a comprehensive review but in
 
00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:35.120 align:start position:0%
particular they're gonna be focused on
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
the privacy
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
implications of this because i think
 
00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:42.320 align:start position:0%
it really is a significant concern i
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
think should be a significant concern to
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
everyone that
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
this is far more than simply the sharing
 
00:09:51.350 --> 00:09:51.360 align:start position:0%
of medical information between medical
 
00:09:52.949 --> 00:09:52.959 align:start position:0%
professionals who may be providing
 
00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
services to any individual it goes well
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
beyond that
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
and in my understanding is it's not even
 
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:00.160 align:start position:0%
limited at least potentially
 
00:10:03.269 --> 00:10:03.279 align:start position:0%
is not even limited to medicare or
 
00:10:04.949 --> 00:10:04.959 align:start position:0%
medicaid recipients rather it could
 
00:10:04.959 --> 00:10:05.430 align:start position:0%
medicaid recipients rather it could
apply

00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
really to anyone who happens to get
 
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh to provide information to
 
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:15.200 align:start position:0%
a food service provider or any any other
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
kind of non-medical
 
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:21.920 align:start position:0%
situation um and i think that's a
 
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
an area of potential concern that really
 
00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
ought to be looked at
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
by the legislature before this continues
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
so uh that's i think that's what this
 
00:10:33.030 --> 00:10:33.040 align:start position:0%
amendment accomplished
 
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:34.560 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lynn are there
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:45.350 --> 00:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
now is it on yeah it is on today thank
 
00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.389 align:start position:0%
now is it on yeah it is on today thank
you

00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:49.990 --> 00:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
um is isn't the
 
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:52.880 align:start position:0%
amendment that you've introduced today
 
00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
that's before us
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
isn't this the subject of a bill that
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
was in the health and human service
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
committee and i
 
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:02.880 align:start position:0%
believe i haven't seen the calendar of
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
course but i believe it may be
 
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the calendar and being reported out
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
next week at our session so isn't this
 
00:11:11.829 --> 00:11:11.839 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
subject matter that was dealt with in
 
00:11:17.430 --> 00:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna i'm gonna defer to uh
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
representative edwards on that
 
00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.910 align:start position:0%
representative edwards on that
um

00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:25.360 align:start position:0%
thank you representative lynn and thank
 
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:26.720 align:start position:0%
you representative walner for the
 
00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:27.590 align:start position:0%
you representative walner for the
question

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh although similar this is not
 
00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079 align:start position:0%
substantively the same thing as
 
00:11:37.910 --> 00:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 601 and
 
00:11:41.110 --> 00:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
and even if it were this would be an
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
example i think
 
00:11:45.590 --> 00:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
of a belts and suspenders strategy
 
00:11:47.350 --> 00:11:47.360 align:start position:0%
of making sure that something this
 
00:11:50.150 --> 00:11:50.160 align:start position:0%
important does find its way into law
 
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:53.200 align:start position:0%
so redundant or not which i don't think
 
00:11:55.509 --> 00:11:55.519 align:start position:0%
it is at all
 
00:11:57.430 --> 00:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
it still nevertheless a good amendment
 
00:12:00.069 --> 00:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
and i'll support it
 
00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
representative rogers for a question
 
00:12:06.550 --> 00:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um after the other
 
00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
day i
 
00:12:09.110 --> 00:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
in fact went to the health and human
 
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:10.310 align:start position:0%
in fact went to the health and human
services

00:12:10.310 --> 00:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:12:12.870 --> 00:12:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee and pulled a file on the bill
 
00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:13.509 align:start position:0%
committee and pulled a file on the bill
that

00:12:13.509 --> 00:12:13.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:15.990 --> 00:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
this is similar to and and looked at not
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
only the bill but
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
the amendments that were there um and i
 
00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:20.880 align:start position:0%
know representative edwards who
 
00:12:22.470 --> 00:12:22.480 align:start position:0%
testified on the bill and talked about
 
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:22.870 align:start position:0%
testified on the bill and talked about
it

00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
at that hearing and this is
 
00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:27.040 align:start position:0%
substantially similar
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
to a number of the amendments they were
 
00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:30.720 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
and talks about the the closed system
 
00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
loop referral system in the committee
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
they did in fact take a vote and it is
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
on the calendar
 
00:12:44.710 --> 00:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
it was quite a large majority vote that
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
they um
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
i believe it was 17 or 14 to five
 
00:12:48.639 --> 00:12:49.509 align:start position:0%
i believe it was 17 or 14 to five
actually

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:49.519 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
the vote to itl it and the concerns were
 
00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.509 align:start position:0%
the vote to itl it and the concerns were
about

00:12:53.509 --> 00:12:53.519 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:12:55.190 --> 00:12:55.200 align:start position:0%
they asked someone in the attorney
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
general's office about
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional questions and he
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
expressed some concerns
 
00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:05.600 align:start position:0%
that needed to be looked at so i'm
 
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.069 align:start position:0%
that needed to be looked at so i'm
concerned

00:13:06.069 --> 00:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
00:13:08.550 --> 00:13:08.560 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing is taking quote
 
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
another bite at the apple
 
00:13:13.030 --> 00:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
for a bill that um while people did
 
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
share concerns they had other concerns
 
00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:17.430 align:start position:0%
share concerns they had other concerns
with

00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:13:19.030 --> 00:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
you would express that you wanted the
 
00:13:21.190 --> 00:13:21.200 align:start position:0%
senate to get the house's position
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
it appears to me like they're getting a
 
00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
position and we're going to be offering
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
them yet another position to look at so
 
00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:29.360 align:start position:0%
if they're getting both sides of a
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
position it's similar to getting nothing
 
00:13:35.990 --> 00:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
so again um i expressed concerns about
 
00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
why we're taking what a policy committee
 
00:13:38.639 --> 00:13:39.670 align:start position:0%
why we're taking what a policy committee
that

00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
dealt with this at length took a
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
position on
 
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
and we're doing the bill
 
00:13:48.629 --> 00:13:48.639 align:start position:0%
which again is policy and we're supposed
 
00:13:50.949 --> 00:13:50.959 align:start position:0%
to look at the financial aspects of it
 
00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
not the policy
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
especially when the committee policy
 
00:13:55.509 --> 00:13:55.519 align:start position:0%
committee has looked at it
 
00:13:57.269 --> 00:13:57.279 align:start position:0%
and we're doing another bite at the
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
apple and changing the policy that the
 
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
policy committee came up with
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
um i don't think that that's our place
 
00:14:05.269 --> 00:14:05.279 align:start position:0%
but especially not
 
00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the last minute when everything else
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
is done
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
without having the proper time for all
 
00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
of us to consider it
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
um i i understand you've considered it
 
00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
for quite a while
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
you said the other day that
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
representative earth had also considered
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
for quite a while
 
00:14:23.269 --> 00:14:23.279 align:start position:0%
and both of you are very intelligent you
 
00:14:25.189 --> 00:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
understand this policy well but i think
 
00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
understand this policy well but i think
that

00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
for the whole committee to vote on it
 
00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
with a very limited time
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
is not the way we should be doing
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
business so i would suggest that we
 
00:14:37.189 --> 00:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
um hold this and and let it be dealt
 
00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
with by the policy
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
committee that will in fact have it in
 
00:14:41.189 --> 00:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
the calendar
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
at the same session not maybe the same
 
00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
session but the same group of days that
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:14:48.230 --> 00:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
health human services will have it on
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
the calendar i guess i don't see why
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:57.189 --> 00:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
all right i've got a lousy speaker here
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
that i
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
can't understand most of what you say
 
00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.110 align:start position:0%
can't understand most of what you say
but

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:15:03.509 --> 00:15:03.519 align:start position:0%
was there a question representative
 
00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
edwards did you understand
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
the question well i i understood
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative rogers in summary
 
00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:15.839 align:start position:0%
to not agree with having
 
00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:18.240 align:start position:0%
the finance committee set this as policy
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
when she thinks there's a
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
parallel path and a more appropriate
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
path in the
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
policy committee which i i think is
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
is not an unfair observation but i
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
i would just want to point out um from
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
my own perspective
 
00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:36.880 align:start position:0%
that what ultimately what this does is
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
it reaffirms what the
 
00:15:40.550 --> 00:15:40.560 align:start position:0%
health and human services oversight
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee can do
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
already which is to take a look at
 
00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:48.320 align:start position:0%
activities in the department and
 
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.110 align:start position:0%
activities in the department and
determine

00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
determine
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
if the department is using
 
00:15:55.509 --> 00:15:55.519 align:start position:0%
it's its best efforts to achieve
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
efficiency and effectiveness
 
00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:00.240 align:start position:0%
in their operations well what this does
 
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
more though is it clarifies that the hhs
 
00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.910 align:start position:0%
more though is it clarifies that the hhs
oversight

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
oversight
 
00:16:09.670 --> 00:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
has a function in this case to review
 
00:16:13.189 --> 00:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
and to report on whether or not
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
from the oversight committee's
 
00:16:17.509 --> 00:16:17.519 align:start position:0%
perspective privacy rules
 
00:16:20.629 --> 00:16:20.639 align:start position:0%
and regulations are being followed to
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
the extent that
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
we believe that the new hampshire
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
constitution on privacy
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
expects us to it's established a very
 
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:30.389 align:start position:0%
expects us to it's established a very
high

00:16:30.389 --> 00:16:30.399 align:start position:0%
high
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
standard that uh that there's concern
 
00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:35.600 align:start position:0%
that not all departments not all
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
legislators have fully embraced at this
 
00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.670 align:start position:0%
legislators have fully embraced at this
point

00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:16:42.949 --> 00:16:42.959 align:start position:0%
and is worth a careful examination
 
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative rogers did you
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
have further
 
00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:49.360 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm just concerned that we turn
 
00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:50.160 align:start position:0%
it over to the
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
the legislative oversight of the health
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
oversight committee
 
00:16:55.590 --> 00:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
it's kind of like turning something over
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
to fiscal and we've all here
 
00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
expressed concern before that we let a
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
small group of legislators do
 
00:17:05.669 --> 00:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
what um 400 should be doing and
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
again i'm sorry if my speaker's not
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
working well but
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
again i think that we want to have more
 
00:17:13.350 --> 00:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
legislators make decisions rather than
 
00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:14.150 align:start position:0%
legislators make decisions rather than
less

00:17:14.150 --> 00:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
and if this is the precedent we want to
 
00:17:17.189 --> 00:17:17.199 align:start position:0%
set about
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
doing policy what's to stop us from the
 
00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.270 align:start position:0%
doing policy what's to stop us from the
future

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
each bringing in a bill that we don't
 
00:17:25.029 --> 00:17:25.039 align:start position:0%
like the way the policy decision
 
00:17:27.429 --> 00:17:27.439 align:start position:0%
policy committees decided and bringing
 
00:17:29.029 --> 00:17:29.039 align:start position:0%
it in at the last minute and say
 
00:17:31.750 --> 00:17:31.760 align:start position:0%
well i like this bill they decided itl
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
so let's redo it in the budget
 
00:17:36.710 --> 00:17:36.720 align:start position:0%
to my way of thinking thank you very
 
00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.909 align:start position:0%
to my way of thinking thank you very
much

00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
much
 
00:17:40.470 --> 00:17:40.480 align:start position:0%
thank you further discussion
 
00:17:42.549 --> 00:17:42.559 align:start position:0%
representative walnut
 
00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative weiler um
 
00:17:53.110 --> 00:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
i was wondering if i could ask the
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor of the amendment a question
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
did you give consideration to taking
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
this amendment to the floor
 
00:18:04.870 --> 00:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
and amending 601 as it comes onto the
 
00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.549 align:start position:0%
and amending 601 as it comes onto the
floor

00:18:06.549 --> 00:18:06.559 align:start position:0%
floor
 
00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
i if you're if that's addressed to me i
 
00:18:10.150 --> 00:18:10.160 align:start position:0%
did not and
 
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:12.640 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you i i have to say
 
00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:13.430 align:start position:0%
to be honest with you i i have to say
candidly

00:18:13.430 --> 00:18:13.440 align:start position:0%
candidly
 
00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
i'm still sort of feeling my way around
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
the legislative procedure so i hadn't
 
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:19.360 align:start position:0%
i understand that i hadn't frankly
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
thought of that um
 
00:18:25.029 --> 00:18:25.039 align:start position:0%
so this was this was suggested as a way
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
as a way to do this it seemed to me to
 
00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:27.350 align:start position:0%
as a way to do this it seemed to me to
be

00:18:27.350 --> 00:18:27.360 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
an appropriate way um to do this
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
and i guess you know one other point i
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
would make just in response to the
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
response to what uh your question
 
00:18:41.510 --> 00:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
is as i think that this amendment
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
merely tells the department of health
 
00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:18:47.270 --> 00:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't make any further contracts
 
00:18:49.350 --> 00:18:49.360 align:start position:0%
regarding regarding this other than the
 
00:18:50.630 --> 00:18:50.640 align:start position:0%
one that's existing
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
until the legislative oversight
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
committee makes its
 
00:18:55.990 --> 00:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations i don't read this as
 
00:18:58.150 --> 00:18:58.160 align:start position:0%
saying and i don't think it does say
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
that once that's happened they are
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
prohibited from making contracts
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
presumably if the legislative oversight
 
00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
committee says look there's all these
 
00:19:06.870 --> 00:19:06.880 align:start position:0%
terrible things you really ought to make
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
we recommend you do this this and this
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
presumably assuming those
 
00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations are reasonable
 
00:19:14.070 --> 00:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
the department will follow them but i
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
suppose and i suppose if they didn't
 
00:19:17.669 --> 00:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
then in the next session
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
we could you know enact legislation but
 
00:19:22.390 --> 00:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't say
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
they can't do that after the after we've
 
00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:25.510 align:start position:0%
they can't do that after the after we've
made

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:19:28.230 --> 00:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
the the oversight committee has made its
 
00:19:29.350 --> 00:19:29.360 align:start position:0%
it's recommended
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations so i don't know exactly
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
what the
 
00:19:35.029 --> 00:19:35.039 align:start position:0%
rather as a reference made to some you
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
know the attorney general having some
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional question i don't quite
 
00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:41.440 align:start position:0%
understand what that could be given the
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
way that i think this would operate
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%

um you've all done a great job getting
 
00:22:00.070 --> 00:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
to this point i know it hasn't been easy
 
00:22:01.190 --> 00:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
in the new environment
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
and support for our staff so i'm going
 
00:22:10.310 --> 00:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
to ask mickey
 
00:22:14.549 --> 00:22:14.559 align:start position:0%
who's monitoring this call the zoom um
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
webinar to share the general education

trust fund surplus statement
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
it was up there then it went away i
 
00:22:34.230 --> 00:22:34.240 align:start position:0%
think that was the highway fun one
 
00:22:35.669 --> 00:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
mickey was getting excited
 
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:40.000 align:start position:0%
so there we go thanks nick
 
00:22:43.669 --> 00:22:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and so before you what you'll see is
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
uh the combined general education trust
 
00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
fund surplus statement it is eight pages
 
00:22:49.750 --> 00:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
i will not go through all
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
eight pages i know you've been through a
 
00:22:54.070 --> 00:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
lot of documents uh this is the document
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
that we use during the process to ensure
 
00:22:57.669 --> 00:22:57.679 align:start position:0%
that the house
 
00:23:01.350 --> 00:23:01.360 align:start position:0%
is offering a balanced budget plan
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
including in this plan is all the
 
00:23:04.870 --> 00:23:04.880 align:start position:0%
appropriations in the large document of
 
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:06.080 align:start position:0%
hospital one
 
00:23:08.470 --> 00:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
any appropriations that are included in
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:12.559 align:start position:0%
2 uh as well as any revenue changes
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
included in house bill 2 and in addition
 
00:23:17.029 --> 00:23:17.039 align:start position:0%
any estimated lapse or
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
the estimated lapse of unexpected
 
00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.789 align:start position:0%
the estimated lapse of unexpected
appropriations

00:23:20.789 --> 00:23:20.799 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:22.720 align:start position:0%
so in total when you received the budget
 
00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:25.200 align:start position:0%
back on february 11th from the governor
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
um the revenue picture was a little
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
different at the time in 21
 
00:23:30.870 --> 00:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh the governor's first revenue west
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
myths assumed that uh
 
00:23:36.549 --> 00:23:36.559 align:start position:0%
21 would have a large lapse about 150.5
 
00:23:38.710 --> 00:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:23:41.269 --> 00:23:41.279 align:start position:0%
but that would not uh the revenues were
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
also going to be underplanned as well
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
in addition a negative balance of 54.4
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars was carried forward from
 
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:48.789 align:start position:0%
million dollars was carried forward from
fy20

00:23:48.789 --> 00:23:48.799 align:start position:0%
fy20
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
and so a draw on the rainy day fund
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
was estimated at that time by the
 
00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:55.350 align:start position:0%
was estimated at that time by the
governor

00:23:55.350 --> 00:23:55.360 align:start position:0%
governor
 
00:23:58.630 --> 00:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
of about 29.9 million dollars
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
so as you know we're currently in fiscal
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
year 21 and
 
00:24:04.070 --> 00:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
um everything is moving we're in march
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
we have
 
00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:08.320 align:start position:0%
three months left in the fiscal year
 
00:24:10.950 --> 00:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
so it will end how it ends uh we'll
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
we'll continue to monitor revenue
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
um the house finance committee also
 
00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:16.390 align:start position:0%
um the house finance committee also
began

00:24:16.390 --> 00:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
began
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
the balance beginning port of negative
 
00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:19.590 align:start position:0%
the balance beginning port of negative
54

00:24:19.590 --> 00:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
54
 
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
407. estimated revenues
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
the first line the 2 billion 725.7
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
are the revenue estimates that were
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
adopted by the
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
house ways and means committee in march
 
00:24:36.230 --> 00:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
i think right around march 18th
 
00:24:38.470 --> 00:24:38.480 align:start position:0%
as you remember at the end of february
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
the house ways means committee
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
presented and passed and tabled house
 
00:24:45.510 --> 00:24:45.520 align:start position:0%
resolution 11 which was their first
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
crack at the revenue estimates
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
based on further discussions with
 
00:24:52.230 --> 00:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
department of revenue administration
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
the and based on discussions with the
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
governor's office and his discussions
 
00:24:57.990 --> 00:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
with the agencies
 
00:25:00.549 --> 00:25:00.559 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates did increase and
 
00:25:02.310 --> 00:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
so you'll remember yesterday that the
 
00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:03.520 align:start position:0%
committee did adopt
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
or two days ago on monday the committee
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
did adopt um
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
the new revenue estimates of the 2.725.7
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
which is the combined general education
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
trust fund
 
00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:15.480 align:start position:0%
both the governor and the house have a
 
00:25:17.830 --> 00:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
62.5 million dollar revenue adjustment
 
00:25:20.070 --> 00:25:20.080 align:start position:0%
and just to remind you what that was
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
is if you remember a couple budgets ago
 
00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:24.480 align:start position:0%
um that there was some one-time
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
education aid for
 
00:25:27.510 --> 00:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch and fiscal
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
capacity disparity aid
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
how that was funded is a restricted they
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
restricted the balance
 
00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund at the end
 
00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:38.640 align:start position:0%
of 19 and put into a special
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term special
 
00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400 align:start position:0%
account to be held aside
 
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:44.480 align:start position:0%
for funds provided to the cities and
 
00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
towns or to the school districts in
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
fy 21 and so that is more just a
 
00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:52.640 align:start position:0%
an adjustment on this statement total
 
00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
revenues for the house
 
00:25:57.909 --> 00:25:57.919 align:start position:0%
2.788.2 million dollars
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
which is over what the governor's
 
00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
original estimates are but a little more
 
00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:02.480 align:start position:0%
in line with
 
00:26:04.710 --> 00:26:04.720 align:start position:0%
where uh revised estimates that the
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
government provided to the
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh committee earlier in the month
 
00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
what's deducted from that is the
 
00:26:14.070 --> 00:26:14.080 align:start position:0%
beginning balance obviously in 54.4 but
 
00:26:15.990 --> 00:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
then the budget appropriations now the
 
00:26:17.909 --> 00:26:17.919 align:start position:0%
budget appropriations on line nine
 
00:26:19.909 --> 00:26:19.919 align:start position:0%
these are the state totals for the
 
00:26:21.909 --> 00:26:21.919 align:start position:0%
general and education trust fund
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
uh that you'll find on the last page of
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
house bill 1 the large
 
00:26:29.430 --> 00:26:29.440 align:start position:0%
700 plus page document and then
 
00:26:31.510 --> 00:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
appropriation adjustments which you will
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
see on schedule
 
00:26:37.269 --> 00:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
2 of about 76.206
 
00:26:40.710 --> 00:26:40.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars and not just i won't
 
00:26:45.029 --> 00:26:45.039 align:start position:0%
move over um two there but 62.5 of that
 
00:26:46.630 --> 00:26:46.640 align:start position:0%
as we talked before
 
00:26:48.870 --> 00:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
is relative to that one-time free and
 
00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and fiscal capacity
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
disparity aid which was offset by that
 
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
62.5 million dollars
 
00:26:56.870 --> 00:26:56.880 align:start position:0%
the other uh 11 plus million dollars is
 
00:26:58.470 --> 00:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
related to
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
your standard your statutory
 
00:27:01.350 --> 00:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
appropriations your fiscal committee
 
00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:02.310 align:start position:0%
appropriations your fiscal committee
appropriations

00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:27:05.350 --> 00:27:05.360 align:start position:0%
uh et cetera in addition um it's a
 
00:27:06.549 --> 00:27:06.559 align:start position:0%
little higher than where the governor
 
00:27:08.549 --> 00:27:08.559 align:start position:0%
came in because the division two as you
 
00:27:10.750 --> 00:27:10.760 align:start position:0%
remember had proposed i think was about
 
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.230 align:start position:0%
remember had proposed i think was about
1.9

00:27:12.230 --> 00:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
1.9
 
00:27:15.750 --> 00:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
uh million dollars in 1921
 
00:27:17.590 --> 00:27:17.600 align:start position:0%
for kindergarten for those cities and
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
towns that have full day kindergarten
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
there was a lag
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
in the timing of the adm and so you can
 
00:27:23.669 --> 00:27:23.679 align:start position:0%
see that's a little higher than where
 
00:27:24.789 --> 00:27:24.799 align:start position:0%
the governor was
 
00:27:27.909 --> 00:27:27.919 align:start position:0%
laps stayed the same 150.5 million
 
00:27:27.919 --> 00:27:28.870 align:start position:0%
laps stayed the same 150.5 million
dollars

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
which is a high lapse historically but
 
00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
something that the
 
00:27:34.870 --> 00:27:34.880 align:start position:0%
governor's office and agencies do
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
believe they'll be able to make
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
this time around it was a hiring freeze
 
00:27:41.430 --> 00:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
as you remember for almost complete year
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
there's also additional federal matching
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
funds for hhs
 
00:27:47.269 --> 00:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
under the medicaid program so that this
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
lapse estimate
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
will hit 150.5 what that ends up doing
 
00:27:55.990 --> 00:27:56.000 align:start position:0%
is a current year balance of about 66.47
 
00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:56.950 align:start position:0%
is a current year balance of about 66.47
million

00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh deduct from that the 54.4 million
 
00:28:00.399 --> 00:28:01.669 align:start position:0%
uh deduct from that the 54.4 million
dollars

00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:28:03.510 --> 00:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
of the beginning balance and it's a
 
00:28:05.990 --> 00:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
positive balance for a combined
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
general education trust fund of 12.066
 
00:28:12.710 --> 00:28:12.720 align:start position:0%
and i just want to point out if mickey
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
if you wouldn't mind flipping to the
 
00:28:17.029 --> 00:28:17.039 align:start position:0%
next page
 
00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
why is there what does the general fund
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
look like you can see down on line
 
00:28:24.070 --> 00:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
17 that although in total there is a
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
positive balance
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
in the combined general education trust
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
fund almost 19 million of that
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
is in the education trust fund and so as
 
00:28:33.510 --> 00:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
a result if you look
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
purely at the general funds there is a
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
negative balance of about 7.8 million
 
00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:38.950 align:start position:0%
negative balance of about 7.8 million
dollars

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
again because of the 54 51.2 came
 
00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
again because of the 54 51.2 came
forward

00:28:43.750 --> 00:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:28:45.909 --> 00:28:45.919 align:start position:0%
to the general fund current year balance
 
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:48.720 align:start position:0%
of 43.3 so it does still result in a
 
00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:49.830 align:start position:0%
of 43.3 so it does still result in a
shortfall

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
shortfall
 
00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
in this point in time of about 7.8
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
based on statute if the state does have
 
00:28:59.190 --> 00:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
a an operating budget deficit in the
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
and your estimated revenues are below
 
00:29:03.909 --> 00:29:03.919 align:start position:0%
the projected
 
00:29:06.950 --> 00:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh biennial plan then an automatic door
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
on the rainy day fund would occur and
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
basically what would happen is
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
would come before fiscal committee and
 
00:29:13.990 --> 00:29:14.000 align:start position:0%
request to draw
 
00:29:16.710 --> 00:29:16.720 align:start position:0%
on that rainy day fund we are several
 
00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:18.080 align:start position:0%
months away from that
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
this is again if everything ended today
 
00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
which we know it won't there would be a
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
small draw of about 7.8 million dollars
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
on the rainy day
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
fund but as we continue through the
 
00:29:30.310 --> 00:29:30.320 align:start position:0%
budget continue the budget throughout
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
the process and
 
00:29:33.909 --> 00:29:33.919 align:start position:0%
may uh watch the revenues in the senate
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
um as well as the community conference
 
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:37.840 align:start position:0%
that number is going to change and and
 
00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
then in addition we'll be paying
 
00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.070 align:start position:0%
then in addition we'll be paying
attention

00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:42.320 align:start position:0%
to how our current revenues are
 
00:29:43.909 --> 00:29:43.919 align:start position:0%
comparing versus plan
 
00:29:46.389 --> 00:29:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh to see that that second trigger in
 
00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:48.240 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund is met that revenues
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
are actually under plan because that's
 
00:29:51.110 --> 00:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
the only way that that automatic draw on
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
the rainy day fund
 
00:29:54.470 --> 00:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
would occur and make you wouldn't mind
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
going back page one
 
00:29:59.430 --> 00:29:59.440 align:start position:0%
thank you and so that's uh you'll see
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
right there the 7.8 million from the
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
randy dave hunt
 
00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
balance after transfers 19896 that is
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
all in the education trust fund
 
00:30:08.630 --> 00:30:08.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see that number carry forward on
 
00:30:11.269 --> 00:30:11.279 align:start position:0%
row 1 in house finance
 
00:30:13.110 --> 00:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
because the education trust fund is
 
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.549 align:start position:0%
because the education trust fund is
non-lapsing

00:30:14.549 --> 00:30:14.559 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
using the revenues from the ways it
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
means revised estimates
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
as well as revenue adjustments from the
 
00:30:22.070 --> 00:30:22.080 align:start position:0%
various changes to
 
00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
the bet rates the bet
 
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:28.720 align:start position:0%
thresholds uh the bpt rate reduction
 
00:30:33.430 --> 00:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
that was provided and voted on on monday
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
in the various other revenue changes
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
the net revenues or the total revenues
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
came out to about
 
00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.120 align:start position:0%
almost about 2.75 billion dollars
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
between the general and education trust
 
00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:46.389 align:start position:0%
between the general and education trust
fund

00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:30:48.870 --> 00:30:48.880 align:start position:0%
deduct from that your budget
 
00:30:50.149 --> 00:30:50.159 align:start position:0%
appropriations so again
 
00:30:51.990 --> 00:30:52.000 align:start position:0%
general education trust fund budget
 
00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:53.190 align:start position:0%
general education trust fund budget
appropriations

00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:30:57.430 --> 00:30:57.440 align:start position:0%
of about 2.753 billion dollars
 
00:31:01.029 --> 00:31:01.039 align:start position:0%
appropriation adjustments about 19.815
 
00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
which you will see
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
on we won't flip to page three but you
 
00:31:04.950 --> 00:31:04.960 align:start position:0%
will see
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
on your hard copy and online uh on page
 
00:31:11.190 --> 00:31:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh sorry on page four you do begin to
 
00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:11.750 align:start position:0%
uh sorry on page four you do begin to
see

00:31:11.750 --> 00:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh where those various adjustments are
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
and i have separated them out by
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
division just so each division can
 
00:31:18.389 --> 00:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
you know ensure that they were all
 
00:31:20.870 --> 00:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for uh laps you'll see that
 
00:31:21.909 --> 00:31:21.919 align:start position:0%
the laps
 
00:31:25.110 --> 00:31:25.120 align:start position:0%
when the governor uh had proposed was 67
 
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars you'll see the house
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
finance moved
 
00:31:30.070 --> 00:31:30.080 align:start position:0%
up to 71 and that's because of an action
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
taken in division three
 
00:31:33.509 --> 00:31:33.519 align:start position:0%
which based on discussions with health
 
00:31:34.870 --> 00:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
and human services
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh they did make a motion to increase
 
00:31:38.549 --> 00:31:38.559 align:start position:0%
the statewide lapse by four million
 
00:31:39.909 --> 00:31:39.919 align:start position:0%
dollars and 22
 
00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:41.840 align:start position:0%
and then you can see another 6.2 million
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
dollars in 23.
 
00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:46.240 align:start position:0%
so for 22 the current year ending
 
00:31:48.630 --> 00:31:48.640 align:start position:0%
balance about 47.2
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
um million dollars cumulative ending
 
00:31:52.950 --> 00:31:52.960 align:start position:0%
balance after adding in the
 
00:31:54.549 --> 00:31:54.559 align:start position:0%
balance forward from the education trust
 
00:31:57.269 --> 00:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
fund we'll bring that to 67.1
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
uh million dollars at the end of fiscal
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
year 22 based on the house's budget
 
00:32:02.870 --> 00:32:02.880 align:start position:0%
proposal house finance committee's
 
00:32:05.590 --> 00:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
budget proposal uh it's the first year
 
00:32:06.710 --> 00:32:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the biennium
 
00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
automatically carries forward any
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
negative part positive
 
00:32:11.509 --> 00:32:11.519 align:start position:0%
automatically carries forward into the
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year so you can see
 
00:32:15.110 --> 00:32:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the beginning balance on row one on
 
00:32:16.389 --> 00:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
the final column
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
uh of 67.1 million dollars uh revenues
 
00:32:20.789 --> 00:32:20.799 align:start position:0%
you can see the
 
00:32:24.070 --> 00:32:24.080 align:start position:0%
the revised estimates on row four uh the
 
00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:24.870 align:start position:0%
the revised estimates on row four uh the
2.8

00:32:24.870 --> 00:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
2.8
 
00:32:26.870 --> 00:32:26.880 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and then total revenue
 
00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.990 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and then total revenue
adjustments

00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
adjustments
 
00:32:30.710 --> 00:32:30.720 align:start position:0%
of about 118 million and this is when a
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
lot of the tax changes proposed by
 
00:32:36.470 --> 00:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh house finance will take effect uh
 
00:32:40.070 --> 00:32:40.080 align:start position:0%
such as your business tax changes
 
00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
and then the larger large one being your
 
00:32:47.029 --> 00:32:47.039 align:start position:0%
um your credit to carry forward
 
00:32:49.029 --> 00:32:49.039 align:start position:0%
uh the bet amendment that was adopted
 
00:32:51.029 --> 00:32:51.039 align:start position:0%
which uh does instead of allowing
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
businesses to
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
carry forward all of their uh previously
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
overpaid taxes
 
00:32:58.870 --> 00:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
they do want to work that down over
 
00:32:58.880 --> 00:32:59.669 align:start position:0%
they do want to work that down over
several

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
several
 
00:33:01.990 --> 00:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
um several years the governor had
 
00:33:03.509 --> 00:33:03.519 align:start position:0%
proposed a similar type of
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
um reduction but the house ways and
 
00:33:07.269 --> 00:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
means committee had actually
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
adjusted that and the house finance
 
00:33:10.389 --> 00:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
committee adopted that amendment
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
so your total revenues for general
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
education trust fund about 2.68
 
00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and then your budgeted
 
00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.389 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and then your budgeted
appropriations

00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
appropriations
 
00:33:20.549 --> 00:33:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh total budget appropriations of about
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
2.8 billion dollars
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
in house bill one appropriation
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
adjustments is a
 
00:33:29.830 --> 00:33:29.840 align:start position:0%
17.9 million almost 18 million dollars
 
00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
of positive adjustments
 
00:33:33.750 --> 00:33:33.760 align:start position:0%
uh which offset those appropriations up
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
top and a majority of that has to do
 
00:33:37.350 --> 00:33:37.360 align:start position:0%
with the division three action relative
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
to the back of budget reductions that
 
00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
you remember uh discussing
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
on monday uh less the lapse the 98.2
 
00:33:45.669 --> 00:33:45.679 align:start position:0%
million dollars again
 
00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
uh that based on a division three action
 
00:33:48.950 --> 00:33:48.960 align:start position:0%
that moved that six point two million
 
00:33:50.549 --> 00:33:50.559 align:start position:0%
dollars above where the governor
 
00:33:53.350 --> 00:33:53.360 align:start position:0%
had uh come in and so that the current
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
year balance of negative 32.2
 
00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
offset by the positive balance of the
 
00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.190 align:start position:0%
offset by the positive balance of the
67.1

00:33:59.190 --> 00:33:59.200 align:start position:0%
67.1
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
uh leaves a balance of 34.9 million
 
00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.310 align:start position:0%
uh leaves a balance of 34.9 million
dollars

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:34:05.990 --> 00:34:06.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of the biennium that is all
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
in the uh general fund
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
one thing i should have mentioned the
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
large revenue adjustment up top
 
00:34:14.710 --> 00:34:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh of the 118 has to do with you
 
00:34:16.149 --> 00:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
remember the statewide education
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
property tax
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
being reduced in 23 by 100 million so
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's a large majority of that
 
00:34:24.790 --> 00:34:24.800 align:start position:0%
so what also resulted is that
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
um the general fund
 
00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:29.839 align:start position:0%
since the education trust fund revenue
 
00:34:31.909 --> 00:34:31.919 align:start position:0%
went down the general fund did have to
 
00:34:31.919 --> 00:34:33.109 align:start position:0%
went down the general fund did have to
transfer

00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
transfer
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
about 65 million dollars into the
 
00:34:36.869 --> 00:34:36.879 align:start position:0%
education trust fund to keep it whole
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
and to ensure that those the reduction
 
00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
in statewide property tax did not
 
00:34:43.589 --> 00:34:43.599 align:start position:0%
impact the grants to the cities and
 
00:34:43.599 --> 00:34:44.230 align:start position:0%
impact the grants to the cities and
towns

00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
towns
 
00:34:46.869 --> 00:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
or sorry to the school districts and so
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
the cumulative vending balance is all in
 
00:34:50.550 --> 00:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
the general fund about 34.9
 
00:34:53.829 --> 00:34:53.839 align:start position:0%
uh million dollars and uh no suspension
 
00:34:54.950 --> 00:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
of the rainy day
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
fund statute based on statute uh any
 
00:34:59.589 --> 00:34:59.599 align:start position:0%
balance remaining at the end of the
 
00:34:59.599 --> 00:35:00.390 align:start position:0%
balance remaining at the end of the
biennium

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:35:01.910 --> 00:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
would be transferred to the rainy day
 
00:35:04.390 --> 00:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
fund so that's why in this budget plan
 
00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:06.480 align:start position:0%
from house finance that is presented
 
00:35:08.470 --> 00:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
uh the rainy day fund balance at the end
 
00:35:10.470 --> 00:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the next biennium is estimated
 
00:35:14.390 --> 00:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
at about 142.6 million dollars
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
and so that was kind of a long way going
 
00:35:19.750 --> 00:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
getting to that the budget is a balanced
 
00:35:21.030 --> 00:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
budget plan
 
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
um in the general and education trust
 
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:24.069 align:start position:0%
um in the general and education trust
fund

00:35:24.069 --> 00:35:24.079 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:35:27.270 --> 00:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
and we did also provide a surplus
 
00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:27.990 align:start position:0%
and we did also provide a surplus
statement

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
for the highway fund and efficient game
 
00:35:31.990 --> 00:35:32.000 align:start position:0%
fund which also show that those two
 
00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.790 align:start position:0%
fund which also show that those two
funds

00:35:32.790 --> 00:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
are also balanced so i can answer any
 
00:35:40.790 --> 00:35:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee for the
 
00:35:42.839 --> 00:35:47.910 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee for the
lba

00:35:47.910 --> 00:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:49.589 --> 00:35:49.599 align:start position:0%
you must have done a great job i don't
 
00:35:52.790 --> 00:35:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
thank you and so i will have mickey
 
00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
unshare this screen
 
00:36:01.589 --> 00:36:01.599 align:start position:0%
and right now we're going to go to
 
00:36:05.990 --> 00:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
amendment uh 2021-1045-h
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
that is the large amendment on house
 
00:36:11.589 --> 00:36:11.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
and uh i just asked if mickey if you
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
could share that screen it may take a
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
little bit to bring up because it is a
 
00:36:19.270 --> 00:36:19.280 align:start position:0%
large document
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
okay and i won't uh i definitely won't
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
go over
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
every single one of these pages but
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
these are the
 
00:36:29.430 --> 00:36:29.440 align:start position:0%
individual appropriations that the
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
divisions have worked on
 
00:36:34.230 --> 00:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
since march or since february uh worked
 
00:36:36.310 --> 00:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
with your agencies and your divisions to
