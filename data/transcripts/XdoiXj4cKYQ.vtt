and that's a schedule for the future
 
00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
any questions um
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
i've talked to i've talked to the
 
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
chief of staff aaron goulet about going
 
00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 align:start position:0%
completely virtual for our
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
meetings because i haven't had
 
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:25.520 align:start position:0%
one positive feedback relative to the
 
00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:26.230 align:start position:0%
one positive feedback relative to the
hybrid

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
hybrid
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
meeting that we had the other day
 
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
the complaint was that if you
 
00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 align:start position:0%
weren't in the room you couldn't be
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
heard by the people
 
00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:42.080 align:start position:0%
joining virtually and
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
what does that mean it means that you
 
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:45.510 align:start position:0%
what does that mean it means that you
know

00:07:45.510 --> 00:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:48.160 align:start position:0%
we could be doing this for nothing
 
00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
because if
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
committee members can't hear and the
 
00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:56.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:00.160 align:start position:0%
i've heard from those that have done the
 
00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
meetings completely virtual that they
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
don't seem to have a problem
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
with the voice
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
so i'm trying to get a ruling
 
00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:16.560 align:start position:0%
from my leadership that we can do
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's meeting completely virtual
 
00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:26.150 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:08:26.150 --> 00:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
well probably front but i will anyway
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
is that most of you that can
 
00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
do it virtually because the
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
chances of being able to understand more
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
would be better i know that
 
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:47.680 align:start position:0%
commerce last week when they met
 
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:50.000 align:start position:0%
they only had two in the room the
 
00:08:51.509 --> 00:08:51.519 align:start position:0%
chairman and others were
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
all virtual and they seem to seem to
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
work out
 
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.120 align:start position:0%
so uh hopefully i'll have
 
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:02.560 align:start position:0%
better news uh but
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
we have to have a hybrid meeting
 
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
tomorrow so i'll be there
 
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:10.240 align:start position:0%
i don't expect to have many others there
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
but do what you think is right
 
00:09:18.389 --> 00:09:18.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
what we plan on doing is
 
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
when we do meet tomorrow
 
00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
norm i do have my hand up okay i wasn't
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
looking at the hands yet
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
but uh go ahead tom um i appreciate the
 
00:09:36.949 --> 00:09:36.959 align:start position:0%
schedule way ahead the work sessions
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
generally go from nine to twelve
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
do you expect them also to go a certain
 
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
amount of time in the afternoon
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
just need it okay but it's probably not
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
like it's gonna go to a three or
 
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.080 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:09:50.949 --> 00:09:50.959 align:start position:0%
it depends on you guys oh okay but where
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
you have so many work schedules planned
 
00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:53.519 align:start position:0%
out yeah
 
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
okay now on those work schedules what's
 
00:09:58.389 --> 00:09:58.399 align:start position:0%
also going to happen
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
is that we're making arrangements to um
 
00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
suggested he gave us three names of
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
representing from the medical to talk
 
00:10:21.519 --> 00:10:24.949 align:start position:0%
representing from the medical to talk
about

00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:28.550 --> 00:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
the vaccine and the cholera about
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
19. what's that about covert 19.
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
yes and then what's the possibility that
 
00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
things are going to improve
 
00:10:43.269 --> 00:10:43.279 align:start position:0%
or get worse and what do they think
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
we need to understand that will
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
greatly affect what we think revenues
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
are going to do
 
00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm working to make that part of the
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
work sessions
 
00:11:00.949 --> 00:11:00.959 align:start position:0%
also was one of the
 
00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
main areas i can't remember right now
 
00:11:07.670 --> 00:11:07.680 align:start position:0%
represent major this is chris um
 
00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
so i reached out to dr chan through john
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
williams at
 
00:11:12.630 --> 00:11:12.640 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:14.160 align:start position:0%
this morning to try to arrange a time
 
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
for him to come talk to the committee
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
about the pandemic and the vaccinations
 
00:11:19.990 --> 00:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
and everything else that you may have
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
questions about
 
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
i've also reached out to the restaurant
 
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:24.240 align:start position:0%
and lodging
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
association that's it i have not heard
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
back from either one of those yet but
 
00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
once i do i'm trying to schedule them on
 
00:11:32.069 --> 00:11:32.079 align:start position:0%
those days that you just mentioned that
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
you would be doing work
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
the 9th 16th or the 18th after the
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
governor's budget director comes in
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
so once i have confirmation i will let
 
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:42.880 align:start position:0%
the committee know so
 
00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:46.640 align:start position:0%
what was brought up yesterday
 
00:11:50.069 --> 00:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
uh suggestions on who we would like to
 
00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:52.240 align:start position:0%
hear from we're working on that
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
in addition i was trying to get somebody
 
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:01.120 align:start position:0%
from the
 
00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
federal reserve bank of boston to
 
00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:06.320 align:start position:0%
present the economic update from
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
national new england
 
00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:11.600 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire at our january
 
00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.550 align:start position:0%
and new hampshire at our january
meetings

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:12.560 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
that they don't do that up
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
for curry from like the 8th of january
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
to the 28th
 
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:26.240 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to try to sneak them in on
 
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of these work sessions to get
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
an update on the uh what's happened
 
00:12:36.629 --> 00:12:36.639 align:start position:0%
what they feel is happening
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
relative to the economy
 
00:12:44.230 --> 00:12:44.240 align:start position:0%
nationally new england and new hampshire
 
00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
and then what will
 
00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
what they feel will happen if
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:00.069 --> 00:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
vaccine problem and things go well with
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
the vaccinations
 
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.480 align:start position:0%
and what do they feel will happen if it
 
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't go well
 
00:13:07.910 --> 00:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
the vaccination or something else
 
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:11.200 align:start position:0%
happens so we need to
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
understand what those extremes might be
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
from from
 
00:13:16.949 --> 00:13:16.959 align:start position:0%
say somebody from the federal reserve
 
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:19.360 align:start position:0%
bank of boston so
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll we can work that in
 
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:22.790 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll we can work that in
before

00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
we do our revenue estimates
 
00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:33.829 --> 00:13:33.839 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes oh are you saying we
 
00:13:34.470 --> 00:13:34.480 align:start position:0%
would vote
 
00:13:40.230 --> 00:13:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:42.880 align:start position:0%
because if we hear important information
 
00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
on the 18th
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
that would be too late for us to really
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
if we i purposely
 
00:13:58.389 --> 00:13:58.399 align:start position:0%
put some time between what we heard
 
00:14:03.829 --> 00:14:03.839 align:start position:0%
on the 18th which is on a thursday
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
to give us some time to do our own
 
00:14:11.829 --> 00:14:11.839 align:start position:0%
research and be prepared on the 23rd
 
00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
which is the following tuesday
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
oh thank you you hadn't mentioned the
 
00:14:18.389 --> 00:14:18.399 align:start position:0%
23rd yet
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
you mentioned the 19th which is a friday
 
00:14:25.990 --> 00:14:26.000 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry notes that you
 
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
anything for f
 
00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:36.000 align:start position:0%
for friday the 19th did you he had 23rd
 
00:14:39.189 --> 00:14:39.199 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i heard that
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
somehow the 23rd is a lot better
 
00:14:44.949 --> 00:14:44.959 align:start position:0%
i've stayed away from mondays and
 
00:14:44.959 --> 00:14:47.110 align:start position:0%
i've stayed away from mondays and
fridays

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
fridays
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
and only use those as a backup
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
and also be able to use those maybe as
 
00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.670 align:start position:0%
and also be able to use those maybe as
caucuses

00:14:55.670 --> 00:14:55.680 align:start position:0%
caucuses
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%

00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:08.240 align:start position:0%
so norm we will exact a number of bills

25th
 
00:16:14.949 --> 00:16:14.959 align:start position:0%
oh yes what i plan to do is that
 
00:16:14.959 --> 00:16:20.829 align:start position:0%
oh yes what i plan to do is that
on

00:16:20.829 --> 00:16:20.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when we have those other seven
 
00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:28.399 align:start position:0%
public hearings if we have any free time
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
i there's four bills
 
00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
i want to exact and i've gone over these
 
00:16:42.310 --> 00:16:42.320 align:start position:0%
with susan
 
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
and susan has gone over those with her
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
caucus and i've gone over those
 
00:16:49.990 --> 00:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
my caucus but i'm going to go over again
 
00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:52.240 align:start position:0%
today with my caucus
 
00:16:55.990 --> 00:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it seems that both caucuses are
 
00:16:56.949 --> 00:16:56.959 align:start position:0%
lined up on
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
four of the bills so we must get those
 
00:17:02.310 --> 00:17:02.320 align:start position:0%
out we need to get the early bill out
 
00:17:07.429 --> 00:17:07.439 align:start position:0%
which is 5 33.
 
00:17:10.710 --> 00:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
so uh bear with me tomorrow
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
if we get an extra 15 minutes in between
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
herrings tomorrow would we do an exact
 
00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:18.789 align:start position:0%
herrings tomorrow would we do an exact
session

00:17:18.789 --> 00:17:18.799 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
and then after the last pill we'll do
 
00:17:25.510 --> 00:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
if we had an exec those four we'll work
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
on that
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
thank you and i may have missed it i
 
00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480 align:start position:0%

on the 24th and 23rd
[Music]

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]

in our caucus they said be prepared
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
on the for a session on the 24th and
 
00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.750 align:start position:0%
on the for a session on the 24th and
23rd

00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
23rd
 
00:17:53.029 --> 00:17:53.039 align:start position:0%
and they're trying to work out the
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
details okay
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:00.470 --> 00:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
i would expect that we will have a
 
00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.830 align:start position:0%
i would expect that we will have a
caucus

00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440 align:start position:0%
we need to get the early bills out
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
i mean we will have a session we need to
 
00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
all right any any further questions
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.549 --> 00:18:22.559 align:start position:0%
then we will get into the
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
revenues starting with liquor
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%

did yesterday or i can just leave the
 
00:18:45.270 --> 00:18:45.280 align:start position:0%
screen blank for the moment you can tell
 
00:18:46.870 --> 00:18:46.880 align:start position:0%

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
and while he's pulling up the worksheet
 
00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
you have the
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
handout that was presented to us
 
00:19:03.750 --> 00:19:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
so you should see the worksheet now
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
yes and um column d
 
00:19:15.190 --> 00:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
is the liquor revenue and column k
 
00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:34.710 --> 00:19:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:36.830 --> 00:19:36.840 align:start position:0%

00:19:45.270 --> 00:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
with me as our cfo tina demirs
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
mr chairman uh what we've presented a
 
00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
few days ago is the numbers that
 
00:19:55.110 --> 00:19:55.120 align:start position:0%
that we are that we're comfortable with
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
our sales were strong in the month of
 
00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
january due to a sale that we run that
 
00:20:02.149 --> 00:20:02.159 align:start position:0%
includes all products
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh right at the moment our total
 
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
uh right at the moment our total
revenues

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
are up 4.7 or
 
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:12.720 align:start position:0%
4 million and our liquor revenue to plan
 
00:20:17.029 --> 00:20:17.039 align:start position:0%
is up 5.3 or 4.1 million
 
00:20:18.789 --> 00:20:18.799 align:start position:0%
but we are comfortable with the numbers
 
00:20:20.230 --> 00:20:20.240 align:start position:0%
that we've proposed
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
and we don't expect to see any changes
 
00:20:25.029 --> 00:20:25.039 align:start position:0%
moving forward toward the end of the
 
00:20:25.039 --> 00:20:28.230 align:start position:0%
moving forward toward the end of the
year

00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.029 --> 00:20:37.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:40.070 --> 00:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
00:20:44.070 --> 00:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
so when i look at hi hi uh uh
 
00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
joe how you doing so listen
 
00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
the target was uh 133.8
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
million that was the plan it looks like
 
00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
you're still holding it
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
the rest of your coming in at 129 is
 
00:20:58.549 --> 00:20:58.559 align:start position:0%
that what you're saying
 
00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:01.280 align:start position:0%
that's correct even though even though
 
00:21:03.190 --> 00:21:03.200 align:start position:0%
you think that the strength there
 
00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:05.360 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to make up that ground
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
no well you'll notice that the transfer
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
to the alcohol fund is 18.5 million
 
00:21:14.830 --> 00:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
so that's right that's that's up
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
230 percent or 11.5 million dollars so
 
00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:23.760 align:start position:0%
you know it's that's the balance of of
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
where where the money ends up so right
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
but you're expecting a pretty robust
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
increase from that
 
00:21:35.590 --> 00:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh was that that wasn't a one-time
 
00:21:39.830 --> 00:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
every year we do five percent which is
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
the 10 million
 
00:21:45.669 --> 00:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
and then this this past budget cycle
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
they added the new
 
00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh law that allows for hhs to ask for
 
00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:52.640 align:start position:0%
additional funds if the
 
00:21:54.549 --> 00:21:54.559 align:start position:0%
granted advantage account is going to
 
00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:57.039 align:start position:0%
fall short and that's the additional 8.5
 
00:21:57.830 --> 00:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're asking for
 
00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:02.360 align:start position:0%
this year okay so in your 136
 
00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
136.6 136.3
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't it does it
 
00:22:11.590 --> 00:22:11.600 align:start position:0%
what does it anticipate it includes the
 
00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360 align:start position:0%
ten million dollars at five percent of
 
00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:15.200 align:start position:0%
our gross profit from prior year it does
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
not include any additional funds that
 
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
they may need because that would be
 
00:22:19.350 --> 00:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
their quarterly review each year okay
 
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
all right that makes you now that
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
reminded me what
 
00:22:29.190 --> 00:22:29.200 align:start position:0%
why there's such a difference between
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
the 129 and 136
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
that there was an extra payment that had
 
00:22:34.390 --> 00:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
to be made okay thank you
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:43.029 --> 00:22:43.039 align:start position:0%
oh thank you uh can you hear me
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
yes okay um just
 
00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
uh the question is uh looking forward
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
to 202 and 23.
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
what are they can you speak to us about
 
00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:58.230 align:start position:0%
what are they can you speak to us about
the

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:04.549 --> 00:23:04.559 align:start position:0%
get in the way of achieving those
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that you've got
 
00:23:08.549 --> 00:23:08.559 align:start position:0%
as your estimate what are the what are
 
00:23:11.430 --> 00:23:11.440 align:start position:0%
the downside risks
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
well we don't we don't foresee any
 
00:23:15.190 --> 00:23:15.200 align:start position:0%
downside risk the market
 
00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
the market is strong our sales are
 
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:18.310 align:start position:0%
the market is strong our sales are
strong

00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
strong
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
our brand is is doing well we're
 
00:23:24.789 --> 00:23:24.799 align:start position:0%
we've closed some stores as you all know
 
00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:25.110 align:start position:0%
we've closed some stores as you all know
and

00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:27.750 --> 00:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
consolidated others and are building six
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
new stores this year
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
so we don't foresee any risk in our
 
00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.830 align:start position:0%
so we don't foresee any risk in our
market

00:23:33.830 --> 00:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
in our sales market in order to meet
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
those numbers
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
again those numbers pose
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
the five percent to uh transfer to hhs
 
00:23:48.830 --> 00:23:48.840 align:start position:0%
so if hhs's
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
numbers expound beyond that
 
00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:53.200 align:start position:0%
that will affect those numbers that you
 
00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:55.029 align:start position:0%
that will affect those numbers that you
see

00:23:55.029 --> 00:23:55.039 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:01.669 --> 00:24:01.679 align:start position:0%
but as we've always said representative
 
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:03.200 align:start position:0%
our our job is to
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
is to make the money and bring the
 
00:24:07.269 --> 00:24:07.279 align:start position:0%
profit in and where the money goes
 
00:24:11.029 --> 00:24:11.039 align:start position:0%
is is the job of the
 
00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
of the legislature so we always we just
 
00:24:16.149 --> 00:24:16.159 align:start position:0%
do our best to make the funds and then
 
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
wherever the funds are allocated that's
 
00:24:21.029 --> 00:24:21.039 align:start position:0%
that's certainly fine with us sir
 
00:24:22.870 --> 00:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you you answered my
 
00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.789 align:start position:0%
okay well thank you you answered my
question

00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:27.830 --> 00:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.669 --> 00:24:31.679 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chairman
 
00:24:35.190 --> 00:24:35.200 align:start position:0%
on we we at them
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
at the moment we are selling to a
 
00:24:39.909 --> 00:24:39.919 align:start position:0%
captive population that is stuck
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
in their second homes in new hampshire
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
and on working remotely and
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's conjectured on drinking and smoking
 
00:24:52.390 --> 00:24:52.400 align:start position:0%
and doing a few other things like that
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
uh more than they used to um
 
00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
do you are you assuming that once
 
00:25:02.470 --> 00:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
dave a number of them have moved
 
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
back and we
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
have tourism running properly again
 
00:25:12.390 --> 00:25:12.400 align:start position:0%
that we will uh we will just substitute
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
the tourism
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
for that and that we will be able to
 
00:25:17.510 --> 00:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
continue to grow
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
grow the market well our
 
00:25:23.510 --> 00:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
our numbers are are continually
 
00:25:25.269 --> 00:25:25.279 align:start position:0%
representing that 50
 
00:25:28.390 --> 00:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
of our 50 51 of our business
 
00:25:30.789 --> 00:25:30.799 align:start position:0%
is cross-border sales and that has not
 
00:25:30.799 --> 00:25:31.750 align:start position:0%
is cross-border sales and that has not
changed

00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
changed
 
00:25:34.310 --> 00:25:34.320 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic uh we've seen a
 
00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:34.950 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic uh we've seen a
slight

00:25:34.950 --> 00:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
slight
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
increase in in in-state sales and
 
00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:38.950 align:start position:0%
increase in in in-state sales and
obviously

00:25:38.950 --> 00:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
uh the real estate market in the in the
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire is very hot at
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
the moment
 
00:25:47.029 --> 00:25:47.039 align:start position:0%
you're hard pressed to find a house on
 
00:25:49.510 --> 00:25:49.520 align:start position:0%
the market for more than a few days so
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
we've certainly enjoyed that market and
 
00:25:54.149 --> 00:25:54.159 align:start position:0%
people moving into the state
 
00:25:56.549 --> 00:25:56.559 align:start position:0%
and a lot of those people are working
 
00:25:57.750 --> 00:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
remotely from
 
00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
wherever whatever state they came from
 
00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:00.950 align:start position:0%
wherever whatever state they came from
and

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:26:03.510 --> 00:26:03.520 align:start position:0%
uh we're probably visiting our state as
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
tourists prior to that
 
00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
so uh it really hasn't affected it
 
00:26:10.070 --> 00:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
hasn't affected the balance of our
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
sales so we really don't uh we haven't
 
00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.269 align:start position:0%
sales so we really don't uh we haven't
seen

00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
what i would consider a tremendous spike
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
and we certainly don't intend to see
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
anything fall off given that our
 
00:26:22.830 --> 00:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales have remained
 
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.590 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales have remained
consistent

00:26:25.590 --> 00:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
thank you very much could you i was
 
00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:30.400 align:start position:0%
trying to look at the previous
 
00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
trying to look at the previous
presentation

00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
00:26:34.549 --> 00:26:34.559 align:start position:0%
and you didn't do a chart that
 
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:37.760 align:start position:0%
explained the factors that that produced
 
00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:37.990 align:start position:0%
explained the factors that that produced
your

00:26:37.990 --> 00:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates in that at least i
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
uh just now do we did we get given
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
on on slide five
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
we showed the breakdown of our revenue
 
00:26:56.310 --> 00:26:56.320 align:start position:0%
categories and the growth
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
so this has our revenue from
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
liquor and wine our revenue from
 
00:27:06.390 --> 00:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
beer and our other revenue and then if
 
00:27:07.669 --> 00:27:07.679 align:start position:0%
you go to slide
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
six you can see that
 
00:27:13.510 --> 00:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
we've shown with that revenue and our
 
00:27:16.149 --> 00:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
expenses what our total net profit
 
00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:19.679 align:start position:0%
equates to so we should be able to tell
 
00:27:21.510 --> 00:27:21.520 align:start position:0%
it from slides five and
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
six when we can find slides five and six
 
00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:24.960 align:start position:0%
i can't
 
00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
do both pages at once when you're
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
sharing the screen i can't
 
00:27:34.149 --> 00:27:34.159 align:start position:0%
can't split my screen
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
that is correct though the breakdown is
 
00:27:38.950 --> 00:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
on five and six and it flows into
 
00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
slide um eight and nine
 
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
where it shows you the breakdown of
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
what's being transferred to the general
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
fund to hhs
 
00:27:48.789 --> 00:27:48.799 align:start position:0%
and what's being transferred for the
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
beer tax
 
00:27:53.990 --> 00:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i would recommend
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
that you have a printed copy
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
with you when you're at these meetings
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
because they do have that type of
 
00:28:04.870 --> 00:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
information the other thing on the
 
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:05.669 align:start position:0%
information the other thing on the
crossbar

00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
crossbar
 
00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
border sales i live right on the board
 
00:28:12.149 --> 00:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
in plaster and if you go by the liquor
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
store or any stores in plaster
 
00:28:18.389 --> 00:28:18.399 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of licenses that you
 
00:28:18.399 --> 00:28:18.710 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of licenses that you
see

00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:18.720 align:start position:0%
see
 
00:28:21.909 --> 00:28:21.919 align:start position:0%
are out of state primarily massachusetts
 
00:28:26.070 --> 00:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
that so i i agree with the commission
 
00:28:32.549 --> 00:28:32.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
um hold on one second i'm gonna

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:14.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner um so when when the virus
 
00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:15.190 align:start position:0%
commissioner um so when when the virus
started

00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:16.880 align:start position:0%
what would you i think when you
 
00:29:19.269 --> 00:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
testified uh you know maybe about nine
 
00:29:20.549 --> 00:29:20.559 align:start position:0%
months ago
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
that the the phenomenon was that uh
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
store sales uh increased as restaurant
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
sales decreased
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
so as the as the far as the as the virus
 
00:29:31.919 --> 00:29:32.630 align:start position:0%
so as the as the far as the as the virus
diminishes

00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
diminishes
 
00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
are you you anticipating that the
 
00:29:36.630 --> 00:29:36.640 align:start position:0%
reverse will be true
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
that uh obviously restaurants as they
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
open now they're never going to open to
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
where they were in terms of the numbers
 
00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:43.510 align:start position:0%
where they were in terms of the numbers
but

00:29:43.510 --> 00:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
but you're expecting the reverse to be
 
00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
true that
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
it'll kind of wash out that that more
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
more liquor will be consumed in a
 
00:29:53.510 --> 00:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant and less at your stores
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
well representative what we've seen thus
 
00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:57.029 align:start position:0%
well representative what we've seen thus
far

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
far
 
00:30:00.789 --> 00:30:00.799 align:start position:0%
is at the height of the pandemic
 
00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:03.840 align:start position:0%
restaurant sales were off as much
 
00:30:07.590 --> 00:30:07.600 align:start position:0%
as 45 to 50 percent
 
00:30:11.430 --> 00:30:11.440 align:start position:0%
and and since that has declined
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
some at this point as of january 31st
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
2021 uh our on-premise partners were
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
only down
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
25.3 so we're already starting to see
 
00:30:28.230 --> 00:30:28.240 align:start position:0%
uh that the revenues from that area
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
increase uh so we're we're very pleased
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
obviously they're a very important part
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
of our business an important part of our
 
00:30:36.159 --> 00:30:37.269 align:start position:0%
of our business an important part of our
economy

00:30:37.269 --> 00:30:37.279 align:start position:0%
economy
 
00:30:40.549 --> 00:30:40.559 align:start position:0%
so with that though our sales have
 
00:30:40.559 --> 00:30:41.830 align:start position:0%
so with that though our sales have
continued

00:30:41.830 --> 00:30:41.840 align:start position:0%
continued
 
00:30:45.909 --> 00:30:45.919 align:start position:0%
to go up but we also feel that
 
00:30:48.230 --> 00:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
you know given the sale that we run in
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
any particular month as i've just said
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
the past month is was a very popular
 
00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:54.230 align:start position:0%
the past month is was a very popular
sale

00:30:54.230 --> 00:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
sale
 
00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
and the sales will will trend up and now
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
when in february and march when we do
 
00:31:03.269 --> 00:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
uh i don't want to say less popular
 
00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
sales but sales of
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
less grandeur you'll see those sales
 
00:31:08.399 --> 00:31:09.509 align:start position:0%
less grandeur you'll see those sales
decline

00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:31:12.710 --> 00:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
as we come back into the spring you'll
 
00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:14.960 align:start position:0%
see the sales increase again
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
so the the traffic remains consistent
 
00:31:21.669 --> 00:31:21.679 align:start position:0%
uh the gross profit is strong because we
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
haven't run any gift card sales for the
 
00:31:24.159 --> 00:31:24.950 align:start position:0%
haven't run any gift card sales for the
year

00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
but and we don't intend to run any at
 
00:31:28.630 --> 00:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
least for this
 
00:31:31.669 --> 00:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
upcoming uh fiscal year okay but it's
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
nice to see that our restaurant partners
 
00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
are starting to gain
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
some ground back and people are feeling
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
comfortable and
 
00:31:41.430 --> 00:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
and going out and that that attributes
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
to their growth
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you
 
00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:46.990 align:start position:0%
okay thank you thank you thank you
representative

00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative thank you mr chair i'm
 
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
just curious if we have any visibility
 
00:31:56.470 --> 00:31:56.480 align:start position:0%
into the 22 23 numbers that hhs
 
00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
might want more than their five percent
 
00:31:59.830 --> 00:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
that would give us a little downside on
 
00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
these numbers if they come back in and
 
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
those numbers are based off of the
 
00:32:09.509 --> 00:32:09.519 align:start position:0%
quarterly review that they do
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
in the fund so we wouldn't know until
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
each of those years
 
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:15.200 align:start position:0%
and and at this point we don't know if
 
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to need more
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
when they do their next quarterly review
 
00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:20.080 align:start position:0%
for this year right now they're
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
projecting that they need the 18.5 but
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
if if for some reasons their funds look
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
like they're going to be a little short
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year we could
 
00:32:28.159 --> 00:32:28.789 align:start position:0%
by the end of the year we could
potentially

00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
have to transfer more
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
and obviously representative that's not
 
00:32:35.990 --> 00:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
something that we're in control of
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
and as i've said we just earned the
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
funds here and
 
00:32:42.630 --> 00:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
and the legislature spends them the way
 
00:32:43.750 --> 00:32:43.760 align:start position:0%
they feel they need to
 
00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
and we're very comfortable with that
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
system okay
 
00:32:53.350 --> 00:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
representative are you all set i'm all
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%

what is actually taxable
 
00:35:13.990 --> 00:35:14.000 align:start position:0%

which is additional paid up insurance is
taxable

00:35:58.150 --> 00:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
taxable
 
00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
and technically that is offset because
 
00:36:01.829 --> 00:36:01.839 align:start position:0%
it's a policy
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
dividend so it's an in and out
 
00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
of the calculation there are
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
other considerations and insurance
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
that will also be taxable
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh the insurance companies will
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
provide us with that information
 
00:36:26.310 --> 00:36:26.320 align:start position:0%
medic aid premium is subject to
 
00:36:29.829 --> 00:36:29.839 align:start position:0%
premium tax medicare
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
supplemental policies or known as
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
medigap policies which are sold by an
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
insurance company are subject to premium
 
00:36:39.680 --> 00:36:40.470 align:start position:0%
insurance company are subject to premium
tax

00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
this is not to be confused with a medic
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
aid medicare advantage plan
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
okay so what's
 
00:36:55.030 --> 00:36:55.040 align:start position:0%
tax exempt political
 
00:36:59.190 --> 00:36:59.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so any further norma
 
00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:02.560 align:start position:0%
you said not to be confused with the
 
00:37:05.750 --> 00:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh medicare advantage
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
plans correct yes there there are
 
00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:13.520 align:start position:0%
medicare medigap policies that are sold
 
00:37:16.550 --> 00:37:16.560 align:start position:0%
that are not have not been
 
00:37:20.829 --> 00:37:20.839 align:start position:0%
approved through the federal
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh center of medicare and medicaid
 
00:37:27.510 --> 00:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
services so they
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
are not medicare advantage plans
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
so the medicare advantage plans tax and
 
00:37:36.870 --> 00:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
not tax
 
00:37:42.390 --> 00:37:42.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
which okay which is brought up on the
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
next slide here
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
so medicare advantage plans which are
 
00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.430 align:start position:0%
so medicare advantage plans which are
sold

00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
sold
 
00:37:55.430 --> 00:37:55.440 align:start position:0%
through insurance companies
 
00:37:59.109 --> 00:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
are not taxable the other thing is the
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
political subdivisions
 
00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.240 align:start position:0%
so if a county city
 
00:38:08.069 --> 00:38:08.079 align:start position:0%
town or village purchases a
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
coverage of health or
 
00:38:14.150 --> 00:38:14.160 align:start position:0%
dental through the
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
insurance companies there is no tax
 
00:38:23.270 --> 00:38:23.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:26.470 --> 00:38:26.480 align:start position:0%
also medicare
 
00:38:30.829 --> 00:38:30.839 align:start position:0%
part d which is the
 
00:38:33.829 --> 00:38:33.839 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical coverage that
 
00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
is through the center of medicare
 
00:38:40.470 --> 00:38:40.480 align:start position:0%
and medicaid services that's not subject
 
00:38:43.510 --> 00:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
to premium tax
 
00:38:46.630 --> 00:38:46.640 align:start position:0%
federal employee health benefit programs
 
00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
are not subject to premium tax
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
servicemen's group life insurance
 
00:38:56.230 --> 00:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
and federal crop insurance are not
 
00:38:58.230 --> 00:38:58.240 align:start position:0%
subject to
 
00:39:02.230 --> 00:39:02.240 align:start position:0%
premium tax so that's
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
the the com part of the components
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
in deriving what the tax base is
 
00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
on this slide here is the fiscal year
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
2021 our current fiscal year
 
00:39:22.790 --> 00:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we're in
 
00:39:26.829 --> 00:39:26.839 align:start position:0%
in right now we had originally projected
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
130 million dollars and we had
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
subsequently changed that to 128.2
 
00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.950 align:start position:0%
subsequently changed that to 128.2
million

00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:39:39.670 --> 00:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
based on what was happening in the
 
00:39:39.680 --> 00:39:40.390 align:start position:0%
based on what was happening in the
markets

00:39:40.390 --> 00:39:40.400 align:start position:0%
markets
 
00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:44.000 align:start position:0%
the automobile
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
insurance refunds in the
 
00:39:50.710 --> 00:39:50.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment so if people were
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
not going to be covered by health
 
00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:54.790 align:start position:0%
not going to be covered by health
policies

00:39:54.790 --> 00:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
policies
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
and some of that was also a shift
 
00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
to possibly these people being eligible
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
for medic aid
 
00:40:08.550 --> 00:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
so currently and i think i jumped ahead
 
00:40:10.150 --> 00:40:10.160 align:start position:0%
here it should say
 
00:40:13.349 --> 00:40:13.359 align:start position:0%
as reported in december's revenue focus
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
we're currently 2 million dollars over
 
00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.349 align:start position:0%
we're currently 2 million dollars over
plan

00:40:17.349 --> 00:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:40:20.390 --> 00:40:20.400 align:start position:0%
and that's attributed to
 
00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:24.640 align:start position:0%
the fees that are collected
 
00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
for producer and adjusters licensing
 
00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.950 align:start position:0%
for producer and adjusters licensing
fees

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
fees
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh i really don't have an explanation
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
why there were a considerable
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
increase in the licensing
 
00:40:45.270 --> 00:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
but there were a number of adjusters
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
and producers that newly licensed
 
00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
in the last few few months
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
that were had not been licensed before
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
so and that's approximately one and a
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
half million
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
that's uh causing that increase
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
so now moving on to fiscal year 2022 and
 
00:41:12.079 --> 00:41:13.910 align:start position:0%
so now moving on to fiscal year 2022 and
2023.

00:41:13.910 --> 00:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
2023.
 
00:41:18.829 --> 00:41:18.839 align:start position:0%
again this is the summary of the
 
00:41:21.349 --> 00:41:21.359 align:start position:0%
calculation the tax
 
00:41:24.950 --> 00:41:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:28.309 --> 00:41:28.319 align:start position:0%
that is reduced by the
 
00:41:31.829 --> 00:41:31.839 align:start position:0%
prepayment and then we receive
 
00:41:34.630 --> 00:41:34.640 align:start position:0%
the estimated payment for the following
 
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.910 align:start position:0%
the estimated payment for the following
year

00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
there's also the unlicensed or
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
non-admitted market
 
00:41:43.349 --> 00:41:43.359 align:start position:0%
premium tax which we're coming down
 
00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
to what we estimate to be the premium
 
00:41:46.480 --> 00:41:47.270 align:start position:0%
to what we estimate to be the premium
tax

00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:50.640 align:start position:0%
revenue and again we're
 
00:41:53.750 --> 00:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
anticipating that it's going to be
 
00:41:57.270 --> 00:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
a slow recovery the
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
businesses and even may not come
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
back to buy the insurance then there may
 
00:42:06.550 --> 00:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
be further decreases in auto
 
00:42:10.790 --> 00:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the components that
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
led us to believe that 2022
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
would be less and then we would have
 
00:42:23.430 --> 00:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
an increase in premium tax for 2023
 
00:42:28.550 --> 00:42:28.560 align:start position:0%
hoping that the economy rebounds
 
00:42:32.630 --> 00:42:32.640 align:start position:0%
as an end result the current fiscal
 
00:42:36.990 --> 00:42:37.000 align:start position:0%
estimate for fiscal year 2022 is
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
127 million and
 
00:42:45.829 --> 00:42:45.839 align:start position:0%
2023 is 133.3 million
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
the next slide is the detail
 
00:42:53.349 --> 00:42:53.359 align:start position:0%
of the computation this slide is
 
00:42:56.550 --> 00:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
the actuaries information that is
 
00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
provided to us
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
for the uh premium growth
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
patterns and they're coming up with
 
00:43:07.829 --> 00:43:07.839 align:start position:0%
us by looking at what they're getting
 
00:43:07.839 --> 00:43:08.790 align:start position:0%
us by looking at what they're getting
for

00:43:08.790 --> 00:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
tax rates i mean not tax rates for
 
00:43:15.990 --> 00:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
the policy rates that they're approving
 
00:43:18.950 --> 00:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
and also what they're seeing in the
 
00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:19.910 align:start position:0%
and also what they're seeing in the
market

00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
market
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
so what ends up happening is the
 
00:43:26.309 --> 00:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
premium tax growth rates for the
 
00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:28.150 align:start position:0%
premium tax growth rates for the
projections

00:43:28.150 --> 00:43:28.160 align:start position:0%
projections
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
let's take for instance for fiscal year
 
00:43:30.319 --> 00:43:32.230 align:start position:0%
let's take for instance for fiscal year
2021

00:43:32.230 --> 00:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
2021
 
00:43:36.230 --> 00:43:36.240 align:start position:0%
the property and casualty is anticipated
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
to grow
 
00:43:40.550 --> 00:43:40.560 align:start position:0%
2.65 percent
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
on the next slide we have
 
00:43:48.150 --> 00:43:48.160 align:start position:0%
the amount
 
00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:51.839 align:start position:0%
that 2.65
 
00:43:55.750 --> 00:43:55.760 align:start position:0%
is multiplied times the actual
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
property and casualty premium
 
00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:05.440 align:start position:0%
of 2463.44
 
00:44:10.230 --> 00:44:10.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with the 2 billion 528
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
72 in the next column so that's how
 
00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
it rolls forward again the next column
 
00:44:21.430 --> 00:44:21.440 align:start position:0%
is the growth rate
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
of 2.55
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
times the calculated rate
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
of 2528.72
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
the following year again we go back
 
00:44:39.510 --> 00:44:39.520 align:start position:0%
to the growth rate of 2.55
 
00:44:42.710 --> 00:44:42.720 align:start position:0%
multiply it times our 2
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
2 593.2
 
00:44:49.510 --> 00:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
to derive it what the estimated
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
premium written for property casualty
 
00:44:56.150 --> 00:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
will be and that's how this whole
 
00:44:56.160 --> 00:44:56.790 align:start position:0%
will be and that's how this whole
schedule

00:44:56.790 --> 00:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
schedule
 
00:44:59.910 --> 00:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
works out you multiply
 
00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
the growth rates times the
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
price starting off with what was the
 
00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.190 align:start position:0%
price starting off with what was the
actual

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.200 align:start position:0%
actual
 
00:45:09.270 --> 00:45:09.280 align:start position:0%
calendar year to come up with the
 
00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.390 align:start position:0%
calendar year to come up with the
extrapolated

00:45:10.390 --> 00:45:10.400 align:start position:0%
extrapolated
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
next calendar year so
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
for premium written in total we're
 
00:45:20.710 --> 00:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
anticipating for fiscal year
 
00:45:23.990 --> 00:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
2021 that it would be
 
00:45:30.550 --> 00:45:30.560 align:start position:0%
6 billion 462.17
 
00:45:34.470 --> 00:45:34.480 align:start position:0%
in again the the
 
00:45:38.309 --> 00:45:38.319 align:start position:0%
columns just put down fiscal year 2022
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
6 billion 486 million 0.72
 
00:45:47.349 --> 00:45:47.359 align:start position:0%
in the following year slight increase of
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
on the next slide we have
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
the first line takes
 
00:46:03.750 --> 00:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
the property and casualty lines
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
that are taxed at one and a quarter
 
00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.390 align:start position:0%
that are taxed at one and a quarter
percent

00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
so we're simply taking one and a quarter
 
00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:11.670 align:start position:0%
so we're simply taking one and a quarter
percent

00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
and multiplying it we've got
 
00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
the premium tax is adding together the
 
00:46:24.470 --> 00:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
four first four lines on slide eight
 
00:46:28.230 --> 00:46:28.240 align:start position:0%
to come up with what the
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
premium tax net premium tax is
 
00:46:35.270 --> 00:46:35.280 align:start position:0%
at one in a quarter and then
 
00:46:39.270 --> 00:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
we add the as i mentioned what was
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
taxable was the finance
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
charges in any
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the other charges
 
00:46:51.349 --> 00:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
that are assessed to come up with the
 
00:46:55.030 --> 00:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
new tax base of
 
00:46:59.270 --> 00:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
3 billion 158.8
 
00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720 align:start position:0%
and that's basically the information
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
going across the page for
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
the business lines that are taxed at
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%

00:47:14.069 --> 00:47:14.079 align:start position:0%

00:47:17.510 --> 00:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
going back to slide eight in adding
 
00:47:17.520 --> 00:47:20.630 align:start position:0%
going back to slide eight in adding
the

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.190 --> 00:47:23.200 align:start position:0%

00:47:29.910 --> 00:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:33.510 --> 00:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
taxable and then we deduct
 
00:47:37.589 --> 00:47:37.599 align:start position:0%
the tax-exempt part medicaid
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
to come up with what is the
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
taxable base at two percent
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
so after we've got the
 
00:47:58.190 --> 00:47:58.200 align:start position:0%
on the next slide is actually the
 
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.390 align:start position:0%
on the next slide is actually the
calculations

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:00.400 align:start position:0%
calculations
 
00:48:03.589 --> 00:48:03.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:09.030 --> 00:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
prior information the
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
net taxable for property in
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
life multiplying that times one and a
 
00:48:17.599 --> 00:48:18.950 align:start position:0%
life multiplying that times one and a
quarter

00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%

00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:22.160 align:start position:0%
and taking the medicare
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
the medical in health at two percent to
 
00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
with the 1.3
 
00:48:33.430 --> 00:48:33.440 align:start position:0%
100 103 million point
 
00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
eight and that's
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
how the the works all the way across
 
00:48:44.230 --> 00:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
is that just multiplying the
 
00:48:47.510 --> 00:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
net taxable premium times
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
the applicable new hampshire rate of
 
00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:53.680 align:start position:0%
either one and a quarter or two percent
 
00:48:57.670 --> 00:48:57.680 align:start position:0%
we also have the retaliatory tax rate
 
00:49:01.190 --> 00:49:01.200 align:start position:0%
that is actually based on
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
what additional tax
 
00:49:07.349 --> 00:49:07.359 align:start position:0%
is collected because i mentioned
 
00:49:10.710 --> 00:49:10.720 align:start position:0%
in our other presentation there is a
 
00:49:12.630 --> 00:49:12.640 align:start position:0%
retaliatory provision
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
which allows us to collect
 
00:49:20.870 --> 00:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
the greater of the tax rate
 
00:49:23.829 --> 00:49:23.839 align:start position:0%
that the company's state of domicile
 
00:49:23.839 --> 00:49:24.790 align:start position:0%
that the company's state of domicile
charges

00:49:24.790 --> 00:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
charges
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
as opposed to what new hampshire charges
 
00:49:33.750 --> 00:49:33.760 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
amount is actually i look at the
 
00:49:40.230 --> 00:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
last three years average
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
in the last five years average and
 
00:49:46.390 --> 00:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
estimate it based on what i see the
 
00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:47.349 align:start position:0%
estimate it based on what i see the
trend

00:49:47.349 --> 00:49:47.359 align:start position:0%
trend
 
00:49:51.589 --> 00:49:51.599 align:start position:0%
going so that's merely a
 
00:49:55.270 --> 00:49:55.280 align:start position:0%
estimate based on what the
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:04.549 --> 00:50:04.559 align:start position:0%
the retaliatory items are
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
again when a
 
00:50:13.430 --> 00:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
company is domiciled in
 
00:50:15.430 --> 00:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
delaware for instance delaware has a
 
00:50:17.190 --> 00:50:17.200 align:start position:0%
fraud fee
 
00:50:20.390 --> 00:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
so because delaware assesses that fraud
 
00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:22.240 align:start position:0%
fee on a new hampshire company doing
 
00:50:24.710 --> 00:50:24.720 align:start position:0%
business in delaware
 
00:50:27.750 --> 00:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire collects on
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the delaware companies that are doing
 
00:50:32.630 --> 00:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
business in new hampshire
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
the purpose of that is again to equalize
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
the tax burden so
 
00:50:50.549 --> 00:50:50.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.670 --> 00:50:53.680 align:start position:0%
an assessment that new hampshire doesn't
 
00:50:53.680 --> 00:50:54.630 align:start position:0%
an assessment that new hampshire doesn't
have

00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:50:57.670 --> 00:50:57.680 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire will retaliate
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
because again the new hampshire
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
companies are paying
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
that assessment in the company in the
 
00:51:04.079 --> 00:51:04.870 align:start position:0%
that assessment in the company in the
state

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:51:08.230 --> 00:51:08.240 align:start position:0%
that is assessing has the assessment
 
00:51:11.589 --> 00:51:11.599 align:start position:0%
number i have a question okay
 
00:51:14.790 --> 00:51:14.800 align:start position:0%
um the retaliatory tax
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:25.510 --> 00:51:25.520 align:start position:0%
the 9.4 the tax rate is isn't
 
00:51:29.109 --> 00:51:29.119 align:start position:0%
what i'm doing there is i'm taking an
 
00:51:32.230 --> 00:51:32.240 align:start position:0%
average of the three the most recent
 
00:51:35.270 --> 00:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
three years in the most recent five
 
00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.470 align:start position:0%
three years in the most recent five
years

00:51:36.470 --> 00:51:36.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
actual and calculated
 
00:51:43.349 --> 00:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
in seeing which way the amounts are
 
00:51:43.359 --> 00:51:45.270 align:start position:0%
in seeing which way the amounts are
trending

00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
trending
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
so that the average of 9.4
 
00:51:51.750 --> 00:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
percent that would be the prior
 
00:51:54.870 --> 00:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
actual information that i had
 
00:51:58.230 --> 00:51:58.240 align:start position:0%
well the first column is for fiscal year
 
00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
2020 that is actual
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
that was nine point
 
00:52:07.589 --> 00:52:07.599 align:start position:0%
four nine million point four uh
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
but when i calculated out for fiscal
 
00:52:10.559 --> 00:52:11.309 align:start position:0%
but when i calculated out for fiscal
year

00:52:11.309 --> 00:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
2021 i looked at
 
00:52:18.069 --> 00:52:18.079 align:start position:0%
the 9.4 plus the
 
00:52:21.510 --> 00:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
actual amounts for the other four years
 
00:52:21.520 --> 00:52:22.390 align:start position:0%
actual amounts for the other four years
prior

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:52:25.750 --> 00:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
and there had been you know swings up
 
00:52:26.630 --> 00:52:26.640 align:start position:0%
and down
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
so when i looked at it it looked
 
00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.870 align:start position:0%
so when i looked at it it looked
potentially

00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
too decrease and again
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
what impacts the retaliatory tax rate is
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
when a a given company
 
00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:46.160 align:start position:0%
will re-domicile to another state
 
00:52:49.990 --> 00:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
for instance if a massachusetts company
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
redomiciles to wisconsin the
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
massachusetts rate
 
00:52:58.950 --> 00:52:58.960 align:start position:0%
of 2.28 no longer applies
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
they are governed by the tax rates in
 
00:53:02.079 --> 00:53:04.390 align:start position:0%
they are governed by the tax rates in
wisconsin

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
wisconsin
 
00:53:08.710 --> 00:53:08.720 align:start position:0%
what i really want to get at it's not
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
where you have retaliatory tax rate it's
 
00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
not the rate
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
it's the amount of money generated right
 
00:53:20.069 --> 00:53:20.079 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars yes yes yeah because
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
when i saw that i said okay
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
he said oh wow yes yes okay i should
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
have clear
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
clarified that that it's not that it's
 
00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:31.349 align:start position:0%
clarified that that it's not that it's
the

00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:53:33.829 --> 00:53:33.839 align:start position:0%
dollars collected it's a retaliatory
 
00:53:33.839 --> 00:53:35.030 align:start position:0%
dollars collected it's a retaliatory
amount

00:53:35.030 --> 00:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.069 align:start position:0%
amount
collected

00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:41.510 --> 00:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay we got that
 
00:53:45.910 --> 00:53:45.920 align:start position:0%
so now i come down to
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
mr chairman yes his hand up
 
00:53:52.230 --> 00:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
and i may have a different question
 
00:54:00.069 --> 00:54:00.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair uh great presentation
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
uh this is the most detail you've
 
00:54:07.990 --> 00:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
ever seen over the years this is great
 
00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:08.549 align:start position:0%
ever seen over the years this is great
uh

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
something that we obviously couldn't
 
00:54:11.670 --> 00:54:11.680 align:start position:0%
replicate um
 
00:54:13.430 --> 00:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
so you've done your homework here but
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
it's all it's all really driven on the
 
00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:17.200 align:start position:0%
premium tax growth rate
 
00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh most of this uh and that and i must
 
00:54:22.150 --> 00:54:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to double check it's both the
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the rates as well as the
 
00:54:25.430 --> 00:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
number of policies correct when they
 
00:54:28.470 --> 00:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
give you that growth rate it's both
 
00:54:31.829 --> 00:54:31.839 align:start position:0%
yes yes and so we're relying on these
 
00:54:31.839 --> 00:54:32.630 align:start position:0%
yes yes and so we're relying on these
consultant

00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%

00:54:50.390 --> 00:54:50.400 align:start position:0%
a firm that helped us
 
00:54:53.670 --> 00:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
calculate the growth rates no no
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
they're they are department
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
employees okay okay okay

so if you take over okay
 
00:55:10.549 --> 00:55:10.559 align:start position:0%
all right i'm upset um let me see who uh
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
represent me i think you have your hand
 
00:55:14.069 --> 00:55:14.079 align:start position:0%
up too
 
00:55:15.670 --> 00:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
thank you i just want to make sure you
 
00:55:17.230 --> 00:55:17.240 align:start position:0%
are going to explain to us what
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
retaliatory item basis is aren't you
 
00:55:23.190 --> 00:55:23.200 align:start position:0%
i don't remember ever seeing that one
 
00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.069 align:start position:0%
i don't remember ever seeing that one
sure

00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
that's when the state
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
as i said for instance delaware has a
 
00:55:31.430 --> 00:55:31.440 align:start position:0%
fraud fee
 
00:55:34.069 --> 00:55:34.079 align:start position:0%
california has a fraud fee pennsylvania
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
has the fraud free
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
and since the
 
00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire companies that do business
 
00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
in the other states
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
are charged those fraud fees
 
00:55:53.270 --> 00:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
we are able to charge
 
00:55:56.309 --> 00:55:56.319 align:start position:0%
the delaware pennsylvania
 
00:55:59.829 --> 00:55:59.839 align:start position:0%
california companies the same
 
00:56:03.190 --> 00:56:03.200 align:start position:0%
front fees
 
00:56:05.670 --> 00:56:05.680 align:start position:0%
based on what the business they do in
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:56:10.390 --> 00:56:10.400 align:start position:0%
we collect primarily from
 
00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
the massachusetts companies
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
and the illinois companies that do
 
00:56:21.750 --> 00:56:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
okay you all said repsome army
 
00:56:29.750 --> 00:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
okay so any other questions no no
 
00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:35.200 align:start position:0%
i think we're set for the moment can
 
00:56:37.109 --> 00:56:37.119 align:start position:0%
keep on you can keep on going okay
 
00:56:40.390 --> 00:56:40.400 align:start position:0%
all right okay so that brings us
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
down to the tax liability before credits
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
the business enterprise tax credit
 
00:56:51.670 --> 00:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
that the insurance companies pay
 
00:56:55.030 --> 00:56:55.040 align:start position:0%
that is allowed as a credit against the
 
00:56:55.040 --> 00:56:55.589 align:start position:0%
that is allowed as a credit against the
premium

00:56:55.589 --> 00:56:55.599 align:start position:0%
premium
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
tax and if there is
 
00:57:02.710 --> 00:57:02.720 align:start position:0%
a life in health guarantee fund
 
00:57:06.230 --> 00:57:06.240 align:start position:0%
class b assessment that applies
 
00:57:09.670 --> 00:57:09.680 align:start position:0%
the companies that are assessed
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
are allowed to take that
 
00:57:16.710 --> 00:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
over a five-year period as a credit
 
00:57:20.230 --> 00:57:20.240 align:start position:0%
the community development finance
 
00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:22.309 align:start position:0%
the community development finance
authority

00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:57:25.589 --> 00:57:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:28.789 --> 00:57:28.799 align:start position:0%
uh donates or contributes to a given
 
00:57:28.799 --> 00:57:30.150 align:start position:0%
uh donates or contributes to a given
project

00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:57:33.990 --> 00:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
they are allowed 75 of that contribution
 
00:57:38.710 --> 00:57:38.720 align:start position:0%
as a credit against the premium tax
 
00:57:44.710 --> 00:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:47.599 align:start position:0%
and from the tax liability we have
 
00:57:47.599 --> 00:57:49.670 align:start position:0%
and from the tax liability we have
received

00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
the estimated prepayment
 
00:58:00.230 --> 00:58:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.030 --> 00:58:03.040 align:start position:0%
so it's similar to any any business that
 
00:58:04.630 --> 00:58:04.640 align:start position:0%
during the tax year they pay
 
00:58:07.990 --> 00:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
an estimated payment uh we
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
actually collected all at tax season on
 
00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:11.990 align:start position:0%
actually collected all at tax season on
march

00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
march
 
00:58:15.030 --> 00:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
15th it's not a quarterly payment
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
as most companies would pay
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
so the net difference between
 
00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:24.400 align:start position:0%
what the tax liability is and what their
 
00:58:25.990 --> 00:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
credit is
 
00:58:29.270 --> 00:58:29.280 align:start position:0%
we use the term it's the true up
 
00:58:35.030 --> 00:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
now then based on what the tax liability
 
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.630 align:start position:0%
now then based on what the tax liability
is

00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:58:44.309 --> 00:58:44.319 align:start position:0%
the there's a hundred percent estimated
 
00:58:44.319 --> 00:58:44.870 align:start position:0%
the there's a hundred percent estimated
payment

00:58:44.870 --> 00:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
payment
 
00:58:48.150 --> 00:58:48.160 align:start position:0%
for the following year that comes
 
00:58:52.789 --> 00:58:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:54.630 --> 00:58:54.640 align:start position:0%
i'm incorrect because that does that
 
00:58:56.150 --> 00:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
says proceeding and it should say
 
00:58:58.710 --> 00:58:58.720 align:start position:0%
following year i'm sorry
 
00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:00.319 align:start position:0%
and that's supposed to be based on what
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
the tax liability is
 
00:59:04.309 --> 00:59:04.319 align:start position:0%
there's sometimes a cha little bit of a
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
change uh
 
00:59:10.150 --> 00:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
on occasion because companies will
 
00:59:11.990 --> 00:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
submit an additional payment
 
00:59:13.430 --> 00:59:13.440 align:start position:0%
anticipating that their
 
00:59:15.190 --> 00:59:15.200 align:start position:0%
tax liability the following year is
 
00:59:18.309 --> 00:59:18.319 align:start position:0%
going to be greater
 
00:59:21.430 --> 00:59:21.440 align:start position:0%
so with the
 
00:59:25.190 --> 00:59:25.200 align:start position:0%
true up in the estimated payment
 
00:59:28.309 --> 00:59:28.319 align:start position:0%
we come down to what our
 
00:59:32.069 --> 00:59:32.079 align:start position:0%
licensed companies tax
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
cash that we anticipate to collect
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
the unlicensed or non-admitted market
 
00:59:44.230 --> 00:59:44.240 align:start position:0%
again that is an estimated
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
number based on what the averages have
 
00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.230 align:start position:0%
number based on what the averages have
been

00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:59:54.630 --> 00:59:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:57.990 --> 00:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
we come down to what the premium tax
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.230 --> 01:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
then we have various fees
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
the majority of the fees that are
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
collected are from the licensing
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
of insurance producers and adjusters
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are also the fees for the
 
01:00:18.230 --> 01:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
licensing of the companies
 
01:00:21.750 --> 01:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
there are filing fees there's also
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
the penalties and fines that are
 
01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:25.670 align:start position:0%
the penalties and fines that are
assessed

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
assessed
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
that are included in the the fee
 
01:00:29.119 --> 01:00:32.630 align:start position:0%
that are included in the the fee
number

01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
the following number is that transfer
 
01:00:37.750 --> 01:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
for the granite advantage
 
01:00:40.789 --> 01:00:40.799 align:start position:0%
trust which is
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
two percent of the what is the medicare
 
01:00:47.270 --> 01:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
advantage premium
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
and that brings us down to what our cash
 
01:00:50.079 --> 01:00:50.710 align:start position:0%
and that brings us down to what our cash
basis

01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:00:54.069 --> 01:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
is for the revenue
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
there is a slight adjustment
 
01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:00.160 align:start position:0%
at the end of every fiscal year because
 
01:01:01.510 --> 01:01:01.520 align:start position:0%
we're collecting
 
01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
that estimated payment of
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
in the priory for the following year we
 
01:01:12.470 --> 01:01:12.480 align:start position:0%
have to we can only recognize
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
as of june 30th half of that revenue
 
01:01:19.030 --> 01:01:19.040 align:start position:0%
so there is a deferred revenue account
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
that accumulates that
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
deferred amount for accounting purposes
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
so i just like to you know let you know
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
because that number
 
01:01:35.829 --> 01:01:35.839 align:start position:0%
the accrued basis is what finally
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
is the number that shows up on the
 
01:01:37.680 --> 01:01:38.870 align:start position:0%
is the number that shows up on the
comprehensive

01:01:38.870 --> 01:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
so i think now it's just if there are
 
01:01:47.670 --> 01:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
01:01:50.870 --> 01:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
or anything that you feel you
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
want to have clarification yes
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
representative has a question
 
01:02:00.549 --> 01:02:00.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
how do you estimate what
 
01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
the transfer is going to have to be the
 
01:02:07.510 --> 01:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
granted advantage is it under current
 
01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.029 align:start position:0%
granted advantage is it under current
law

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:09.039 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
again this this number here after
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
at the next to the last line here
 
01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:34.720 align:start position:0%
granite advantage health plans
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're anticipating what
 
01:02:37.599 --> 01:02:38.549 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're anticipating what
the

01:02:38.549 --> 01:02:38.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
premium on that uh
 
01:02:45.670 --> 01:02:45.680 align:start position:0%
medic expansion would be
 
01:02:49.910 --> 01:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
and it's that premium tax
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
that is transferred over to the
 
01:02:55.750 --> 01:02:55.760 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
01:02:56.549 --> 01:02:56.559 align:start position:0%
to that
 
01:03:00.230 --> 01:03:00.240 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund and is that
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%
that estimate is based on what's written
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
in the law right now
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
01:03:09.910 --> 01:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
because they keep changing it every
 
01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:11.349 align:start position:0%
because they keep changing it every
biennium

01:03:11.349 --> 01:03:11.359 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
01:03:16.870 --> 01:03:16.880 align:start position:0%
yes they do
 
01:03:20.150 --> 01:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
so are there any other questions
 
01:03:21.910 --> 01:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
i see norm is back so i'm going to turn
 
01:03:23.829 --> 01:03:23.839 align:start position:0%
it back to norm
 
01:03:26.630 --> 01:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
you know i have no idea what the
 
01:03:26.640 --> 01:03:27.190 align:start position:0%
you know i have no idea what the
insurance

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
insurance
 
01:03:31.589 --> 01:03:31.599 align:start position:0%
department would ever do without norma
 
01:03:34.870 --> 01:03:34.880 align:start position:0%
oh i thank you you are so thorough and
 
01:03:38.710 --> 01:03:38.720 align:start position:0%
we've always taken your numbers uh
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of confidence well i
 
01:03:44.630 --> 01:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
i try i unfortunately am a very detailed
 
01:03:46.150 --> 01:03:46.160 align:start position:0%
person so i like to share the
 
01:03:47.750 --> 01:03:47.760 align:start position:0%
information that i have
 
01:03:50.950 --> 01:03:50.960 align:start position:0%
i know you are and i'm
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
norm norm there's one more hand up uh i
 
01:03:54.950 --> 01:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
01:03:59.430 --> 01:03:59.440 align:start position:0%
well there was
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
phillips yes yes thank you
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
i just uh i think i figured it out but
 
01:04:06.630 --> 01:04:06.640 align:start position:0%
when i look at page 10
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
or slide 10 of your presentation today
 
01:04:13.990 --> 01:04:14.000 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 21 i'm seeing that 127
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
million 960 number
 
01:04:17.990 --> 01:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
and then when i look at the revenue
 
01:04:20.630 --> 01:04:20.640 align:start position:0%
worksheet for column
 
01:04:24.829 --> 01:04:24.839 align:start position:0%
f for fiscal year 21 i'm seeing the
 
01:04:24.839 --> 01:04:26.309 align:start position:0%
f for fiscal year 21 i'm seeing the
range

01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
range
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
different and i'm just trying to figure
 
01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.390 align:start position:0%
different and i'm just trying to figure
out

01:04:30.390 --> 01:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:04:33.510 --> 01:04:33.520 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:04:36.309 --> 01:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
why it's reported one way in one slide
 
01:04:36.319 --> 01:04:36.950 align:start position:0%
why it's reported one way in one slide
and

01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:04:38.230 --> 01:04:38.240 align:start position:0%
then a different presentation is
 
01:04:41.829 --> 01:04:41.839 align:start position:0%
reported in a different way
 
01:04:44.950 --> 01:04:44.960 align:start position:0%
well the information that i reported on
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
slide five
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
was as presented to the house ways and
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
means for an update
 
01:04:54.789 --> 01:04:54.799 align:start position:0%
whereas the information on
 
01:04:57.430 --> 01:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
slide 10 is a little bit more with a
 
01:04:58.710 --> 01:04:58.720 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
01:05:02.549 --> 01:05:02.559 align:start position:0%
updated information once we had
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
some adjustments to the actual for
 
01:05:11.029 --> 01:05:11.039 align:start position:0%
calendar year 2019 which impacts fiscal
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
year 2020.
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
and again that would go back to your
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
previous statement about those insurance
 
01:05:15.839 --> 01:05:17.349 align:start position:0%
previous statement about those insurance
company

01:05:17.349 --> 01:05:17.359 align:start position:0%
company
 
01:05:19.109 --> 01:05:19.119 align:start position:0%
payouts and the reasons why they were
 
01:05:21.270 --> 01:05:21.280 align:start position:0%
reduced premium taxes
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
at the outset of your presentation today
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:28.789 --> 01:05:28.799 align:start position:0%
which are you you're talking about the
 
01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:30.960 align:start position:0%
pre estimated prepayments
 
01:05:32.870 --> 01:05:32.880 align:start position:0%
normally i think she's referring to the
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
uh the auto
 
01:05:35.829 --> 01:05:35.839 align:start position:0%
rep uh the auto rebates that we
 
01:05:38.710 --> 01:05:38.720 align:start position:0%
experienced over the summer yeah
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
i think outside of your presentation you
 
01:05:45.349 --> 01:05:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:49.029 --> 01:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
right we made some adjustments and
 
01:05:52.309 --> 01:05:52.319 align:start position:0%
but that impacted fiscal year 2021
 
01:05:56.630 --> 01:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
and that was part part of the reason for
 
01:06:00.230 --> 01:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
decreasing the original
 
01:06:04.230 --> 01:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
from the original
 
01:06:06.950 --> 01:06:06.960 align:start position:0%
great thank you very very good point
 
01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.069 align:start position:0%
great thank you very very good point
representative

01:06:08.069 --> 01:06:08.079 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:10.069 --> 01:06:10.079 align:start position:0%
yeah norm does that mean that chris is
 
01:06:11.910 --> 01:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
chris going to update our sheet to that
 
01:06:13.109 --> 01:06:13.119 align:start position:0%
new number
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
128 instead of google b
 
01:06:19.430 --> 01:06:19.440 align:start position:0%
so just so i can confirm what norma
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that for 21 it's
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
going to be 127.6 million
 
01:06:28.789 --> 01:06:28.799 align:start position:0%
instead of the 128.2 million
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
so norma just just so the committee
 
01:06:40.470 --> 01:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
understands that your your most recent
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
number that they should base their
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
estimate on is on slide 10.
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
yeah in fiscal year 21 it would be 127.6
 
01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:50.390 align:start position:0%
yeah in fiscal year 21 it would be 127.6
million

01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:06:53.670 --> 01:06:53.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 22 would be 127 million
 
01:06:58.829 --> 01:06:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:58.839 --> 01:07:01.029 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:04.230 --> 01:07:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh yes that that that's that's
 
01:07:07.029 --> 01:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
true based on what information that i
 
01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:08.720 align:start position:0%
had at the time
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
yep i will tell you that
 
01:07:16.870 --> 01:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
we are ahead of uh
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
schedule as far as what
 
01:07:24.390 --> 01:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
the is being reported in the revenue
 
01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.829 align:start position:0%
the is being reported in the revenue
focus

01:07:26.829 --> 01:07:26.839 align:start position:0%
focus
 
01:07:26.839 --> 01:07:29.670 align:start position:0%
focus
reports

01:07:29.670 --> 01:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
reports
 
01:07:32.549 --> 01:07:32.559 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify one more time are you
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
more comfortable
 
01:07:34.789 --> 01:07:34.799 align:start position:0%
is the department more comfortable
 
01:07:36.230 --> 01:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
suggesting you're going to be closer to
 
01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.230 align:start position:0%
suggesting you're going to be closer to
the

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:37.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:07:39.670 --> 01:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
128.2 million that you show on slide
 
01:07:39.680 --> 01:07:40.549 align:start position:0%
128.2 million that you show on slide
five

01:07:40.549 --> 01:07:40.559 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
or do you think it's going to be closer
 
01:07:45.190 --> 01:07:45.200 align:start position:0%
to the 127 million that's on slide 10
 
01:07:48.470 --> 01:07:48.480 align:start position:0%
oh a good point
 
01:07:52.150 --> 01:07:52.160 align:start position:0%
for the fiscal year 21 21
 
01:07:55.430 --> 01:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
uh i would
 
01:07:59.829 --> 01:07:59.839 align:start position:0%
go with the uh 128.2 million
 
01:08:03.270 --> 01:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:08:05.349 --> 01:08:05.359 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're good then on the
 
01:08:05.359 --> 01:08:06.309 align:start position:0%
so i i think we're good then on the
worksheet

01:08:06.309 --> 01:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
worksheet
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
any other questions if not
 
01:08:19.349 --> 01:08:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you the insurance department for a
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
great presentation
 
01:08:27.110 --> 01:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.110 --> 01:08:31.120 align:start position:0%

thank you members of the committee uh
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
for allowing me uh to present
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
this morning um a uh just a quick
 
01:10:08.790 --> 01:10:08.800 align:start position:0%
quick update with respect to revenue
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
since we last
 
01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:14.400 align:start position:0%
met when i last presented
 
01:10:17.590 --> 01:10:17.600 align:start position:0%
as of uh december 31 of last year i
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
reported that we had revenues totaling
 
01:10:19.760 --> 01:10:20.750 align:start position:0%
reported that we had revenues totaling
uh

01:10:20.750 --> 01:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:10:23.669 --> 01:10:23.679 align:start position:0%
2.282 million uh
 
01:10:26.790 --> 01:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
but we didn't anticipate a considerable
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
increase in revenue for the month of
 
01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
january and we did in fact
 
01:10:34.709 --> 01:10:34.719 align:start position:0%
as anticipated receive
 
01:10:38.709 --> 01:10:38.719 align:start position:0%
fees for broker and investment advisors
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
as you can see on the screen that amount
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
that came in was 14 million two hundred
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
and seventeen thousand
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars so as you can see
 
01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:48.790 align:start position:0%
one hundred dollars so as you can see
for

01:10:48.790 --> 01:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
uh 2021 in blue year to date through
 
01:10:55.990 --> 01:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
january 31 uh broker dealer fees are now
 
01:10:57.510 --> 01:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
at 15
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
million 947 084
 
01:11:05.350 --> 01:11:05.360 align:start position:0%
we do project that we will complete the
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:11:09.990 --> 01:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
at 16 million 750 for that particular
 
01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:11.590 align:start position:0%
at 16 million 750 for that particular
category

01:11:11.590 --> 01:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
category
 
01:11:14.950 --> 01:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
so that that represents the um
 
01:11:16.390 --> 01:11:16.400 align:start position:0%
probably the number that most committee
 
01:11:17.910 --> 01:11:17.920 align:start position:0%
members may have had a concern about
 
01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.110 align:start position:0%
members may have had a concern about
because

01:11:19.110 --> 01:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
through through december 31 it just
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
seemed off
 
01:11:24.870 --> 01:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
uh but we knew that revenue would be
 
01:11:25.990 --> 01:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
so we are still on track about
 
01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:29.950 align:start position:0%
so we are still on track about
projecting

01:11:29.950 --> 01:11:29.960 align:start position:0%
projecting
 
01:11:33.350 --> 01:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
41 million 250 for
 
01:11:37.110 --> 01:11:37.120 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 2021 i would also
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
like to point out in terms of securities
 
01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.310 align:start position:0%
like to point out in terms of securities
registrations

01:11:40.310 --> 01:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
right now it's just showing that six
 
01:11:49.110 --> 01:11:49.120 align:start position:0%
hundred and one thousand dollars
 
01:11:52.470 --> 01:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
however we receive the vast majority
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
of our mutual fund uh fees
 
01:11:58.630 --> 01:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh which are due on may 1. and that will
 
01:11:58.640 --> 01:11:59.189 align:start position:0%
uh which are due on may 1. and that will
be

01:11:59.189 --> 01:11:59.199 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:12:01.590 --> 01:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
that will create a significant influx of
 
01:12:03.270 --> 01:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
revenue the number is still
 
01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:05.600 align:start position:0%
questionable as far as how many mutual
 
01:12:06.630 --> 01:12:06.640 align:start position:0%
fund companies
 
01:12:09.830 --> 01:12:09.840 align:start position:0%
will renew but we are are comfortable
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
in projecting uh 24.5 million
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
in fees for uh securities registrations
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
which would totally bring us up to the
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
41 250.
 
01:12:23.669 --> 01:12:23.679 align:start position:0%
um so those are the updated numbers mr
 
01:12:25.110 --> 01:12:25.120 align:start position:0%
chair be happy to answer any questions
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
that the committee may have
 
01:12:30.709 --> 01:12:30.719 align:start position:0%
yes one second i got to bring the
 
01:12:30.719 --> 01:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
yes one second i got to bring the
participant

01:12:31.430 --> 01:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
participant
 
01:12:35.590 --> 01:12:35.600 align:start position:0%
list up uh representative
 
01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:39.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman are you is your
 
01:12:39.199 --> 01:12:40.070 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman are you is your
system

01:12:40.070 --> 01:12:40.080 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:12:42.870 --> 01:12:42.880 align:start position:0%
able to receive all of these
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
electronically or are you dependent on
 
01:12:47.110 --> 01:12:47.120 align:start position:0%
the usps which
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
has been having terrible problems yes
 
01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:50.310 align:start position:0%
has been having terrible problems yes
the

01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of our revenues now
 
01:12:54.550 --> 01:12:54.560 align:start position:0%
are received electronically
 
01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:56.640 align:start position:0%
we have been working with mutual fund
 
01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:57.590 align:start position:0%
we have been working with mutual fund
companies

01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh to make filings electronically it
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
used to be just hard copy checks
 
01:13:04.550 --> 01:13:04.560 align:start position:0%
however we do have a means by which they
 
01:13:05.750 --> 01:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
can transmit
 
01:13:08.390 --> 01:13:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh the renewal for us or to us along
 
01:13:09.990 --> 01:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
with the revenue
 
01:13:13.270 --> 01:13:13.280 align:start position:0%
so it provides for timely receipt
 
01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
of those monies thank you very much
 
01:13:24.550 --> 01:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:28.149 --> 01:13:28.159 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that for fiscal
 
01:13:28.159 --> 01:13:31.510 align:start position:0%
so what you're saying is that for fiscal
21

01:13:31.510 --> 01:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.750 --> 01:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
you're estimating 41 million 250
 
01:13:39.110 --> 01:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
000 that's correct
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
and uh it it potentially could be higher
 
01:13:44.550 --> 01:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
depending upon mutual fund renewals
 
01:13:47.990 --> 01:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
which we will see uh come may 1 and uh
 
01:13:52.550 --> 01:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.470 --> 01:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.830 --> 01:14:01.840 align:start position:0%
essentially what you gave us yes
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:07.990 --> 01:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
and christopher i will provide you with
 
01:14:11.590 --> 01:14:11.600 align:start position:0%
a copy of this uh after the meeting
 
01:14:14.870 --> 01:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
thank you barry
 
01:14:17.350 --> 01:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay i don't see any questions and or
 
01:14:18.149 --> 01:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
thank you for
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
could i just have a follow-up on my
 
01:14:28.550 --> 01:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
previous question
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
on i believe that we usually
 
01:14:35.750 --> 01:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
get the first category of fees the
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
dealer fee
 
01:14:39.350 --> 01:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
broker dealer fees in in december but a
 
01:14:41.669 --> 01:14:41.679 align:start position:0%
couple of times they've come in january
 
01:14:44.070 --> 01:14:44.080 align:start position:0%
if you're electronic now why are they
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
still coming
 
01:14:49.030 --> 01:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
late well the we're unfortunately we are
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
at the mercy of finra which is the
 
01:14:53.350 --> 01:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
former nasd
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
they are the entity that will collect
 
01:14:57.030 --> 01:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:58.960 align:start position:0%
from the various broker dealers and
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
investment advisors
 
01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
and remit it to us and oftentimes it's a
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
timing issue
 
01:15:06.950 --> 01:15:06.960 align:start position:0%
i understand that the actual funds were
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
received in the treasury
 
01:15:13.030 --> 01:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
on december 31 but did not necessarily
 
01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:13.350 align:start position:0%
on december 31 but did not necessarily
hit

01:15:13.350 --> 01:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
hit
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
until the first business day in january
 
01:15:18.630 --> 01:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
so it really was just it was really a
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
matter of timing we we experienced that
 
01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
and i received several calls too towards
 
01:15:24.950 --> 01:15:24.960 align:start position:0%
the end of the year
 
01:15:27.669 --> 01:15:27.679 align:start position:0%
uh calendar year uh inquiring as to
 
01:15:29.750 --> 01:15:29.760 align:start position:0%
whether those funds will hit or not
 
01:15:33.030 --> 01:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh so uh in this case here yes the
 
01:15:35.590 --> 01:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
finra did remit them to the state on
 
01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
1231 but they didn't hit our books until
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
i don't see any thank you for

so he may be coming in closer to 10 30.
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
um i spoke to him this morning uh norm
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah so he knows you know he's going to
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:35.990 --> 01:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
all right why don't we take a
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:00.840 --> 01:18:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:18:48.390 --> 01:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.830 --> 01:19:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:06.840 --> 01:24:43.669 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:49.030 --> 01:24:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
he's not yet remsa major i expect him
 
01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:52.950 align:start position:0%
he's not yet remsa major i expect him
momentarily

01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
momentarily
 
01:24:56.229 --> 01:24:56.239 align:start position:0%
okay um but i did get a response from
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
john williams regarding dr chan
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
and coming to the committee and
 
01:25:03.430 --> 01:25:03.440 align:start position:0%
it's unsure at this time if he's going
 
01:25:05.510 --> 01:25:05.520 align:start position:0%
to have the availability
 
01:25:08.229 --> 01:25:08.239 align:start position:0%
um but john williams did indicate that
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
last friday there was a meeting
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
with the um house health
 
01:25:15.669 --> 01:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
and human services and elderly affairs
 
01:25:17.669 --> 01:25:17.679 align:start position:0%
committee i guess it was a two-hour
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
um meeting where they recorded dr chan's
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
presentation to them
 
01:25:24.870 --> 01:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
and i will get a link and share that
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
with the committee because that may
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
address some of the questions
 
01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay um the other thing that
 
01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
john williams suggested if we can't get
 
01:25:36.470 --> 01:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
a time with dr chan is if there's
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
specific questions from committee
 
01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.030 align:start position:0%
specific questions from committee
members

01:25:39.030 --> 01:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
members
 
01:25:40.870 --> 01:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
we could compile them and send them over
 
01:25:42.070 --> 01:25:42.080 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
john williams and he would get responses
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
from dr chan and his group for the
 
01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:49.270 align:start position:0%
from dr chan and his group for the
committee

01:25:49.270 --> 01:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:50.709 --> 01:25:50.719 align:start position:0%
but we uh he is checking the
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
availability of dr chan but i guess
 
01:25:54.790 --> 01:25:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's been significant requests on his
 
01:25:55.750 --> 01:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
time to
 
01:25:57.990 --> 01:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
present to various groups including the
 
01:25:58.000 --> 01:25:59.270 align:start position:0%
present to various groups including the
legislature

01:25:59.270 --> 01:25:59.280 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
01:26:02.149 --> 01:26:02.159 align:start position:0%
um so he's having some challenges there
 
01:26:02.159 --> 01:26:02.870 align:start position:0%
um so he's having some challenges there
or

01:26:02.870 --> 01:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
or if there's somebody else who would
 
01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:05.990 align:start position:0%
or if there's somebody else who would
have

01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
some idea of
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
what's going on relative to the covert
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
and what's the worst case in the best
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
case scenario
 
01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
and the timing of these
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
yep yeah no that was part of the um
 
01:26:25.750 --> 01:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
request so i
 
01:26:28.149 --> 01:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
i told them john i would follow up after
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
you guys are done meeting this morning
 
01:26:30.870 --> 01:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
and just let him know what the response
 
01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
was from the committee
 
01:26:34.390 --> 01:26:34.400 align:start position:0%
yeah see if he has somebody else that he
 
01:26:34.400 --> 01:26:35.830 align:start position:0%
yeah see if he has somebody else that he
could

01:26:35.830 --> 01:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:26:39.110 --> 01:26:39.120 align:start position:0%
will do okay
 
01:26:42.629 --> 01:26:42.639 align:start position:0%
because i i'd like to have an interface
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
with the committee members and the
 
01:26:44.480 --> 01:26:47.189 align:start position:0%
with the committee members and the
presenter

01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
i indicated that to uh mr williams that
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
there may be questions that kind of
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
arise through the discussion that you're
 
01:26:55.350 --> 01:26:55.360 align:start position:0%
not thinking of at this moment
 
01:26:57.510 --> 01:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that if having somebody talk to the
 
01:26:59.830 --> 01:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
committee may be the preferred method
 
01:27:03.189 --> 01:27:03.199 align:start position:0%
right yeah and it just adds to that
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
i think that's get get the best we can
 
01:27:06.790 --> 01:27:06.800 align:start position:0%
from dr chan
 
01:27:08.950 --> 01:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
that's very important but uh
 
01:27:10.390 --> 01:27:10.400 align:start position:0%
representative murphy
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
identified a couple of other people and
 
01:27:14.070 --> 01:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
01:27:15.750 --> 01:27:15.760 align:start position:0%
you said representative major that you
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
were interested in pursuing that and i
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
think having
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
perspectives uh sort of a broader range
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
of perspectives would be good on this
 
01:27:26.310 --> 01:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
um difficult issue all right you will at
 
01:27:28.470 --> 01:27:28.480 align:start position:0%
least have the link to
 
01:27:31.510 --> 01:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh chan's presentation but
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
we still want to have somebody to
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
present this
 
01:27:39.430 --> 01:27:39.440 align:start position:0%
to us uh chris if i may um
 
01:27:42.229 --> 01:27:42.239 align:start position:0%
there's two names that you might ask
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
them about
 
01:27:48.070 --> 01:27:48.080 align:start position:0%
jose mercado m-e-r-c-a-d-o
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
and michael calderwood
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
both dh epidemiologists and they've been
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
giving talks as well so you might just
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
ask him about those two people okay
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
so we're working on it could i just
 
01:28:10.229 --> 01:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion too in order to make
 
01:28:12.149 --> 01:28:12.159 align:start position:0%
it more attractive i should think the
 
01:28:14.229 --> 01:28:14.239 align:start position:0%
finance committee needs to listen to
 
01:28:14.239 --> 01:28:14.629 align:start position:0%
finance committee needs to listen to
this

01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
too well once we maybe we can join
 
01:28:21.189 --> 01:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm going to have i'm going to
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
invite the finance committee and there's
 
01:28:24.629 --> 01:28:24.639 align:start position:0%
some of these things i'm going to invite
 
01:28:24.639 --> 01:28:25.590 align:start position:0%
some of these things i'm going to invite
the

01:28:25.590 --> 01:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:28.950 --> 01:28:28.960 align:start position:0%
senate ways and means committee to
 
01:28:28.960 --> 01:28:34.790 align:start position:0%
senate ways and means committee to
also

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:38.070 --> 01:28:38.080 align:start position:0%
where it's virtual that
 
01:28:40.070 --> 01:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
might as well it doesn't make we don't
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
have to worry about rooms
 
01:28:45.270 --> 01:28:45.280 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of advantages aren't
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
there yes
 
01:28:50.790 --> 01:28:50.800 align:start position:0%
it's really quite surprising whoever
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
would have thought that sitting in our
 
01:28:56.310 --> 01:28:56.320 align:start position:0%
own house would be as interesting
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
it's working out better than i thought
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
it would yeah me too
 
01:29:04.390 --> 01:29:04.400 align:start position:0%
and and no trouble hearing you at all
 
01:29:04.400 --> 01:29:04.870 align:start position:0%
and and no trouble hearing you at all
and

01:29:04.870 --> 01:29:04.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
representative malloy uh really hit the
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
nail on the head
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
and he said by being home you have
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
access to all kinds of things
 
01:29:19.430 --> 01:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
laptop et cetera supreme major
 
01:29:26.870 --> 01:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
a minority opinion i think it's an
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
enormous disadvantage to freshmen
 
01:29:33.270 --> 01:29:33.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's probably i i agree that's
 
01:29:37.510 --> 01:29:37.520 align:start position:0%
why the freshmen no matter
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
do not feel silly do not feel stupid or
 
01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:41.760 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
01:29:45.030 --> 01:29:45.040 align:start position:0%
jump in and ask questions because
 
01:29:47.030 --> 01:29:47.040 align:start position:0%
there's have your item there that you
 
01:29:48.870 --> 01:29:48.880 align:start position:0%
can't question
 
01:29:51.510 --> 01:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
and that's the way you really dig into
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
this stuff
 
01:29:55.430 --> 01:29:55.440 align:start position:0%
by getting styling with the questions so
 
01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:55.669 align:start position:0%
by getting styling with the questions so
i

01:29:55.669 --> 01:29:55.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:29:59.750 --> 01:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:02.229 --> 01:30:02.239 align:start position:0%
there's some major uh mr mcintyre is on
 
01:30:05.189 --> 01:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
the call now so you can start with your
 
01:30:06.870 --> 01:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
revenues related to lottery if you would
 
01:30:10.149 --> 01:30:10.159 align:start position:0%
like right and does he have a
 
01:30:18.870 --> 01:30:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
or mr chairman charlie mcintyre here for
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%

01:30:26.709 --> 01:30:26.719 align:start position:0%
i have a bad connection so i may just go
 
01:30:26.719 --> 01:30:27.669 align:start position:0%
i have a bad connection so i may just go
to

01:30:27.669 --> 01:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:30:35.430 --> 01:30:35.440 align:start position:0%
um audio if that's okay
 
01:30:37.430 --> 01:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
so good morning this is charlie mcintyre
 
01:30:39.270 --> 01:30:39.280 align:start position:0%
for the lottery uh i had
 
01:30:42.950 --> 01:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
presented to you a couple weeks ago
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates this year of 120
 
01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
01:30:49.189 --> 01:30:49.199 align:start position:0%
and the next two years would be fiscal
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
year 22
 
01:30:53.669 --> 01:30:53.679 align:start position:0%
of 125 million and fiscal year
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
23 of 127 million we anticipate
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
growth next year particularly in sports
 
01:31:01.750 --> 01:31:01.760 align:start position:0%
betting and internet
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
we do not expect instant tickets to
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
continue their tremendous growth
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
which we have enjoyed over the last year
 
01:31:09.590 --> 01:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
the out year sort of the second year of
 
01:31:12.790 --> 01:31:12.800 align:start position:0%
the biennium i would anticipate
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
massachusetts chooses to have sports
 
01:31:14.639 --> 01:31:15.270 align:start position:0%
massachusetts chooses to have sports
betting

01:31:15.270 --> 01:31:15.280 align:start position:0%
betting
 
01:31:16.629 --> 01:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
so i'd anticipate a slow down of
 
01:31:18.390 --> 01:31:18.400 align:start position:0%
revenues there
 
01:31:20.149 --> 01:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
obviously we're still subject to the
 
01:31:22.070 --> 01:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
normal economic pressures
 
01:31:24.709 --> 01:31:24.719 align:start position:0%
of gas prices uh and the like and the
 
01:31:25.830 --> 01:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
general economy
 
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
but certainly that's it in a nutshell
 
01:31:31.350 --> 01:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
i i think our revenues are pretty basic
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
and i'm happy to answer any questions
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:39.669 --> 01:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
questions from committee members
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
representative baxter
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i couldn't hear what
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
you said there you said you expected
 
01:31:48.310 --> 01:31:48.320 align:start position:0%
something to slow down
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
um what what like a ticket or something
 
01:31:53.750 --> 01:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
no i'm sorry so certainly uh one thing
 
01:31:55.189 --> 01:31:55.199 align:start position:0%
would be sports betting
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
i anticipate massachusetts will enact
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
sports betting in the next year
 
01:32:01.270 --> 01:32:01.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll have it live by the second
 
01:32:03.430 --> 01:32:03.440 align:start position:0%
year of our biennium
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
secondarily i would anticipate scratch
 
01:32:07.189 --> 01:32:07.199 align:start position:0%
ticket sales which have enjoyed
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
tremendous growth this sketch
 
01:32:12.629 --> 01:32:12.639 align:start position:0%
to slow down probably certainly next
 
01:32:14.390 --> 01:32:14.400 align:start position:0%
year into the following year
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh not stop growth but certainly slow
 
01:32:18.870 --> 01:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
down we're up 20
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
on scratch ticket sales which is
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
historic so
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh i never like to plan for historic
 
01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.430 align:start position:0%
uh i never like to plan for historic
events

01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
events
 
01:32:29.270 --> 01:32:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:37.910 --> 01:32:37.920 align:start position:0%
hi charlie uh to uh just amplify that a
 
01:32:39.750 --> 01:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
little bit for the committee
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
what percentage of sports betting is
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
coming from out of state or like for
 
01:32:44.550 --> 01:32:44.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but out of state in
 
01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:45.510 align:start position:0%
massachusetts but out of state in
general

01:32:45.510 --> 01:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:32:48.310 --> 01:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
so so currently approximately 20 percent
 
01:32:49.510 --> 01:32:49.520 align:start position:0%
of our mobile
 
01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:51.920 align:start position:0%
activity is coming from out of state so
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
80 percent
 
01:32:55.030 --> 01:32:55.040 align:start position:0%
give or take is coming from new
 
01:32:57.270 --> 01:32:57.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire vermont and maine
 
01:32:58.950 --> 01:32:58.960 align:start position:0%
and maine in vermont they're very small
 
01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
one or two percent three percent
 
01:33:04.390 --> 01:33:04.400 align:start position:0%
um of the mobile side of our retail
 
01:33:06.830 --> 01:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
side the majority is coming from
 
01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.470 align:start position:0%
side the majority is coming from
massachusetts

01:33:08.470 --> 01:33:08.480 align:start position:0%
massachusetts
 
01:33:11.590 --> 01:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
and so the facilities at seabrook and
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
manchester to a lesser extent will be
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
financially impacted
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
we have things we plan on doing if
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
indeed that happens
 
01:33:21.510 --> 01:33:21.520 align:start position:0%
and it depends on where those facilities
 
01:33:23.590 --> 01:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
are located it certainly looks like the
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
facilities would be located
 
01:33:27.270 --> 01:33:27.280 align:start position:0%
in everett which is a far distance from
 
01:33:28.709 --> 01:33:28.719 align:start position:0%
our border thankfully
 
01:33:30.629 --> 01:33:30.639 align:start position:0%
but if one were to be located in lowell
 
01:33:35.030 --> 01:33:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.149 --> 01:33:38.159 align:start position:0%
follow up oh
 
01:33:39.830 --> 01:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
so do you anticipate they're going to
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
have uh just like us they're going to
 
01:33:42.950 --> 01:33:42.960 align:start position:0%
have mobile as well as
 
01:33:45.910 --> 01:33:45.920 align:start position:0%
brick and mortar places correct i would
 
01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
just make a lot of mobile
 
01:33:49.189 --> 01:33:49.199 align:start position:0%
from what i've read from the press
 
01:33:49.199 --> 01:33:52.390 align:start position:0%
from what i've read from the press
reports

01:33:52.390 --> 01:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
press reports it looks like the they
 
01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:55.510 align:start position:0%
press reports it looks like the they
won't

01:33:55.510 --> 01:33:55.520 align:start position:0%
won't
 
01:33:58.070 --> 01:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
have college sports which is certainly a
 
01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:58.870 align:start position:0%
have college sports which is certainly a
big

01:33:58.870 --> 01:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
big
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
activity for us and as we go into march
 
01:34:04.950 --> 01:34:04.960 align:start position:0%
it's actually the largest sports event
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
in the spring
 
01:34:08.310 --> 01:34:08.320 align:start position:0%
the college basketball tournament and
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
college football is obviously big in the
 
01:34:09.840 --> 01:34:10.229 align:start position:0%
college football is obviously big in the
fall

01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
so we'll have a competitive advantage
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
there but
 
01:34:15.270 --> 01:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes it's my anticipation they'll have
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
mobile as well as physical retail
 
01:34:17.440 --> 01:34:18.950 align:start position:0%
mobile as well as physical retail
locations

01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
locations
 
01:34:21.030 --> 01:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
just to follow up again uh norm if you
 
01:34:22.310 --> 01:34:22.320 align:start position:0%
don't mind
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
charlie you won't explain that to the
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
committee just
 
01:34:28.229 --> 01:34:28.239 align:start position:0%
we have a few minutes here uh about the
 
01:34:28.239 --> 01:34:28.870 align:start position:0%
we have a few minutes here uh about the
sports

01:34:28.870 --> 01:34:28.880 align:start position:0%
sports
 
01:34:31.350 --> 01:34:31.360 align:start position:0%
spending on colleges my recollection is
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
that there was some
 
01:34:34.790 --> 01:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
blackouts though right for yeah for for
 
01:34:35.750 --> 01:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:34:37.830 --> 01:34:37.840 align:start position:0%
teams yes and so there's a current
 
01:34:40.229 --> 01:34:40.239 align:start position:0%
blackout uh you're not allowed to bet on
 
01:34:41.669 --> 01:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
a state of new hampshire team
 
01:34:44.070 --> 01:34:44.080 align:start position:0%
whether that be unh or dartmouth for say
 
01:34:45.350 --> 01:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
the only exception would be is if
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
they're in another tournament
 
01:34:51.910 --> 01:34:51.920 align:start position:0%
so for example if unh makes the college
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
basketball tournament
 
01:34:54.629 --> 01:34:54.639 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to bet on the tournament
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
as a whole but you're not allowed to bet
 
01:34:57.270 --> 01:34:57.280 align:start position:0%
on unh
 
01:34:59.910 --> 01:34:59.920 align:start position:0%
individually and so that was in a
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
request from the colleges that they
 
01:35:03.510 --> 01:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
asked for that we were happy to abide by
 
01:35:04.390 --> 01:35:04.400 align:start position:0%
and you folks
 
01:35:07.270 --> 01:35:07.280 align:start position:0%
obviously abided by that as well thank
 
01:35:09.590 --> 01:35:09.600 align:start position:0%
you charlie
 
01:35:12.629 --> 01:35:12.639 align:start position:0%
it represented all me
 
01:35:15.270 --> 01:35:15.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on about the
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
scratch tickets you say they're
 
01:35:18.950 --> 01:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be growing are they
 
01:35:20.550 --> 01:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
going to be falling again
 
01:35:23.910 --> 01:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
once people can get out and about more
 
01:35:26.950 --> 01:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
i don't think so certainly um it's been
 
01:35:30.070 --> 01:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
growth for the last 10 years almost
 
01:35:30.080 --> 01:35:31.189 align:start position:0%
growth for the last 10 years almost
unabated

01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%
unabated
 
01:35:33.109 --> 01:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
so uh and that's in the gross dollar
 
01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
terms and also in net dollar terms
 
01:35:37.990 --> 01:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
but i would anticipate at some point it
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
just will be slowing
 
01:35:42.550 --> 01:35:42.560 align:start position:0%
not so one of the things is though last
 
01:35:43.189 --> 01:35:43.199 align:start position:0%
year our
 
01:35:45.910 --> 01:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
profit was approximately 100 million and
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
this year it's approximately
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
our we're estimating 120 million dollars
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
so 20 million dollars increase in profit
 
01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:52.310 align:start position:0%
so 20 million dollars increase in profit
is

01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:35:55.669 --> 01:35:55.679 align:start position:0%
well it's historic so i would anticipate
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
slowing and certainly this is us being
 
01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.990 align:start position:0%
slowing and certainly this is us being
conservative

01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:10.550 --> 01:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions
 
01:36:16.950 --> 01:36:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
i'll rub some names down mute yourself
 
01:36:23.270 --> 01:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
yeah i got it yeah you got it um yeah
 
01:36:24.550 --> 01:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
charlie uh
 
01:36:27.750 --> 01:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
i may have missed this but um
 
01:36:31.109 --> 01:36:31.119 align:start position:0%
could you uh speak to
 
01:36:33.669 --> 01:36:33.679 align:start position:0%
how other developments in massachusetts
 
01:36:36.830 --> 01:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
particularly their big casinos
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
um are impacting or
 
01:36:44.149 --> 01:36:44.159 align:start position:0%
might impact our revenues here
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
um and so i'm not talking about sports
 
01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.430 align:start position:0%
um and so i'm not talking about sports
betting

01:36:47.430 --> 01:36:47.440 align:start position:0%
betting
 
01:36:48.870 --> 01:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
the future of sports betting in
 
01:36:50.550 --> 01:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
massachusetts or
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
their lottery program but the casino
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
and you may have spoken to this and i
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
may have missed it if so
 
01:37:00.310 --> 01:37:00.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry no no certainly uh thank you
 
01:37:01.669 --> 01:37:01.679 align:start position:0%
for the question representative ames
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
um the impact that a casino the casino
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
in boston would have would be
 
01:37:08.149 --> 01:37:08.159 align:start position:0%
really related to charitable gambling
 
01:37:10.390 --> 01:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
side which for the purposes of revenues
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
is quite minor we only estimate three to
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
four million dollars profit for the
 
01:37:16.709 --> 01:37:16.719 align:start position:0%
state from charitable gaming
 
01:37:19.030 --> 01:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
it will impact the charities certainly
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
obviously with their
 
01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
casinos closed because of kovid it
 
01:37:24.709 --> 01:37:24.719 align:start position:0%
hasn't had quite the impact
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
and candidly because of the location of
 
01:37:28.550 --> 01:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
the facility
 
01:37:31.590 --> 01:37:31.600 align:start position:0%
in everett it being everett and it's
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
sort of inaccessibility as well as their
 
01:37:35.669 --> 01:37:35.679 align:start position:0%
economic price point
 
01:37:37.350 --> 01:37:37.360 align:start position:0%
it also hasn't had the same impact that
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
we expected meaning it's hard to get to
 
01:37:42.550 --> 01:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
and really expensive while you're there
 
01:37:43.750 --> 01:37:43.760 align:start position:0%
in contrast to
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.470 --> 01:37:50.480 align:start position:0%
up um
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
so what about the uh casino
 
01:37:56.870 --> 01:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
in springfield uh which is
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
maybe too far away to be a big impact
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
and uh the
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
uh what do they call it uh uh
 
01:38:04.790 --> 01:38:04.800 align:start position:0%
casino in um
 
01:38:08.070 --> 01:38:08.080 align:start position:0%
central massachusetts yeah you certainly
 
01:38:11.510 --> 01:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's a good good question we have seen
 
01:38:13.350 --> 01:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
more activity we've seen more folks from
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
new hampshire drive to foxwoods and
 
01:38:16.070 --> 01:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
mohegan sun
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
then we have seen go to everett the wind
 
01:38:19.119 --> 01:38:19.910 align:start position:0%
then we have seen go to everett the wind
facility

01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
facility
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
and the one in springfield and certainly
 
01:38:22.950 --> 01:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
the one in plain ridge because
 
01:38:24.149 --> 01:38:24.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you're driving to plane
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
ridge it's a couple hours you're going
 
01:38:27.990 --> 01:38:28.000 align:start position:0%
to continue on to go to foxwoods
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
which is a much nicer facility and
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
certainly the
 
01:38:33.189 --> 01:38:33.199 align:start position:0%
those two facilities in connecticut have
 
01:38:35.109 --> 01:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
loyal customers and they
 
01:38:36.950 --> 01:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
obviously reward customers and so i
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
think there's a still that
 
01:38:41.430 --> 01:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
loyalty to those two facilities over and
 
01:38:43.430 --> 01:38:43.440 align:start position:0%
above the facilities of massachusetts
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
more so than i anticipated when they
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
were first
 
01:38:50.229 --> 01:38:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
interesting worth watching yeah no
 
01:38:54.470 --> 01:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
question and certainly
 
01:38:56.310 --> 01:38:56.320 align:start position:0%
there's another lawsuit pending about
 
01:38:57.669 --> 01:38:57.679 align:start position:0%
another possible facility in
 
01:38:59.189 --> 01:38:59.199 align:start position:0%
massachusetts uh there's
 
01:39:01.350 --> 01:39:01.360 align:start position:0%
one more casino to be located and that
 
01:39:02.550 --> 01:39:02.560 align:start position:0%
certainly is still an
 
01:39:04.950 --> 01:39:04.960 align:start position:0%
influx and where that goes uh that would
 
01:39:06.310 --> 01:39:06.320 align:start position:0%
be in the southeast
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
i think because exactly unless they
 
01:39:09.350 --> 01:39:09.360 align:start position:0%
change their mind
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
unless they change the mind look for a
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
better location i mean my terror exists
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
if they put it somewhere like in lowell
 
01:39:16.310 --> 01:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
that would be my absolute
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
worst our worst nightmare um but they
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
have not realized the revenues they
 
01:39:21.830 --> 01:39:21.840 align:start position:0%
expected obviously
 
01:39:28.390 --> 01:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:32.149 --> 01:39:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:35.590 --> 01:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh let me ask you mr chair is
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
it uh appropriate for charlie to comment
 
01:39:44.950 --> 01:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
on house bill 533 at this point since
 
01:39:46.950 --> 01:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
we are my senses but probably not
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
because we're not
 
01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
we're not in a hearing session i had a
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
conversation this morning
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
about one of the questions that was
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
asked and since we have him on the uh
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
zoom about was the question was
 
01:40:02.550 --> 01:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh is the attorney general's office
 
01:40:04.390 --> 01:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
01:40:06.229 --> 01:40:06.239 align:start position:0%
uh the new model that he's proposing in
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
house bill 533
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
and i mean i can share his answer with
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
the committee tomorrow
 
01:40:13.590 --> 01:40:13.600 align:start position:0%
uh or if you want to he said he's on the
 
01:40:15.750 --> 01:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
phone and we have a few minutes
 
01:40:16.950 --> 01:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
we could get it right directly from him
 
01:40:18.550 --> 01:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
i don't know if it's violating anything
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
for him to do that
 
01:40:21.750 --> 01:40:21.760 align:start position:0%
i would allow it this is a public
 
01:40:23.189 --> 01:40:23.199 align:start position:0%
hearing and
 
01:40:26.470 --> 01:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
we had we had a public hearing on that
 
01:40:28.229 --> 01:40:28.239 align:start position:0%
we're going to be having another work
 
01:40:29.750 --> 01:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
session coming up
 
01:40:33.030 --> 01:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
in public hearing norm that's one of the
 
01:40:34.629 --> 01:40:34.639 align:start position:0%
bills we're going to exact tomorrow
 
01:40:37.669 --> 01:40:37.679 align:start position:0%
right yes so
 
01:40:39.910 --> 01:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
are you saying it's okay or not okay
 
01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:43.350 align:start position:0%
are you saying it's okay or not okay
okay

01:40:43.350 --> 01:40:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
charlie wants to respond
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay certainly i think the question was
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
had the attorney general's office been
 
01:40:52.790 --> 01:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
notified of this proposed legislation
 
01:40:54.709 --> 01:40:54.719 align:start position:0%
and the answer is yes our chief
 
01:40:56.149 --> 01:40:56.159 align:start position:0%
compliance officer
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh is formerly the attorney general's
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
office and
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
talks to them regularly about all of our
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
activities including this and they were
 
01:41:03.990 --> 01:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
aware of it
 
01:41:12.629 --> 01:41:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
absent major representative
 
01:41:19.109 --> 01:41:19.119 align:start position:0%
bernstein first and then followed by
 
01:41:19.119 --> 01:41:20.149 align:start position:0%
bernstein first and then followed by
representative

01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good morning charlie
 
01:41:22.639 --> 01:41:23.510 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair good morning charlie
morning

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
morning
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
in your presentation from uh a week or
 
01:41:27.189 --> 01:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
two ago
 
01:41:28.790 --> 01:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
you you did have a bullet point about
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
the state of massachusetts in acting
 
01:41:32.870 --> 01:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
sports betting
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
is is there any new information or is is
 
01:41:36.709 --> 01:41:36.719 align:start position:0%
the pace of
 
01:41:39.990 --> 01:41:40.000 align:start position:0%
uh your time frame of when it will be
 
01:41:43.830 --> 01:41:43.840 align:start position:0%
enacted i guess my simple question is do
 
01:41:45.750 --> 01:41:45.760 align:start position:0%
you still stand by the revenue estimates
 
01:41:45.760 --> 01:41:46.070 align:start position:0%
you still stand by the revenue estimates
for

01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
2022 and 23 or is there new information
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
which is going to
 
01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
uh adjust those estimates no
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
the revenue estimates are the ones that
 
01:41:56.790 --> 01:41:56.800 align:start position:0%
i hadn't uh suggested
 
01:41:58.470 --> 01:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
in that presentation and we'll still
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
stand by them it's just i don't
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
anticipate the same growth
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
that we would have realized had they not
 
01:42:05.750 --> 01:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
been and i
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
like i said it's a guess right what a
 
01:42:09.669 --> 01:42:09.679 align:start position:0%
legislature particularly massachusetts
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
will do
 
01:42:12.790 --> 01:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
so um it's my guess but i would
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
anticipate them legalizing it
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
in this next legislative session their
 
01:42:18.950 --> 01:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
their current one
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
and it being impact revenues not the
 
01:42:24.149 --> 01:42:24.159 align:start position:0%
next fiscal year but the one thereafter
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
i don't anticipate a down year i just
 
01:42:27.350 --> 01:42:27.360 align:start position:0%
don't expect the same growth we would
 
01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:28.390 align:start position:0%
don't expect the same growth we would
realize

01:42:28.390 --> 01:42:28.400 align:start position:0%
realize
 
01:42:29.990 --> 01:42:30.000 align:start position:0%
right you do have some modest growth
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
we're going from 125 million to 127 and
 
01:42:33.990 --> 01:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
a half
 
01:42:36.790 --> 01:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
yeah and certainly that's related also
 
01:42:37.590 --> 01:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
i just i really am conservative
 
01:42:42.629 --> 01:42:42.639 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues out two years
 
01:42:42.639 --> 01:42:43.430 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues out two years
because

01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:42:45.830 --> 01:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
of what can happen in two years um you
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
know representative you know
 
01:42:49.270 --> 01:42:49.280 align:start position:0%

01:42:59.750 --> 01:42:59.760 align:start position:0%
um charlie i've got two questions
 
01:43:01.109 --> 01:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
actually that one of them
 
01:43:03.350 --> 01:43:03.360 align:start position:0%
is relating to representative abrami's
 
01:43:05.510 --> 01:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
about 533
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
does the ag's office do any enforcement
 
01:43:10.629 --> 01:43:10.639 align:start position:0%
for you now
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
um they don't they don't they do reviews
 
01:43:15.990 --> 01:43:16.000 align:start position:0%
for us and they'll do background checks
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:43:18.550 --> 01:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
um but they don't do any criminal
 
01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.669 align:start position:0%
um but they don't do any criminal
enforcement

01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement
 
01:43:23.350 --> 01:43:23.360 align:start position:0%
no thank you and then the other
 
01:43:24.470 --> 01:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
questions totally
 
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
unrelated to that on in the
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
massachusetts casinos i think that there
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
was some
 
01:43:34.629 --> 01:43:34.639 align:start position:0%
set up that they were going to be doing
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
impact studies
 
01:43:39.669 --> 01:43:39.679 align:start position:0%
of on the effect of the casinos
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
on the communities et cetera on have
 
01:43:42.719 --> 01:43:44.149 align:start position:0%
on the communities et cetera on have
they

01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:43:46.950 --> 01:43:46.960 align:start position:0%
finished any about plain ridge for
 
01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.870 align:start position:0%
finished any about plain ridge for
instance

01:43:48.870 --> 01:43:48.880 align:start position:0%
instance
 
01:43:51.910 --> 01:43:51.920 align:start position:0%
the slots casino yes or no
 
01:43:53.590 --> 01:43:53.600 align:start position:0%

it was just two pages you can see the
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
various revenue sources
 
01:44:59.109 --> 01:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
that go into the numbers that would help
 
01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%

the various revenue sources and then
 
01:45:30.070 --> 01:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
they may have questions as a result
 
01:45:33.430 --> 01:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:36.210 --> 01:45:36.220 align:start position:0%

remind you of the different revenue
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
types go down through the list
 
01:45:52.629 --> 01:45:52.639 align:start position:0%
is is that what you would like me to do
 
01:45:54.550 --> 01:45:54.560 align:start position:0%

01:45:59.990 --> 01:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
you provided the committee last week you
 
01:46:01.109 --> 01:46:01.119 align:start position:0%
you know you listed out like the
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
licenses the agent fees
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
just to remind the committee of what
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
some of those might be
 
01:46:08.550 --> 01:46:08.560 align:start position:0%
okay now that they've had a week to
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
think about it
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay um so we have our licenses which is
 
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:14.550 align:start position:0%
okay um so we have our licenses which is
our

01:46:14.550 --> 01:46:14.560 align:start position:0%
our
 
01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
biggest part of unrestricted revenues
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
our concord agent fees which is the one
 
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:21.990 align:start position:0%
our concord agent fees which is the one
dollar

01:46:21.990 --> 01:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
fee per license type that is sold here
 
01:46:26.390 --> 01:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
in our concord
 
01:46:29.510 --> 01:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
office miscellaneous sales and
 
01:46:32.870 --> 01:46:32.880 align:start position:0%
income is kind of a melting pot
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
of revenues that does not have fall into
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
any other category
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
and as i stated last week and i'll
 
01:46:41.910 --> 01:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
restate the biggest deposit
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
into that fund is the internal
 
01:46:49.030 --> 01:46:49.040 align:start position:0%
administrative charge that we charge for
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
overhead on all of our dedicated
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
accounts here at the department
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
and that is approximately 250 to 300
 
01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
000 per year the ohrv
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
license agent fees is the same as the
 
01:47:07.510 --> 01:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
concrete agent fees only that's the oh
 
01:47:07.520 --> 01:47:07.910 align:start position:0%
concrete agent fees only that's the oh
the

01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
fee charge for ohrv registrations and
 
01:47:13.510 --> 01:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
for this current fiscal year that just
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
went up to four dollars per registration
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
license agent fines and penalties those
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
funds are submitted by license agents
 
01:47:26.790 --> 01:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
that are late in submitting their
 
01:47:26.800 --> 01:47:27.510 align:start position:0%
that are late in submitting their
monthly

01:47:27.510 --> 01:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
monthly
 
01:47:31.350 --> 01:47:31.360 align:start position:0%
um monthly reports along with their
 
01:47:34.149 --> 01:47:34.159 align:start position:0%
monthly remittances they have until the
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
14th of the month
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
to submit those they are allowed to
 
01:47:42.070 --> 01:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh request one waiver per year
 
01:47:44.950 --> 01:47:44.960 align:start position:0%
and we are allowed to find them if uh of
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
course with covid we did
 
01:47:49.350 --> 01:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
allow a lot of people we were very very
 
01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
allow a lot of people we were very very
lenient

01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
lenient
 
01:47:53.109 --> 01:47:53.119 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people interest on savings
 
01:47:53.119 --> 01:47:54.149 align:start position:0%
for a lot of people interest on savings
deposits

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
deposits
 
01:47:58.709 --> 01:47:58.719 align:start position:0%
i made a significant adjustment to our
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
current fiscal year 21 budgeted on that
 
01:48:04.070 --> 01:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
because our interest revenues have taken
 
01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
a considerable nosedives like all of
 
01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.229 align:start position:0%
a considerable nosedives like all of
ours

01:48:08.229 --> 01:48:08.239 align:start position:0%
ours
 
01:48:11.270 --> 01:48:11.280 align:start position:0%
sale on surplus property are those
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
funds that we receive for equipment that
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
we send over to
 
01:48:20.149 --> 01:48:20.159 align:start position:0%
surplus that subsequently gets sold to
 
01:48:21.510 --> 01:48:21.520 align:start position:0%
the public
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
sale of surplus vehicles same thing only
 
01:48:26.390 --> 01:48:26.400 align:start position:0%
that is specific to all fish and game
 
01:48:27.430 --> 01:48:27.440 align:start position:0%
vehicles that get
 
01:48:30.629 --> 01:48:30.639 align:start position:0%
sold after we surplus them federal
 
01:48:33.590 --> 01:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
recoveries and direct costs that is the
 
01:48:36.870 --> 01:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh another large pot of funding
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
and that is actually the indirect cost
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
that is charged on all of our federal
 
01:48:42.639 --> 01:48:43.510 align:start position:0%
that is charged on all of our federal
grants

01:48:43.510 --> 01:48:43.520 align:start position:0%
grants
 
01:48:46.070 --> 01:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
which all of our federal grants is
 
01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.270 align:start position:0%
which all of our federal grants is
approximately

01:48:47.270 --> 01:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:48:50.149 --> 01:48:50.159 align:start position:0%
seven to ten million dollars per year
 
01:48:52.149 --> 01:48:52.159 align:start position:0%
and it's an overhead charge
 
01:48:55.109 --> 01:48:55.119 align:start position:0%
that we are able to charge for the cost
 
01:48:55.119 --> 01:48:55.430 align:start position:0%
that we are able to charge for the cost
of

01:48:55.430 --> 01:48:55.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:48:58.470 --> 01:48:58.480 align:start position:0%
personnel and benefits
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
that is overhead
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
game management transfers let me
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
read that one to you because that one's
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit
 
01:49:12.790 --> 01:49:12.800 align:start position:0%
more detailed um so initially
 
01:49:15.589 --> 01:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
all license revenues are deposited into
 
01:49:19.750 --> 01:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
that first pot of money 5221
 
01:49:22.790 --> 01:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
but after monthly reconciliations ten
 
01:49:22.800 --> 01:49:23.669 align:start position:0%
but after monthly reconciliations ten

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
from the sale of each turkey bear and

01:49:34.470 --> 01:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
and subsequent permit when drawn are
 
01:49:34.480 --> 01:49:35.430 align:start position:0%
and subsequent permit when drawn are
deposited

01:49:35.430 --> 01:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
deposited
 
01:49:38.870 --> 01:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
into the dedicated game management
 
01:49:38.880 --> 01:49:40.310 align:start position:0%
into the dedicated game management
account

01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:49:42.790 --> 01:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
and all funds remaining are transferred
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
into this unrestricted
 
01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
game management account
 
01:49:51.430 --> 01:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
and the ohrv and marine unrefunded road
 
01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:52.070 align:start position:0%
and the ohrv and marine unrefunded road
toll

01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
toll
 
01:49:55.430 --> 01:49:55.440 align:start position:0%
per the rsas that i notate below
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
260 colon 60 and 260 colon 61
 
01:50:02.070 --> 01:50:02.080 align:start position:0%
in statute those are transferred from
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
the department of safety into the
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:13.910 --> 01:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
is that helpful questions the first one
 
01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:14.470 align:start position:0%
is that helpful questions the first one
is

01:50:14.470 --> 01:50:14.480 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
representative romney yeah uh thank you
 
01:50:21.990 --> 01:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
come on thank you um so
 
01:50:24.470 --> 01:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the transfers on the uh
 
01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:25.990 align:start position:0%
let's talk about the transfers on the uh
rotols

01:50:25.990 --> 01:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
rotols
 
01:50:27.830 --> 01:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
so maureen i kind of understand that
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
they probably have the pumps right by
 
01:50:31.030 --> 01:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the water and they know that they are
 
01:50:34.470 --> 01:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
the pumps uh well again someone would
 
01:50:36.149 --> 01:50:36.159 align:start position:0%
have with a boat that has a trailer they
 
01:50:37.990 --> 01:50:38.000 align:start position:0%
may fill up their tank uh
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
at a regular gas station how do they
 
01:50:40.400 --> 01:50:41.350 align:start position:0%
at a regular gas station how do they
know

01:50:41.350 --> 01:50:41.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:50:43.109 --> 01:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
how do they and the same thing with the
 
01:50:44.870 --> 01:50:44.880 align:start position:0%
off-road vehicle
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
how do they know that the gasoline is
 
01:50:49.030 --> 01:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
being sold
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
for that use to be actually what
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
what that is is we here at fish and game
 
01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
are responsible for
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
sending the department of safety road
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
toll bureau
 
01:51:04.229 --> 01:51:04.239 align:start position:0%
the annual report of all registrations
 
01:51:07.350 --> 01:51:07.360 align:start position:0%
sold for ohrv and they
 
01:51:11.510 --> 01:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
take that figure say it's 85 000
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
registrations a year they take that
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
figure and they
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
plug it into a formula on their side
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
based on unrefunded fuel
 
01:51:26.790 --> 01:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
and that's how they come up with that
 
01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.229 align:start position:0%
and that's how they come up with that
figure

01:51:28.229 --> 01:51:28.239 align:start position:0%
figure
 
01:51:30.310 --> 01:51:30.320 align:start position:0%
okay because my understanding is that
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
there is if if you have a boat and you
 
01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:32.790 align:start position:0%
there is if if you have a boat and you
fill

01:51:32.790 --> 01:51:32.800 align:start position:0%
fill
 
01:51:35.750 --> 01:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
and you for your tan let's say you fill
 
01:51:36.950 --> 01:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
your tank up
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
uh you can the individual can apply for
 
01:51:41.669 --> 01:51:41.679 align:start position:0%
a refund of the tax part right
 
01:51:43.510 --> 01:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
that's the right absolutely right the
 
01:51:44.870 --> 01:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
same thing with an off-road vehicle
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
they can they can a lot of people don't
 
01:51:49.990 --> 01:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
so that's the um that's the unrun
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
refunded part of this correct that is
 
01:51:52.719 --> 01:51:54.310 align:start position:0%
refunded part of this correct that is
correct

01:51:54.310 --> 01:51:54.320 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
right so all right uh
 
01:51:59.589 --> 01:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
i just wasn't sure how that all worked
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
and you say there's some kind of a
 
01:52:02.310 --> 01:52:02.320 align:start position:0%
formula that i use to
 
01:52:05.270 --> 01:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
calculate how much you go back on on
 
01:52:05.280 --> 01:52:05.750 align:start position:0%
calculate how much you go back on on
both

01:52:05.750 --> 01:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:52:07.910 --> 01:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
on both parts of money it's a formula
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
used for
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
the amount of ohrv registrations that
 
01:52:12.470 --> 01:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
are registered
 
01:52:15.910 --> 01:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
annually and the amount of boats that
 
01:52:17.990 --> 01:52:18.000 align:start position:0%
are registered now boat registrations of
 
01:52:19.510 --> 01:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
course run through the department of
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
safety so that's all done
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
internally and for the number of ohrv
 
01:52:26.149 --> 01:52:26.159 align:start position:0%
registrations that's a figure that we
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
actually send over to them on an annual
 
01:52:28.639 --> 01:52:29.589 align:start position:0%
actually send over to them on an annual
basis

01:52:29.589 --> 01:52:29.599 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:52:32.870 --> 01:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank you you're welcome that's a
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
lot of money
 
01:52:37.910 --> 01:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
it is okay representative
 
01:52:42.470 --> 01:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
elmy thank you mr chairman
 
01:52:44.790 --> 01:52:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'd just like to comment on the last one
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
maybe we'd like to find out what that
 
01:52:48.070 --> 01:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
formula is and whether they
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
update it every now and then but
 
01:52:54.550 --> 01:52:54.560 align:start position:0%
um i have a question
 
01:52:57.589 --> 01:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
about the the
 
01:53:00.709 --> 01:53:00.719 align:start position:0%
the fact i think you have more money in
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
the sub funds
 
01:53:05.830 --> 01:53:05.840 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds on especially the
 
01:53:09.910 --> 01:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
the the game licenses other than moose
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
on i believe all have been merged into
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
one fund
 
01:53:16.070 --> 01:53:16.080 align:start position:0%
there's a fund for there's a license for
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
a turkey there's a license
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
for uh a partridge i think there's a
 
01:53:22.310 --> 01:53:22.320 align:start position:0%
license for all sorts of
 
01:53:25.830 --> 01:53:25.840 align:start position:0%
of of smaller game
 
01:53:29.350 --> 01:53:29.360 align:start position:0%
and deer and such and
 
01:53:31.109 --> 01:53:31.119 align:start position:0%
i think they've all been merged into the
 
01:53:33.830 --> 01:53:33.840 align:start position:0%
same since they're improving the habitat
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
for for one animal they're usually
 
01:53:38.229 --> 01:53:38.239 align:start position:0%
improving it for
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
others as well and they use them for
 
01:53:43.109 --> 01:53:43.119 align:start position:0%
that purpose as i
 
01:53:46.790 --> 01:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
recall but i i wonder for
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
us to try to understand the fission game
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
revenues if we really don't need to have
 
01:53:55.109 --> 01:53:55.119 align:start position:0%
some kind
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
of understanding of how much is in
 
01:54:02.229 --> 01:54:02.239 align:start position:0%
those dedicated funds
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
i have that list right here in front of
 
01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:06.229 align:start position:0%
i have that list right here in front of
me

01:54:06.229 --> 01:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:54:09.430 --> 01:54:09.440 align:start position:0%
thank you i
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
i wanted to be completely prepared for
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
all of your questions today
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
um and you are absolutely right about
 
01:54:19.030 --> 01:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
these smaller funds
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
many years ago we had a waterfowl a
 
01:54:22.870 --> 01:54:22.880 align:start position:0%
turkey and a
 
01:54:26.310 --> 01:54:26.320 align:start position:0%
bear and moose account all separate
 
01:54:29.830 --> 01:54:29.840 align:start position:0%
and it did not make sense to have all
 
01:54:31.270 --> 01:54:31.280 align:start position:0%
those separate accounts
 
01:54:33.750 --> 01:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
they were merged into what we call now
 
01:54:36.629 --> 01:54:36.639 align:start position:0%
the game management account
 
01:54:40.470 --> 01:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
so we have right now on the books
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
16 dedicated accounts and you're asking
 
01:54:44.000 --> 01:54:44.950 align:start position:0%
16 dedicated accounts and you're asking
specifically

01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:54:47.830 --> 01:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
for the game management account i have
 
01:54:49.350 --> 01:54:49.360 align:start position:0%
the balance that was brought
 
01:54:52.709 --> 01:54:52.719 align:start position:0%
forward into fiscal year 21
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
and that would have been 1.6 million
 
01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:00.629 align:start position:0%
and that would have been 1.6 million
dollars

01:55:00.629 --> 01:55:00.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:03.270 --> 01:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
thank you i know i know this is in our
 
01:55:03.280 --> 01:55:04.229 align:start position:0%
thank you i know i know this is in our
dedicated

01:55:04.229 --> 01:55:04.239 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
01:55:07.589 --> 01:55:07.599 align:start position:0%
fund what i call a telephone book
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
enormous compilation um
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
but what are what's the total for all of
 
01:55:16.310 --> 01:55:16.320 align:start position:0%
the dedicated accounts
 
01:55:20.629 --> 01:55:20.639 align:start position:0%
and how how much comes in from the feds
 
01:55:24.310 --> 01:55:24.320 align:start position:0%
oh i i don't well total federal dollars
 
01:55:27.430 --> 01:55:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh really varies on an annual basis
 
01:55:36.149 --> 01:55:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:38.950 --> 01:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
the unobligated balance that came
 
01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.750 align:start position:0%
the unobligated balance that came
forward

01:55:39.750 --> 01:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
forward
 
01:55:42.629 --> 01:55:42.639 align:start position:0%
into fiscal year 21 which means when we
 
01:55:43.750 --> 01:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
close the books
 
01:55:47.669 --> 01:55:47.679 align:start position:0%
june 30th of 2020
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
in our dedicated accounts meaning

about
 
01:56:10.550 --> 01:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
half of of the expenses that are in

01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
um based on reps of almi's question
 
01:57:38.950 --> 01:57:38.960 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:57:40.149 --> 01:57:40.159 align:start position:0%
department of safety and their
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
calculation for the unr unrefunded tolls

except some of my emails aren't going
out

01:58:02.870 --> 01:58:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.270 --> 01:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
i can reach out to dana and monica again
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
with an email
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
and see if they could join sooner but
 
01:58:10.070 --> 01:58:10.080 align:start position:0%
unless there's something the committee
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
needs to talk about at this moment
 
01:58:13.669 --> 01:58:13.679 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to take a break
 
01:58:16.470 --> 01:58:16.480 align:start position:0%
for a few minutes or
 
01:58:19.669 --> 01:58:19.679 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments from the
 
01:58:19.679 --> 01:58:20.709 align:start position:0%
any questions or comments from the
committee

01:58:20.709 --> 01:58:20.719 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:58:25.870 --> 01:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:28.790 --> 01:58:28.800 align:start position:0%
25 after uh norm
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative schamberg here yes are we
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
exacting any bills tomorrow or are we
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
just having hearings
 
01:58:40.310 --> 01:58:40.320 align:start position:0%
tomorrow i talked to susan
 
01:58:43.430 --> 01:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
and we plan on executing
 
01:58:45.030 --> 01:58:45.040 align:start position:0%
okay all right i just wanna make sure i
 
01:58:46.470 --> 01:58:46.480 align:start position:0%
heard's right and will that be
 
01:58:50.070 --> 01:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
after the hearings or be sometime during
 
01:58:53.910 --> 01:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
if there's time between hearing
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
then we will hopefully be able to
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
execute a bill
 
01:59:01.589 --> 01:59:01.599 align:start position:0%
too okay i won't have any time for the
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
exact at the end of the last hearing
 
01:59:06.790 --> 01:59:06.800 align:start position:0%
okay thank you sir but there's only
 
01:59:08.470 --> 01:59:08.480 align:start position:0%
there's only four bills that
 
01:59:12.550 --> 01:59:12.560 align:start position:0%
uh candidates for liking tomorrow
 
01:59:16.310 --> 01:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
and i can go through those right now and
 
01:59:19.350 --> 01:59:19.360 align:start position:0%
those are bills that uh
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
as a result of the republican caucus
 
01:59:25.109 --> 01:59:25.119 align:start position:0%
another kind of caucus
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
pretty close that would be house bill
 
01:59:34.950 --> 01:59:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:40.629 --> 01:59:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
53 yeah 353
 
01:59:50.149 --> 01:59:50.159 align:start position:0%
house bill 583
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
543 and 533 is an early bill and we need
 
01:59:55.750 --> 01:59:55.760 align:start position:0%
to get that out tomorrow
 
01:59:59.750 --> 01:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
so the one two three four bills
 
02:00:03.990 --> 02:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and it was
 
02:00:09.350 --> 02:00:09.360 align:start position:0%
15 281 353
 
02:00:12.470 --> 02:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
let me hospital 15.
 
02:00:16.390 --> 02:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
281 353
 
02:00:21.750 --> 02:00:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:25.830 --> 02:00:25.840 align:start position:0%
uh norm yes um i've been taking notes
 
02:00:26.470 --> 02:00:26.480 align:start position:0%
and i
 
02:00:28.149 --> 02:00:28.159 align:start position:0%
keep going back to eddie's comments
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
about how much covit is going to
 
02:00:32.790 --> 02:00:32.800 align:start position:0%
affect these revenues um but it seems
 
02:00:34.709 --> 02:00:34.719 align:start position:0%
like we have some revenues that we don't
 
02:00:36.390 --> 02:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
really think kova is going to affect
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
very much
 
02:00:39.510 --> 02:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
we have others like meals and rooms
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
where there might be a very great effect
 
02:00:44.550 --> 02:00:44.560 align:start position:0%
and make might make sense going forward
 
02:00:45.750 --> 02:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
to kind of break those
 
02:00:50.629 --> 02:00:50.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:53.109 --> 02:00:53.119 align:start position:0%
you've been on this before and what we
 
02:00:53.990 --> 02:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
usually end up
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
doing is that we
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
take care of the easy revenues first
 
02:01:04.629 --> 02:01:04.639 align:start position:0%
those that such as tom refers to
 
02:01:07.430 --> 02:01:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we're pretty confident don't very
 
02:01:07.440 --> 02:01:08.310 align:start position:0%
that we're pretty confident don't very
much

02:01:08.310 --> 02:01:08.320 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:01:10.390 --> 02:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
and we have great confidence in the
 
02:01:10.400 --> 02:01:11.830 align:start position:0%
and we have great confidence in the
agencies

02:01:11.830 --> 02:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:01:16.950 --> 02:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
and we don't feel that clove is
 
02:01:20.070 --> 02:01:20.080 align:start position:0%
and we'll have to identify those that we
 
02:01:20.950 --> 02:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
feel covert
 
02:01:25.109 --> 02:01:25.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:28.390 --> 02:01:28.400 align:start position:0%
this is why we need to get
 
02:01:32.070 --> 02:01:32.080 align:start position:0%
somebody from hhs come before the
 
02:01:32.080 --> 02:01:33.430 align:start position:0%
somebody from hhs come before the
committee

02:01:33.430 --> 02:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:01:37.589 --> 02:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
and so we can question them relative to
 
02:01:40.950 --> 02:01:40.960 align:start position:0%
where is this covet going do we see
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
light at the end of the tunnel is it
 
02:01:44.070 --> 02:01:44.080 align:start position:0%
going to get worse is it going to get
 
02:01:47.270 --> 02:01:47.280 align:start position:0%
better is it going to reoccur again
 
02:01:52.550 --> 02:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:54.870 --> 02:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
we don't do th if we don't do that with
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
hhs we're really not doing our job
 
02:02:02.390 --> 02:02:02.400 align:start position:0%
i agree um any further
 
02:02:05.910 --> 02:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
comments before we take a break well
 
02:02:08.709 --> 02:02:08.719 align:start position:0%
you know if we could get the link uh mr
 
02:02:11.030 --> 02:02:11.040 align:start position:0%
chairman to that two-hour
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
meeting with of course
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
chris is going to send that link to us
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay i'd be happy to
 
02:02:22.790 --> 02:02:22.800 align:start position:0%
to look at it this weekend and see
 
02:02:24.790 --> 02:02:24.800 align:start position:0%
whether there's a section that's
 
02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:26.629 align:start position:0%
whether there's a section that's
particularly

02:02:26.629 --> 02:02:26.639 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
02:02:30.390 --> 02:02:30.400 align:start position:0%
relevant not only you whoever else will
 
02:02:31.030 --> 02:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
do that
 
02:02:32.629 --> 02:02:32.639 align:start position:0%
and it will help the committee as a
 
02:02:34.550 --> 02:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
whole it would be
 
02:02:38.310 --> 02:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
two hours is a long time and
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:45.189 --> 02:02:45.199 align:start position:0%
the new people are
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
right at the same point as we are on
 
02:02:49.030 --> 02:02:49.040 align:start position:0%
this covert so
 
02:02:52.950 --> 02:02:52.960 align:start position:0%
i invite them to do the same
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
right major yes chris
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%

02:03:00.870 --> 02:03:00.880 align:start position:0%
so she could meet with the committee now
 
02:03:02.229 --> 02:03:02.239 align:start position:0%

02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
maybe she can join in the middle of the
 
02:03:08.159 --> 02:03:09.350 align:start position:0%
maybe she can join in the middle of the
conversation

02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:03:11.270 --> 02:03:11.280 align:start position:0%

02:03:45.430 --> 02:03:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.030 --> 02:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
the um can you put up
 
02:04:08.629 --> 02:04:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.750 --> 02:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
and they're going to concentrate on the
 
02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.550 align:start position:0%
and they're going to concentrate on the
so-called

02:04:12.550 --> 02:04:12.560 align:start position:0%
so-called
 
02:04:17.990 --> 02:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:23.430 --> 02:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:25.830 --> 02:04:25.840 align:start position:0%
last time we met so i can follow up with
 
02:04:28.310 --> 02:04:28.320 align:start position:0%
any additional questions
 
02:04:31.910 --> 02:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay so i've got it on page three of the
 
02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:33.589 align:start position:0%
okay so i've got it on page three of the
presentation

02:04:33.589 --> 02:04:33.599 align:start position:0%
presentation
 
02:04:35.990 --> 02:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
um that just talks about kind of an
 
02:04:37.510 --> 02:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
overview of the different
 
02:04:39.589 --> 02:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
other revenue that's tracked and
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:48.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:53.030 --> 02:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
let me pull out the participant list
 
02:04:56.950 --> 02:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
see all right representative
 
02:05:06.229 --> 02:05:06.239 align:start position:0%
software you have questions
 
02:05:09.510 --> 02:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
represented southwest yeah i apologize
 
02:05:12.709 --> 02:05:12.719 align:start position:0%
my hand was up from before okay uh
 
02:05:15.430 --> 02:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative brown yeah this is
 
02:05:16.310 --> 02:05:16.320 align:start position:0%
actually for chris
 
02:05:19.350 --> 02:05:19.360 align:start position:0%
um what what percent i don't have
 
02:05:20.790 --> 02:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
the sheets in front of me but what
 
02:05:23.109 --> 02:05:23.119 align:start position:0%
percent we're hearing from uh
 
02:05:25.669 --> 02:05:25.679 align:start position:0%
from uh about abandoned property because
 
02:05:27.589 --> 02:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a large number compared to
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
the rest
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
what percentage of the total is
 
02:05:32.069 --> 02:05:32.079 align:start position:0%
abandoned property
 
02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:36.239 align:start position:0%
on the other yeah i think slide six has
 
02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
a good depiction
 
02:05:42.069 --> 02:05:42.079 align:start position:0%
of that so so i'm on slide six now and
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
you can see abandoned properties
 
02:05:47.589 --> 02:05:47.599 align:start position:0%
um estimated to be about 17.3 million
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
in 21 16.8 million and 22
 
02:05:56.310 --> 02:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:59.430 --> 02:05:59.440 align:start position:0%
but when we look at the total for uh
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
okay i'm sorry okay
 
02:06:04.470 --> 02:06:04.480 align:start position:0%
so the total the total in the other
 
02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:06.149 align:start position:0%
so the total the total in the other
category

02:06:06.149 --> 02:06:06.159 align:start position:0%
category
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know is 64. 8 million
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
of that 17.3 would be from abandoned
 
02:06:14.830 --> 02:06:14.840 align:start position:0%
property in 2021
 
02:06:17.750 --> 02:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
right and that's why we're breaking it
 
02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
out just to
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
make sure we get that one understand
 
02:06:21.910 --> 02:06:21.920 align:start position:0%
that that large number
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.310 --> 02:06:30.320 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous revenues there's about
 
02:06:34.310 --> 02:06:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
of dedicated
 
02:06:41.350 --> 02:06:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.149 --> 02:06:44.159 align:start position:0%
is that the right number i think dana
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
said something like 140 now
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
but it has been up closer to 200 in past
 
02:06:48.960 --> 02:06:49.510 align:start position:0%
but it has been up closer to 200 in past
years

02:06:49.510 --> 02:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:06:52.950 --> 02:06:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay dana you can correct me
 
02:06:55.750 --> 02:06:55.760 align:start position:0%
yeah they're revenue sources in our
 
02:06:56.950 --> 02:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
financial system
 
02:06:59.669 --> 02:06:59.679 align:start position:0%
so they may or may not be dedicated but
 
02:07:00.470 --> 02:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
they are
 
02:07:02.550 --> 02:07:02.560 align:start position:0%
various revenue sources collected by the
 
02:07:02.560 --> 02:07:04.149 align:start position:0%
various revenue sources collected by the
agencies

02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
and that whole 140 represents that 26.7
 
02:07:08.719 --> 02:07:10.830 align:start position:0%
and that whole 140 represents that 26.7
million

02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:07:14.229 --> 02:07:14.239 align:start position:0%
yes yeah and then
 
02:07:19.109 --> 02:07:19.119 align:start position:0%
the others three are the major items
 
02:07:21.750 --> 02:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
reimbursement indirect costs
 
02:07:24.390 --> 02:07:24.400 align:start position:0%
post-retirement benefits recovery
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
and abandoned property correct those are
 
02:07:28.390 --> 02:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
the top
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
three within the entire category of
 
02:07:31.360 --> 02:07:37.510 align:start position:0%
three within the entire category of
other

02:07:37.510 --> 02:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:40.550 --> 02:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh representative oh no
 
02:07:43.350 --> 02:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
i i didn't lower my hand i'm sorry okay
 
02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:52.709 --> 02:07:52.719 align:start position:0%
jordan i gotta find the thing
 
02:07:55.270 --> 02:07:55.280 align:start position:0%

constituent with an issue regarding
 
02:08:25.109 --> 02:08:25.119 align:start position:0%
unclaimed property and a small thing she
 
02:08:25.990 --> 02:08:26.000 align:start position:0%
should be aware of
 
02:08:30.149 --> 02:08:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:34.870 --> 02:08:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i just wanted
 
02:08:38.159 --> 02:08:38.470 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman on i just wanted
to

02:08:38.470 --> 02:08:38.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:08:42.229 --> 02:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
ask there are a number of these that
 
02:08:45.430 --> 02:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
in the other category that are
 
02:08:49.189 --> 02:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
on our boards gas fitter fees
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
things like that that are in the larger
 
02:08:53.669 --> 02:08:53.679 align:start position:0%
part of the
 
02:08:56.870 --> 02:08:56.880 align:start position:0%
other category are those lapses
 
02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
is that the way that one works lapse at
 
02:09:00.310 --> 02:09:00.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the year
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
of what the board hasn't had to spend
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
um this would be just on the revenue
 
02:09:08.709 --> 02:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
side so
 
02:09:11.430 --> 02:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
it would be any revenue they collected
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
that would support
 
02:09:16.470 --> 02:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
the expenditure of that agency
 
02:09:18.709 --> 02:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't it this particular rev
 
02:09:20.790 --> 02:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
these particular revenue sources here
 
02:09:23.669 --> 02:09:23.679 align:start position:0%
are unrestricted revenues that support
 
02:09:25.910 --> 02:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
general fund spending as a whole
 
02:09:28.950 --> 02:09:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh so if they if they
 
02:09:31.430 --> 02:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
collect what they planned to collect
 
02:09:33.510 --> 02:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
we're in good shape if they collect less
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
than they planned
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
then our hope is that another revenue
 
02:09:38.310 --> 02:09:38.320 align:start position:0%
source comes in higher
 
02:09:41.109 --> 02:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
and net net the total category comes
 
02:09:43.350 --> 02:09:43.360 align:start position:0%
within plan
 
02:09:46.390 --> 02:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah my
 
02:09:46.400 --> 02:09:47.270 align:start position:0%
does that answer your question yeah my
question

02:09:47.270 --> 02:09:47.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:09:50.629 --> 02:09:50.639 align:start position:0%
comes from on in the past we were
 
02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
the board of electricians which had been
 
02:09:53.920 --> 02:09:54.629 align:start position:0%
the board of electricians which had been
absorbed

02:09:54.629 --> 02:09:54.639 align:start position:0%
absorbed
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
into safety at a time when we had a very
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
long-term commissioner
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
and on plumbers
 
02:10:08.470 --> 02:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
on the idea was that electricians should
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
should go with plumbers the electricians
 
02:10:11.910 --> 02:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
were very
 
02:10:14.950 --> 02:10:14.960 align:start position:0%
upset about this partly because uh some
 
02:10:16.790 --> 02:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
of their expenses were
 
02:10:19.750 --> 02:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
of their fees were being used for things
 
02:10:21.669 --> 02:10:21.679 align:start position:0%
that belonged to all of safety and not
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
to them
 
02:10:26.310 --> 02:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
and they eventually got out of there but
 
02:10:29.350 --> 02:10:29.360 align:start position:0%
um do you
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
do you when they're they're within
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
another agency
 
02:10:38.310 --> 02:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
and they aren't completely uh within the
 
02:10:41.990 --> 02:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
what that agency is doing do you look at
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
how these expenses go on
 
02:10:47.350 --> 02:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
how they are using their expenses or
 
02:10:50.550 --> 02:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:53.430 --> 02:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
we do not do that here in central
 
02:10:54.709 --> 02:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
accounting but i'm
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that the department of safety
 
02:10:57.830 --> 02:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
would have more
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
information on that it's one of their
 
02:11:01.030 --> 02:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
revenue sources
 
02:11:10.629 --> 02:11:10.639 align:start position:0%
so i would i would not speak for them
 
02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:22.870 --> 02:11:22.880 align:start position:0%
um chris is monika
 
02:11:25.910 --> 02:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
have you been able to contact her yet um
 
02:11:27.589 --> 02:11:27.599 align:start position:0%
i haven't been able to get in touch with
 
02:11:29.109 --> 02:11:29.119 align:start position:0%
her yet
 
02:11:31.030 --> 02:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
but again the committee is meeting a
 
02:11:32.790 --> 02:11:32.800 align:start position:0%
little bit sooner than i had originally
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
told her
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.950 --> 02:11:42.960 align:start position:0%
she may get on in by 11 20 because dana
 
02:11:44.950 --> 02:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
was able to but i don't know
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
um and if there's any specific questions
 
02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:48.470 align:start position:0%
um and if there's any specific questions
um

02:11:48.470 --> 02:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:50.950 --> 02:11:50.960 align:start position:0%
for her that the committee doesn't want
 
02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
to stay on the call until
 
02:11:54.709 --> 02:11:54.719 align:start position:0%
she gets on like i can share those with
 
02:11:55.589 --> 02:11:55.599 align:start position:0%
her and
 
02:11:57.270 --> 02:11:57.280 align:start position:0%
bring back to the committee we can wait
 
02:11:59.750 --> 02:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
until she gets on
 
02:12:01.990 --> 02:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
um it's however you want to proceed
 
02:12:02.870 --> 02:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
represent major
 
02:12:04.550 --> 02:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
like she may be on in the next five or
 
02:12:06.790 --> 02:12:06.800 align:start position:0%
ten minutes oh wait
 
02:12:10.550 --> 02:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay um and and if i might represent
 
02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
over you would just like me to get you
 
02:12:13.669 --> 02:12:13.679 align:start position:0%
the abandoned property information and
 
02:12:18.790 --> 02:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i've got a constituent uh that uh
 
02:12:22.310 --> 02:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
had a
 
02:12:25.510 --> 02:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
um interesting conversation with
 
02:12:28.390 --> 02:12:28.400 align:start position:0%
people on the phone um and i wanted to
 
02:12:30.069 --> 02:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
relay that
 
02:12:32.310 --> 02:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
okay yeah so i'll get you the treasurer
 
02:12:34.149 --> 02:12:34.159 align:start position:0%
and then the um director of abandoned
 
02:12:34.159 --> 02:12:34.950 align:start position:0%
and then the um director of abandoned
properties

02:12:34.950 --> 02:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
properties
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
email addresses and i'll send them to
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:47.030 --> 02:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
and what we're looking at on the screen
 
02:12:49.109 --> 02:12:49.119 align:start position:0%
now is some of the other
 
02:12:55.830 --> 02:12:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.870 --> 02:12:58.880 align:start position:0%
one you see the labor transfer in the
 
02:13:01.669 --> 02:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
middle of the page
 
02:13:04.709 --> 02:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
so if i can yes highlight it yeah so
 
02:13:06.870 --> 02:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
that's an example of an agency that's
 
02:13:09.030 --> 02:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
uh has a dedicated funding mechanism
 
02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
uh has a dedicated funding mechanism
currently

02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:13:11.830 --> 02:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
so all the fees that they collect go
 
02:13:13.990 --> 02:13:14.000 align:start position:0%
into a a a
 
02:13:16.390 --> 02:13:16.400 align:start position:0%
dedicated fund they pay their expenses
 
02:13:18.069 --> 02:13:18.079 align:start position:0%
from that so that the legislature
 
02:13:19.189 --> 02:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
appropriates them
 
02:13:21.030 --> 02:13:21.040 align:start position:0%
in a budget and it's paid through that
 
02:13:23.109 --> 02:13:23.119 align:start position:0%
fund and at the end of the year
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
they transfer any balance that's
 
02:13:26.310 --> 02:13:26.320 align:start position:0%
remaining to the general fund so that's
 
02:13:27.830 --> 02:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
a it's a revenue transfer
 
02:13:31.270 --> 02:13:31.280 align:start position:0%
into other category so that's
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
one example um i think kind of relates
 
02:13:35.430 --> 02:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
to what represent volume was asking
 
02:13:36.790 --> 02:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
about like the gas fitters
 
02:13:38.950 --> 02:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
gas fitters i think is set in statute so
 
02:13:39.830 --> 02:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
that they're
 
02:13:42.390 --> 02:13:42.400 align:start position:0%
they're a generally funded board so all
 
02:13:43.910 --> 02:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
their fees go into the general fund and
 
02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
then they are funded through the general
 
02:13:45.360 --> 02:13:46.629 align:start position:0%
then they are funded through the general
fund

02:13:46.629 --> 02:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:13:48.550 --> 02:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
and the reviews that you would have for
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
those types of agencies
 
02:13:52.149 --> 02:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
um by the legislature would be
 
02:13:54.390 --> 02:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
essentially be during this budget
 
02:13:57.030 --> 02:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
process so if there's any specific
 
02:13:58.709 --> 02:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
questions on
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
a specific fund and how it's being used
 
02:14:02.790 --> 02:14:02.800 align:start position:0%
to pay for
 
02:14:04.629 --> 02:14:04.639 align:start position:0%
activities with an agency you know
 
02:14:06.310 --> 02:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
that's a time that sometimes the
 
02:14:07.830 --> 02:14:07.840 align:start position:0%
finance committee will will have that
 
02:14:09.990 --> 02:14:10.000 align:start position:0%
discussion with the agencies and
 
02:14:12.149 --> 02:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
sometimes as a result of that you might
 
02:14:14.149 --> 02:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
see language added to house bill 2 to
 
02:14:16.470 --> 02:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
address some of those concerns
 
02:14:19.030 --> 02:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
um so i would suggest that if there's
 
02:14:20.390 --> 02:14:20.400 align:start position:0%
members of of
 
02:14:21.910 --> 02:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
house ways and means or any other
 
02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
committee that
 
02:14:26.629 --> 02:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
has a concern about an activity that's
 
02:14:28.229 --> 02:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
funded through the budget that is in
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
a debt using a dedicated or restricted
 
02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:31.750 align:start position:0%
a debt using a dedicated or restricted
fund

02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
share that with your finance um members
 
02:14:35.669 --> 02:14:35.679 align:start position:0%
and and
 
02:14:37.750 --> 02:14:37.760 align:start position:0%
they can maybe address that as part of
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:14:44.709 --> 02:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:46.550 --> 02:14:46.560 align:start position:0%
in addition our office will sometimes do
 
02:14:48.709 --> 02:14:48.719 align:start position:0%
audits of these various entities
 
02:14:50.950 --> 02:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
um we do performance audits and
 
02:14:52.709 --> 02:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
financial audits performance audits are
 
02:14:53.750 --> 02:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
driven by
 
02:14:55.189 --> 02:14:55.199 align:start position:0%
the legislative performance audit
 
02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:57.599 align:start position:0%
oversight committee um
 
02:14:59.189 --> 02:14:59.199 align:start position:0%
looking more at like your efficiency
 
02:15:01.109 --> 02:15:01.119 align:start position:0%
effectiveness type of issues and then
 
02:15:02.870 --> 02:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
obviously the financial audits look at
 
02:15:05.589 --> 02:15:05.599 align:start position:0%
the finances so there's a those are two
 
02:15:06.709 --> 02:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
ways that
 
02:15:08.550 --> 02:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
somebody outside the agency might look
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
at some of these entities
 
02:15:13.510 --> 02:15:13.520 align:start position:0%
the uh there's one line there the
 
02:15:13.520 --> 02:15:14.550 align:start position:0%
the uh there's one line there the
indigent

02:15:14.550 --> 02:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
indigent
 
02:15:17.990 --> 02:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
representation yep uh
 
02:15:24.470 --> 02:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
does this mean that it was funded
 
02:15:32.709 --> 02:15:32.719 align:start position:0%
and this is the excess over that or
 
02:15:36.069 --> 02:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
however so that's basically a recovery
 
02:15:39.589 --> 02:15:39.599 align:start position:0%
of judicial counsel okay um expenses so
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
when they when they pay
 
02:15:43.030 --> 02:15:43.040 align:start position:0%
um or they pay for the services that are
 
02:15:44.470 --> 02:15:44.480 align:start position:0%
provided for those individuals that
 
02:15:46.390 --> 02:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
can't afford an attorney or the services
 
02:15:47.750 --> 02:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
around that
 
02:15:49.830 --> 02:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
um they do there's a process within
 
02:15:51.750 --> 02:15:51.760 align:start position:0%
administrative services to look at
 
02:15:53.669 --> 02:15:53.679 align:start position:0%
individuals to see if they
 
02:15:55.270 --> 02:15:55.280 align:start position:0%
could reimburse the state for some
 
02:15:57.109 --> 02:15:57.119 align:start position:0%
portion of that money
 
02:16:01.030 --> 02:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
on their defense or on their case um
 
02:16:02.470 --> 02:16:02.480 align:start position:0%
so that's what that represents and
 
02:16:04.870 --> 02:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's why it's
 
02:16:06.790 --> 02:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
fairly difficult i think to to know
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
exactly what they're going to get from
 
02:16:10.149 --> 02:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
year to year because it's it's uh
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
really dependent on what they can
 
02:16:15.669 --> 02:16:15.679 align:start position:0%
recover that's a fairly large amount
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
yeah 1.8 million oh chris i was just
 
02:16:19.350 --> 02:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
going to add
 
02:16:21.750 --> 02:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's a great explanation and it's done
 
02:16:23.510 --> 02:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
through our costa collections division
 
02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
here and admin services
 
02:16:26.790 --> 02:16:26.800 align:start position:0%
but they did have some recent
 
02:16:30.470 --> 02:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
legislative changes that i think
 
02:16:32.709 --> 02:16:32.719 align:start position:0%
restricted the amount that i shouldn't
 
02:16:34.309 --> 02:16:34.319 align:start position:0%
use the term restricted but
 
02:16:37.669 --> 02:16:37.679 align:start position:0%
um we we expect to collect less because
 
02:16:40.790 --> 02:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
of some recent changes in legislation so
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
that is
 
02:16:44.709 --> 02:16:44.719 align:start position:0%
um commissioner arlinghaus had given me
 
02:16:47.030 --> 02:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
a lower estimate for that line item
 
02:16:51.110 --> 02:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:52.709 --> 02:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
thank you dana and i'm sorry i should
 
02:16:56.469 --> 02:16:56.479 align:start position:0%
have let dana respond to that
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
no i think that was a great response
 
02:17:04.230 --> 02:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative brownie
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask this question but
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
since we have time if you go to the
 
02:17:10.469 --> 02:17:10.479 align:start position:0%
aircraft operations fees
 
02:17:14.790 --> 02:17:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh i guess it would be dana
 
02:17:17.270 --> 02:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
years ago we we had a bill that we
 
02:17:17.280 --> 02:17:17.830 align:start position:0%
years ago we we had a bill that we
actually

02:17:17.830 --> 02:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
lowered the fees to encourage more
 
02:17:24.389 --> 02:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
planes to be based in new hampshire but
 
02:17:25.110 --> 02:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
does that line
 
02:17:28.629 --> 02:17:28.639 align:start position:0%
also include the fuel tax that we
 
02:17:28.639 --> 02:17:29.830 align:start position:0%
also include the fuel tax that we
collect

02:17:29.830 --> 02:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
collect
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
from both the prop plains and jet a
 
02:17:36.309 --> 02:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
fuel that's used i
 
02:17:39.270 --> 02:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
would expect not i can check with the
 
02:17:41.110 --> 02:17:41.120 align:start position:0%
department of transportation
 
02:17:43.270 --> 02:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
unless chris knows but we since we've
 
02:17:45.030 --> 02:17:45.040 align:start position:0%
identified that particular revenue
 
02:17:45.040 --> 02:17:45.429 align:start position:0%
identified that particular revenue
source

02:17:45.429 --> 02:17:45.439 align:start position:0%
source
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
just for aircraft operator fees i would
 
02:17:49.509 --> 02:17:49.519 align:start position:0%
expect there wouldn't be other funds
 
02:17:51.270 --> 02:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
commingled in that line
 
02:17:52.950 --> 02:17:52.960 align:start position:0%
so those are the those are the aircraft
 
02:17:54.950 --> 02:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
registration fees to
 
02:17:58.230 --> 02:17:58.240 align:start position:0%
be based to have your plane uh based

okay is moniker of us yet
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
representative major could i on
 
02:18:22.230 --> 02:18:22.240 align:start position:0%
on add something to the dedicated fund
 
02:18:22.240 --> 02:18:23.270 align:start position:0%
on add something to the dedicated fund
discussion

02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:18:26.309 --> 02:18:26.319 align:start position:0%
yes thank you on i was
 
02:18:28.629 --> 02:18:28.639 align:start position:0%
on the division in finance many many
 
02:18:29.589 --> 02:18:29.599 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
02:18:31.190 --> 02:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
which was supposed to be dealing with
 
02:18:32.790 --> 02:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
these things and
 
02:18:35.669 --> 02:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
i understand that they're still they pay
 
02:18:37.750 --> 02:18:37.760 align:start position:0%
very little attention to the dedicated
 
02:18:39.750 --> 02:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
funds because they're concentrated on
 
02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:40.309 align:start position:0%
funds because they're concentrated on
the

02:18:40.309 --> 02:18:40.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:18:43.589 --> 02:18:43.599 align:start position:0%
general fund and the education trust
 
02:18:43.599 --> 02:18:44.309 align:start position:0%
general fund and the education trust
fund

02:18:44.309 --> 02:18:44.319 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:18:47.030 --> 02:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
and that is why over the i worked over
 
02:18:48.950 --> 02:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
the years on dedicated
 
02:18:52.549 --> 02:18:52.559 align:start position:0%
fund uh oversight
 
02:18:55.830 --> 02:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
for a long time and we now have a
 
02:18:55.840 --> 02:18:56.790 align:start position:0%
for a long time and we now have a
dedicated

02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
dedicated
 
02:18:59.429 --> 02:18:59.439 align:start position:0%
fund joint committee with the senate
 
02:19:00.629 --> 02:19:00.639 align:start position:0%
which is doing
 
02:19:03.830 --> 02:19:03.840 align:start position:0%
five-year cycle uh reviews of all of the
 
02:19:05.270 --> 02:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
02:19:09.830 --> 02:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
by agency and on we have in the past
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
on uh found saying
 
02:19:16.309 --> 02:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
things the the uh office for
 
02:19:18.709 --> 02:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
professional licensure and certification
 
02:19:21.990 --> 02:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
had came and asked us for a uh
 
02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
told us that they they because we were
 
02:19:26.150 --> 02:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
talking with them they went
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
and asked for a performance audit which
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
is coming to them shortly and if anybody
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
does have
 
02:19:37.030 --> 02:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
uh questions about dedicated funds i
 
02:19:37.040 --> 02:19:37.429 align:start position:0%
uh questions about dedicated funds i
think

02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
uh we are doing a five-year cycle but we
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
do it uh representative major i think
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
he's going to chair again
 
02:19:53.030 --> 02:19:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.070 --> 02:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
we also take things out of order when
 
02:19:59.510 --> 02:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
we've got questions that have come up
 
02:20:01.590 --> 02:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
so that we can look at particular
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and see
 
02:20:06.150 --> 02:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
we we look at how much money uh
 
02:20:08.230 --> 02:20:08.240 align:start position:0%
they have accumulated that they aren't
 
02:20:08.240 --> 02:20:09.349 align:start position:0%
they have accumulated that they aren't
using

02:20:09.349 --> 02:20:09.359 align:start position:0%
using
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
uh that's been a problem what used to be
 
02:20:13.510 --> 02:20:13.520 align:start position:0%
a problem in some of them
 
02:20:15.429 --> 02:20:15.439 align:start position:0%
we look at whether they've got too
 
02:20:17.110 --> 02:20:17.120 align:start position:0%
little money to do what they're supposed
 
02:20:18.790 --> 02:20:18.800 align:start position:0%
to be doing or they're doing the same
 
02:20:20.710 --> 02:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
thing as something else
 
02:20:24.389 --> 02:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
on the the funds have been getting
 
02:20:28.309 --> 02:20:28.319 align:start position:0%
a lot more regularized over this
 
02:20:30.790 --> 02:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
long period in which we've been looking
 
02:20:32.230 --> 02:20:32.240 align:start position:0%
at them
 
02:20:34.469 --> 02:20:34.479 align:start position:0%
that'll make tomorrow easier when we
 
02:20:34.479 --> 02:20:35.990 align:start position:0%
that'll make tomorrow easier when we
discuss

02:20:35.990 --> 02:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
discuss
 
02:20:39.510 --> 02:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 134 which is repealing the
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:50.550 --> 02:20:50.560 align:start position:0%
the treasurer is on the line now and
 
02:20:52.469 --> 02:20:52.479 align:start position:0%
she'll be promoted into the call
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
okay great um and just a follow up with
 
02:20:56.950 --> 02:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
the dedicated funds
 
02:21:00.070 --> 02:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
that document is produced by
 
02:21:01.670 --> 02:21:01.680 align:start position:0%
department of administrative services
 
02:21:03.429 --> 02:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
and is available on their website so you
 
02:21:04.309 --> 02:21:04.319 align:start position:0%
can see the
 
02:21:06.309 --> 02:21:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh as representative referred to it as
 
02:21:07.429 --> 02:21:07.439 align:start position:0%
the phone book
 
02:21:09.510 --> 02:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
electronically on on department of
 
02:21:10.950 --> 02:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
administrative services website and
 
02:21:11.990 --> 02:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
you'll see all the dedicated
 
02:21:14.630 --> 02:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
funds that are established in the state
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
um it does provide the statutory
 
02:21:17.270 --> 02:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
reference so if you're
 
02:21:19.590 --> 02:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
curious as to you know how it's set up
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
and what the law is saying
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
and to the comment about the um finance
 
02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:26.309 align:start position:0%
and to the comment about the um finance
committee

02:21:26.309 --> 02:21:26.319 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:27.680 align:start position:0%
maybe not looking as much at the
 
02:21:29.349 --> 02:21:29.359 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds as they do the general
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
fund and the education trust fund as
 
02:21:32.309 --> 02:21:32.319 align:start position:0%
well as
 
02:21:34.389 --> 02:21:34.399 align:start position:0%
fish and game and and highway funds
 
02:21:34.399 --> 02:21:35.590 align:start position:0%
fish and game and and highway funds
unrestricted

02:21:35.590 --> 02:21:35.600 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
02:21:37.670 --> 02:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
um that's a true statement partly
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
because a lot of the
 
02:21:42.389 --> 02:21:42.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds provide authority to
 
02:21:45.030 --> 02:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
the commissioner or a commission or
 
02:21:47.590 --> 02:21:47.600 align:start position:0%
group to
 
02:21:49.190 --> 02:21:49.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate and spend the money in those
 
02:21:51.110 --> 02:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds
 
02:21:52.550 --> 02:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
so so the legislature through the
 
02:21:54.309 --> 02:21:54.319 align:start position:0%
legislation has decided that
 
02:21:55.670 --> 02:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
you know the money should be available
 
02:21:57.590 --> 02:21:57.600 align:start position:0%
for a certain purpose and and
 
02:21:58.950 --> 02:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
they come forward and present it in
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
their budget and
 
02:22:03.110 --> 02:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
they may have a language that allows
 
02:22:04.389 --> 02:22:04.399 align:start position:0%
them to if they have more revenue than
 
02:22:05.750 --> 02:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
they expected to just go ahead and
 
02:22:09.510 --> 02:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
budget that for the activity um
 
02:22:12.230 --> 02:22:12.240 align:start position:0%
so so that kind of led to the purpose i
 
02:22:12.870 --> 02:22:12.880 align:start position:0%
think of the
 
02:22:14.309 --> 02:22:14.319 align:start position:0%
the commission that she was talking
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
about just a moment ago
 
02:22:17.830 --> 02:22:17.840 align:start position:0%
to review the dedicated funds to make
 
02:22:19.190 --> 02:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
sure they were being used
 
02:22:21.990 --> 02:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
the way that the legislature intended uh
 
02:22:22.950 --> 02:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
make sure that
 
02:22:24.790 --> 02:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
you know over time things haven't
 
02:22:26.389 --> 02:22:26.399 align:start position:0%
changed where the funds maybe need to be
 
02:22:27.429 --> 02:22:27.439 align:start position:0%
used differently
 
02:22:28.870 --> 02:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
and if that was the case then a
 
02:22:31.670 --> 02:22:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislation could be introduced um to
 
02:22:33.349 --> 02:22:33.359 align:start position:0%
reflect what the use of the funds should
 
02:22:34.790 --> 02:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
be going forward and then
 
02:22:37.590 --> 02:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
if the fund wasn't being used to repeal
 
02:22:37.600 --> 02:22:38.309 align:start position:0%
if the fund wasn't being used to repeal
it

02:22:38.309 --> 02:22:38.319 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:22:41.030 --> 02:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
and clean it up a little bit and so when
 
02:22:43.349 --> 02:22:43.359 align:start position:0%
you look at the dedicated fund report
 
02:22:45.110 --> 02:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see that there's some they're all
 
02:22:47.510 --> 02:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
numbered starting one and they go up to
 
02:22:50.870 --> 02:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
like 350 now somewhere in that range
 
02:22:52.550 --> 02:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
but you'll see you know some numbers are
 
02:22:55.270 --> 02:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
repealed um
 
02:22:58.070 --> 02:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
purposely the numbers aren't reused you
 
02:22:59.670 --> 02:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
just keep adding to the end as you're
 
02:23:02.710 --> 02:23:02.720 align:start position:0%
creating new funds so
 
02:23:04.630 --> 02:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
i think partly for historical reason and
 
02:23:05.910 --> 02:23:05.920 align:start position:0%
not to confuse the
 
02:23:09.030 --> 02:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
any any history that might be traced
 
02:23:12.150 --> 02:23:12.160 align:start position:0%
so based on that um and now that
 
02:23:13.349 --> 02:23:13.359 align:start position:0%
monica's in the meeting
 
02:23:15.510 --> 02:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
um i'll i'll be quiet and if there's any
 
02:23:17.270 --> 02:23:17.280 align:start position:0%
questions you have specific to abandoned
 
02:23:19.910 --> 02:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
property or anything else the treasurer
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
does with interest in surplus or any
 
02:23:22.800 --> 02:23:23.270 align:start position:0%
does with interest in surplus or any
other

02:23:23.270 --> 02:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:23:25.429 --> 02:23:25.439 align:start position:0%
functions i'm sure she'd be happy to
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
discuss that with you
 
02:23:29.590 --> 02:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
does she have a screen that she wants to
 
02:23:32.150 --> 02:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
share with us
 
02:23:33.590 --> 02:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
monica do you have anything you want to
 
02:23:35.910 --> 02:23:35.920 align:start position:0%
share or you're just going to respond to
 
02:23:37.670 --> 02:23:37.680 align:start position:0%

02:24:04.150 --> 02:24:04.160 align:start position:0%
estimates that we provided
 
02:24:06.790 --> 02:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
um what i can briefly say i think um two
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ago when i when i was
 
02:24:11.830 --> 02:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
um and this meeting um meeting
 
02:24:15.110 --> 02:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
um with with all of you um you know i
 
02:24:16.150 --> 02:24:16.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the
 
02:24:18.309 --> 02:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
estimates that we provide are really
 
02:24:19.670 --> 02:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
based on
 
02:24:23.590 --> 02:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
a 10-year average that we calculate um
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
so that's so those are the numbers that
 
02:24:26.790 --> 02:24:26.800 align:start position:0%
you know this this
 
02:24:29.590 --> 02:24:29.600 align:start position:0%
methodology that we use uh 10-year
 
02:24:31.030 --> 02:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
average produces
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
um and so um when we calculate this
 
02:24:36.389 --> 02:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
estimate it really is
 
02:24:39.110 --> 02:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
um i mentioned i mentioned in the past
 
02:24:39.120 --> 02:24:39.670 align:start position:0%
um i mentioned i mentioned in the past
so

02:24:39.670 --> 02:24:39.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:24:42.469 --> 02:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
after three years when we we were unable
 
02:24:43.670 --> 02:24:43.680 align:start position:0%
to return
 
02:24:47.110 --> 02:24:47.120 align:start position:0%
um funds to to the rightful owners
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
um then we have this property that we're
 
02:24:51.510 --> 02:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
able to estee to the counties
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
and the general fund and so we use
 
02:24:57.910 --> 02:24:57.920 align:start position:0%
um the the components of the calculation
 
02:24:58.389 --> 02:24:58.399 align:start position:0%
that i
 
02:25:01.429 --> 02:25:01.439 align:start position:0%
share with you two weeks ago um
 
02:25:03.429 --> 02:25:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know we use those components are
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
more consistent year
 
02:25:07.510 --> 02:25:07.520 align:start position:0%
year things that we know um the ca the
 
02:25:07.520 --> 02:25:08.309 align:start position:0%
year things that we know um the ca the
the

02:25:08.309 --> 02:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:25:10.790 --> 02:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
property that is reported to us an
 
02:25:11.990 --> 02:25:12.000 align:start position:0%
average of
 
02:25:15.270 --> 02:25:15.280 align:start position:0%
um what we pay each you know
 
02:25:17.349 --> 02:25:17.359 align:start position:0%
during the last 10 years an average of
 
02:25:18.710 --> 02:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
what we pay
 
02:25:20.550 --> 02:25:20.560 align:start position:0%
and so the only component that is
 
02:25:22.550 --> 02:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
difficult to estimate is
 
02:25:25.910 --> 02:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
is the value of um the pres
 
02:25:27.349 --> 02:25:27.359 align:start position:0%
the amount of proceeds that we're going
 
02:25:29.990 --> 02:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
to receive when we sell securities
 
02:25:31.590 --> 02:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
so that's really the only one that
 
02:25:33.349 --> 02:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
really will perhaps
 
02:25:36.790 --> 02:25:36.800 align:start position:0%
drive the number that we provide
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
either higher or lower depending on you
 
02:25:40.550 --> 02:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
know how
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
the fair market value of those
 
02:25:45.349 --> 02:25:45.359 align:start position:0%
securities is going to be at the time
 
02:25:47.750 --> 02:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we um that we sell those securities
 
02:25:50.070 --> 02:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
so that really is a foundation how we
 
02:25:52.070 --> 02:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
come up with those numbers
 
02:25:55.750 --> 02:25:55.760 align:start position:0%
the the so that's what we have
 
02:25:57.750 --> 02:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then once we start selling
 
02:26:00.150 --> 02:26:00.160 align:start position:0%
securities which will start
 
02:26:02.070 --> 02:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
um i will say in about a month that's
 
02:26:04.630 --> 02:26:04.640 align:start position:0%
when we start that process
 
02:26:06.870 --> 02:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
we don't typically recalculate the
 
02:26:08.389 --> 02:26:08.399 align:start position:0%
estimate because we really
 
02:26:11.270 --> 02:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
still don't have any changes so it's
 
02:26:13.590 --> 02:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
really until june when we
 
02:26:16.230 --> 02:26:16.240 align:start position:0%
we when we might have a better idea if
 
02:26:18.309 --> 02:26:18.319 align:start position:0%
the number that we estimated
 
02:26:21.510 --> 02:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
is going to change um so
 
02:26:23.670 --> 02:26:23.680 align:start position:0%
so so that's that's really what i can
 
02:26:24.790 --> 02:26:24.800 align:start position:0%
share with you
 
02:26:26.710 --> 02:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
i'll be happy to answer any questions
 
02:26:29.750 --> 02:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
that that you may have
 
02:26:33.429 --> 02:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
um represent romney
 
02:26:36.630 --> 02:26:36.640 align:start position:0%
oh again i i forgot to lower my hand
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
from before
 
02:26:41.910 --> 02:26:41.920 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry um let me ask you a question
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
moniker where we have
 
02:26:48.950 --> 02:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
a pandemic going on and
 
02:26:51.990 --> 02:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
we have the death rate
 
02:26:54.469 --> 02:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire we're a lot better off
 
02:26:55.990 --> 02:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
than other states
 
02:26:57.990 --> 02:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
but i would assume there'd be more
 
02:26:59.590 --> 02:26:59.600 align:start position:0%
abandoned property
 
02:27:03.750 --> 02:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
down the road because of the pandemic
 
02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:11.349 --> 02:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
yeah that is a great question i think
 
02:27:14.870 --> 02:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
you know when we when we when we met
 
02:27:18.710 --> 02:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
with with the committee
 
02:27:22.389 --> 02:27:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh two weeks ago we we kind of have an
 
02:27:23.190 --> 02:27:23.200 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
02:27:25.830 --> 02:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
some of the trends that might change the
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
amount of property that we will get
 
02:27:31.670 --> 02:27:31.680 align:start position:0%
uh or how the industry might change
 
02:27:34.950 --> 02:27:34.960 align:start position:0%
um you know during the next few years
 
02:27:37.270 --> 02:27:37.280 align:start position:0%
but the pandemic is not one of them so i
 
02:27:38.790 --> 02:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
think it will be
 
02:27:41.830 --> 02:27:41.840 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of a similar effort
 
02:27:47.590 --> 02:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:49.670 --> 02:27:49.680 align:start position:0%
holders report to us the type of
 
02:27:52.230 --> 02:27:52.240 align:start position:0%
property perhaps that will drive
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
the property reported but some of the
 
02:27:57.349 --> 02:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
changes that we also make in
 
02:28:00.389 --> 02:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
the way we um you know we now um you
 
02:28:01.670 --> 02:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
know claimants can
 
02:28:04.790 --> 02:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
can claim their funds so
 
02:28:06.389 --> 02:28:06.399 align:start position:0%
there's some changes that could occur
 
02:28:08.230 --> 02:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
the other way so we may get more funds
 
02:28:09.270 --> 02:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
reported to us
 
02:28:12.070 --> 02:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
but then we may have more individuals
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
claiming property since they have more
 
02:28:16.389 --> 02:28:16.399 align:start position:0%
access to computers in their home
 
02:28:18.550 --> 02:28:18.560 align:start position:0%
and and so they're able to search for
 
02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:19.750 align:start position:0%
and and so they're able to search for
property

02:28:19.750 --> 02:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:28:22.389 --> 02:28:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh more than than others so it's a great
 
02:28:23.910 --> 02:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
question so i think to
 
02:28:27.110 --> 02:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
answer you your question is that has not
 
02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:27.510 align:start position:0%
answer you your question is that has not
been

02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
been
 
02:28:30.230 --> 02:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh included in this estimate um this
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
estimate is really
 
02:28:34.469 --> 02:28:34.479 align:start position:0%
strictly based on the information that
 
02:28:34.479 --> 02:28:35.030 align:start position:0%
strictly based on the information that
we've

02:28:35.030 --> 02:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
we've
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
that we have during that has occurred
 
02:28:41.750 --> 02:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
over the last 10 years uh based on the
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
property that has been reported to us
 
02:28:47.750 --> 02:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
three years ago um and and so that's
 
02:28:51.110 --> 02:28:51.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're presenting today
 
02:28:53.910 --> 02:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
it is really a better estimate i think
 
02:28:53.920 --> 02:28:54.630 align:start position:0%
it is really a better estimate i think
um

02:28:54.630 --> 02:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:56.309 --> 02:28:56.319 align:start position:0%
just because we're consistent with the
 
02:28:58.630 --> 02:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
methodology and i think most of the
 
02:28:58.640 --> 02:28:59.510 align:start position:0%
methodology and i think most of the
times

02:28:59.510 --> 02:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
times
 
02:29:03.429 --> 02:29:03.439 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't change that much it did
 
02:29:05.270 --> 02:29:05.280 align:start position:0%
change last year again because of the
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
unknown variable
 
02:29:09.030 --> 02:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
of securities how this amer the fair
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
market value of those securities is
 
02:29:11.910 --> 02:29:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to change
 
02:29:15.590 --> 02:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
that really is what could drive um
 
02:29:18.309 --> 02:29:18.319 align:start position:0%
a significant change if the market were
 
02:29:19.349 --> 02:29:19.359 align:start position:0%
to change
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
right now it doesn't appear that it's
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
happening um you know we could have some
 
02:29:24.309 --> 02:29:24.319 align:start position:0%
adjustments some
 
02:29:27.270 --> 02:29:27.280 align:start position:0%
some um corrections in the capital
 
02:29:29.110 --> 02:29:29.120 align:start position:0%
market in the coming months but
 
02:29:32.230 --> 02:29:32.240 align:start position:0%
it is it's it wouldn't be um it's not
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be a a
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
right now of course we don't know um we
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
can't time the market and all of that
 
02:29:39.510 --> 02:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
but uh
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
it's not anticipated to be a very big
 
02:29:42.870 --> 02:29:42.880 align:start position:0%
adjustment like we
 
02:29:45.270 --> 02:29:45.280 align:start position:0%
the one we had last year as a result of
 
02:29:47.270 --> 02:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:29:50.630 --> 02:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr
 
02:29:50.640 --> 02:29:51.910 align:start position:0%
okay representative thank you mr
chairman

02:29:51.910 --> 02:29:51.920 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:29:53.910 --> 02:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
monica i think i started on this
 
02:29:55.750 --> 02:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
question last time but
 
02:29:58.790 --> 02:29:58.800 align:start position:0%
the issue of when securities are sold
 
02:30:03.349 --> 02:30:03.359 align:start position:0%
or maybe we discussed it before on
 
02:30:05.750 --> 02:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are at least some brokerages that
 
02:30:06.790 --> 02:30:06.800 align:start position:0%
in order to
 
02:30:10.389 --> 02:30:10.399 align:start position:0%
avoid timing the market and losing
 
02:30:13.590 --> 02:30:13.600 align:start position:0%
on sell or buy
 
02:30:16.150 --> 02:30:16.160 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of time and i
 
02:30:16.160 --> 02:30:16.630 align:start position:0%
over a longer period of time and i
wonder

02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
wonder
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
if the selling process is
 
02:30:21.830 --> 02:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
complicated enough that you couldn't
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
institute something like that
 
02:30:26.870 --> 02:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's right now if we get the wrong day
 
02:30:28.950 --> 02:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
all these people lose and if we get a
 
02:30:33.110 --> 02:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
beautiful day they win
 
02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
right no in and that is a great question
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
i actually when i had an opportunity to
 
02:30:40.309 --> 02:30:40.319 align:start position:0%
to speak to mr mcnasty about this
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
um you know we just explore your
 
02:30:44.309 --> 02:30:44.319 align:start position:0%
question your exact question and
 
02:30:47.510 --> 02:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
and so um he reminded me of um
 
02:30:50.389 --> 02:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
really how this process uh works it's
 
02:30:52.469 --> 02:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
not a one-day transaction it doesn't
 
02:30:52.479 --> 02:30:53.190 align:start position:0%
not a one-day transaction it doesn't
happen

02:30:53.190 --> 02:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know in one day it really the
 
02:30:56.309 --> 02:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
process and this
 
02:30:59.590 --> 02:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
is the custodian that does it for us
 
02:31:02.630 --> 02:31:02.640 align:start position:0%
they start um selling
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
um i think like i think they start
 
02:31:07.030 --> 02:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
around march time and
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
it takes a couple of months it takes a
 
02:31:11.030 --> 02:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
few months to um
 
02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
to really do that so they start selling
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
the start
 
02:31:17.349 --> 02:31:17.359 align:start position:0%
their stun um you know that process and
 
02:31:19.429 --> 02:31:19.439 align:start position:0%
so for us when we receive the proceeds
 
02:31:21.510 --> 02:31:21.520 align:start position:0%
we receive the proceeds
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
um i think sometime in may when we start
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
receiving some payments
 
02:31:27.830 --> 02:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
from that from those um you know from
 
02:31:29.270 --> 02:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
those sales
 
02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
and um so it is not it doesn't happen in
 
02:31:34.150 --> 02:31:34.160 align:start position:0%
one day it does happen over time
 
02:31:37.750 --> 02:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
it was last year it really was during
 
02:31:40.720 --> 02:31:41.190 align:start position:0%
it was last year it really was during
those

02:31:41.190 --> 02:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
those
 
02:31:43.990 --> 02:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
bad months because as you know the
 
02:31:45.990 --> 02:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
markets recovered
 
02:31:48.070 --> 02:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
in may we were back you know they were
 
02:31:49.910 --> 02:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
back to normal in may
 
02:31:53.030 --> 02:31:53.040 align:start position:0%
um june the market was up again so it
 
02:31:53.910 --> 02:31:53.920 align:start position:0%
really was
 
02:31:57.190 --> 02:31:57.200 align:start position:0%
just a very bad timing uh
 
02:32:00.070 --> 02:32:00.080 align:start position:0%
last year so again unless we have the
 
02:32:00.080 --> 02:32:00.790 align:start position:0%
last year so again unless we have the
same

02:32:00.790 --> 02:32:00.800 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:32:03.910 --> 02:32:03.920 align:start position:0%
the same bad time in this year
 
02:32:06.630 --> 02:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
which i don't anticipate um i hope i
 
02:32:07.990 --> 02:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
don't have to come back to you and say
 
02:32:09.110 --> 02:32:09.120 align:start position:0%
i'm so sorry about this
 
02:32:12.870 --> 02:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
for my back my bad estimates um
 
02:32:14.790 --> 02:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
but we really don't anticipate it so it
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
really is a process that takes
 
02:32:19.030 --> 02:32:19.040 align:start position:0%
longer and we couldn't we couldn't sell
 
02:32:20.790 --> 02:32:20.800 align:start position:0%
every month like it really we
 
02:32:23.429 --> 02:32:23.439 align:start position:0%
really need to wait until this property
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
meets that period of
 
02:32:27.429 --> 02:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
um you know meets the requirement okay
 
02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
we haven't returned this funds
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
um and so securities was for one year so
 
02:32:34.469 --> 02:32:34.479 align:start position:0%
we need to hold those securities for
 
02:32:34.479 --> 02:32:35.510 align:start position:0%
we need to hold those securities for
that

02:32:35.510 --> 02:32:35.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:32:37.750 --> 02:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
whole period the whole one-year period
 
02:32:40.150 --> 02:32:40.160 align:start position:0%
and all for us to be able to sell it so
 
02:32:43.590 --> 02:32:43.600 align:start position:0%
um the way we the way it is established
 
02:32:47.190 --> 02:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
today uh we we couldn't start selling
 
02:32:48.630 --> 02:32:48.640 align:start position:0%
you know months of the month we will
 
02:32:50.150 --> 02:32:50.160 align:start position:0%
have to probably change
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
our process significantly to to do
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:02.870 --> 02:33:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:06.070 --> 02:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
represent major yes just for the
 
02:33:06.080 --> 02:33:06.710 align:start position:0%
represent major yes just for the
committee's

02:33:06.710 --> 02:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
committee's
 
02:33:09.510 --> 02:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
um just for information for the
 
02:33:10.630 --> 02:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
committee monica that
 
02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
the transfer occurs in june related to
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
abandoned property revenue correct
 
02:33:18.230 --> 02:33:18.240 align:start position:0%
that is correct so that that it's it's
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
an end of the year
 
02:33:22.309 --> 02:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
um activity that occurs so just so the
 
02:33:23.590 --> 02:33:23.600 align:start position:0%
committee knows there's no
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
monthly or quarterly estimates go along
 
02:33:27.030 --> 02:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
with this it's it's
 
02:33:28.870 --> 02:33:28.880 align:start position:0%
um the treasurer is trying to estimate
 
02:33:30.469 --> 02:33:30.479 align:start position:0%
for for year end
 
02:33:32.150 --> 02:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
what they think they might transfer and
 
02:33:34.550 --> 02:33:34.560 align:start position:0%
i think what monica's um
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
alluded to is that you know there could
 
02:33:38.070 --> 02:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
be factors between now and june that
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
um may impact the estimate to some
 
02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:42.710 align:start position:0%
um may impact the estimate to some
extent

02:33:42.710 --> 02:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:44.710 --> 02:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
exactly and and so that's the reason why
 
02:33:47.110 --> 02:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
our our estimates really don't change
 
02:33:49.750 --> 02:33:49.760 align:start position:0%
we have our best estimate but there's
 
02:33:52.070 --> 02:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
really not a lot we can change
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
from now until the actual calculation
 
02:33:55.349 --> 02:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
happens and
 
02:33:58.070 --> 02:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
um it's just because we do have to wait
 
02:33:58.080 --> 02:33:58.389 align:start position:0%
um it's just because we do have to wait
for

02:33:58.389 --> 02:33:58.399 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:34:01.030 --> 02:34:01.040 align:start position:0%
for for the you know to meet the the
 
02:34:02.790 --> 02:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
requirements of the property
 
02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:04.640 align:start position:0%
and that's what we we try to calculate
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
it as soon as we can
 
02:34:08.230 --> 02:34:08.240 align:start position:0%
so it does happen um some you know
 
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
mid-june so we're able to uh
 
02:34:13.110 --> 02:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know um so we're able to submit all
 
02:34:14.830 --> 02:34:14.840 align:start position:0%
of the funding
 
02:34:17.910 --> 02:34:17.920 align:start position:0%
um the this treatment revenue to the
 
02:34:19.030 --> 02:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
02:34:21.190 --> 02:34:21.200 align:start position:0%
before the end of the year before june
 
02:34:22.309 --> 02:34:22.319 align:start position:0%
30. so
 
02:34:24.710 --> 02:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
um i know administrative services
 
02:34:25.910 --> 02:34:25.920 align:start position:0%
they're asking us about
 
02:34:28.230 --> 02:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
you you do you you know the beginning of
 
02:34:30.870 --> 02:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
june is do you still expect
 
02:34:32.870 --> 02:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
the amount coming on time and we always
 
02:34:34.150 --> 02:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
say yes but
 
02:34:35.510 --> 02:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
what we know this you know that
 
02:34:37.750 --> 02:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
anticipation of our revenue
 
02:34:44.230 --> 02:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
um expected before the end of the year
 
02:34:46.870 --> 02:34:46.880 align:start position:0%

time for everybody
 
02:36:06.710 --> 02:36:06.720 align:start position:0%
oh saturday afternoon wow
 
02:36:09.910 --> 02:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:14.630 --> 02:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:17.830 --> 02:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
representative army i mean uh bromley
 
02:36:21.429 --> 02:36:21.439 align:start position:0%
so uh you said that uh tomorrow is still
 
02:36:22.710 --> 02:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
up in the air a little bit
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
uh but how are you gonna you're gonna
 
02:36:28.150 --> 02:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
communicate if it's gonna be a total
 
02:36:30.389 --> 02:36:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh virtual meeting and not in person is
 
02:36:31.590 --> 02:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
that it or
 
02:36:33.429 --> 02:36:33.439 align:start position:0%
are you are you going making the call
 
02:36:34.950 --> 02:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
right now that
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
um as at this point
 
02:36:43.429 --> 02:36:43.439 align:start position:0%
it's a hybrid meeting
 
02:36:48.830 --> 02:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise is that a firm is that
 
02:36:54.469 --> 02:36:54.479 align:start position:0%
is that going to potentially change uh
 
02:36:58.469 --> 02:36:58.479 align:start position:0%
and if it does if it changes

to have it changed but
 
02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
