00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
all right it being 0900 hours at this
 
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
time I would like to perhaps ask
 
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
representative Jones if you would lead
 
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 align:start position:0%
us in the pledge as is our custom here
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
okay at this time we will get started
 
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
and our first measure up today is uh HB
 
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
264 FN with a financial note relative to
 
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
delegates to an article 5 convention
 
00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 align:start position:0%
this is Article 5 day here in state
 
00:02:28.509 --> 00:02:28.519 align:start position:0%
federal uh this measure this bill makes
 
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
it a Class B felony for a delegate to an
 
00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention uh to support or
 
00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
approve proposing an amendment not
 
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
authorized by by our
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
legislature Prime sponsor is here
 
00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 align:start position:0%

welcome thank you Colonel I appreciate
 
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:51.040 align:start position:0%
it uh for the record my name is Jordan
 
00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
erery uh representing Hillsboro New
 
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in Hillsboro 13 I am the
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor of HB 264 FN over the
 
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
past several years a decade or so I've
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
been constantly receiving email and
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
letters and I've been spoken to at the
 
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 align:start position:0%
post office while food shopping uh
 
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
dining establishments in town the human
 
00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 align:start position:0%
cry is such that my wife could make this
 
00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 align:start position:0%
presentation from merely overhearing
 
00:03:21.149 --> 00:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
these discussions and she doesn't
 
00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319 align:start position:0%
particularly like
 
00:03:25.869 --> 00:03:25.879 align:start position:0%
Politics the issue is the lack of
 
00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
responsiveness of a distant national
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
government throughout history this has
 
00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 align:start position:0%
been the issue of states and Nations the
 
00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
founding fathers of the United States
 
00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
however had extraordinary insight into
 
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
human nature and saw the danger of a
 
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
massive bureaucracy of in a government
 
00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 align:start position:0%
and they left us with a constitutional
 
00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:51.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
power as we all know our government uh
 
00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
nationally rests on a three-legged stool
 
00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 align:start position:0%
of people States and a federal
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
government the people directly elect
 
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 align:start position:0%
representatives electors to elect the
 
00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 align:start position:0%
president and the members of the house
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
and the Senate these two branches then
 
00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 align:start position:0%
support the supposedly nonpartisan
 
00:04:18.069 --> 00:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
devotees to the written law the Supreme
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
Court judges yes this is a deliberately
 
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 align:start position:0%
inefficient method of government wherein
 
00:04:27.749 --> 00:04:27.759 align:start position:0%
the people can have a direct say we have
 
00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 align:start position:0%
strayed from that again the found
 
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 align:start position:0%
founding fathers were rather sure a
 
00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic government would exist they
 
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
had just fought a war like largely
 
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 align:start position:0%
because of a distant government not
 
00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
responding remember ta taxes the
 
00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.790 align:start position:0%
responding remember ta taxes the
Intolerable

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
Acts after long debate and within our
 
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
constitution is the basis for the people
 
00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:52.759 align:start position:0%
to restrain that government yes we can
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
elect people to office but sometimes is
 
00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
necessary to shake the tree as it were
 
00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
and legally threaten the accumul ated
 
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 align:start position:0%
Power by invoking the right of the
 
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 align:start position:0%
people to tell their federal government
 
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:07.800 align:start position:0%
what to do as as opposed to torches and
 
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 align:start position:0%
Pitch pitchforks of the nearby Shay
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
Rebellion the Constitution allows for
 
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 align:start position:0%
the states remember that the several
 
00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:19.039 align:start position:0%
sovereign states have co-equal standing
 
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
with the people and the federal
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
government to take action to apply
 
00:05:25.029 --> 00:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
change to the federal
 
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:28.440 align:start position:0%
government that's a paraphrasing of
 
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
Jefferson via a constitutional amendment
 
00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 align:start position:0%
orig originating not from the
 
00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy or deep state but from the
 
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
incubators of democracy the states
 
00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
themselves that is Article 5 in a
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
nutshell an essential
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
part far too infrequently applied
 
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
Congress has an appetite for power it is
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
up to the states to curb that power
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
which infringes upon the rights and
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
privileges of we the people in the bills
 
00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
before the committee today there is an
 
00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:02.039 align:start position:0%
attempt to rebuke the will of the people
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
already passed by this body by this
 
00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 align:start position:0%
legislature I bill to assure the State
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
Legislative control of delegates when an
 
00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention is called such as
 
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
this uh hb26 whatever it is for and
 
00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 align:start position:0%
another call for a convention to the
 
00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:25.039 align:start position:0%
States this letter this speech which I
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
provided to the clerk can apply to all
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
three in service testimony on those
 
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 align:start position:0%
bills with regard to an attempt to
 
00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:35.199 align:start position:0%
reject the will of the people the
 
00:06:38.469 --> 00:06:38.479 align:start position:0%
1970s in in the 1970s and more recently
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
Scot scotus decision decisions have
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
repeatedly stated that when petitioning
 
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:46.840 align:start position:0%
the federal government once the petition
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
is made the goal has been scored and you
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
can't unmake a
 
00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:54.919 align:start position:0%
goal there is no recision that can
 
00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
therefore be valid it is in my
 
00:06:59.830 --> 00:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
considered an informed op opinion that
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
such an effort is speculative at best
 
00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
and certainly move to the entire purpose
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
of Article 5
 
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
itself with regard to delegates by
 
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 align:start position:0%
whatever name known the states have the
 
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:15.800 align:start position:0%
absolute right to appoint whomsoever the
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
state wishes since a cons uh a
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
Convention of states is a legislative
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
action no executive involvement is valid
 
00:07:28.350 --> 00:07:28.360 align:start position:0%
States already um routinely Place
 
00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:31.120 align:start position:0%
restrictions on Commissioners to
 
00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:33.560 align:start position:0%
interstate compacts such as the Conn
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
Connecticut River compact the bill
 
00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:39.199 align:start position:0%
before you does nothing more than that
 
00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:41.039 align:start position:0%
among the handouts before you was the
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
list of states that have already sub uh
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
submitted petitions uh before the go U
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:59.550 --> 00:07:59.560 align:start position:0%
chart even uh Senator Schumer as well as
 
00:08:02.469 --> 00:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
as never as nearly every responsible
 
00:08:04.869 --> 00:08:04.879 align:start position:0%
constitutional expert has repeatedly
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
declared that a petition for a
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
convention regardless of a topic is
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
substantially similar to merely a call
 
00:08:16.869 --> 00:08:16.879 align:start position:0%
for a convention to undertake a specific
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
action it is up to the states to to
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
limit what topic their delegates by
 
00:08:25.110 --> 00:08:25.120 align:start position:0%
whatever name called can vote upon the
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire led the way with this
 
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
principle when the constitutional
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
convention was called by the
 
00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:32.800 align:start position:0%
Confederation of states in the 1780s our
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
delegates left Philadelphia to return to
 
00:08:37.269 --> 00:08:37.279 align:start position:0%
conquered for instructions others
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
followed St suit I was reminded today
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
that some didn't even bother to show up
 
00:08:44.509 --> 00:08:44.519 align:start position:0%
until after New Hampshire came back and
 
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
said yeah let's do
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
this some seem to forget that our
 
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:49.630 align:start position:0%
this some seem to forget that our
Federal

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
Federal
 
00:08:52.350 --> 00:08:52.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution has elements that challenge
 
00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:56.360 align:start position:0%
Federal Primacy some people may Advance
 
00:08:58.790 --> 00:08:58.800 align:start position:0%
a theory saying the states cannot call a
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
convention or that the convention will
 
00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:03.760 align:start position:0%
run away or that the world will
 
00:09:05.949 --> 00:09:05.959 align:start position:0%
implode some seem to say the
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution must be protected by not
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
following the Constitutional Provisions
 
00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
available to the
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
states some seem to think that the
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
provision in the Bill of Rights which
 
00:09:21.630 --> 00:09:21.640 align:start position:0%
was adopted largely uh by the insistence
 
00:09:24.389 --> 00:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire especially the 9th and
 
00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:27.550 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire especially the 9th and
the

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
10th do not apply
 
00:09:32.829 --> 00:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
a small vocal Progressive socialist
 
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:34.720 align:start position:0%
sounding minority suggests that the
 
00:09:36.389 --> 00:09:36.399 align:start position:0%
convention will lead to the total
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
Destruction of a of a constitutional
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
republic as an aside it is interesting
 
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:44.000 align:start position:0%
to note that the founder of one of those
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
special uh interest groups was a strong
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
advocate for using Article 5 to control
 
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:53.360 align:start position:0%
the Deep state of federal bureaucracy
 
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:54.720 align:start position:0%
way back in the
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
70s I would remind you that a
 
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention is is akin to
 
00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
a Committee hearing such as this it is
 
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:05.880 align:start position:0%
important but not the end all rather we
 
00:10:08.230 --> 00:10:08.240 align:start position:0%
the people must vote on the results of
 
00:10:10.829 --> 00:10:10.839 align:start position:0%
the convention actions the bar for
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
changing the Constitution is high as the
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
discussion of the ongoing erra uh
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
Congress created Amendment illustrates
 
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
it is not the convention one must fear
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
rather one must examine the motives of
 
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
why the rights of the people not to be
 
00:10:30.829 --> 00:10:30.839 align:start position:0%
able to vote on topics are being
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
attacked I have provided or I am
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
providing a copy of uh Utah senator Ken
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%
Ivory's book where is the line I hope
 
00:10:42.470 --> 00:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
the chairman makes it available to any
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
who request it but I have requested more
 
00:10:49.069 --> 00:10:49.079 align:start position:0%
copies uh from uh my friend Ken Ivory
 
00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
for the the rest of the committee we
 
00:10:53.710 --> 00:10:53.720 align:start position:0%
need to stop the federal government from
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
its overreach and interference in the
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
commission duties of the state
 
00:10:59.550 --> 00:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
governments we can return the power to
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
the People by as tip O'Neal suggested
 
00:11:06.269 --> 00:11:06.279 align:start position:0%
keeping the power local via the states
 
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:08.200 align:start position:0%
challenging the
 
00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:10.760 align:start position:0%
overbearing uh Washington
 
00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.310 align:start position:0%
overbearing uh Washington
DC

00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
DC
 
00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:14.519 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy in this committee you have a
 
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:16.720 align:start position:0%
serious obligation to help return power
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
to the states and their Sury people I
 
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.120 align:start position:0%
have included in my presentation
 
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:23.440 align:start position:0%
handouts from the agency created out of
 
00:11:26.389 --> 00:11:26.399 align:start position:0%
the 2018 Convention of States held in
 
00:11:29.550 --> 00:11:29.560 align:start position:0%
Phoenix as a repository of information
 
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
on Article 5 and the 10th Amendment I
 
00:11:35.110 --> 00:11:35.120 align:start position:0%
was a delegate uh to that event
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
appointed by the speaker uh
 
00:11:39.629 --> 00:11:39.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bill Omen and several
 
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
others were also present the president
 
00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
of the Senate appointed Senator Dan inis
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
rules for the operation of the
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
convention were created and sent to the
 
00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.430 align:start position:0%
convention were created and sent to the
various

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
various
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
States the interesting impediment to
 
00:11:56.870 --> 00:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
their not already having been a call
 
00:11:59.470 --> 00:11:59.480 align:start position:0%
issued by Congress is that the the
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
employee of Congress the
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
archist to whom petitions are addressed
 
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:09.200 align:start position:0%
has never reported the petitions to
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
Congress you may recall that the
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
longtime AR archist recently retired and
 
00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
took his pension rather
 
00:12:19.470 --> 00:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
unexpectedly the Library of Congress to
 
00:12:21.910 --> 00:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
which petitions are sent for efficient
 
00:12:24.629 --> 00:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
government filing I say that remembering
 
00:12:27.150 --> 00:12:27.160 align:start position:0%
the last scene of Raiders of the Lost
 
00:12:31.389 --> 00:12:31.399 align:start position:0%
Arc um has some 38 to 40 petitions on
 
00:12:35.110 --> 00:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
file depending upon whether you count
 
00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:39.240 align:start position:0%
uh several that are different based upon
 
00:12:41.150 --> 00:12:41.160 align:start position:0%
the information and belief there are a
 
00:12:44.150 --> 00:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
few members of Congress of both bodies
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
and both parties who are active
 
00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:49.240 align:start position:0%
preparing interested Supreme Court
 
00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
litigation that may happen within this
 
00:12:54.590 --> 00:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
legislative term to force a publication
 
00:12:58.790 --> 00:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
and Counting of the sunry petitions thus
 
00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
this type of legislation is
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
necessary as you know a deliberative and
 
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:08.600 align:start position:0%
measured legislative approach is second
 
00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:11.480 align:start position:0%
only to the lethargic and waddling pace
 
00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:12.829 align:start position:0%
only to the lethargic and waddling pace
of

00:13:12.829 --> 00:13:12.839 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
litigation finally remember this
 
00:13:18.269 --> 00:13:18.279 align:start position:0%
Congress accumulates power to itself
 
00:13:22.150 --> 00:13:22.160 align:start position:0%
Congress as an entity abhor power
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
sharing and the Constitution envisioned
 
00:13:28.629 --> 00:13:28.639 align:start position:0%
that Congress fears as is illustrated by
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
the UNC counted petitions the states
 
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
exercising their constitutional power to
 
00:13:37.350 --> 00:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
threaten the status quo New Hampshire
 
00:13:39.550 --> 00:13:39.560 align:start position:0%
led the way in establishing the
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution New Hampshire can maintain
 
00:13:44.829 --> 00:13:44.839 align:start position:0%
its role as a leader in this nation with
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
the passage of HB
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
264 which is a step in that direction
 
00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:52.560 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to answer any questions I
 
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:55.720 align:start position:0%
will point out that the multi-page final
 
00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
draft is a uh work product of the
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
Phoenix correspondence uh commission
 
00:14:03.189 --> 00:14:03.199 align:start position:0%
called the
 
00:14:07.189 --> 00:14:07.199 align:start position:0%
PCC uh which is in your packet and there
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
is a handout talking about the problem
 
00:14:13.389 --> 00:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
the solution and who PCC is and how you
 
00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
can get involved uh just as
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
a uh bit of a prim ofasa information on
 
00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:23.839 align:start position:0%
it supporting that I've also included
 
00:14:26.629 --> 00:14:26.639 align:start position:0%
the current national debt which is why I
 
00:14:28.389 --> 00:14:28.399 align:start position:0%
petitioned for and got the balance
 
00:14:29.949 --> 00:14:29.959 align:start position:0%
budget amendment established in the
 
00:14:32.829 --> 00:14:32.839 align:start position:0%
first place which is rising at the rate
 
00:14:35.790 --> 00:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:39.110 --> 00:14:39.120 align:start position:0%
7,547 per
 
00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:43.160 align:start position:0%
second that's an interesting figure uh
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
you may have seen uh U representative
 
00:14:50.949 --> 00:14:50.959 align:start position:0%
Massie has a little clock on his lapel
 
00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
pin that's how fast it's going because
 
00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:55.120 align:start position:0%
you can hardly count the last four
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
digits they were rotating over so fastly
 
00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
and and then there's sometimes been a
 
00:15:04.110 --> 00:15:04.120 align:start position:0%
question regarding uh faithless delegate
 
00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:04.910 align:start position:0%
question regarding uh faithless delegate
uh

00:15:04.910 --> 00:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:06.720 align:start position:0%
legislation well there were that
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
question rised was risen in 2020 and
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
again this year but uh the Supreme Court
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
decided that decision when they talked
 
00:15:19.189 --> 00:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
about faithful elector laws an elector
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
is a delegate of the state elected by
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
people and they said yep you can control
 
00:15:29.509 --> 00:15:29.519 align:start position:0%
how people vote on federal issues i' be
 
00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions sir thank
 
00:15:34.069 --> 00:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative uh thank
 
00:15:35.629 --> 00:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
you for the wonderful handouts
 
00:15:37.870 --> 00:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
especially the Article Five convention
 
00:15:41.389 --> 00:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
legislative progress report uh very uh
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
useful very helpful so thank you for
 
00:15:46.069 --> 00:15:46.079 align:start position:0%
that uh a couple quick ones you just
 
00:15:48.870 --> 00:15:48.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned faithless electors versus
 
00:15:51.949 --> 00:15:51.959 align:start position:0%
versus Faith faithless delegates so the
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court ruling on faithless
 
00:15:58.389 --> 00:15:58.399 align:start position:0%
electors you you say that applies to
 
00:16:02.110 --> 00:16:02.120 align:start position:0%
faithless delegates as well to Article 5
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
I would say it does yes because the
 
00:16:07.870 --> 00:16:07.880 align:start position:0%
electors are elected to do a job for the
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
state that is to reflect the election of
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
the individuals states can place
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
restrictions on individuals saying that
 
00:16:16.430 --> 00:16:16.440 align:start position:0%
you signed up to do this you advertise
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
to do this uh you were elected to do
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
this you have to do this and at the same
 
00:16:25.910 --> 00:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
time a person who signs up to go to uh
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
um and or is appointed by the
 
00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399 align:start position:0%
legislature to be a delegate of the
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
legislature at a convention which I
 
00:16:34.470 --> 00:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
signed up to do this I said I'm going to
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
vote on this topic and this topic only
 
00:16:37.949 --> 00:16:37.959 align:start position:0%
and that's the only topic I'm going to
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
vote on same thing as I signed up and
 
00:16:43.790 --> 00:16:43.800 align:start position:0%
I'm only going to vote on for a or
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
b okay got got it a similar measure to
 
00:16:50.509 --> 00:16:50.519 align:start position:0%
this representative has come through
 
00:16:51.870 --> 00:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
this committee and through the house
 
00:16:53.829 --> 00:16:53.839 align:start position:0%
before I'm trying to remember I believe
 
00:16:55.629 --> 00:16:55.639 align:start position:0%
it went to the governor's desk and maybe
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
was vetoed I'm trying to recollect
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
you're probably ahead of me in this if
 
00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
if that's the case if if a similar Meo
 
00:17:06.470 --> 00:17:06.480 align:start position:0%
if a similar measure was vetoed uh do
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
you remember what what the rationale for
 
00:17:12.350 --> 00:17:12.360 align:start position:0%
the veto was uh the to the best of my
 
00:17:14.669 --> 00:17:14.679 align:start position:0%
recollection um several governors of
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
veto this and I remember Dan it had put
 
00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
some legislation in a decade or so ago
 
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
along the same lines and it was vetoed
 
00:17:24.909 --> 00:17:24.919 align:start position:0%
by a Democrat Governor and it was also
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
vetoed by Republican Governors um say
 
00:17:30.510 --> 00:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
the argument at the same time was well
 
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:32.760 align:start position:0%
it's nice it be a good idea but we
 
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
really don't need it we don't need this
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
to have on the books I would suggest to
 
00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
this committee and to the entire general
 
00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
court that uh time is running out uh
 
00:17:45.750 --> 00:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
once it was discovered that the uh
 
00:17:48.070 --> 00:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
petitions had not been counted and there
 
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:51.080 align:start position:0%
are efforts underway to count those
 
00:17:53.190 --> 00:17:53.200 align:start position:0%
petitions thank you representative other
 
00:17:56.549 --> 00:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.310 --> 00:17:59.320 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chairman uh thank you
 
00:18:02.630 --> 00:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
for being here to take my question which
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
is in the specifics the the the broad
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
Strokes sound pretty reasonable and good
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a little curious about the specifics
 
00:18:10.029 --> 00:18:10.039 align:start position:0%
particularly when it comes to
 
00:18:13.870 --> 00:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
definitions under unauthorized Amendment
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
and legislative instructions where it
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
says that
 
00:18:20.909 --> 00:18:20.919 align:start position:0%
um uh an unauthorized Amendment means a
 
00:18:22.270 --> 00:18:22.280 align:start position:0%
proposed amendment or change to the
 
00:18:23.669 --> 00:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
United States Constitution that is
 
00:18:25.430 --> 00:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
outside the scope of the article 5
 
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
application and legislative instructions
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
so then we looked at legislative
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
instructions it says uh means
 
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
instruction given by the general court
 
00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
to a delegate before or during an
 
00:18:37.350 --> 00:18:37.360 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention so what is what is
 
00:18:39.750 --> 00:18:39.760 align:start position:0%
the scope of of that exactly what is and
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
does not qualify is it a is it a full
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
vote of the house is it a vote of those
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
present is it a a vote out of a
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
committee is it a speaker's
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
instruction it would probably be a bit
 
00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
of a combination of both um for let's
 
00:18:56.430 --> 00:18:56.440 align:start position:0%
take housing for example which is is
 
00:18:59.230 --> 00:18:59.240 align:start position:0%
discussed in in the uh the fiscal if the
 
00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
speaker said you cannot stay at a
 
00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.270 align:start position:0%
speaker said you cannot stay at a
five-star

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
five-star
 
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
hotel then that's an instruction and if
 
00:19:07.549 --> 00:19:07.559 align:start position:0%
you go to a five-star hotel anything
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
above 60110 $200 a night it's on you uh
 
00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
would be my interpretation of that the
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
other instruction would be something
 
00:19:19.710 --> 00:19:19.720 align:start position:0%
from the uh joint resolution of the uh
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
of the body and remember we can call our
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
own uh body into session at any time for
 
00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:28.320 align:start position:0%
a special session uh to issue new
 
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:31.720 align:start position:0%
instruction C so if uh for example we
 
00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:34.280 align:start position:0%
were uh the convention was called and
 
00:19:35.549 --> 00:19:35.559 align:start position:0%
the convention was called for the
 
00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:38.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of discussing my favorite topic
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
a balance budget
 
00:19:43.149 --> 00:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
amendment and somebody brought up an
 
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:45.880 align:start position:0%
amendment to appeal the Second
 
00:19:48.990 --> 00:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh our guys couldn't vote on
 
00:19:51.909 --> 00:19:51.919 align:start position:0%
that second amendment unless they said
 
00:19:54.390 --> 00:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
yes vote on it and vote
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
no uh and while while we're on that one
 
00:20:01.870 --> 00:20:01.880 align:start position:0%
remember don't would take 13 states the
 
00:20:04.430 --> 00:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
people of the people or legislators of
 
00:20:08.190 --> 00:20:08.200 align:start position:0%
13 states to say no to any Amendment and
 
00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:09.029 align:start position:0%
13 states to say no to any Amendment and
it's

00:20:09.029 --> 00:20:09.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:20:09.039 --> 00:20:10.750 align:start position:0%
it's
dead

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
dead
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a big hurdle to pass
 
00:20:17.230 --> 00:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
representative Gagney has a
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
representative Ry for taking my question
 
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:23.440 align:start position:0%
I know the answer you know the answer to
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
this question then why are you
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
asking because other people people
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
around might not know so you'll indulge
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
me here uh I see the penalty for
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
violation is a Class B uh
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
felony uh do you could you tell the
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
people what a classb felony how many
 
00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
years that
 
00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
is 1 to 7even I believe three and a half
 
00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
to seven 3 and A2 to S three and A2 to S
 
00:20:59.270 --> 00:20:59.280 align:start position:0%
I suppose Class A is a 7 to 15 7 and2
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
followup sir followup thank you
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
um assuming that this bill passes this
 
00:21:11.909 --> 00:21:11.919 align:start position:0%
committee you are also aware that it'll
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
probably go to the C&amp;J committee to see
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
whether or not the uh penalty would be
 
00:21:22.909 --> 00:21:22.919 align:start position:0%
proper which could slow things down you
 
00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
aware of that right yes I am aware of
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
that and uh I'll tell this committee
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
which will have the obligate if this
 
00:21:32.789 --> 00:21:32.799 align:start position:0%
committee passes it which will be
 
00:21:34.470 --> 00:21:34.480 align:start position:0%
presenting it before
 
00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:36.190 align:start position:0%
presenting it before
C&amp;J

00:21:36.190 --> 00:21:36.200 align:start position:0%
C&amp;J
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
that a penalty sub substantial enough to
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
get somebody's
 
00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:44.110 align:start position:0%
get somebody's
attention

00:21:44.110 --> 00:21:44.120 align:start position:0%
attention
 
00:21:46.549 --> 00:21:46.559 align:start position:0%
works I'll point out that this measure
 
00:21:50.350 --> 00:21:50.360 align:start position:0%
also has a fiscal note this is HB 264 FN
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
typically measures with fiscal notes are
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
looked at by Finance uh possibility of
 
00:21:58.390 --> 00:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
uh a different committee looking at it
 
00:22:03.070 --> 00:22:03.080 align:start position:0%
as as well uh is uh is is interesting uh
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
and thank you gagy for the for the
 
00:22:08.909 --> 00:22:08.919 align:start position:0%
lesson on felony charges people watching
 
00:22:12.470 --> 00:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
at home uh always learn from watching
 
00:22:15.149 --> 00:22:15.159 align:start position:0%
our hearings at uh state state federal
 
00:22:18.110 --> 00:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the prime
 
00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:20.669 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the prime
represent

00:22:20.669 --> 00:22:20.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
budak uh thank you Mr chairman for the
 
00:22:24.350 --> 00:22:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh for this opportunity and thank you
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
for testifying today uh my question is
 
00:22:30.990 --> 00:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
why is this bill feel necessary when the
 
00:22:32.950 --> 00:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution already provides a method
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
for amendments through Congressional
 
00:22:38.830 --> 00:22:38.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
rectification thank you there are two
 
00:22:43.750 --> 00:22:43.760 align:start position:0%
methods in Article
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
5 for
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
approval this has nothing to do with a
 
00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.590 align:start position:0%
approval this has nothing to do with a
petition

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
petition
 
00:22:55.190 --> 00:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
for a um Constitutional Convention a
 
00:22:56.789 --> 00:22:56.799 align:start position:0%
call of the
 
00:23:00.789 --> 00:23:00.799 align:start position:0%
states this only regulates the delegates
 
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:04.120 align:start position:0%
to that convention if
 
00:23:07.350 --> 00:23:07.360 align:start position:0%
called what this does is establishes the
 
00:23:10.510 --> 00:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
authority of the state to prevent
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
delegates to a constitutional convention
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
which has nothing to do with Congress
 
00:23:19.230 --> 00:23:19.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
involved under the the second half of
 
00:23:22.279 --> 00:23:23.870 align:start position:0%
involved under the the second half of
Article

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:23.880 align:start position:0%
Article
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
5 this would regulate the conduct and
 
00:23:30.630 --> 00:23:30.640 align:start position:0%
the voting behavior of the delegates to
 
00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
that Constitutional Convention now
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
Congress can amend the Constitution any
 
00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:37.320 align:start position:0%
time it wants sometimes they've been
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
successful remember Congress passed the
 
00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:44.720 align:start position:0%
Volstead Act so we could not
 
00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:48.120 align:start position:0%
drink they did a good job on that one
 
00:23:50.110 --> 00:23:50.120 align:start position:0%
one way to get organized crime firmly
 
00:23:51.870 --> 00:23:51.880 align:start position:0%
embedded in
 
00:23:55.669 --> 00:23:55.679 align:start position:0%
society um the states have the equal
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
authority to propose
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
amendments to the
 
00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:04.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and this regulates our
 
00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:07.720 align:start position:0%
delegates not our Congress Critters but
 
00:24:10.310 --> 00:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
our state delegates to the
 
00:24:13.830 --> 00:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention so there's two
 
00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.310 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention so there's two
co-equal

00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
co-equal
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
activities One Federal and one
 
00:24:22.149 --> 00:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
state Article 5 does is silent regarding
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
the ability of the state to control but
 
00:24:28.909 --> 00:24:28.919 align:start position:0%
that is because the state is its own
 
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:33.440 align:start position:0%
entity that is co-equal in in theory
 
00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
with the federal government the federal
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
government is grown to the point where
 
00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799 align:start position:0%
the states
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
are being abused
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
again other questions seeing none uh
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.190 --> 00:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
on the legislative
 
00:25:03.630 --> 00:25:03.640 align:start position:0%
instructions thank
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
you uh are given by the general court to
 
00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
a delegate before or during Article 5
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
convention that doesn't mean he has an
 
00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:15.720 align:start position:0%
independent way of voting he has to vote
 
00:25:19.110 --> 00:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
the way he's told is that correct it
 
00:25:22.950 --> 00:25:22.960 align:start position:0%
could be or it could be also just to not
 
00:25:26.950 --> 00:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
consider remember we have instructions
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
um when we across the hall we if we're
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
present we have to vote but we can also
 
00:25:36.669 --> 00:25:36.679 align:start position:0%
have instructions not to attend and I'm
 
00:25:39.549 --> 00:25:39.559 align:start position:0%
sure somebody in here has at one time or
 
00:25:41.149 --> 00:25:41.159 align:start position:0%
another been told that it was probably
 
00:25:43.029 --> 00:25:43.039 align:start position:0%
time for them to have a smoke break even
 
00:25:46.430 --> 00:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
if they didn't smoke
 
00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
so uh that that's what a legislative
 
00:25:51.789 --> 00:25:51.799 align:start position:0%
instruction is they could be told to
 
00:25:55.789 --> 00:25:55.799 align:start position:0%
vote yay on this proposed amendment or
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
vote nay on this proposed amendment
 
00:26:01.110 --> 00:26:01.120 align:start position:0%
by the general court because the general
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
court retains the power and they're
 
00:26:06.669 --> 00:26:06.679 align:start position:0%
obligated I'm sorry
 
00:26:10.269 --> 00:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
follow yes they would be
 
00:26:13.510 --> 00:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
obligated thank you other questions
 
00:26:16.149 --> 00:26:16.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Mr Prime sponsor
 
00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:20.480 align:start position:0%
repr some viy okay Sam fieldman is back

uh we saw Sam a number of times last
 
00:26:25.750 --> 00:26:25.760 align:start position:0%
year Sam has asked or M Mr fieldman has
 
00:26:27.510 --> 00:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
asked for 2 minutes I think we can do
 
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%

back thank you very much uh my name is
 
00:26:58.350 --> 00:26:58.360 align:start position:0%
Samuel fieldman uh thank you uh chairman
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
mfet members of the committee um
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
testifying in support of this uh of this
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill um and last year I testified in
 
00:27:07.909 --> 00:27:07.919 align:start position:0%
support of uh two other bills to
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
regulate the Article 5 convention
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
delegates um I help I participated in uh
 
00:27:16.590 --> 00:27:16.600 align:start position:0%
drafting one of those bills um and I
 
00:27:19.389 --> 00:27:19.399 align:start position:0%
this it's an uh area of expertise for me
 
00:27:21.029 --> 00:27:21.039 align:start position:0%
it's uh I'm one of the top experts on
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
the Article 5 convention process in the
 
00:27:26.590 --> 00:27:26.600 align:start position:0%
country um and uh the advantage that
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
this bill has over the ones last year
 
00:27:30.070 --> 00:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
although I I certainly support the ones
 
00:27:31.389 --> 00:27:31.399 align:start position:0%
last year and actually like them better
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
than this one uh this one is
 
00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:35.440 align:start position:0%
considerably simpler uh the ones last
 
00:27:37.510 --> 00:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
year ended up dying in the Senate and as
 
00:27:39.870 --> 00:27:39.880 align:start position:0%
far as I understood it the reason why
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
they died in the Senate was largely
 
00:27:44.509 --> 00:27:44.519 align:start position:0%
because they were um too complicated for
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate to deal with in the time that
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
was available um they didn't see it as a
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
priority although I certainly view it as
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
such this one uh is much simpler it just
 
00:28:00.389 --> 00:28:00.399 align:start position:0%
uh puts on one penalty on onto the um uh
 
00:28:03.630 --> 00:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
onto delegates who uh who um violate
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
their Oaths and uh that exact thing has
 
00:28:08.509 --> 00:28:08.519 align:start position:0%
been upheld by the Supreme Court
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously as recently as 2020 um in
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
the case of uh electors the Electoral
 
00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
College um representative mfet uh asked
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
about the comparison between delegates
 
00:28:23.310 --> 00:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
and electors uh it's important to note
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
in that case there there's two
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
comparisons one um uh the uh regulations
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
over delegates to Article 5 conventions
 
00:28:35.590 --> 00:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
has a longer history than regulations
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
over um over uh electricity Electoral
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
College because the Article 5
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
ratification conventions that were used
 
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:47.880 align:start position:0%
in 1933 to ratify um the uh the 21st
 
00:28:50.509 --> 00:28:50.519 align:start position:0%
amendment um included regulations in
 
00:28:51.950 --> 00:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
some of those bills particularly in
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
Arizona that had a bill virtually
 
00:28:57.190 --> 00:28:57.200 align:start position:0%
identical to the one uh in New Mexico
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
that was the subject of that case in the
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court um and further uh uh Larry
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
leig who argued um in that in uh the
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
other side the losing side of that case
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
in Shalo V Washington um he thought that
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
the regulations would not apply to the
 
00:29:19.509 --> 00:29:19.519 align:start position:0%
electoral college but would apply to the
 
00:29:22.789 --> 00:29:22.799 align:start position:0%
delegates uh to an article 5 convention
 
00:29:25.750 --> 00:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
uh because the the arguments in favor of
 
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:27.480 align:start position:0%
those kinds of regulations applying to
 
00:29:29.789 --> 00:29:29.799 align:start position:0%
delegates convention uh are
 
00:29:32.350 --> 00:29:32.360 align:start position:0%
significantly stronger based on uh
 
00:29:34.509 --> 00:29:34.519 align:start position:0%
various factors in how the Constitution
 
00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:36.440 align:start position:0%
treats the two I I disagreed I thought
 
00:29:37.789 --> 00:29:37.799 align:start position:0%
they applied to both and the Supreme
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
Court ended up agreeing with me that
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
they do apply to the electors and
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
there's no reason to think that the same
 
00:29:47.389 --> 00:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hold true for uh delegates um
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
always good when the Supreme Court
 
00:29:51.789 --> 00:29:51.799 align:start position:0%
agrees with you are you yes I mean Larry
 
00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
Le was uh happy with the decision even
 
00:29:56.190 --> 00:29:56.200 align:start position:0%
though he lost it he's talked many times
 
00:29:59.149 --> 00:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
about that being a successful loss um
 
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
the the one last thing I want to point
 
00:30:03.630 --> 00:30:03.640 align:start position:0%
out there uh is a a potential for an
 
00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention coming up fairly
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
soon uh based on existing convention
 
00:30:13.149 --> 00:30:13.159 align:start position:0%
calls that um that passed as of 1979 uh
 
00:30:15.549 --> 00:30:15.559 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire um many of those
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
have since been rescinded but recision
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh is not relevant once you hit the uh
 
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:24.320 align:start position:0%
threshold of 34 and the argument there
 
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:25.720 align:start position:0%
is that since we've crossed that
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
threshold as of 1979 the recisions that
 
00:30:30.549 --> 00:30:30.559 align:start position:0%
happened after that point no longer
 
00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
matter even though recisions certainly
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
are valid if they happen before you hit
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
34 um based on that there could be a
 
00:30:39.549 --> 00:30:39.559 align:start position:0%
convention coming in the near future now
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
if you support that idea uh you should
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
want to pass this uh this regulation if
 
00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:48.840 align:start position:0%
you oppose that idea you should demand
 
00:30:51.350 --> 00:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
that you pass this regulation either way
 
00:30:54.350 --> 00:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
it make sure that the process is safer
 
00:30:56.830 --> 00:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
and does follow the in addition to the
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
many other uh safety checks on that
 
00:31:03.029 --> 00:31:03.039 align:start position:0%
process it adds one more to just ensure
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
um that the delegates follow what is
 
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
asked of them sure ex extra insurance so
 
00:31:10.070 --> 00:31:10.080 align:start position:0%
to speak uh would you take any questions
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
after are there any questions uh
 
00:31:15.430 --> 00:31:15.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd thank you Mr
 
00:31:16.950 --> 00:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:31:19.629 --> 00:31:19.639 align:start position:0%
question I apologize I'm I have a really
 
00:31:22.990 --> 00:31:23.000 align:start position:0%
bad head cold this week um so are you
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
not given your background are you not
 
00:31:27.470 --> 00:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
concerned that this would tie delegates
 
00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:31.320 align:start position:0%
to a more partisan politics um position
 
00:31:33.830 --> 00:31:33.840 align:start position:0%
rather than allowing them to engage in a
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
more independent and in good faith
 
00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:38.240 align:start position:0%
measure it would tie delegates to the
 
00:31:41.389 --> 00:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
demands of their particular State um and
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
that is the way that process is supposed
 
00:31:46.389 --> 00:31:46.399 align:start position:0%
to work if the states are not able to
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
come together on a particular um on a
 
00:31:53.509 --> 00:31:53.519 align:start position:0%
particular uh policy then that policy
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
should not and cannot be in the
 
00:31:56.629 --> 00:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
Constitution and that's the way that's
 
00:32:00.350 --> 00:32:00.360 align:start position:0%
supposed to work followup followup um
 
00:32:02.990 --> 00:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
thank you uh so are there any
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
protections that could be allowed for to
 
00:32:08.990 --> 00:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that a minority voice can also
 
00:32:11.149 --> 00:32:11.159 align:start position:0%
be represented especially given that the
 
00:32:14.789 --> 00:32:14.799 align:start position:0%
penalties of tying delegates are is so
 
00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
high sure well absolutely um the
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
delegates are first of all the
 
00:32:20.750 --> 00:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution guarantees this is a
 
00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:23.000 align:start position:0%
substantial majority view in the
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
literature that the constitution
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
guarantees um the delegacy to deliberate
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
uh they have to be able to have some
 
00:32:33.909 --> 00:32:33.919 align:start position:0%
decision-making process the state can
 
00:32:36.269 --> 00:32:36.279 align:start position:0%
tie their hands to it to a certain
 
00:32:39.590 --> 00:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
degree in terms of um like the the
 
00:32:42.629 --> 00:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
subject matter and procedures um but it
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
can't prevent deliberation to come
 
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:46.320 align:start position:0%
together it can't mandate a specific
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
language for example um there are also
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
going to be people from all 50 states
 
00:32:54.590 --> 00:32:54.600 align:start position:0%
this this is not just for the states
 
00:32:57.509 --> 00:32:57.519 align:start position:0%
that support a particular uh policy it's
 
00:32:59.789 --> 00:32:59.799 align:start position:0%
for all all 50 states and in particular
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
only 34 states have to come together uh
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
to call the convention to discuss that
 
00:33:08.389 --> 00:33:08.399 align:start position:0%
policy but you need 38 uh which is four
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the additional 16 a quarter of the
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
ones that did not call for the
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
convention still have to come together
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
as part of the ratification so their
 
00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
voice has to be heard or else it will
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
never go through ratification so even
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
the states if they may want to dominate
 
00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:25.200 align:start position:0%
it with a particular left-wing or
 
00:33:28.190 --> 00:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
right-wing policy uh that would not end
 
00:33:30.590 --> 00:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
up resulting in uh an amendment to the
 
00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution it would end up resulting
 
00:33:34.590 --> 00:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
in nothing which is why I don't fear a
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
convention even on subject matters where
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
I disagree because either they will find
 
00:33:42.029 --> 00:33:42.039 align:start position:0%
language for the Constitution that
 
00:33:43.789 --> 00:33:43.799 align:start position:0%
passes that enormous threshold and
 
00:33:46.669 --> 00:33:46.679 align:start position:0%
solves the many hurdles or it won't end
 
00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
up in the Constitution and it will
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
become one of several proposals that
 
00:33:53.389 --> 00:33:53.399 align:start position:0%
that simply uh are not part of the law
 
00:33:56.710 --> 00:33:56.720 align:start position:0%
understood thank you for that other
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none uh thank you Mr
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
Felman thank you uh Bob Hansen from
 
00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
Salem is Bob here yes he is he's asked
 
00:34:09.030 --> 00:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
for up to two minutes uh welcome Mr
 
00:34:12.990 --> 00:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:15.230 --> 00:34:15.240 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you for the opportunity
 
00:34:17.430 --> 00:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
I've lived in Salem for 50 years I voted
 
00:34:20.069 --> 00:34:20.079 align:start position:0%
in every local and national election for
 
00:34:24.190 --> 00:34:24.200 align:start position:0%
over 60 years I just want to support the
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
uh this motion uh I support the
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
um Article 5 convention I just want to
 
00:34:33.669 --> 00:34:33.679 align:start position:0%
make sure there's a distinction made
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
that regardless of any feelings you have
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
on the Article 5 convention you need to
 
00:34:40.710 --> 00:34:40.720 align:start position:0%
really look at this independently they
 
00:34:43.909 --> 00:34:43.919 align:start position:0%
need 34 states to have the convention 19
 
00:34:46.149 --> 00:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
states have already approved this there
 
00:34:47.869 --> 00:34:47.879 align:start position:0%
are another three to four states that
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
are in process in the next few months so
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
we should reach the 34 states in within
 
00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
a number of years when that happens New
 
00:34:58.710 --> 00:34:58.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is going to send delegates
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether or not they
 
00:35:04.030 --> 00:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
approve of the bill so it's important
 
00:35:05.870 --> 00:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
that we have the rules in place to be
 
00:35:07.510 --> 00:35:07.520 align:start position:0%
able to control the delegates and be
 
00:35:09.630 --> 00:35:09.640 align:start position:0%
able to make sure that they're complying
 
00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:11.680 align:start position:0%
with the state
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
requirements thank you for the
 
00:35:15.710 --> 00:35:15.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity thank you for that
 
00:35:17.790 --> 00:35:17.800 align:start position:0%
affirmation of what we heard earlier
 
00:35:19.870 --> 00:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Hansen uh will you take any
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
questions if there are any yeah sure uh
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
are there any questions for Mr
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
Hansen seeing none uh thank you I just
 
00:35:29.430 --> 00:35:29.440 align:start position:0%
have one other thought that occurred to
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
me the speakers before me a couple times
 
00:35:35.550 --> 00:35:35.560 align:start position:0%
they use the termic
 
00:35:38.349 --> 00:35:38.359 align:start position:0%
uh a conventional convention or
 
00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:40.040 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention I just want to
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
make the distinction the Article 5
 
00:35:45.990 --> 00:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
convention is only to propose amendments
 
00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
to the existing Constitution a
 
00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:50.359 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention is usually
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
interpreted as trying to come up with
 
00:35:55.309 --> 00:35:55.319 align:start position:0%
the new Constitution and Article 5 is
 
00:35:57.190 --> 00:35:57.200 align:start position:0%
not trying to do that they don't have
 
00:35:58.710 --> 00:35:58.720 align:start position:0%
the authority to do that I just want to
 
00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:01.000 align:start position:0%
make out the distinction for you thank
 
00:36:02.470 --> 00:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
you thank you again important
 
00:36:04.390 --> 00:36:04.400 align:start position:0%
distinction in
 
00:36:08.990 --> 00:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
indeed uh Eric Benitas is Eric here Mr
 
00:36:11.829 --> 00:36:11.839 align:start position:0%
Benitas it looks like he is in the house
 
00:36:13.430 --> 00:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
he's asked for three minutes he's in
 
00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:16.440 align:start position:0%
support of the bill HB
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
264 welcome Mr Benitas thank you thank
 
00:36:22.349 --> 00:36:22.359 align:start position:0%
you very much chairman thank you uh uh
 
00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:24.240 align:start position:0%
committee members uh I will not take
 
00:36:25.630 --> 00:36:25.640 align:start position:0%
that much time because I did not realize
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
Sam would be here so I thought I was
 
00:36:30.910 --> 00:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
going to be uh representing uh Wolfpack
 
00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:33.680 align:start position:0%
um in this but uh he was here and he is
 
00:36:35.109 --> 00:36:35.119 align:start position:0%
much more knowledgeable than I am on
 
00:36:37.510 --> 00:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
Article 5 so I'm I'm grateful for that
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Eric Benavides I live in
 
00:36:42.030 --> 00:36:42.040 align:start position:0%
the town of Guilford I am here in
 
00:36:45.750 --> 00:36:45.760 align:start position:0%
support uh of this uh bill um while
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
there is lots of evidence uh
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
peer-reviewed evidence that article 5 uh
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
conventions State conventions are safe
 
00:36:56.150 --> 00:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
and uh that the process will work
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
exactly how we uh Envision it to and it
 
00:37:01.030 --> 00:37:01.040 align:start position:0%
will not go off the rails let me just
 
00:37:03.190 --> 00:37:03.200 align:start position:0%
state that right away I do believe that
 
00:37:05.430 --> 00:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
bills like this um offer greater
 
00:37:09.270 --> 00:37:09.280 align:start position:0%
protection um for us um and also give
 
00:37:11.230 --> 00:37:11.240 align:start position:0%
people confidence that this process will
 
00:37:15.550 --> 00:37:15.560 align:start position:0%
work um so uh I'm in favor of this um
 
00:37:19.950 --> 00:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
and uh as the gentleman stated um we are
 
00:37:21.589 --> 00:37:21.599 align:start position:0%
very close to possibly having a
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
convention so having um these uh bills
 
00:37:27.589 --> 00:37:27.599 align:start position:0%
in place these regulations would be good
 
00:37:30.550 --> 00:37:30.560 align:start position:0%
uh I believe 25 of the 50 states have
 
00:37:33.309 --> 00:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
already passed bills like this faithful
 
00:37:35.750 --> 00:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
delegate bills um so they are already in
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
place in those States and I believe New
 
00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire should be the 26th um that is
 
00:37:42.069 --> 00:37:42.079 align:start position:0%
all I have to say I can take any
 
00:37:44.309 --> 00:37:44.319 align:start position:0%
questions you you might have thank you
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
Mr benus are there any questions M uh Mr
 
00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:48.670 align:start position:0%
Mr benus are there any questions M uh Mr
representative

00:37:48.670 --> 00:37:48.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:37:51.990 --> 00:37:52.000 align:start position:0%
bataki so uh hypothetically speaking
 
00:37:54.190 --> 00:37:54.200 align:start position:0%
let's say 34 states have passed or
 
00:37:58.190 --> 00:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
adopted this uh Bill what specific
 
00:38:00.870 --> 00:38:00.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional changes do we do you do
 
00:38:05.030 --> 00:38:05.040 align:start position:0%
we or hope do you hope to achieve
 
00:38:07.630 --> 00:38:07.640 align:start position:0%
through an article 5 convention that
 
00:38:09.430 --> 00:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
cannot be accomplished
 
00:38:11.870 --> 00:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
through sorry
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh let me find the right questions
 
00:38:23.430 --> 00:38:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:38:30.230 --> 00:38:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:38:32.670 --> 00:38:32.680 align:start position:0%
response um well let me just State what
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
wolfpack's mission is who I'm here
 
00:38:36.309 --> 00:38:36.319 align:start position:0%
representing sure as a volunteer but
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
still I do represent that
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
organization um wolfpack's goal is to
 
00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
get large money out of our political
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
system the corrupting influence of it
 
00:38:48.510 --> 00:38:48.520 align:start position:0%
and we support any means necessary to
 
00:38:50.589 --> 00:38:50.599 align:start position:0%
make that happen anything available to
 
00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:52.319 align:start position:0%
us in the Constitution whether that is
 
00:38:53.990 --> 00:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
through Congress whether it is through
 
00:38:55.790 --> 00:38:55.800 align:start position:0%
bills and legislation within a state
 
00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
itself or whether it is the Article 5
 
00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
convention we do not discriminate any
 
00:39:02.670 --> 00:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
way we can get there we want to get
 
00:39:06.710 --> 00:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
there um and so uh so that is our goal
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
um we we do believe that Congress would
 
00:39:12.230 --> 00:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
have a chance to pass this but being
 
00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:15.400 align:start position:0%
America everything is divided we do not
 
00:39:18.230 --> 00:39:18.240 align:start position:0%
set Power in one place that is why we
 
00:39:20.710 --> 00:39:20.720 align:start position:0%
have two branches uh three branches of
 
00:39:23.030 --> 00:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
government to separate the powers that's
 
00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:25.240 align:start position:0%
why there is a senate and a house that's
 
00:39:27.109 --> 00:39:27.119 align:start position:0%
why there's a governor we separate the
 
00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:29.560 align:start position:0%
power is to make sure that one body does
 
00:39:31.829 --> 00:39:31.839 align:start position:0%
not have all the power in Article 5 and
 
00:39:34.069 --> 00:39:34.079 align:start position:0%
the ability to propose amendments is the
 
00:39:36.470 --> 00:39:36.480 align:start position:0%
exact same thing we cannot have that
 
00:39:39.710 --> 00:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
power live in one body alone we need it
 
00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:41.760 align:start position:0%
to be separated the states have the
 
00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:44.440 align:start position:0%
right if Congress will not act to
 
00:39:46.950 --> 00:39:46.960 align:start position:0%
propose for a convention so that we can
 
00:39:49.309 --> 00:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
propose amendments as well and to put
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
all of that power into one body or to be
 
00:39:55.510 --> 00:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
afraid to use our state right to invoke
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
that power limits us and causes us to
 
00:40:01.510 --> 00:40:01.520 align:start position:0%
have a corrupt body that is the only
 
00:40:03.230 --> 00:40:03.240 align:start position:0%
place that can propose amendments and I
 
00:40:04.950 --> 00:40:04.960 align:start position:0%
do not believe that that America was
 
00:40:07.710 --> 00:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
designed in that way thank you again and
 
00:40:09.710 --> 00:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for confirming the the wolf
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
pack Mission other questions
 
00:40:13.990 --> 00:40:14.000 align:start position:0%
representative mandle bomb thank you Mr
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
question so I just wanted to to clarify
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
something for the record so I've heard
 
00:40:24.390 --> 00:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
that 34 states are needed to call a
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
convention um and 19 States so far have
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
already passed faithful delegate views
 
00:40:34.829 --> 00:40:34.839 align:start position:0%
no 25 25 states have passed faithful
 
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
delegate bills okay and um one of the
 
00:40:40.630 --> 00:40:40.640 align:start position:0%
previous speakers mentioned 19 do you
 
00:40:44.190 --> 00:40:44.200 align:start position:0%
know what or if um it could be that I
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
don't know records are are different was
 
00:40:48.069 --> 00:40:48.079 align:start position:0%
he talking about faithful delegate bills
 
00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:50.000 align:start position:0%
or was he talking about possible states
 
00:40:54.950 --> 00:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
that passed uh uh convention calls
 
00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:57.680 align:start position:0%
um con that was convention call so
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
convention call is separate from a
 
00:41:01.190 --> 00:41:01.200 align:start position:0%
faithful delegates Bill the faithful
 
00:41:02.950 --> 00:41:02.960 align:start position:0%
delegates bill that we are looking at
 
00:41:05.430 --> 00:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
today is not a convention call it is to
 
00:41:09.349 --> 00:41:09.359 align:start position:0%
put restrictions on a delegate um a a
 
00:41:11.109 --> 00:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
call to a convention is a totally
 
00:41:13.309 --> 00:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
different and we have already passed a
 
00:41:16.670 --> 00:41:16.680 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment um call to the
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution and I I I I'm afraid that I
 
00:41:21.750 --> 00:41:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't follow the balance budget
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
amendment as much as I follow the
 
00:41:25.870 --> 00:41:25.880 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance Amendment so I'm not
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
sure what the total is right now you'd
 
00:41:29.790 --> 00:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
have to refer to one of my balanced
 
00:41:32.390 --> 00:41:32.400 align:start position:0%
budget amendment colleagues thank you Mr
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
B when the clerk asks for something for
 
00:41:36.870 --> 00:41:36.880 align:start position:0%
the record that's that's a good thing we
 
00:41:38.430 --> 00:41:38.440 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we have the numbers
 
00:41:40.270 --> 00:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
correct other questions representative
 
00:41:42.550 --> 00:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
bataki sorry for the previous confusion
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
I found my question now okay so what
 
00:41:48.069 --> 00:41:48.079 align:start position:0%
specific constitutional changes do we
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
hope or do you hope to achieve through
 
00:41:52.589 --> 00:41:52.599 align:start position:0%
an article five convention that cannot
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
be accomplished through the traditional
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
amendment process the sorry the last
 
00:42:00.309 --> 00:42:00.319 align:start position:0%
part the traditional amendment process
 
00:42:02.550 --> 00:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh there is nothing that can be done if
 
00:42:04.670 --> 00:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
if Congress wants to do the traditional
 
00:42:06.670 --> 00:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
if amendment process I would be more
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
than happy to allow them to do that the
 
00:42:10.589 --> 00:42:10.599 align:start position:0%
fact is that they are not doing that and
 
00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:14.240 align:start position:0%
the we our job is to push for an article
 
00:42:16.349 --> 00:42:16.359 align:start position:0%
5 Amendment because Congress will not
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
act and that is our
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
duty other
 
00:42:23.349 --> 00:42:23.359 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you so much
 
00:42:25.309 --> 00:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
for your testimony yeah I appreciate all
 
00:42:26.390 --> 00:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
the way down here from Guilford I have
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
two more cards
 
00:42:33.150 --> 00:42:33.160 align:start position:0%
um Carol pusit Carol it looks like she's
 
00:42:36.230 --> 00:42:36.240 align:start position:0%
asked for 56 seconds but maybe I'm not
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
reading 56 seconds that's a a request we
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
can definitely honor uh coming here from
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
Rochester thank you I wanted to make
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
sure I typed it up so I could be super
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
fast because I know you have a lot of
 
00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:50.680 align:start position:0%
people to listen to thank you so much
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
for having me um New Hampshire should
 
00:42:55.109 --> 00:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
definitely pass this resolution since
 
00:42:57.150 --> 00:42:57.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature turns over
 
00:42:59.069 --> 00:42:59.079 align:start position:0%
every two years New Hampshire needs to
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
have its delegate legislation in place
 
00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire legislators that I
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
have spoken to are not sure how basic
 
00:43:08.349 --> 00:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
agency law Works they're not lawyers and
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
they're not required to be lawyers
 
00:43:12.309 --> 00:43:12.319 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation stops the
 
00:43:13.990 --> 00:43:14.000 align:start position:0%
confusion on how to proceed when an
 
00:43:16.630 --> 00:43:16.640 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention is called I would
 
00:43:19.470 --> 00:43:19.480 align:start position:0%
love for this legislation to include any
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
Interstate Convention as well thus
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire even further it
 
00:43:25.910 --> 00:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
would also be great to include delegate
 
00:43:28.190 --> 00:43:28.200 align:start position:0%
selection protocols and who is going to
 
00:43:30.069 --> 00:43:30.079 align:start position:0%
charge them for being guilty of a clasby
 
00:43:31.790 --> 00:43:31.800 align:start position:0%
felony and who's going to hold the
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
delegates accountable I thank the
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
sponsors for their foresight in
 
00:43:37.069 --> 00:43:37.079 align:start position:0%
protecting New Hampshire and I thank
 
00:43:39.870 --> 00:43:39.880 align:start position:0%

00:43:44.790 --> 00:43:44.800 align:start position:0%

00:44:00.230 --> 00:44:00.240 align:start position:0%
minutes speaking for himself and he's in
 
00:44:08.670 --> 00:44:08.680 align:start position:0%

trelli it's a wide share thank you
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
committee um I I want to start with uh

my timer here so I have it I just want
 
00:44:21.390 --> 00:44:21.400 align:start position:0%
to talk about briefly I'm I'm going to
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
follow up on several of the other
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
comments from from other people
 
00:44:25.990 --> 00:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
providing testimony I'm not going to
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
read the the book to you uh Belton
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
suspenders it there safety measures so
 
00:44:35.710 --> 00:44:35.720 align:start position:0%
people refer to Belton suspenders as
 
00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:38.440 align:start position:0%
solving one problem if it breaks through
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
there's a backup to it and so what we
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
have in the belt and suspenders are
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
things that Charles Pinkney brought into
 
00:44:49.670 --> 00:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
the Constitutional Convention in
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia in March of
 
00:44:55.870 --> 00:44:55.880 align:start position:0%
1787 there was no option for Congress to
 
00:44:59.109 --> 00:44:59.119 align:start position:0%
propose amendments with that article
 
00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:02.400 align:start position:0%
16 that was presented to the to the uh
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
to the chamber based on the Virginia
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
Plan it was solely the state legislators
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
that were going to call a convention to
 
00:45:13.430 --> 00:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
propose amendments among the several
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
States at that time
 
00:45:19.109 --> 00:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
13 so that was put in
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
place and discussed until it shifted in
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
June when Congress that was actually
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton wanted to have well
 
00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
we need Congress to do
 
00:45:33.230 --> 00:45:33.240 align:start position:0%
this and it shifted back again so it
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
included Congress and the letter the
 
00:45:38.990 --> 00:45:39.000 align:start position:0%
words or and the written testimony that
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
I sent last night a five-page document I
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of you saw it I
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
actually specify the words it says the
 
00:45:48.430 --> 00:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
Congress whenever two-thirds of both
 
00:45:50.670 --> 00:45:50.680 align:start position:0%
houses shall deem it necessary shall
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
propose amendments to this
 
00:45:56.950 --> 00:45:56.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution and it says this constit
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
ution twice in Article 5 so that's belt
 
00:46:03.150 --> 00:46:03.160 align:start position:0%
number one
 
00:46:06.670 --> 00:46:06.680 align:start position:0%
suspenders there's three topics so this
 
00:46:10.390 --> 00:46:10.400 align:start position:0%
this bill refers to Article 5 three
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
topics impose fiscal restraints on the
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
federal government limit the power and
 
00:46:15.630 --> 00:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the federal government
 
00:46:17.190 --> 00:46:17.200 align:start position:0%
limit the terms of office for its
 
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:20.200 align:start position:0%
officials and members of Congress so any
 
00:46:22.470 --> 00:46:22.480 align:start position:0%
delegates that are appointed elected by
 
00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
the states are signing up for those
 
00:46:26.950 --> 00:46:26.960 align:start position:0%
topics and committing that those are
 
00:46:28.750 --> 00:46:28.760 align:start position:0%
going to be what those topics are that
 
00:46:31.510 --> 00:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to debate at a convention
 
00:46:34.270 --> 00:46:34.280 align:start position:0%
for proposing amendments and then what
 
00:46:38.790 --> 00:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
gets forgotten one state one vote so if
 
00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
50 states go if New York wants to send
 
00:46:44.670 --> 00:46:44.680 align:start position:0%
one person to object to it they get one
 
00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:47.480 align:start position:0%
negative vote if they send 50 people
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
whatever the majority of New York is
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
they get one vote every state gets one
 
00:46:56.109 --> 00:46:56.119 align:start position:0%
vote and then when those amendments
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
Whatever Gets 26 goes back to the States
 
00:46:58.760 --> 00:46:59.750 align:start position:0%
Whatever Gets 26 goes back to the States
for

00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:47:02.910 --> 00:47:02.920 align:start position:0%
ratification and it takes 3/4 of those
 
00:47:05.069 --> 00:47:05.079 align:start position:0%
states to ratify so we have belts
 
00:47:07.390 --> 00:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
suspenders we have velcro double-sided
 
00:47:10.390 --> 00:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
tape we've got all kinds of things and
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
all it takes is 13
 
00:47:17.069 --> 00:47:17.079 align:start position:0%
chambers of 99 bodies because Nebraska
 
00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
no thank
 
00:47:29.710 --> 00:47:29.720 align:start position:0%
you any questions from Mr
 
00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:33.640 align:start position:0%
trelli seeing none at this time before I

plastow uh so I'm here to offer hcr3 a
 
00:50:44.349 --> 00:50:44.359 align:start position:0%
concurrent resolution applying for a
 
00:50:46.349 --> 00:50:46.359 align:start position:0%
Convention of States under Article Five
 
00:50:49.109 --> 00:50:49.119 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution to the United States
 
00:50:51.069 --> 00:50:51.079 align:start position:0%
and uh I know that there are many new
 
00:50:53.430 --> 00:50:53.440 align:start position:0%
members here and you heard some of
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
Article 5 uh I guess uh procedures
 
00:51:01.829 --> 00:51:01.839 align:start position:0%
already but I just want to reprise that
 
00:51:04.190 --> 00:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
quickly for the committee what is an
 
00:51:08.030 --> 00:51:08.040 align:start position:0%
article five it's a procedure to amend
 
00:51:10.270 --> 00:51:10.280 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and there are two
 
00:51:13.230 --> 00:51:13.240 align:start position:0%
methods congress with the 2third vote
 
00:51:16.910 --> 00:51:16.920 align:start position:0%
can propose amendments or 2third of the
 
00:51:19.630 --> 00:51:19.640 align:start position:0%
states can make an application for a
 
00:51:22.190 --> 00:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
convention to propose amendments and
 
00:51:24.589 --> 00:51:24.599 align:start position:0%
those would be limited purpose
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
conventions with specific uniform
 
00:51:33.190 --> 00:51:33.200 align:start position:0%
applications to amend not redraft the
 
00:51:36.030 --> 00:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution those that convention comes
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
up with the wording of the Amendments
 
00:51:41.510 --> 00:51:41.520 align:start position:0%
that are then presented either from
 
00:51:44.630 --> 00:51:44.640 align:start position:0%
Congress or from the convention to three
 
00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
quarters of the states to ratify well
 
00:51:49.030 --> 00:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
all the states to ratify in three
 
00:51:50.990 --> 00:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
quarters in order to for it to actually
 
00:51:55.230 --> 00:51:55.240 align:start position:0%
be ratified um to become part of the
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution now while why was this
 
00:52:02.589 --> 00:52:02.599 align:start position:0%
two-part process or two mechanism way
 
00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
adopted so the initial proposal being
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
discussed at the Constitutional
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
Convention was that only Congress was
 
00:52:11.670 --> 00:52:11.680 align:start position:0%
going to propose the Amendments and that
 
00:52:15.549 --> 00:52:15.559 align:start position:0%
was that was supported by Madison our
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
the father of our Constitution and
 
00:52:20.430 --> 00:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
remember he didn't support the first 10
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
amendments and what became the 27th as
 
00:52:27.349 --> 00:52:27.359 align:start position:0%
well but led their way to advancement
 
00:52:29.190 --> 00:52:29.200 align:start position:0%
when he became a congressman in the
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
first Congress but during that
 
00:52:34.510 --> 00:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Convention George Mason
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
stood up and said Congressional role
 
00:52:41.190 --> 00:52:41.200 align:start position:0%
alone would be excessive exceptional and
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
dangerous the plan now formed will firm
 
00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
will will certainly be defective as a
 
00:52:51.230 --> 00:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
confederation has found on trial to be
 
00:52:54.470 --> 00:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
amendments therefore will be necessary
 
00:52:56.270 --> 00:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
and it will be better to provide for
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
them in an easy regular and
 
00:53:01.470 --> 00:53:01.480 align:start position:0%
constitutional way than trust to chance
 
00:53:04.150 --> 00:53:04.160 align:start position:0%
and violence it would be improper to
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
require the consent of the national
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
legislature because they may abuse their
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
power and refused to consent to that
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
very account so basically Mason stood up
 
00:53:19.069 --> 00:53:19.079 align:start position:0%
and said
 
00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
Congress if if there is a need may
 
00:53:24.069 --> 00:53:24.079 align:start position:0%
decide they don't want to deal with this
 
00:53:24.079 --> 00:53:26.829 align:start position:0%
decide they don't want to deal with this
issue

00:53:26.829 --> 00:53:26.839 align:start position:0%
issue
 
00:53:31.030 --> 00:53:31.040 align:start position:0%
Jerry our our urw uh neighbor to the to
 
00:53:33.549 --> 00:53:33.559 align:start position:0%
the South uh proposed the State
 
00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:36.200 align:start position:0%
Convention process it was unanimously
 
00:53:38.349 --> 00:53:38.359 align:start position:0%
adopted on the last day of the
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
convention Madison then switched his
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
support to it and spoke to it in
 
00:53:44.160 --> 00:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
support to it and spoke to it in
Federalist

00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
43 there was also been great concern
 
00:53:54.390 --> 00:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
that the actual Constitutional
 
00:53:59.190 --> 00:53:59.200 align:start position:0%
Convention that dealt with this was not
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
legitimate in 1786 the Annapolis
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
convention on trade and commerce
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
resulted in Virginia's call for devising
 
00:54:10.270 --> 00:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
And discussing all alterations and
 
00:54:12.710 --> 00:54:12.720 align:start position:0%
further Provisions as may be necessary
 
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
to render the Federal Constitution
 
00:54:17.829 --> 00:54:17.839 align:start position:0%
adequate to the exigencies of the
 
00:54:21.589 --> 00:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
Union you had six states then call for a
 
00:54:24.109 --> 00:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
constitutional con
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
convention then the actual
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
conf uh Confederation Congress issued
 
00:54:30.119 --> 00:54:30.910 align:start position:0%
conf uh Confederation Congress issued
their

00:54:30.910 --> 00:54:30.920 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:54:33.510 --> 00:54:33.520 align:start position:0%
decree and then six other states
 
00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
followed the only one that didn't was
 
00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:38.270 align:start position:0%
followed the only one that didn't was
Rhode

00:54:38.270 --> 00:54:38.280 align:start position:0%
Rhode
 
00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
Island Madison speaking about this in a
 
00:54:44.190 --> 00:54:44.200 align:start position:0%
letter to Jefferson said the
 
00:54:45.750 --> 00:54:45.760 align:start position:0%
recommendations from the meeting in
 
00:54:49.309 --> 00:54:49.319 align:start position:0%
Annapolis of the Plenty potenti meaning
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
we're going to do the whole thing
 
00:54:55.309 --> 00:54:55.319 align:start position:0%
convention in Philadelphia in May
 
00:54:58.870 --> 00:54:58.880 align:start position:0%
next has been well received indeed the
 
00:55:01.510 --> 00:55:01.520 align:start position:0%
evidence of dangerous defects of the
 
00:55:05.150 --> 00:55:05.160 align:start position:0%
Confederation has been has has at length
 
00:55:08.950 --> 00:55:08.960 align:start position:0%
prited the most obstinate adversaries to
 
00:55:12.789 --> 00:55:12.799 align:start position:0%
reform Madison in his diary then wrote
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
all agreed and owed that the federal
 
00:55:17.870 --> 00:55:17.880 align:start position:0%
government in its existing shape has
 
00:55:21.190 --> 00:55:21.200 align:start position:0%
ineff is was inefficient and could be
 
00:55:23.750 --> 00:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
lost members of the Southern and middle
 
00:55:25.950 --> 00:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
States seem generally anxious about some
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
Republic repan organization of a system
 
00:55:30.750 --> 00:55:30.760 align:start position:0%
which could preserve the union and give
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
due energy to the government of
 
00:55:37.950 --> 00:55:37.960 align:start position:0%
it in the handout I provided you uh I
 
00:55:41.510 --> 00:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
gave you the actual commissions of
 
00:55:46.270 --> 00:55:46.280 align:start position:0%
those 12 States saying we want to have a
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
convention to deal with this with the
 
00:55:53.470 --> 00:55:53.480 align:start position:0%
issues on a plenty potenti
 
00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
way and I gave you the list of 40 two
 
00:56:00.230 --> 00:56:00.240 align:start position:0%
documented conventions that have been
 
00:56:05.270 --> 00:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
held since the the uh Europeans came to
 
00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:06.910 align:start position:0%
held since the the uh Europeans came to
this

00:56:06.910 --> 00:56:06.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:11.190 --> 00:56:11.200 align:start position:0%
continent in no case were these runaways
 
00:56:13.390 --> 00:56:13.400 align:start position:0%
I give you this information because
 
00:56:15.670 --> 00:56:15.680 align:start position:0%
there are those that are going to follow
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
and say if you have an article 5
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
convention it will be a Runway it can be
 
00:56:24.390 --> 00:56:24.400 align:start position:0%
a runaway it'll be a disaster I wanted
 
00:56:28.510 --> 00:56:28.520 align:start position:0%
to put a state through the heart of that
 
00:56:31.750 --> 00:56:31.760 align:start position:0%
fantasy that is not true you have the
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
commissions of the states that said we
 
00:56:36.829 --> 00:56:36.839 align:start position:0%
want to do this we want to have a
 
00:56:39.150 --> 00:56:39.160 align:start position:0%
revision of the Articles and create a
 
00:56:42.390 --> 00:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
new government and you have the examples
 
00:56:45.029 --> 00:56:45.039 align:start position:0%
of conventions that have been held where
 
00:56:48.750 --> 00:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
there has been no runaway problems
 
00:56:51.470 --> 00:56:51.480 align:start position:0%
now Article
 
00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
Five conventions have been tried in the
 
00:56:57.309 --> 00:56:57.319 align:start position:0%
past and never
 
00:57:00.230 --> 00:57:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh never happened in the United States
 
00:57:01.470 --> 00:57:01.480 align:start position:0%
to this
 
00:57:05.029 --> 00:57:05.039 align:start position:0%
point but they have been drivers of
 
00:57:07.910 --> 00:57:07.920 align:start position:0%
change and I give you two examples in
 
00:57:12.670 --> 00:57:12.680 align:start position:0%
1912 29 of the necessary 31 States
 
00:57:15.270 --> 00:57:15.280 align:start position:0%
pushed for direct election of senators
 
00:57:17.829 --> 00:57:17.839 align:start position:0%
that caused the Congress to act they
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
created the 17th amendment in 1983 we
 
00:57:26.870 --> 00:57:26.880 align:start position:0%
got 32 states of the 34 necessary at
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
that time to pursue balanced budget
 
00:57:34.470 --> 00:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
amendment the result was Congress passed
 
00:57:37.750 --> 00:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
the Graham Redman haulings Provisions
 
00:57:39.430 --> 00:57:39.440 align:start position:0%
the following two
 
00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
years so you can see that even if a a
 
00:57:46.390 --> 00:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
movement for a convention doesn't
 
00:57:49.990 --> 00:57:50.000 align:start position:0%
actually get there it can be a Spur to
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
Congress to act as they often times do
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
not want to take actions against against
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
uh against their power and authority and
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
the budget amendment is clear so what is
 
00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.470 align:start position:0%
the budget amendment is clear so what is
hcr3

00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
hcr3
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
proposing basically controls in three
 
00:58:12.630 --> 00:58:12.640 align:start position:0%
different areas first to uh discuss
 
00:58:15.910 --> 00:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
potential uh options for fiscal
 
00:58:18.870 --> 00:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
restraints on the federal government
 
00:58:23.630 --> 00:58:23.640 align:start position:0%
right now we have almost a $37 trillion
 
00:58:26.270 --> 00:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
debt when I spoke on this measure
 
00:58:30.270 --> 00:58:30.280 align:start position:0%
measure two years ago it was around 32
 
00:58:34.270 --> 00:58:34.280 align:start position:0%
trillion it is clearly out of control
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
hence there is a very strong movement
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
for some kind of balanced budget
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
amendment and as well as a tax revenue
 
00:58:46.510 --> 00:58:46.520 align:start position:0%
cap proposal there could be other items
 
00:58:48.630 --> 00:58:48.640 align:start position:0%
that fall under fiscal constraints but
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
those seem to be the two most
 
00:58:54.829 --> 00:58:54.839 align:start position:0%
common second limit the power and
 
00:58:57.510 --> 00:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of the federal government
 
00:58:59.029 --> 00:58:59.039 align:start position:0%
well this comes from the fact that we
 
00:59:02.470 --> 00:59:02.480 align:start position:0%
have an administrative state that is
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
ruling far too much of our life we have
 
00:59:08.109 --> 00:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
a supreme court that has made decisions
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh particularly on the interstate
 
00:59:14.230 --> 00:59:14.240 align:start position:0%
commerce uh Clause uh where they they
 
00:59:17.589 --> 00:59:17.599 align:start position:0%
decided that growing wheat on one's own
 
00:59:20.710 --> 00:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
farm for one's own use was interstate
 
00:59:23.789 --> 00:59:23.799 align:start position:0%
commerce once they did that the door was
 
00:59:27.069 --> 00:59:27.079 align:start position:0%
open and and Congress could make law on
 
00:59:30.549 --> 00:59:30.559 align:start position:0%
anything citing it was compliant with
 
00:59:33.789 --> 00:59:33.799 align:start position:0%
Article 1 Section 8 of The Constitution
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
and Article 1 Section 8 if you remember
 
00:59:38.750 --> 00:59:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's where it lists these are the
 
00:59:41.069 --> 00:59:41.079 align:start position:0%
powers of congress everything else
 
00:59:44.069 --> 00:59:44.079 align:start position:0%
that's not here belongs to the states
 
00:59:45.829 --> 00:59:45.839 align:start position:0%
well they've they've taken that and
 
00:59:49.950 --> 00:59:49.960 align:start position:0%
they've run with it so we have massive
 
00:59:53.109 --> 00:59:53.119 align:start position:0%
uh amounts of power that Congress has
 
00:59:57.390 --> 00:59:57.400 align:start position:0%
acred to itself to make laws that that
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
we are not in favor of if if from a
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
state perspective uh or admin create an
 
01:00:07.150 --> 01:00:07.160 align:start position:0%
administrative state that does the same
 
01:00:10.549 --> 01:00:10.559 align:start position:0%
so the kinds of things uh that could be
 
01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
considered and discussed in a
 
01:00:13.599 --> 01:00:15.430 align:start position:0%
considered and discussed in a
convention

01:00:15.430 --> 01:00:15.440 align:start position:0%
convention
 
01:00:19.270 --> 01:00:19.280 align:start position:0%
um on this particular item would be
 
01:00:22.390 --> 01:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
proper definition of the Commerce Clause
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
or state laws uh uh State opportunity to
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
abgate laws regulations executive orders
 
01:00:34.670 --> 01:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
of of uh Court decisions mean a proposal
 
01:00:36.750 --> 01:00:36.760 align:start position:0%
three4 of the states or two-thirds of
 
01:00:39.109 --> 01:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
the states if faced with the law that
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
says all right everybody has to uh uh
 
01:00:45.390 --> 01:00:45.400 align:start position:0%
Drive EVS by 2050 say no we're not going
 
01:00:48.309 --> 01:00:48.319 align:start position:0%
to do that if enough of if enough States
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
decide that they want to uh uh in a
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
proposal like that if that was a
 
01:00:55.029 --> 01:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that states had
 
01:00:59.950 --> 01:00:59.960 align:start position:0%
that Authority one could overturn a a uh
 
01:01:02.950 --> 01:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
inappropriate overreaching of Congress
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
or the
 
01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.789 align:start position:0%
or the
executive

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:06.799 align:start position:0%
executive
 
01:01:09.630 --> 01:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
um reversing the 17th Amendment
 
01:01:12.750 --> 01:01:12.760 align:start position:0%
restoring State legislatures back to
 
01:01:14.150 --> 01:01:14.160 align:start position:0%
deciding who is going to be their
 
01:01:16.309 --> 01:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
Senators so the Senators work for the
 
01:01:19.230 --> 01:01:19.240 align:start position:0%
states and DEP protect State interests
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
rather than the the broad um general
 
01:01:25.549 --> 01:01:25.559 align:start position:0%
public where our state representatives
 
01:01:28.589 --> 01:01:28.599 align:start position:0%
are supposed to uh take that task
 
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:31.160 align:start position:0%
Congressional override of Supreme Court
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
decisions by a super majority sunsetting
 
01:01:37.549 --> 01:01:37.559 align:start position:0%
of uh of of agencies Congressional
 
01:01:40.829 --> 01:01:40.839 align:start position:0%
approval of agency regulations right now
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
the the Constitution says that the
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
Congress is the only entity that can
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
make laws yet we have administrative
 
01:01:51.990 --> 01:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
agencies making most of our laws
 
01:01:53.870 --> 01:01:53.880 align:start position:0%
something's wrong with that
 
01:01:57.789 --> 01:01:57.799 align:start position:0%
equation uh so there there are multiple
 
01:02:00.309 --> 01:02:00.319 align:start position:0%
areas of discussion for proposals for
 
01:02:02.870 --> 01:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment under this broad
 
01:02:05.829 --> 01:02:05.839 align:start position:0%
topic and finally the third topic is
 
01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
limitation of terms of office for
 
01:02:11.789 --> 01:02:11.799 align:start position:0%
officials and for members of
 
01:02:15.349 --> 01:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
Congress so term limits for
 
01:02:18.349 --> 01:02:18.359 align:start position:0%
representatives and Senators term limits
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
for senior federal officials working in
 
01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:24.200 align:start position:0%
the government term limits for judges
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
and justices these are all all potential
 
01:02:31.950 --> 01:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
proposals under this broad rubric uh and
 
01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh that could be discussed in amendments
 
01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:35.990 align:start position:0%
uh that could be discussed in amendments
hence

01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
hence
 
01:02:38.829 --> 01:02:38.839 align:start position:0%
proposed I'd like to point out that uh
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
Linda mimel a former member of this
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
committee and I uh were honored to
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
participate in a simulated Article 5
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
Convention of states in August of
 
01:02:53.109 --> 01:02:53.119 align:start position:0%
20123 uh with legislators from every
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
state and it was an outstanding success
 
01:02:58.990 --> 01:02:59.000 align:start position:0%
and I think truly demonstrated the
 
01:03:01.789 --> 01:03:01.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity that this kind of procedure
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
could uh could
 
01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:07.760 align:start position:0%
hold but bottom line you as state
 
01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:10.640 align:start position:0%
legislators are a nation's last line of
 
01:03:13.390 --> 01:03:13.400 align:start position:0%
defense against an all powerful
 
01:03:16.309 --> 01:03:16.319 align:start position:0%
overreaching federal government the
 
01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:20.039 align:start position:0%
framers preserve this task for you as
 
01:03:20.039 --> 01:03:21.230 align:start position:0%
framers preserve this task for you as
your

01:03:21.230 --> 01:03:21.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:03:24.990 --> 01:03:25.000 align:start position:0%
Birthright you are enabled to reclaim
 
01:03:28.630 --> 01:03:28.640 align:start position:0%
the people's power power 19 states have
 
01:03:32.789 --> 01:03:32.799 align:start position:0%
done so I urge you to be the 20th the
 
01:03:35.349 --> 01:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
issue deserves full consideration in the
 
01:03:38.190 --> 01:03:38.200 align:start position:0%
house happy to answer any
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr Prime sponsor
 
01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi you said the
 
01:03:45.510 --> 01:03:45.520 align:start position:0%
Article Five was adopted unanimously in
 
01:03:48.069 --> 01:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
Philadelphia is that article five the
 
01:03:51.349 --> 01:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
The Proposal of having uh yes both the
 
01:03:54.750 --> 01:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
Congressional route and the uh State
 
01:03:58.829 --> 01:03:58.839 align:start position:0%
Route uh and it was it was discussed for
 
01:04:03.750 --> 01:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
for uh on several rounds and finally um
 
01:04:07.630 --> 01:04:07.640 align:start position:0%
Colonel Mason was able to convince all
 
01:04:10.069 --> 01:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
that it was appropriate and necessary
 
01:04:10.079 --> 01:04:12.510 align:start position:0%
that it was appropriate and necessary
repres

01:04:12.510 --> 01:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
repres
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
gagy thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:04:17.430 --> 01:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:04:19.829 --> 01:04:19.839 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at the prior Bill and I'm
 
01:04:23.069 --> 01:04:23.079 align:start position:0%
looking at your bill my understanding is
 
01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:27.039 align:start position:0%
that you want the same outcome come as
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
HB 264 for an article 5 convention could
 
01:04:33.390 --> 01:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
you tell me if any what the difference
 
01:04:36.870 --> 01:04:36.880 align:start position:0%
between your bill and the other bill
 
01:04:39.630 --> 01:04:39.640 align:start position:0%
would yours accomplish
 
01:04:42.390 --> 01:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
more I I don't think so the the the key
 
01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.549 align:start position:0%
more I I don't think so the the the key
language

01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:04:48.109 --> 01:04:48.119 align:start position:0%
is uh having the state agree that it
 
01:04:51.230 --> 01:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
wants to move forward for in the three
 
01:04:53.549 --> 01:04:53.559 align:start position:0%
areas and the three areas are are the
 
01:04:53.559 --> 01:04:55.829 align:start position:0%
areas and the three areas are are the
same

01:04:55.829 --> 01:04:55.839 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:04:58.670 --> 01:04:58.680 align:start position:0%
thank you and I would point out that
 
01:05:00.789 --> 01:05:00.799 align:start position:0%
representative Bernard's measur is an
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
HCR it's a house concurrent resolution
 
01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
previous measure was a HB was a house
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
build so there was a distinction there
 
01:05:10.430 --> 01:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative F I'm sure represent
 
01:05:12.190 --> 01:05:12.200 align:start position:0%
Bernard would love to have a question
 
01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.349 align:start position:0%
Bernard would love to have a question
from

01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you and thank you
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi I just want to
 
01:05:20.789 --> 01:05:20.799 align:start position:0%
clarification and I apologize I don't
 
01:05:24.029 --> 01:05:24.039 align:start position:0%
have your resolution in front of me um
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
so under in your hand out here you say
 
01:05:30.190 --> 01:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
um each state gets one vote like in the
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
Electoral College but I think anyone
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
who's stayed up all night on Election
 
01:05:37.390 --> 01:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
night knows that not every state in the
 
01:05:39.430 --> 01:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
Electoral under the Electoral College
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
gets one vote can so can you just
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
clarify is in your resolution is it one
 
01:05:45.829 --> 01:05:45.839 align:start position:0%
state one vote or is it a situation like
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
the Electoral
 
01:05:51.269 --> 01:05:51.279 align:start position:0%
College no it's
 
01:05:55.190 --> 01:05:55.200 align:start position:0%
uh in a convention each state gets one
 
01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.829 align:start position:0%
uh in a convention each state gets one
vote

01:05:56.829 --> 01:05:56.839 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
is this is yes like that yes
 
01:06:01.880 --> 01:06:03.230 align:start position:0%
is this is yes like that yes
representative

01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
mbom um thank you Mr chairman um and
 
01:06:07.589 --> 01:06:07.599 align:start position:0%
thank you representative bernardy I have
 
01:06:09.630 --> 01:06:09.640 align:start position:0%
a followup to representative F's
 
01:06:12.870 --> 01:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
question so can states determine how
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
many delegates they send to a convention
 
01:06:18.150 --> 01:06:18.160 align:start position:0%
but they'd still have one vote Yes
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
states can can send as many delegates as
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
they want in the original articles uh of
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
01:06:28.269 --> 01:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
Confederation uh you could send as many
 
01:06:31.630 --> 01:06:31.640 align:start position:0%
you want you needed two to agree or a
 
01:06:34.029 --> 01:06:34.039 align:start position:0%
majority to agree you needed two at
 
01:06:36.349 --> 01:06:36.359 align:start position:0%
least to make a a vote if only one
 
01:06:38.309 --> 01:06:38.319 align:start position:0%
showed up your your state didn't get a
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
vote you needed at least two uh uh to uh
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
participate and you have your vote count
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
but if you had 17 show up you had to
 
01:06:53.750 --> 01:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
have the a majority opinion and that was
 
01:06:56.430 --> 01:06:56.440 align:start position:0%
your one vote right thank you uh
 
01:06:58.870 --> 01:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
followup followup uh thank you Mr
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
chairman so um first thank you for this
 
01:07:03.789 --> 01:07:03.799 align:start position:0%
handout I'm finding it very useful as
 
01:07:05.950 --> 01:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
someone who has not had a civics lesson
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
on this topic so on this the back side
 
01:07:13.349 --> 01:07:13.359 align:start position:0%
of the sheet you give some examples of
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
what these different amendments could be
 
01:07:20.870 --> 01:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
in a constitutional
 
01:07:24.750 --> 01:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
convention are delegates or States
 
01:07:28.269 --> 01:07:28.279 align:start position:0%
typically voted on a package of
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendments or specific things like a
 
01:07:32.990 --> 01:07:33.000 align:start position:0%
separate amendment that would limit that
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
would have term limits for
 
01:07:36.150 --> 01:07:36.160 align:start position:0%
representatives and second amend another
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
amendment that would have term limits
 
01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.470 align:start position:0%
amendment that would have term limits
for

01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:07:41.710 --> 01:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
judges okay first it's not a
 
01:07:43.789 --> 01:07:43.799 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention it's an
 
01:07:48.750 --> 01:07:48.760 align:start position:0%
articles convention okay uh and but yes
 
01:07:52.789 --> 01:07:52.799 align:start position:0%
every particular proposal that is
 
01:07:56.910 --> 01:07:56.920 align:start position:0%
discussed and and I I gave example of
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
items that could be discussed and
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
potentially turned into
 
01:08:05.069 --> 01:08:05.079 align:start position:0%
amendments uh under under those three
 
01:08:08.309 --> 01:08:08.319 align:start position:0%
topic areas uh every one of those would
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
be a separate amendment that then would
 
01:08:14.069 --> 01:08:14.079 align:start position:0%
be proposed to all the states requiring
 
01:08:16.789 --> 01:08:16.799 align:start position:0%
3ars of them to ratify all right thank
 
01:08:19.110 --> 01:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
you other questions for the prime
 
01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:21.550 align:start position:0%
you other questions for the prime
representative

01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:08:23.870 --> 01:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
beler thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:08:25.149 --> 01:08:25.159 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing us this
 
01:08:25.159 --> 01:08:26.349 align:start position:0%
you representative for bringing us this
bill

01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
I have a question because I I'm a little
 
01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
bit agnostic on the concept I don't
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
disagree in the least with your um
 
01:08:37.829 --> 01:08:37.839 align:start position:0%
intent behind doing this but when I look
 
01:08:39.829 --> 01:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
at the actual process and how it go how
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
to go about it and I look at for
 
01:08:43.789 --> 01:08:43.799 align:start position:0%
instance Amendment one uh a Bridging the
 
01:08:45.990 --> 01:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech well we've recently
 
01:08:48.870 --> 01:08:48.880 align:start position:0%
seen a lot of censorship on the internet
 
01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:51.759 align:start position:0%
that was asked for by federal government
 
01:08:53.870 --> 01:08:53.880 align:start position:0%
we've see Amendment two shall not be
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
infringed it's feeling pretty infringed
 
01:08:59.390 --> 01:08:59.400 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways Amendment four uh
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
secure person's houses papers and
 
01:09:03.390 --> 01:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
effects it seems like the federal
 
01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:04.920 align:start position:0%
government is spying on just about
 
01:09:07.829 --> 01:09:07.839 align:start position:0%
everybody all the time article 4 section
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
4 guarantees to each state a republican
 
01:09:10.990 --> 01:09:11.000 align:start position:0%
form of government that will be
 
01:09:13.870 --> 01:09:13.880 align:start position:0%
protected from Invasion so if the
 
01:09:15.990 --> 01:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution is really good and I tend
 
01:09:18.669 --> 01:09:18.679 align:start position:0%
to think it is really good and the
 
01:09:22.110 --> 01:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
federal government just isn't following
 
01:09:25.630 --> 01:09:25.640 align:start position:0%
it why does changing the letter of the
 
01:09:27.789 --> 01:09:27.799 align:start position:0%
Constitution change what the federal
 
01:09:29.749 --> 01:09:29.759 align:start position:0%
government is
 
01:09:33.829 --> 01:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
doing well I think it boils down to uh
 
01:09:36.189 --> 01:09:36.199 align:start position:0%
areas where
 
01:09:40.910 --> 01:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
the Congress as well as the courts
 
01:09:43.349 --> 01:09:43.359 align:start position:0%
have allowed
 
01:09:47.189 --> 01:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
some fuzzy interpretations of what the
 
01:09:49.470 --> 01:09:49.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution is I mean the Constitution
 
01:09:52.950 --> 01:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
is what four or five pages printed out
 
01:09:56.470 --> 01:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a statement of key
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
principles uh and those amendments are a
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
matter of a few lines uh and so what
 
01:10:08.350 --> 01:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
what do they mean uh uh you can get as I
 
01:10:10.870 --> 01:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh the interstate commerce
 
01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:13.640 align:start position:0%
clause for an example where there was a
 
01:10:17.830 --> 01:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
court case that said growing wheat on
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
your own land for your own use impacted
 
01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce well that gave
 
01:10:27.350 --> 01:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
congress the right to do
 
01:10:29.470 --> 01:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
anything that is not what was
 
01:10:31.669 --> 01:10:31.679 align:start position:0%
legitimately meant by addressing
 
01:10:35.669 --> 01:10:35.679 align:start position:0%
interstate commerce by the same token uh
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
you're talking about U you know
 
01:10:40.910 --> 01:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
infringement of of
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh freedom of speech the Second
 
01:10:47.790 --> 01:10:47.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights uh search and seizure
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
uh censorship I mean these are areas
 
01:10:53.189 --> 01:10:53.199 align:start position:0%
that are all currently in in the court
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
system in various arenas
 
01:10:58.590 --> 01:10:58.600 align:start position:0%
if we get bad decisions
 
01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:02.440 align:start position:0%
there and and Congress goes along with
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
them then that could be an area for an
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
article 5 convention to say hey we need
 
01:11:12.310 --> 01:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
to turn this back to mean this and be
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
much more clear and specific so it's an
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fix where these uh issues
 
01:11:21.750 --> 01:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
have gone off the
 
01:11:24.229 --> 01:11:24.239 align:start position:0%
rail other questions for the prime
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:29.630 --> 01:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:11:33.910 --> 01:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
being here sir um previously we did uh
 
01:11:35.270 --> 01:11:35.280 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:11:38.990 --> 01:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
264 and that called for a balanced
 
01:11:41.590 --> 01:11:41.600 align:start position:0%
budget and in reading your
 
01:11:46.110 --> 01:11:46.120 align:start position:0%
HR it's it calls for imposed fiscal
 
01:11:48.350 --> 01:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
restraints would balance budget be
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
included in that fiscal restraint yes as
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
as you noted when I on On The Backs side
 
01:11:57.629 --> 01:11:57.639 align:start position:0%
of my comments I I indicate that that a
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
balance budget is within that broader
 
01:12:05.430 --> 01:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
rubric as well as uh tax caps uh or or
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
other controls on government
 
01:12:11.830 --> 01:12:11.840 align:start position:0%
spending thank you Mr chair other
 
01:12:15.189 --> 01:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
questions representative uh buak go
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
ahead and then representative cber uh
 
01:12:20.030 --> 01:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
quick clarification so in your next page
 
01:12:22.750 --> 01:12:22.760 align:start position:0%
you I like all the goals very uh
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
interesting one thing that I want to
 
01:12:26.590 --> 01:12:26.600 align:start position:0%
know more about it is sunset agencies
 
01:12:28.030 --> 01:12:28.040 align:start position:0%
could you talk more about these what are
 
01:12:30.629 --> 01:12:30.639 align:start position:0%
the agencies that you want to
 
01:12:33.470 --> 01:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
Sunset these are not my proposals I'm
 
01:12:36.149 --> 01:12:36.159 align:start position:0%
get what I did was list under the
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
concept of limit power and jurisdiction
 
01:12:41.229 --> 01:12:41.239 align:start position:0%
of the federal government what are the
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
mechanisms that one could potentially
 
01:12:47.310 --> 01:12:47.320 align:start position:0%
legitimately consider in a Convention as
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
the convention gets together and says
 
01:12:51.990 --> 01:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
all right we we need to limit power and
 
01:12:54.510 --> 01:12:54.520 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction of federal government what
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
powers and how and how are we going to
 
01:13:02.430 --> 01:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
do it what what so if your concern is
 
01:13:06.189 --> 01:13:06.199 align:start position:0%
Runway federal
 
01:13:08.830 --> 01:13:08.840 align:start position:0%
agencies one of the ways one can
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
constrain federal agencies are Sunset
 
01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
Provisions it's just it's just an
 
01:13:18.790 --> 01:13:18.800 align:start position:0%
example I'm not proposing that I'm not
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
saying that's what we should do I'm not
 
01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
saying that's what what New Hampshire
 
01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
representatives to a convention should
 
01:13:27.669 --> 01:13:27.679 align:start position:0%
do I'm just saying that is a kind of
 
01:13:29.990 --> 01:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
thing that one could consider because
 
01:13:32.189 --> 01:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
remember that convention is a
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
conversation of the representatives of
 
01:13:38.550 --> 01:13:38.560 align:start position:0%
all the 50 states or whoever shows up to
 
01:13:41.229 --> 01:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
that convention you're going to discuss
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
the issues you're going to thrash them
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
out and you're going to propose
 
01:13:49.669 --> 01:13:49.679 align:start position:0%
potential amendments or decide hey
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here for us to propose
 
01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.750 align:start position:0%
there's nothing here for us to propose
at

01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
at
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
all representative cyber ranking
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
remember yeah I have a question in
 
01:14:01.350 --> 01:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
regards to um ruling such as citizen
 
01:14:03.990 --> 01:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
citizens united even with the
 
01:14:07.430 --> 01:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
application I'm having a very hard time
 
01:14:11.550 --> 01:14:11.560 align:start position:0%
seeing how we protect this process from
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
influence from outside entities I mean
 
01:14:17.550 --> 01:14:17.560 align:start position:0%
one could say I guess that you know here
 
01:14:19.510 --> 01:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
in the Le you know we we're elected by
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
the people and so we would be good to go
 
01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:24.679 align:start position:0%
represent that but you know don't we see
 
01:14:26.790 --> 01:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of money flowing around here in
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
conquered for certain pieces of
 
01:14:33.510 --> 01:14:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislation or on behalf of certain
 
01:14:36.830 --> 01:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
legislators to do certain things to
 
01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
appease those special interests and I'm
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
talking about you know everybody up here
 
01:14:42.910 --> 01:14:42.920 align:start position:0%
it's not just one side of the aisle the
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
other so I guess what are the plans to
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
protect you know that
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
further well there there is not a
 
01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:56.280 align:start position:0%
proposal under the under this particular
 
01:15:00.229 --> 01:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
uh um resolution to deal with the
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
federal uh financing of of Elections if
 
01:15:08.310 --> 01:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
one wanted to propose a an amendment in
 
01:15:11.669 --> 01:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
that regard and I think uh Wolfpack uh
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
is pursuing a potential amendment in
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
that Arena then there's then there's an
 
01:15:20.189 --> 01:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to bring that topic
 
01:15:23.950 --> 01:15:23.960 align:start position:0%
discussion to a convention if if you
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
have the requis that two3 States agree
 
01:15:30.709 --> 01:15:30.719 align:start position:0%
and thrash out an amendment proposal
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
that would be considered as an Amendment
 
01:15:35.110 --> 01:15:35.120 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution it's it's not in
 
01:15:36.590 --> 01:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
this particular
 
01:15:41.709 --> 01:15:41.719 align:start position:0%
listing followup followup thank you um I
 
01:15:45.030 --> 01:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
guess what I'm talking about is say a
 
01:15:48.629 --> 01:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
corporation paying a delegate to you
 
01:15:51.790 --> 01:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
know put a certain subject or whatever
 
01:15:55.149 --> 01:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
that would benefit them in the end when
 
01:15:59.470 --> 01:15:59.480 align:start position:0%
that said delegate goes to attends the
 
01:16:04.470 --> 01:16:04.480 align:start position:0%
the article convention de delegates from
 
01:16:07.830 --> 01:16:07.840 align:start position:0%
a state are sent by the legislature so
 
01:16:09.470 --> 01:16:09.480 align:start position:0%
they're picked by the legislature
 
01:16:14.030 --> 01:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
whatever process it it uh uh decides is
 
01:16:18.510 --> 01:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
is appropriate and sent with a
 
01:16:21.590 --> 01:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
particular point of view so I'll go back
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
to the Constitutional Convention New
 
01:16:25.470 --> 01:16:25.480 align:start position:0%
York sent
 
01:16:28.070 --> 01:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
three delegates they worked in that
 
01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:31.080 align:start position:0%
convention for a period of time two two
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
of them decided that uh what was being
 
01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
discussed was beyond the scope of what
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
was their remit from the state so they
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
left and Alexander Hamilton remained the
 
01:16:45.310 --> 01:16:45.320 align:start position:0%
only one
 
01:16:49.310 --> 01:16:49.320 align:start position:0%
there he so uh they didn't have the you
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
know the requisite Authority anymore
 
01:16:56.790 --> 01:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
with only one delegate so if asking is
 
01:17:01.470 --> 01:17:01.480 align:start position:0%
would a would the state send a delegate
 
01:17:05.709 --> 01:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
that is then being paid under the table
 
01:17:08.110 --> 01:17:08.120 align:start position:0%
by a corporation I mean that that would
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
seem to me a violation of you know the
 
01:17:15.669 --> 01:17:15.679 align:start position:0%
the the uh the charter of a of a
 
01:17:18.550 --> 01:17:18.560 align:start position:0%
commissioner going to the to the
 
01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:21.480 align:start position:0%
commission other questions for the
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
prime uh represent Foss
 
01:17:27.149 --> 01:17:27.159 align:start position:0%
thank you I actually have a followup
 
01:17:29.910 --> 01:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
from representative belcher's question
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
um so you use the example of the
 
01:17:37.350 --> 01:17:37.360 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and uh saying that
 
01:17:40.110 --> 01:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
obviously Congress has passed many laws
 
01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:42.840 align:start position:0%
based on uh their understanding of the
 
01:17:45.229 --> 01:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause uh and the Supreme Court
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
has held these up as constitutional so
 
01:17:52.030 --> 01:17:52.040 align:start position:0%
if a convention were to find that
 
01:17:55.390 --> 01:17:55.400 align:start position:0%
actually Congress doesn't have the
 
01:17:58.270 --> 01:17:58.280 align:start position:0%
uh authority to I don't know if you if
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
you'd rather regulate interstate
 
01:18:04.110 --> 01:18:04.120 align:start position:0%
commerce or regulate it in this manner
 
01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
isn't this essentially creating a fourth
 
01:18:08.790 --> 01:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:12.870 --> 01:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
government no no it's not created it it
 
01:18:17.149 --> 01:18:17.159 align:start position:0%
if if an example of interstate commerce
 
01:18:22.149 --> 01:18:22.159 align:start position:0%
uh a convention uh strikes a uh an
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
amendment that brings the understanding
 
01:18:26.990 --> 01:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
of what regulating interstate commerce
 
01:18:29.910 --> 01:18:29.920 align:start position:0%
meant back to what what the original
 
01:18:33.350 --> 01:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
purpose was back when the Constitution
 
01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.149 align:start position:0%
purpose was back when the Constitution
was

01:18:34.149 --> 01:18:34.159 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:18:34.159 --> 01:18:35.790 align:start position:0%
was
created

01:18:35.790 --> 01:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
created
 
01:18:39.870 --> 01:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh what it means is this the federal
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
government is not going to have the
 
01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
authority to pass laws in that area so
 
01:18:47.110 --> 01:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
the states then are given that Authority
 
01:18:49.990 --> 01:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
The Authority comes back to the states
 
01:18:53.709 --> 01:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
to act on specific items and
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
concerns follow
 
01:19:00.270 --> 01:19:00.280 align:start position:0%
up but so that essentially would act on
 
01:19:03.669 --> 01:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
a check to laws that congress has
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
already passed Congress US Congress and
 
01:19:11.030 --> 01:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
that the judicial branch has found
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional so this is a check on
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
them similar to our system of checks and
 
01:19:18.990 --> 01:19:19.000 align:start position:0%
balances so but you still this would not
 
01:19:20.470 --> 01:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
create a fourth branch of government
 
01:19:22.709 --> 01:19:22.719 align:start position:0%
you're saying and I just don't
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
understand how wouldn't if it has this
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
check and Balance
 
01:19:30.990 --> 01:19:31.000 align:start position:0%
power so if you consider the check and
 
01:19:34.149 --> 01:19:34.159 align:start position:0%
balance being uh judicial legislative
 
01:19:36.790 --> 01:19:36.800 align:start position:0%
and executive fine but there's another
 
01:19:39.350 --> 01:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
check and balance which is federalism
 
01:19:42.910 --> 01:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
federal state local control so if you
 
01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
take power away from the feds who have
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriately taken it and the and the
 
01:19:54.070 --> 01:19:54.080 align:start position:0%
and the court system said it's okay now
 
01:19:56.350 --> 01:19:56.360 align:start position:0%
you pass a Constitutional Amendment say
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
no you don't have that Authority that
 
01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.149 align:start position:0%
no you don't have that Authority that
Authority

01:20:01.149 --> 01:20:01.159 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
01:20:04.270 --> 01:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
as articulated in the 10th Amendment
 
01:20:07.430 --> 01:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
goes back and stays with the states so
 
01:20:10.270 --> 01:20:10.280 align:start position:0%
the state has the authority to act it's
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
not another branch of government it's
 
01:20:15.430 --> 01:20:15.440 align:start position:0%
another it's another layer of government
 
01:20:17.430 --> 01:20:17.440 align:start position:0%
okay one one final
 
01:20:19.629 --> 01:20:19.639 align:start position:0%
followup uh but wouldn't that be a
 
01:20:22.110 --> 01:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
violation of the supremacy clause that
 
01:20:25.189 --> 01:20:25.199 align:start position:0%
the federal government the federal laws
 
01:20:27.149 --> 01:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
are the law of the
 
01:20:30.070 --> 01:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
land and the Constitution is the supreme
 
01:20:31.910 --> 01:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
law of the land and if the amendment
 
01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:33.430 align:start position:0%
law of the land and if the amendment
says

01:20:33.430 --> 01:20:33.440 align:start position:0%
says
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
that the states have authority in this
 
01:20:38.830 --> 01:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
area it's not a violation of the
 
01:20:41.790 --> 01:20:41.800 align:start position:0%
supremacy CLA Clause other questions for
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
the prime
 
01:20:47.070 --> 01:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor uh yes go ahead rep of gagy

thank you for your
 
01:20:52.189 --> 01:20:52.199 align:start position:0%
Indulgence an article five convention is
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
that not giving the people back the
 
01:20:59.070 --> 01:20:59.080 align:start position:0%
right for the laws to be for the People
 
01:21:00.950 --> 01:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
by the people and of the people instead
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
of government
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
overreach absolutely I second the motion
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%

up uh representative Lloyd please thank

you I'll try to be brief um
 
01:21:19.430 --> 01:21:19.440 align:start position:0%
so in this um If This Were to go through
 
01:21:22.030 --> 01:21:22.040 align:start position:0%
and let's say that that this resolution
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
does come through and an an article 5
 
01:21:28.189 --> 01:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
convention is called um how does New
 
01:21:30.510 --> 01:21:30.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently have a process in
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
selection I do not believe New Hampshire
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
has a formalized process in place that
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
would have to be something the
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
legislature would would take up and I
 
01:21:46.430 --> 01:21:46.440 align:start position:0%
would expect that it would be some kind
 
01:21:48.790 --> 01:21:48.800 align:start position:0%
of discussion between the start with
 
01:21:50.470 --> 01:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
between the speaker and the president of
 
01:21:52.590 --> 01:21:52.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate of how we're going to uh
 
01:21:54.669 --> 01:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
identify who those commissioner
 
01:21:57.669 --> 01:21:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:01.149 --> 01:22:01.159 align:start position:0%
be seeing no further hands I want to
 
01:22:03.110 --> 01:22:03.120 align:start position:0%

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%

01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
speaking requests but I want to go to um
 
01:22:49.310 --> 01:22:49.320 align:start position:0%

uh in the house uh and our our Uh custom
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
here is is maybe the case in the US
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
Senate is is to uh try to avoid uh
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
Applause uh but I don't object to that
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
former former Senator San torm does not
 
01:23:16.709 --> 01:23:16.719 align:start position:0%

before I believe Senator welcome back uh
 
01:23:20.950 --> 01:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
the senator has asked for 15 minutes and
 
01:23:22.310 --> 01:23:22.320 align:start position:0%
I think given the distance you've
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
traveled uh we can do that so so welcome
 
01:23:28.070 --> 01:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and uh it is truly
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%

committee and uh and uh to be back in
 
01:23:34.590 --> 01:23:34.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I only wish that uh the
 
01:23:35.950 --> 01:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
committee treats me Kinder than the
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
voters of New Hampshire did in 2012 um
 
01:23:40.830 --> 01:23:40.840 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of support but not not
 
01:23:43.470 --> 01:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
quite enough uh it was uh it's great to
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
be here and I I I want to do my best to
 
01:23:47.790 --> 01:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
try to answer maybe even some of the
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
questions that have been asked here I
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
just want to give you a little bit of a
 
01:23:53.430 --> 01:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
background as to how I got involved I I
 
01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:54.920 align:start position:0%
and when I was asked asked about this
 
01:23:56.470 --> 01:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
issue actually it was during the 2012
 
01:23:59.070 --> 01:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
campaign uh I knew nothing about it uh
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer I was in Congress and the
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
senate for 16 years and knew nothing
 
01:24:06.350 --> 01:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
about Article 5 uh and really didn't
 
01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:08.520 align:start position:0%
even recogn realize that that state
 
01:24:10.070 --> 01:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
legislatur could propose amendments
 
01:24:11.709 --> 01:24:11.719 align:start position:0%
because it was not nothing I'd ever
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
heard before uh and so my initial
 
01:24:16.270 --> 01:24:16.280 align:start position:0%
reaction was uh as being a conservative
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
was uh let's just say very skeptical uh
 
01:24:21.189 --> 01:24:21.199 align:start position:0%
well if it hadn't been done for 240
 
01:24:22.750 --> 01:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
years why are we thinking about doing it
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
now and and so I really had the position
 
01:24:28.470 --> 01:24:28.480 align:start position:0%
of really not being a supporter of it um
 
01:24:31.110 --> 01:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't until later on and I I
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
remind the the committee that when I was
 
01:24:35.430 --> 01:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
running for president in 2011 here in
 
01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in 12 uh the federal
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
deficit was Federal uh uh debt was $14
 
01:24:44.830 --> 01:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
trillion I mean that doesn't seem that
 
01:24:46.629 --> 01:24:46.639 align:start position:0%
long ago that I was up here campaigning
 
01:24:49.750 --> 01:24:49.760 align:start position:0%
and it was 14 trillion it's 30 almost 35
 
01:24:53.270 --> 01:24:53.280 align:start position:0%
36 trillion doll now every four months
 
01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:54.880 align:start position:0%
we're adding a trillion
 
01:24:57.149 --> 01:24:57.159 align:start position:0%
to the national debt I just ask any of
 
01:24:58.430 --> 01:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
you and I don't care what side of the
 
01:25:00.870 --> 01:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
Alle you on if we continue this are we
 
01:25:03.149 --> 01:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
not headed to a fiscal crisis and do you
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
see any anybody either party I'm both
 
01:25:09.030 --> 01:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
parties are guilty here do you see
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
either party doing anything in
 
01:25:13.390 --> 01:25:13.400 align:start position:0%
Washington DC to stop the accumulation
 
01:25:15.590 --> 01:25:15.600 align:start position:0%
of debt and the collapse of our
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
financial system does anyone believe
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's not going to
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
happen Okay I don't see any hands going
 
01:25:25.109 --> 01:25:25.119 align:start position:0%
up so here's so when people tell me well
 
01:25:27.870 --> 01:25:27.880 align:start position:0%
there's a risk if we do a Convention of
 
01:25:30.709 --> 01:25:30.719 align:start position:0%
States well if the alternative is fiscal
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
collapse is a certainty what's the
 
01:25:37.629 --> 01:25:37.639 align:start position:0%
risk if your house across the street is
 
01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:40.040 align:start position:0%
burning and you have to cross the street
 
01:25:42.510 --> 01:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
to put the fire out there's a risk of
 
01:25:43.790 --> 01:25:43.800 align:start position:0%
crossing the
 
01:25:46.189 --> 01:25:46.199 align:start position:0%
street there is their car could be
 
01:25:48.910 --> 01:25:48.920 align:start position:0%
coming by it could hit you bad things
 
01:25:50.910 --> 01:25:50.920 align:start position:0%
can happen if you cross a
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
street but if your house is burning you
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
cross the darn Street Ladies and
 
01:25:58.830 --> 01:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
Gentlemen you know all this you know
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
this I mean you're the live free to die
 
01:26:03.390 --> 01:26:03.400 align:start position:0%
State you know that Washington is on a
 
01:26:05.830 --> 01:26:05.840 align:start position:0%
on a on a crash course whether it's
 
01:26:08.629 --> 01:26:08.639 align:start position:0%
financially or whether it's the Tyranny
 
01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing candidly from both
 
01:26:13.189 --> 01:26:13.199 align:start position:0%
parties when it comes to the uh the
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
president and the way they wield their
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
pens and tell you how they're they're
 
01:26:19.510 --> 01:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
going to change everything and do things
 
01:26:21.590 --> 01:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
that presidents here to for never
 
01:26:25.030 --> 01:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
thought they could do this is not
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
what we signed up for if you will as a
 
01:26:31.189 --> 01:26:31.199 align:start position:0%
in this constitution people talk about
 
01:26:32.870 --> 01:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
they pull out their pocket Constitution
 
01:26:36.430 --> 01:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
say don't change this well it was
 
01:26:38.270 --> 01:26:38.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly written it was divinely
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
inspired we don't have any Madison or
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
Franklin's or Jeffersons left in the
 
01:26:46.149 --> 01:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
United States well we may not but let's
 
01:26:49.709 --> 01:26:49.719 align:start position:0%
just be honest this document has been
 
01:26:53.109 --> 01:26:53.119 align:start position:0%
changed it's been changed 27 times it
 
01:26:54.470 --> 01:26:54.480 align:start position:0%
may have been a perfect document ment
 
01:26:56.590 --> 01:26:56.600 align:start position:0%
was a darn good one and I would argue
 
01:26:57.669 --> 01:26:57.679 align:start position:0%
that most people think most of the
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
changes are pretty darn good first 10
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
amendments not too many people disagree
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
with those right the Amendments after
 
01:27:06.470 --> 01:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
the Civil War not too many people
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
disagree with those in fact someone
 
01:27:10.149 --> 01:27:10.159 align:start position:0%
asked the question well you know we
 
01:27:11.629 --> 01:27:11.639 align:start position:0%
don't follow the laws now why will we
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
follow them in the future look at the
 
01:27:16.390 --> 01:27:16.400 align:start position:0%
Amendments we actually do follow those
 
01:27:19.189 --> 01:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
we actually follow them pretty darn well
 
01:27:21.109 --> 01:27:21.119 align:start position:0%
do we not limit presence to two terms
 
01:27:22.550 --> 01:27:22.560 align:start position:0%
yep we follow that do women have the
 
01:27:24.189 --> 01:27:24.199 align:start position:0%
right to vote well I look around here I
 
01:27:26.910 --> 01:27:26.920 align:start position:0%
say the answer is yes we follow those
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendments why do we follow them we
 
01:27:31.950 --> 01:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
follow them because it is darn near
 
01:27:33.870 --> 01:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
andoss to pass an amendment to the
 
01:27:36.229 --> 01:27:36.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution it's the hardest thing any
 
01:27:38.629 --> 01:27:38.639 align:start position:0%
government any level of government is
 
01:27:41.229 --> 01:27:41.239 align:start position:0%
required to do to pass anything the
 
01:27:44.030 --> 01:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
hardest highest bar is to add an
 
01:27:46.350 --> 01:27:46.360 align:start position:0%
amendment to the Constitution you need
 
01:27:49.310 --> 01:27:49.320 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the states am imagine
 
01:27:52.030 --> 01:27:52.040 align:start position:0%
if you had to get 3/4 of the house here
 
01:27:54.430 --> 01:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
to pass anything oh you'd get you know
 
01:27:58.109 --> 01:27:58.119 align:start position:0%
you'd name a a a park or two but
 
01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
anything controversial no way you're
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
going to get three4 of and here's the
 
01:28:04.189 --> 01:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
interesting thing someone said well you
 
01:28:07.629 --> 01:28:07.639 align:start position:0%
don't need 13 states for one leg one
 
01:28:09.510 --> 01:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
house of legislature to post it that's
 
01:28:12.310 --> 01:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
wrong you need 13 states and one house
 
01:28:15.030 --> 01:28:15.040 align:start position:0%
of legislature to do nothing they don't
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
have to oppose it they don't have to
 
01:28:18.510 --> 01:28:18.520 align:start position:0%
vote on it what is the easiest thing I
 
01:28:19.870 --> 01:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
know some of you are new members but let
 
01:28:21.390 --> 01:28:21.400 align:start position:0%
me assure you the answer to this
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
question what is the easiest thing for
 
01:28:25.870 --> 01:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
any legisl to do when it comes to an
 
01:28:25.880 --> 01:28:28.270 align:start position:0%
any legisl to do when it comes to an
issue

01:28:28.270 --> 01:28:28.280 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:28:31.350 --> 01:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
nothing right put it in your
 
01:28:35.390 --> 01:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
drawer all 13 houses of of 13 different
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
states have to do is put it in their
 
01:28:40.510 --> 01:28:40.520 align:start position:0%
drawer this is darn near impossible and
 
01:28:43.430 --> 01:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
so in order to pass
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
something you need broad consensus if
 
01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
you look at all the Amendments that have
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
passed a date they were overwhelming
 
01:28:53.709 --> 01:28:53.719 align:start position:0%
consensus that this needed to be done
 
01:28:56.109 --> 01:28:56.119 align:start position:0%
you need 75% of the states my guess is
 
01:28:59.189 --> 01:28:59.199 align:start position:0%
you need 80 85% of the public to agree
 
01:29:02.350 --> 01:29:02.360 align:start position:0%
to get 75% of the states to pass you
 
01:29:04.430 --> 01:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
talk about a runaway
 
01:29:06.870 --> 01:29:06.880 align:start position:0%
convention a convention simply does one
 
01:29:09.870 --> 01:29:09.880 align:start position:0%
thing it proposes amendments tomorrow
 
01:29:11.790 --> 01:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
the Congress could propose an amendment
 
01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the First Amendment they
 
01:29:15.709 --> 01:29:15.719 align:start position:0%
can do it tomorrow do you see people
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
running around saying oh I'm worried the
 
01:29:19.350 --> 01:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
Congress might propose an amendment
 
01:29:20.950 --> 01:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's going to take my rights away
 
01:29:24.669 --> 01:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
nobody worries about that why
 
01:29:26.350 --> 01:29:26.360 align:start position:0%
because it's damn near impossible to
 
01:29:28.109 --> 01:29:28.119 align:start position:0%
pass anything through the legislature
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
they knew they wouldn't get something
 
01:29:32.430 --> 01:29:32.440 align:start position:0%
like that passed do you think folks
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
after having worked hard to get 34
 
01:29:37.709 --> 01:29:37.719 align:start position:0%
states to do the three things that
 
01:29:39.229 --> 01:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
represented bernardy who did by the way
 
01:29:42.189 --> 01:29:42.199 align:start position:0%
a fabulous job do you think after
 
01:29:44.310 --> 01:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
working that hard to get a convention
 
01:29:45.430 --> 01:29:45.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to propose things that
 
01:29:48.070 --> 01:29:48.080 align:start position:0%
have no chance of passing no they're
 
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
going to propose things that have some
 
01:29:54.270 --> 01:29:54.280 align:start position:0%
chance for states that may not be
 
01:29:56.350 --> 01:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
excited about the topics that are at
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
hand would might might see a way to pass
 
01:30:00.990 --> 01:30:01.000 align:start position:0%
something I use an
 
01:30:03.109 --> 01:30:03.119 align:start position:0%
example people say well what would that
 
01:30:04.790 --> 01:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
be would it be a balanced budget
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
amendment maybe I doubt a balanced
 
01:30:08.629 --> 01:30:08.639 align:start position:0%
budget amendment candidly will pass 38
 
01:30:10.790 --> 01:30:10.800 align:start position:0%
State legislatures at this point I doubt
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
it in fact I greatly doubt it that
 
01:30:15.030 --> 01:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we shouldn't try but I I
 
01:30:17.550 --> 01:30:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't think it will happen do you think
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
well then what would happen the one
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
example I use that I still think could
 
01:30:23.629 --> 01:30:23.639 align:start position:0%
could pass and something that would be
 
01:30:25.350 --> 01:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
very important for the stability of our
 
01:30:27.390 --> 01:30:27.400 align:start position:0%
Republic is to limit the Supreme Court
 
01:30:28.350 --> 01:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
to nine
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
members that would prohibit either party
 
01:30:33.510 --> 01:30:33.520 align:start position:0%
from packing the court and trying to do
 
01:30:34.990 --> 01:30:35.000 align:start position:0%
something which I think would be against
 
01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
the the interests of our country I know
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
Democrats might say well you know that's
 
01:30:42.109 --> 01:30:42.119 align:start position:0%
because you have a majority now well
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
that hasn't always been the case and let
 
01:30:45.390 --> 01:30:45.400 align:start position:0%
me assure you it won't always be the
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
case it will swing back and forth but it
 
01:30:50.030 --> 01:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
will do so gradually over time and that
 
01:30:54.390 --> 01:30:54.400 align:start position:0%
is the way stability works for America
 
01:30:56.430 --> 01:30:56.440 align:start position:0%
and I think 38 State legislatures could
 
01:30:58.149 --> 01:30:58.159 align:start position:0%
actually pass that would it be worth
 
01:31:00.070 --> 01:31:00.080 align:start position:0%
doing a Convention of States just to do
 
01:31:01.709 --> 01:31:01.719 align:start position:0%
that in my opinion absolutely yes for
 
01:31:05.550 --> 01:31:05.560 align:start position:0%
two reasons three reasons number one the
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.310 --> 01:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
convention the founders remember had
 
01:31:14.030 --> 01:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
something in
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
common and people forget this but it's
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
true the founders were state
 
01:31:22.189 --> 01:31:22.199 align:start position:0%
legislators they didn't want the power
 
01:31:24.310 --> 01:31:24.320 align:start position:0%
in the federal government they knew
 
01:31:25.870 --> 01:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
there needed to be more power but they
 
01:31:27.189 --> 01:31:27.199 align:start position:0%
didn't want the power to go to the
 
01:31:29.910 --> 01:31:29.920 align:start position:0%
federal government they wanted it at the
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
states so they were state legislators
 
01:31:34.590 --> 01:31:34.600 align:start position:0%
and they focused on one thing they
 
01:31:36.709 --> 01:31:36.719 align:start position:0%
focused on checks and balances and
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
particularly checking the federal
 
01:31:40.310 --> 01:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
government becoming becoming a tyranical
 
01:31:42.550 --> 01:31:42.560 align:start position:0%
body because they were afraid of that
 
01:31:44.910 --> 01:31:44.920 align:start position:0%
they came from that and so they put all
 
01:31:46.830 --> 01:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
these checks in place to make make make
 
01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
sure that happened they put two
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
particular Provisions in that
 
01:31:55.310 --> 01:31:55.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution to protect the states one
 
01:31:57.870 --> 01:31:57.880 align:start position:0%
was was mentioned earlier you folks used
 
01:32:00.189 --> 01:32:00.199 align:start position:0%
to pick United States senators now as
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
someone who's United States senator from
 
01:32:02.790 --> 01:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania who would never have been
 
01:32:04.390 --> 01:32:04.400 align:start position:0%
picked by my legislature I'm actually
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
glad that's not the case anymore but the
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
reality is it was there so you had a
 
01:32:14.550 --> 01:32:14.560 align:start position:0%
body to check Washington DC from taking
 
01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
your power the Senate just so you know
 
01:32:19.750 --> 01:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
most folks don't know this but prior to
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
the 17th amendment of 1912 in order to P
 
01:32:25.189 --> 01:32:25.199 align:start position:0%
to bring up a bill in the United States
 
01:32:26.990 --> 01:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
Senate you know what percentage of
 
01:32:29.070 --> 01:32:29.080 align:start position:0%
senators had to agree to bring up a bill
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
just to vote on it
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
100% you know what the federal deficit
 
01:32:37.709 --> 01:32:37.719 align:start position:0%
was in 1912 when the 17th amendment was
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
passed a buck 50 from the Spanish
 
01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:43.189 align:start position:0%
passed a buck 50 from the Spanish
American

01:32:43.189 --> 01:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:45.990 --> 01:32:46.000 align:start position:0%
War the federal government Washington DC
 
01:32:47.669 --> 01:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
was a Backwater town that nobody paid
 
01:32:50.870 --> 01:32:50.880 align:start position:0%
much attention to 70 Amendment came
 
01:32:52.750 --> 01:32:52.760 align:start position:0%
changed everything people say don't
 
01:32:54.790 --> 01:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
touch this constitution ution it has
 
01:32:57.430 --> 01:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
been touched ladies and gentlemen it has
 
01:32:59.270 --> 01:32:59.280 align:start position:0%
been touched and it's been fundamentally
 
01:33:02.070 --> 01:33:02.080 align:start position:0%
changed it's shifted the power away from
 
01:33:03.990 --> 01:33:04.000 align:start position:0%
you to
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
Washington and and Washington DC
 
01:33:09.350 --> 01:33:09.360 align:start position:0%
exploded second thing that happened was
 
01:33:11.109 --> 01:33:11.119 align:start position:0%
Court decisions during the New Deal
 
01:33:13.470 --> 01:33:13.480 align:start position:0%
primarily that expanded all of these
 
01:33:15.390 --> 01:33:15.400 align:start position:0%
provisions on the Federal Constitution
 
01:33:17.870 --> 01:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
to allow ever expanding role of
 
01:33:19.310 --> 01:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
government and that
 
01:33:21.430 --> 01:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
continues this is not the same
 
01:33:23.790 --> 01:33:23.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution people wave this around if
 
01:33:25.750 --> 01:33:25.760 align:start position:0%
if you order a constitution from the
 
01:33:27.910 --> 01:33:27.920 align:start position:0%
general printing office in Washington DC
 
01:33:30.950 --> 01:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
do you know how big it is it's
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
2,600 pages that is the Constitution you
 
01:33:37.470 --> 01:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
live by when people say don't touch it
 
01:33:40.109 --> 01:33:40.119 align:start position:0%
it's been touched folks this is not
 
01:33:40.119 --> 01:33:41.669 align:start position:0%
it's been touched folks this is not
2,600

01:33:41.669 --> 01:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
2,600
 
01:33:45.149 --> 01:33:45.159 align:start position:0%
pages but the Constitution you live by
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
which is annotated by Supreme Court
 
01:33:49.470 --> 01:33:49.480 align:start position:0%
decision and amendments is
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
2,600 Pages do you think we might be
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
able to touch that you think that might
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
be a good
 
01:34:00.030 --> 01:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
idea and so the reason it's important
 
01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:02.920 align:start position:0%
for you to have this call and to do this
 
01:34:05.950 --> 01:34:05.960 align:start position:0%
convention is to reassert your Authority
 
01:34:07.590 --> 01:34:07.600 align:start position:0%
because the second provision is the one
 
01:34:10.310 --> 01:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're talking about was the provision to
 
01:34:12.830 --> 01:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
allow you to propose amendments
 
01:34:16.430 --> 01:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
everybody needs a boss everybody needs a
 
01:34:18.950 --> 01:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
check you are the check to the federal
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
government and for 250 years you haven't
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
used it for 150 30 years you didn't need
 
01:34:26.990 --> 01:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
it you had another check it was the
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
United States Senate but for the last
 
01:34:31.790 --> 01:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
100 years you have you have you have not
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
use the check that was the emergency
 
01:34:36.709 --> 01:34:36.719 align:start position:0%
check and you can make the argument that
 
01:34:38.950 --> 01:34:38.960 align:start position:0%
up until the last 20 or so years you
 
01:34:42.350 --> 01:34:42.360 align:start position:0%
didn't need that either but you do
 
01:34:45.790 --> 01:34:45.800 align:start position:0%
now you have an obligation because you
 
01:34:48.510 --> 01:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
have power
 
01:34:48.520 --> 01:34:50.790 align:start position:0%
have power
Spider-Man

01:34:50.790 --> 01:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
Spider-Man
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
right you're Spider-Man you have great
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
power you have great
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
responsibility I know state legislators
 
01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:02.639 align:start position:0%
you're used to being dumped upon by the
 
01:35:04.070 --> 01:35:04.080 align:start position:0%
federal government everybody telling you
 
01:35:06.109 --> 01:35:06.119 align:start position:0%
how to do things how to run
 
01:35:08.830 --> 01:35:08.840 align:start position:0%
things there's one good way to stop it a
 
01:35:11.750 --> 01:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
good slap aside the head hey by we're
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're the bower in to new
 
01:35:17.830 --> 01:35:17.840 align:start position:0%
sheriff we're gonna pass this resolution
 
01:35:19.590 --> 01:35:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're going to we're going to assert our
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
Authority rightfully under the
 
01:35:23.510 --> 01:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution you're going to be a all
 
01:35:26.470 --> 01:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
this is all this Con under the Article
 
01:35:29.310 --> 01:35:29.320 align:start position:0%
Five is part of the
 
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution Article 5 is your Authority
 
01:35:36.229 --> 01:35:36.239 align:start position:0%
your responsibility to protect this
 
01:35:38.790 --> 01:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
country don't Sher that responsibility
 
01:35:40.430 --> 01:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
because I'm afraid of a runaway a
 
01:35:43.590 --> 01:35:43.600 align:start position:0%
runaway what a runaway convention to
 
01:35:43.600 --> 01:35:45.669 align:start position:0%
runaway what a runaway convention to
propose

01:35:45.669 --> 01:35:45.679 align:start position:0%
propose
 
01:35:48.629 --> 01:35:48.639 align:start position:0%
amendments remember Congress can do it
 
01:35:52.310 --> 01:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
today so this proposes amendments and by
 
01:35:54.270 --> 01:35:54.280 align:start position:0%
the way as for the Run away because I
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
know that's an important issue I'm
 
01:35:58.390 --> 01:35:58.400 align:start position:0%
running around be in South Dakota on
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
Monday we we're going to probably pass
 
01:36:02.470 --> 01:36:02.480 align:start position:0%
South Dakota be the 20th estate so New
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you got to get cooking if you
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
want to be
 
01:36:08.470 --> 01:36:08.480 align:start position:0%
20 so South Dakota will probably pass
 
01:36:10.229 --> 01:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
will pass it next week we already passed
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
the H the Senate by big margin should
 
01:36:13.990 --> 01:36:14.000 align:start position:0%
pass the
 
01:36:17.870 --> 01:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
house we we we have to go around state
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
by state by state to get 34 states to to
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
ratify this thing and we're using the it
 
01:36:27.470 --> 01:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
the language that you have before you is
 
01:36:29.149 --> 01:36:29.159 align:start position:0%
the same language in South Dakota it was
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
the same in Georgia which was the first
 
01:36:33.270 --> 01:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
state to passes and Arizona and Texas
 
01:36:34.550 --> 01:36:34.560 align:start position:0%
and Florida and a whole bunch of other
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
states have already passed it it's the
 
01:36:38.669 --> 01:36:38.679 align:start position:0%
same language well why are we bothering
 
01:36:41.390 --> 01:36:41.400 align:start position:0%
to do that well because the language
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
just like when you pass a bill it has to
 
01:36:44.070 --> 01:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
be the same in the house and the same in
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
the senate or it doesn't become law same
 
01:36:48.830 --> 01:36:48.840 align:start position:0%
thing here has to be the same in all 34
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
states or you don't get a convention
 
01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
called how do I know that because
 
01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
there's been 400 calls for a convention
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
in the history of our country and we've
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
yet to have a
 
01:36:59.629 --> 01:36:59.639 align:start position:0%
convention if all you needed was 34
 
01:37:01.149 --> 01:37:01.159 align:start position:0%
states calling a convention and you can
 
01:37:03.070 --> 01:37:03.080 align:start position:0%
go and do anything we' already have a
 
01:37:05.229 --> 01:37:05.239 align:start position:0%
convention but Congress has never called
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
a convention why because 34 states
 
01:37:10.189 --> 01:37:10.199 align:start position:0%
haven't agreed on the subject matter
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:18.350 --> 01:37:18.360 align:start position:0%
convention I mean it just makes sense if
 
01:37:21.310 --> 01:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
you need 34 states to agree on what the
 
01:37:24.109 --> 01:37:24.119 align:start position:0%
convention's about that obvious means
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
something at the convention they're
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
limited by what the call of the
 
01:37:29.270 --> 01:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
convention is
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
for you had a bill earlier in this
 
01:37:33.950 --> 01:37:33.960 align:start position:0%
discussion talking about faithful
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
delegate that's another that's a belt
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
and suspender as the gentleman
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
appropriately said that's to make sure
 
01:37:41.750 --> 01:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
that your state is following what you as
 
01:37:43.790 --> 01:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature want which is limiting
 
01:37:45.589 --> 01:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
to those three topics at least the ones
 
01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here and maybe other
 
01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
things that you want to limit to that
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
they have to vote for this or can't vote
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
for something of this that's up to you
 
01:37:55.229 --> 01:37:55.239 align:start position:0%
you control the
 
01:37:57.189 --> 01:37:57.199 align:start position:0%
process people say well we don't know
 
01:38:00.070 --> 01:38:00.080 align:start position:0%
what the rules are there's no rules set
 
01:38:02.109 --> 01:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
well the reality is there's
 
01:38:04.030 --> 01:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
precedent I don't know about you but
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
most legislators when they come into
 
01:38:07.950 --> 01:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
session have to adopt rules you guys
 
01:38:09.750 --> 01:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
have to adopt rules when you come into
 
01:38:11.870 --> 01:38:11.880 align:start position:0%
session okay well how do you know what
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
rules to adopt how do you know what
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
process to use you have a precedent that
 
01:38:18.750 --> 01:38:18.760 align:start position:0%
when you come in you do certain things
 
01:38:20.070 --> 01:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
not in the rules because you don't have
 
01:38:23.229 --> 01:38:23.239 align:start position:0%
any rules but you have precedent as to
 
01:38:25.390 --> 01:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
how things are done and you operate by
 
01:38:28.310 --> 01:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
precedent all the time well as was
 
01:38:30.070 --> 01:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned there's been 40 conventions of
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
states in the history of our country and
 
01:38:34.629 --> 01:38:34.639 align:start position:0%
they've all run the same way there is
 
01:38:37.270 --> 01:38:37.280 align:start position:0%
precedent there is one one state one
 
01:38:39.589 --> 01:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
vote how do we know because we've had 40
 
01:38:40.870 --> 01:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
of them and they've all been one state
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
one vote just like you before you adopt
 
01:38:45.790 --> 01:38:45.800 align:start position:0%
your rules that President will rule
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
until you have a rules and then you
 
01:38:49.229 --> 01:38:49.239 align:start position:0%
could you can change that at the rules
 
01:38:52.189 --> 01:38:52.199 align:start position:0%
good luck there's about three times more
 
01:38:53.950 --> 01:38:53.960 align:start position:0%
small states and there are big States as
 
01:38:55.149 --> 01:38:55.159 align:start position:0%
population you think they're going to
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
give up power to the big States let me
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
assure you New Hampshire is not going to
 
01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:58.709 align:start position:0%
assure you New Hampshire is not going to
do

01:38:58.709 --> 01:38:58.719 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:39:02.229 --> 01:39:02.239 align:start position:0%
that neither is South
 
01:39:04.669 --> 01:39:04.679 align:start position:0%
Dakota I know there's a lot of panic
 
01:39:06.910 --> 01:39:06.920 align:start position:0%
around this and I get it because with
 
01:39:08.910 --> 01:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and
 
01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
unfamiliarity people get nervous and
 
01:39:14.790 --> 01:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
they feel like oh there's risk I need I
 
01:39:16.830 --> 01:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
I'm here to try to get you
 
01:39:20.229 --> 01:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable that this is not a risky
 
01:39:21.910 --> 01:39:21.920 align:start position:0%
thing to do and in fact it is an
 
01:39:24.030 --> 01:39:24.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely necessary thing and it's an
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
absolute abandonment of your
 
01:39:30.390 --> 01:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility as legislators
 
01:39:33.589 --> 01:39:33.599 align:start position:0%
not to intercede and do an
 
01:39:35.669 --> 01:39:35.679 align:start position:0%
intervention on both parties in
 
01:39:38.669 --> 01:39:38.679 align:start position:0%
Washington DC we need you and
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
particularly New Hampshire it's one of
 
01:39:41.510 --> 01:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons I was so excited to come up
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
here you folks want to be first in the
 
01:39:46.030 --> 01:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
nation and you are you guys want to lead
 
01:39:47.709 --> 01:39:47.719 align:start position:0%
you want to you want to be the ones who
 
01:39:50.790 --> 01:39:50.800 align:start position:0%
have a oversized weight on what's going
 
01:39:54.589 --> 01:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
on in Washington DC
 
01:39:56.430 --> 01:39:56.440 align:start position:0%
and here I'm up here pleading with you
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
to do that
 
01:40:00.350 --> 01:40:00.360 align:start position:0%
here I would think New Hampshire would
 
01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
have been first Live Free or Die protect
 
01:40:06.070 --> 01:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
our rights as the state why aren't you
 
01:40:09.070 --> 01:40:09.080 align:start position:0%

questions yes thank you Senator uh I do
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
want to say that New Hampshire was ninth
 
01:40:22.510 --> 01:40:22.520 align:start position:0%
to uh approve the original Constitution
 
01:40:24.550 --> 01:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
which put us over the the top so we uh
 
01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
perhaps we'll put you over the top with
 
01:40:28.270 --> 01:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
us and time will tell Pia was second but
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm just saying time will tell and I and
 
01:40:32.750 --> 01:40:32.760 align:start position:0%
I I do want to say that uh when you did
 
01:40:35.149 --> 01:40:35.159 align:start position:0%
lose the New Hampshire Primary in 2012
 
01:40:36.950 --> 01:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
you lost to a gentleman who had a place
 
01:40:39.709 --> 01:40:39.719 align:start position:0%
on Lake wiip I know very well so
 
01:40:41.910 --> 01:40:41.920 align:start position:0%

01:40:45.910 --> 01:40:45.920 align:start position:0%
bomb our clerk uh go ahead thank you Mr
 
01:40:48.550 --> 01:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
chairman um and thank you senator sorum
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
for for being here and taking my
 
01:40:54.149 --> 01:40:54.159 align:start position:0%
question so I'm curious what potential
 
01:40:56.790 --> 01:40:56.800 align:start position:0%
legal challenges there might be to an
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
amendment that is passed by by a
 
01:41:04.510 --> 01:41:04.520 align:start position:0%
convention okay so again prop the
 
01:41:06.990 --> 01:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
convention proposes amendments we don't
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
pass they don't pass it and and and all
 
01:41:10.910 --> 01:41:10.920 align:start position:0%
50 states gather together each state
 
01:41:14.430 --> 01:41:14.440 align:start position:0%
gets one vote 26 votes are necessary for
 
01:41:17.430 --> 01:41:17.440 align:start position:0%
a an amendment to be proposed it is then
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
according to uh to the Constitution sent
 
01:41:21.470 --> 01:41:21.480 align:start position:0%
to the states for
 
01:41:24.430 --> 01:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
ratification um all but of the 27
 
01:41:26.350 --> 01:41:26.360 align:start position:0%
Amendments 26 were done by the state
 
01:41:28.390 --> 01:41:28.400 align:start position:0%
legislators themselves having to pass it
 
01:41:30.870 --> 01:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
both houses and in the case Nebraska one
 
01:41:34.470 --> 01:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
house um and and once it is adopted just
 
01:41:38.390 --> 01:41:38.400 align:start position:0%
like all the prior 26 uh 27 once it's
 
01:41:40.270 --> 01:41:40.280 align:start position:0%
adopted it's included in the
 
01:41:43.430 --> 01:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution and therefore has the same
 
01:41:46.830 --> 01:41:46.840 align:start position:0%
Force as any other provision of the
 
01:41:49.589 --> 01:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution so I you know the court
 
01:41:52.350 --> 01:41:52.360 align:start position:0%
will then go ahead and interpret what
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
that means but if it's
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
the court is limited to nine members I
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
there's not much interpretation there I
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
mean again it depends on the amendment
 
01:42:03.070 --> 01:42:03.080 align:start position:0%
but um at least the one I'm suggesting
 
01:42:04.950 --> 01:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
would not leave itself very much open to
 
01:42:07.830 --> 01:42:07.840 align:start position:0%
interpretation thank you other questions
 
01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:10.109 align:start position:0%
interpretation thank you other questions
representative

01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:42:12.669 --> 01:42:12.679 align:start position:0%
Foss thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:42:15.910 --> 01:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
Senator sorum uh I'll Echo uh chairman
 
01:42:18.589 --> 01:42:18.599 align:start position:0%
Moffet welcome back to New Hampshire and
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
you should come here when it's not
 
01:42:24.629 --> 01:42:24.639 align:start position:0%
winter sometime I I have oh good glad to
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
hear it uh
 
01:42:29.750 --> 01:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
so the examples that have been talked
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
about are generally uh or the examples
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
that have been used limiting uh the
 
01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
power of the federal government but is
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
there the check to do something like
 
01:42:45.790 --> 01:42:45.800 align:start position:0%
expanding the power like I say Chevron
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
Defence was just
 
01:42:50.390 --> 01:42:50.400 align:start position:0%
overturned uh which I mean it's been a
 
01:42:52.870 --> 01:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
minute since I took administrative law
 
01:42:56.589 --> 01:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
in Pennsylvania uh and seems like kind
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
of threw the administrative law world
 
01:43:03.910 --> 01:43:03.920 align:start position:0%
into a tizzy let's say um so what's to
 
01:43:07.229 --> 01:43:07.239 align:start position:0%
stop a a convention from proposing an
 
01:43:10.550 --> 01:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
amendment that would reinstate something
 
01:43:13.270 --> 01:43:13.280 align:start position:0%
like Chevron Defence that administrative
 
01:43:16.350 --> 01:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
agencies have the power to you know
 
01:43:19.390 --> 01:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
essentially make laws are we are we the
 
01:43:23.229 --> 01:43:23.239 align:start position:0%
only the only check there uh no the I
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
again I mentioned before the language of
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
the resolution uh would limit what is
 
01:43:31.550 --> 01:43:31.560 align:start position:0%
eligible to be proposed you know
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
Wolfpack wants to have campaign Finance
 
01:43:35.430 --> 01:43:35.440 align:start position:0%
well you can't if there if if that
 
01:43:37.310 --> 01:43:37.320 align:start position:0%
happens if there's a convention on
 
01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance limiting the spending
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
in Washington you can't have an abortion
 
01:43:44.030 --> 01:43:44.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment be proposed it's non- gerain
 
01:43:46.629 --> 01:43:46.639 align:start position:0%
and and so uh that would be ruled out of
 
01:43:51.070 --> 01:43:51.080 align:start position:0%
order uh number one uh number two you
 
01:43:53.830 --> 01:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
know they uh if if you look at the fact
 
01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
that these states 34 of them came
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
together because they wanted to limit
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
the power of the federal government at
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
least 34 of those states are probably
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to vote for things that limit the
 
01:44:04.510 --> 01:44:04.520 align:start position:0%
power of the federal government not
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
expand it I mean that that would be a
 
01:44:08.990 --> 01:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
rational thing to say because at the
 
01:44:12.270 --> 01:44:12.280 align:start position:0%
time that 34 is accomplished 34 states
 
01:44:14.709 --> 01:44:14.719 align:start position:0%
still have to be controlled by people
 
01:44:16.470 --> 01:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
who agree with this otherwise like I
 
01:44:18.189 --> 01:44:18.199 align:start position:0%
know is being considered here you it
 
01:44:20.149 --> 01:44:20.159 align:start position:0%
would be rescinded and then you wouldn't
 
01:44:21.790 --> 01:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
get to
 
01:44:23.870 --> 01:44:23.880 align:start position:0%
34 one
 
01:44:27.350 --> 01:44:27.360 align:start position:0%
followup thank you uh but there's
 
01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:29.840 align:start position:0%
nothing to so should this this happen in
 
01:44:32.950 --> 01:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention be held there's
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
nothing to stop me from uh introducing
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
another resolution that would propose uh
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
an amendment to enshrine abortion a
 
01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
affirmative right to abortion in the
 
01:44:50.229 --> 01:44:50.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution so uh there there's no
 
01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
there's no stop Gap there that it seems
 
01:44:54.950 --> 01:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
like this would set quite the
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
Precedence well any delegate could come
 
01:45:00.149 --> 01:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
forward and obviously they they have the
 
01:45:01.750 --> 01:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
right to say anything and propose
 
01:45:04.390 --> 01:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
anything uh but that doesn't mean that
 
01:45:06.870 --> 01:45:06.880 align:start position:0%
the I mean you have the right to propose
 
01:45:07.990 --> 01:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
all sorts of things here in the
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
legislature and that doesn't mean it's
 
01:45:13.750 --> 01:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
going to pass and um in this case it it
 
01:45:16.550 --> 01:45:16.560 align:start position:0%
will not be it will not be considered it
 
01:45:18.510 --> 01:45:18.520 align:start position:0%
would be considered out of order because
 
01:45:20.470 --> 01:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
it's not Germaine to the subject matter
 
01:45:23.189 --> 01:45:23.199 align:start position:0%
of the convention and so it would be it
 
01:45:25.589 --> 01:45:25.599 align:start position:0%
would be dismissed for that reason I
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
think it would also probably fail
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
because there wouldn't be sufficient
 
01:45:31.310 --> 01:45:31.320 align:start position:0%
votes for it to to happen but but by by
 
01:45:33.830 --> 01:45:33.840 align:start position:0%
order of the like I said if you need 34
 
01:45:35.510 --> 01:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
states to come together and agree on the
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
exact language that language has meaning
 
01:45:39.510 --> 01:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
and the meaning is that that the
 
01:45:41.430 --> 01:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
convention is limited to those things
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
and so anything that is outside the
 
01:45:45.950 --> 01:45:45.960 align:start position:0%
scope of that would be considered out of
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
order and not not be eligible to vote
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
and then we mentioned before and you
 
01:45:52.350 --> 01:45:52.360 align:start position:0%
have here the faithful delegate bill you
 
01:45:54.750 --> 01:45:54.760 align:start position:0%
would be an faithful delegate if if New
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire would pass a law that said
 
01:45:59.109 --> 01:45:59.119 align:start position:0%
that you have to limit the areas of
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
discussion to the things that are in the
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
in the call for the convention and you
 
01:46:05.510 --> 01:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't do so then you'd be in violation
 
01:46:06.910 --> 01:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
of that that's one of the reasons I'm
 
01:46:08.430 --> 01:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
supporting the faithful delegate bill
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
and I think mentioned before about half
 
01:46:12.070 --> 01:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
the states have already passed something
 
01:46:13.870 --> 01:46:13.880 align:start position:0%
like that because they don't want people
 
01:46:15.310 --> 01:46:15.320 align:start position:0%
going to these conventions that are
 
01:46:17.030 --> 01:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
limited to certain things and
 
01:46:18.870 --> 01:46:18.880 align:start position:0%
introducing other issues they want to
 
01:46:20.390 --> 01:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
keep it to the subject matter because
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
that's what they promised the people
 
01:46:24.229 --> 01:46:24.239 align:start position:0%
they would do when they passed it you
 
01:46:26.310 --> 01:46:26.320 align:start position:0%
know when you make a vote it's a promise
 
01:46:27.790 --> 01:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're you're you're
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
saying to the people of the state this
 
01:46:31.350 --> 01:46:31.360 align:start position:0%
is what we're going to do we promise
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
that we will uphold the the the language
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
the resolution or the or the statute
 
01:46:38.350 --> 01:46:38.360 align:start position:0%
that we passed and you would be
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
violating that and you would be subject
 
01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:42.960 align:start position:0%
to penalties as a result as an
 
01:46:45.669 --> 01:46:45.679 align:start position:0%
individual delegate the questions uh
 
01:46:48.310 --> 01:46:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative cyber yeah I just wanted
 
01:46:51.950 --> 01:46:51.960 align:start position:0%
to go back to your um example there that
 
01:46:54.589 --> 01:46:54.599 align:start position:0%
you had in regards so like say the topic
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
is um campaign
 
01:46:59.990 --> 01:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
Finance Could you actually underneath
 
01:47:01.950 --> 01:47:01.960 align:start position:0%
that because it is still under campaign
 
01:47:04.910 --> 01:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
Finance say like as you were like do you
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
know campaign Finance um for pro-choice
 
01:47:11.149 --> 01:47:11.159 align:start position:0%
or something like that again I'm not
 
01:47:13.030 --> 01:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
advocating for campaign finance that oh
 
01:47:15.470 --> 01:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
no I understand that I'm just so I'm not
 
01:47:17.229 --> 01:47:17.239 align:start position:0%
an expert on what I don't even know what
 
01:47:19.030 --> 01:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
their language says specifically so I
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
really can't answer that question I I
 
01:47:22.189 --> 01:47:22.199 align:start position:0%
can tell you with respect to the
 
01:47:24.589 --> 01:47:24.599 align:start position:0%
language we have they're all very clear
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
as their limiting it's limiting language
 
01:47:30.030 --> 01:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's to it's to reduce the power of
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
the federal government is not to expand
 
01:47:33.830 --> 01:47:33.840 align:start position:0%
the power of the federal government and
 
01:47:37.229 --> 01:47:37.239 align:start position:0%
and and uh and so that's that's that's
 
01:47:38.910 --> 01:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
how that's how our language works I
 
01:47:42.229 --> 01:47:42.239 align:start position:0%
can't speak to theirs okay thank you any
 
01:47:44.669 --> 01:47:44.679 align:start position:0%
other questions representative Lloyd
 
01:47:46.070 --> 01:47:46.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:47:49.270 --> 01:47:49.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question thank you um can you
 
01:47:52.030 --> 01:47:52.040 align:start position:0%
better can you understand a little bit
 
01:47:53.350 --> 01:47:53.360 align:start position:0%
of my
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
or can you understand a little bit of my
 
01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
concern here in that New Hampshire does
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
not have a defined uh delegate selection
 
01:48:06.149 --> 01:48:06.159 align:start position:0%
process and how I'm concerned with this
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
potentially having a very partisan slant
 
01:48:13.990 --> 01:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
should this be taken up and and come to
 
01:48:17.189 --> 01:48:17.199 align:start position:0%
pass um to use your example of the
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court situation um couldn't a
 
01:48:24.629 --> 01:48:24.639 align:start position:0%
delegate also uh create uh uh or use a
 
01:48:26.870 --> 01:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
convention to force a hearing for a
 
01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to uh uh appointee to
 
01:48:32.229 --> 01:48:32.239 align:start position:0%
happen in a timely manner propos when
 
01:48:33.990 --> 01:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's proposed by the sitting president I
 
01:48:36.910 --> 01:48:36.920 align:start position:0%
mean like there are there's a lot of
 
01:48:39.510 --> 01:48:39.520 align:start position:0%
partisan slant to this and I I guess my
 
01:48:41.990 --> 01:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
concern would be the delegate selection
 
01:48:43.950 --> 01:48:43.960 align:start position:0%
process and making sure that every voice
 
01:48:43.960 --> 01:48:45.070 align:start position:0%
process and making sure that every voice
is

01:48:45.070 --> 01:48:45.080 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:48:49.149 --> 01:48:49.159 align:start position:0%
represented yeah um about a dozen states
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
have passed delegate selection uh
 
01:48:54.229 --> 01:48:54.239 align:start position:0%
procedures and and all of them the
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
legislators basically determine who the
 
01:48:59.270 --> 01:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
who the folks are and I would you know
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
our expectation is I think most people's
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
expectation is that the legislature
 
01:49:04.229 --> 01:49:04.239 align:start position:0%
would appoint
 
01:49:06.189 --> 01:49:06.199 align:start position:0%
legislators uh now there may be some
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
people outside the legislature that
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
could be appointed but by and large uh
 
01:49:13.310 --> 01:49:13.320 align:start position:0%
we suspect that legislators seeing this
 
01:49:15.310 --> 01:49:15.320 align:start position:0%
as their responsibility would would
 
01:49:16.990 --> 01:49:17.000 align:start position:0%
would put some of their colleagues
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
forward and as far as the partisan
 
01:49:20.990 --> 01:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
breakup I mean every State's going to be
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
different as to as to how they how they
 
01:49:26.229 --> 01:49:26.239 align:start position:0%
do that and the numbers some states have
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
uh have I think seven or eight some have
 
01:49:30.990 --> 01:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
six some have five I mean there's
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
they're all over the place as far as the
 
01:49:35.550 --> 01:49:35.560 align:start position:0%
number is concerned but it's it is the
 
01:49:38.149 --> 01:49:38.159 align:start position:0%
decision by you and you as as a as a
 
01:49:40.430 --> 01:49:40.440 align:start position:0%
legislator will have the opportunity to
 
01:49:42.189 --> 01:49:42.199 align:start position:0%
weigh in on that and try to influence
 
01:49:44.910 --> 01:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
how that process works again you folks
 
01:49:46.390 --> 01:49:46.400 align:start position:0%
control the whole
 
01:49:49.790 --> 01:49:49.800 align:start position:0%
process other questions represent
 
01:49:53.470 --> 01:49:53.480 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair and
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
Senator thank you so much for being here
 
01:49:56.830 --> 01:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
come welcome back to New Hampshire
 
01:49:58.629 --> 01:49:58.639 align:start position:0%
you're always a we of information thank
 
01:50:01.790 --> 01:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
you um and mine is a simple question the
 
01:50:04.189 --> 01:50:04.199 align:start position:0%
one vote concept that's great for New
 
01:50:07.709 --> 01:50:07.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but wouldn't uh California and
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
New York and and so on say that's not
 
01:50:11.239 --> 01:50:12.189 align:start position:0%
New York and and so on say that's not
full

01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
full
 
01:50:14.510 --> 01:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
representation well I I just go back I
 
01:50:16.390 --> 01:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
mean you mentioned California uh
 
01:50:19.149 --> 01:50:19.159 align:start position:0%
California has been involved with um
 
01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:22.520 align:start position:0%
with conventions of states in the past
 
01:50:24.790 --> 01:50:24.800 align:start position:0%
uh the Colorado River compact which
 
01:50:26.990 --> 01:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
allocates water for the Colorado River
 
01:50:29.470 --> 01:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
was done through a Convention of States
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
each state passed a resolution to um to
 
01:50:34.870 --> 01:50:34.880 align:start position:0%
appoint Commissioners uh all all the
 
01:50:36.950 --> 01:50:36.960 align:start position:0%
States involved appointed Commissioners
 
01:50:39.390 --> 01:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
they were sent uh they they they each
 
01:50:41.950 --> 01:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
had Commissioners come more than one
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
they all gather together they came up
 
01:50:45.910 --> 01:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
with an idea and then went back to the
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
States California didn't complain they
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
had one vote and Utah had one vote uh
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
why because if you look at the language
 
01:50:55.750 --> 01:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
I mean it's a Convention of States it's
 
01:50:57.589 --> 01:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
not a convention it's not a delegate
 
01:50:59.510 --> 01:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
convention it's a Convention of States
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
each state is a sovereign entity and so
 
01:51:03.790 --> 01:51:03.800 align:start position:0%
they may complain about it but as I
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
mentioned before the precedent is one
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
state one vote that's how it would begin
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
there would be a rules package that we'
 
01:51:13.149 --> 01:51:13.159 align:start position:0%
be adopted and I maybe at maybe
 
01:51:14.550 --> 01:51:14.560 align:start position:0%
California and New York would say well
 
01:51:18.109 --> 01:51:18.119 align:start position:0%
we want you know uh states to be uh
 
01:51:20.430 --> 01:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
based the votes to be based on
 
01:51:24.470 --> 01:51:24.480 align:start position:0%
population well there'd be about 38 or
 
01:51:27.510 --> 01:51:27.520 align:start position:0%
39 states that would say no because they
 
01:51:29.390 --> 01:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
would be at a disadvantage there are
 
01:51:32.390 --> 01:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
only a handful of states that have huge
 
01:51:35.470 --> 01:51:35.480 align:start position:0%
populations and they are not going to I
 
01:51:37.629 --> 01:51:37.639 align:start position:0%
guarantee you I I None of the small
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
states are going to give up that that uh
 
01:51:42.750 --> 01:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
privilege other questions thank you
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
Senator representative
 
01:51:48.149 --> 01:51:48.159 align:start position:0%
Bennett thank you for taking my question
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
um I am I'm kind of new so thank you for
 
01:51:54.870 --> 01:51:54.880 align:start position:0%
coming here um I'm just curious about
 
01:51:58.589 --> 01:51:58.599 align:start position:0%
your timetable like um I know you can't
 
01:52:01.030 --> 01:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
pinpoint who's going to do what but I'm
 
01:52:04.910 --> 01:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
sure you have a projection of you know
 
01:52:06.990 --> 01:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
how you think this is going to play out
 
01:52:08.270 --> 01:52:08.280 align:start position:0%
so I just wondering like are you
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
thinking a year two years yeah I wish I
 
01:52:14.229 --> 01:52:14.239 align:start position:0%
wish I was that smart uh I one of the
 
01:52:15.950 --> 01:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
things I've learned a long time ago is
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
um projecting how state legislator are
 
01:52:19.750 --> 01:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
going to behave is really a risky
 
01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
business I don't think you'll feel see
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
anybody at Caesars putting odds up on on
 
01:52:26.950 --> 01:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
things like that at I mean there are
 
01:52:29.030 --> 01:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
several States I mentioned South Dakota
 
01:52:30.629 --> 01:52:30.639 align:start position:0%
I mean South Dakota you would have
 
01:52:31.629 --> 01:52:31.639 align:start position:0%
thought was a state that would have
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
passed this a long long time ago and um
 
01:52:37.270 --> 01:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
and you know Wisconsin passed it I mean
 
01:52:40.030 --> 01:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
Wisconsin's you know a very very purple
 
01:52:42.229 --> 01:52:42.239 align:start position:0%
State and yet it passed it and some of
 
01:52:44.990 --> 01:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
the reddest states have not um and so
 
01:52:46.910 --> 01:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's it it is it's a hard thing to
 
01:52:49.709 --> 01:52:49.719 align:start position:0%
figure um uh the answer is it's not
 
01:52:51.550 --> 01:52:51.560 align:start position:0%
going to be this in the next couple of
 
01:52:55.189 --> 01:52:55.199 align:start position:0%
years uh and and unlikely to be the next
 
01:52:57.629 --> 01:52:57.639 align:start position:0%
three or four years but I I it's going
 
01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
to take I hate to say it things have to
 
01:53:02.950 --> 01:53:02.960 align:start position:0%
continue to keep getting as getting
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
worse and the worse it gets the more
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
people are saying okay really don't have
 
01:53:09.149 --> 01:53:09.159 align:start position:0%
a choice here we've got to do something
 
01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
we need an intervention and um and I I
 
01:53:14.109 --> 01:53:14.119 align:start position:0%
think we're going to pick up at least
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
I'm very hopeful we uh we'll pick up
 
01:53:18.550 --> 01:53:18.560 align:start position:0%
three or four states this year uh and
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully that'll build some momentum
 
01:53:23.310 --> 01:53:23.320 align:start position:0%
any other questions uh representative
 
01:53:25.589 --> 01:53:25.599 align:start position:0%
cure thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
senator for being here thank you you
 
01:53:30.669 --> 01:53:30.679 align:start position:0%
made a good case I think I uh I am
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
somewhat swayed but I do have a little b
 
01:53:36.030 --> 01:53:36.040 align:start position:0%
a question yeah you made the case that
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
we're heading for a real fiscal crisis I
 
01:53:39.679 --> 01:53:40.750 align:start position:0%
we're heading for a real fiscal crisis I
don't

01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:40.760 align:start position:0%
don't
 
01:53:42.910 --> 01:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
disagree you also made the case that
 
01:53:44.790 --> 01:53:44.800 align:start position:0%
it's very unlikely that a balanced
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
budget amendment would be able to make
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
it through given the constraints that
 
01:53:51.430 --> 01:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
exist under Article 5 I also don't
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
disagree so given that is there a reason
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
that we ought to look at the artical 5
 
01:54:01.069 --> 01:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
process rather than say the process
 
01:54:03.709 --> 01:54:03.719 align:start position:0%
outlined by Madison nullification and
 
01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%
interposition yeah I look first off
 
01:54:11.430 --> 01:54:11.440 align:start position:0%
nullification is been been debated and
 
01:54:13.629 --> 01:54:13.639 align:start position:0%
and lost and we fought a war over it and
 
01:54:15.270 --> 01:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
it didn't go very well for the
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
nullifiers uh I don't think that's a
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
that's a a path that is going to be a
 
01:54:24.550 --> 01:54:24.560 align:start position:0%
fruitful path for uh uh for resolving
 
01:54:28.069 --> 01:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
the problems that we have today uh and I
 
01:54:30.709 --> 01:54:30.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned before one of the biggest
 
01:54:33.149 --> 01:54:33.159 align:start position:0%
reasons I am personally for this is just
 
01:54:36.470 --> 01:54:36.480 align:start position:0%
doing it even if nothing happens even if
 
01:54:38.589 --> 01:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
you don't if you propose amendments none
 
01:54:39.510 --> 01:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
ratified what you've done is you've
 
01:54:43.950 --> 01:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
you've told the Congress and the
 
01:54:46.350 --> 01:54:46.360 align:start position:0%
president there's a sheriff in town that
 
01:54:48.510 --> 01:54:48.520 align:start position:0%
you guys actually are willing to use the
 
01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
power given to you to draw imagine I
 
01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
think people don't really realze how how
 
01:54:55.990 --> 01:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
much of a deal this would be we've never
 
01:54:57.390 --> 01:54:57.400 align:start position:0%
done this in the history of the country
 
01:54:59.390 --> 01:54:59.400 align:start position:0%
can you imagine the attention nationally
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
this will get this will be a huge deal
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
this will be covered wall toall there'll
 
01:55:06.669 --> 01:55:06.679 align:start position:0%
be all sorts of attention on what
 
01:55:09.030 --> 01:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
federalism the role of the states when
 
01:55:11.149 --> 01:55:11.159 align:start position:0%
it comes to the federal government where
 
01:55:12.790 --> 01:55:12.800 align:start position:0%
power should be allocated where is it
 
01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:13.950 align:start position:0%
power should be allocated where is it
best

01:55:13.950 --> 01:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
best
 
01:55:17.189 --> 01:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
placed there'll be movements behind
 
01:55:17.199 --> 01:55:18.030 align:start position:0%
placed there'll be movements behind
different

01:55:18.030 --> 01:55:18.040 align:start position:0%
different
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
amendments will there be money behind it
 
01:55:21.550 --> 01:55:21.560 align:start position:0%
sure I'm sure there'll be money behind
 
01:55:22.830 --> 01:55:22.840 align:start position:0%
but there'll be money behind good things
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
and probably bad things things you agree
 
01:55:25.830 --> 01:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
with and things you don't there's always
 
01:55:27.470 --> 01:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
money involved why because there's power
 
01:55:29.109 --> 01:55:29.119 align:start position:0%
involved there's power involved money's
 
01:55:30.629 --> 01:55:30.639 align:start position:0%
going to be involved but it's all going
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
to be the beauty of this will be out in
 
01:55:34.629 --> 01:55:34.639 align:start position:0%
the open it'll be a transparent process
 
01:55:37.229 --> 01:55:37.239 align:start position:0%
there'll be a national debate and you
 
01:55:39.069 --> 01:55:39.079 align:start position:0%
folks will be at the center of it not
 
01:55:42.109 --> 01:55:42.119 align:start position:0%
congress not Washington you folks will
 
01:55:44.470 --> 01:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
be educating the American public about
 
01:55:46.669 --> 01:55:46.679 align:start position:0%
federalism about what the imagine if our
 
01:55:48.550 --> 01:55:48.560 align:start position:0%
kids in in school had to actually learn
 
01:55:50.069 --> 01:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
said right and and had and we had a
 
01:55:56.870 --> 01:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
national discussion about what what
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
Washington should do and what's best
 
01:55:59.950 --> 01:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
left at the state or what's best left to
 
01:55:59.960 --> 01:56:00.589 align:start position:0%
left at the state or what's best left to
the

01:56:00.589 --> 01:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:56:04.350 --> 01:56:04.360 align:start position:0%
people that in itself that educational
 
01:56:06.629 --> 01:56:06.639 align:start position:0%
process and that new sheriff in town
 
01:56:09.229 --> 01:56:09.239 align:start position:0%
process tells me more than anything else
 
01:56:12.270 --> 01:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:14.870 --> 01:56:14.880 align:start position:0%
Washington there is there is absolutely
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
no governor on what every member of con
 
01:56:19.189 --> 01:56:19.199 align:start position:0%
I don't care how conservative you are
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
you get there and you got people in your
 
01:56:22.790 --> 01:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
office you know this
 
01:56:24.149 --> 01:56:24.159 align:start position:0%
how many people in your office come here
 
01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
and say I wish youd do less of this or
 
01:56:29.629 --> 01:56:29.639 align:start position:0%
don't spend as much money on this nobody
 
01:56:32.109 --> 01:56:32.119 align:start position:0%
does nobody does in in the in conquered
 
01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
and let me assure you nobody does in
 
01:56:36.030 --> 01:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
Washington and they tell and they ask us
 
01:56:37.030 --> 01:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
to do things that we have no
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional authority to do but we
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to say
 
01:56:43.790 --> 01:56:43.800 align:start position:0%
no this changes the game because once
 
01:56:45.510 --> 01:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
you do it and once every all the fears
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
are swept away that it runs orderly and
 
01:56:49.709 --> 01:56:49.719 align:start position:0%
you propose amendments maybe some pass
 
01:56:53.550 --> 01:56:53.560 align:start position:0%
maybe they don't guess what you can do
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
Congress gets out of line again or
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't start addressing the issues you
 
01:56:58.990 --> 01:56:59.000 align:start position:0%
address you say you know what we're
 
01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:00.430 align:start position:0%
address you say you know what we're
coming

01:57:00.430 --> 01:57:00.440 align:start position:0%
coming
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
back you are supposed to be a player on
 
01:57:08.589 --> 01:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.109 --> 01:57:11.119 align:start position:0%
enough why because you are closest to
 
01:57:13.390 --> 01:57:13.400 align:start position:0%
the people there is nobody closer to the
 
01:57:17.669 --> 01:57:17.679 align:start position:0%
people than you 400 of you immeasurably
 
01:57:19.229 --> 01:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
close to the
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
people and we need you
 
01:57:26.430 --> 01:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
in Washington thank you Senator seeing
 
01:57:28.750 --> 01:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
no other hands up uh I do want to thank
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
you again uh former US senator uh we
 
01:57:33.390 --> 01:57:33.400 align:start position:0%
don't get that many in here our new
 
01:57:35.350 --> 01:57:35.360 align:start position:0%
governor by the way is a former US
 
01:57:37.470 --> 01:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
senator oh I know I sered with her yes
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
and uh I before we lose you uh as a
 
01:57:43.390 --> 01:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
senator from Pennsylvania uh by the way
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
she has Pennsylvania ties we're very
 
01:57:47.870 --> 01:57:47.880 align:start position:0%
proud of that as a Penn stator so she uh
 
01:57:51.069 --> 01:57:51.079 align:start position:0%
was a a Keystone State resident at one
 
01:57:52.870 --> 01:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
time as a student
 
01:57:55.270 --> 01:57:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh as a former US senator from
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania did you go to the Steelers
 
01:57:59.430 --> 01:57:59.440 align:start position:0%
or the Eagles I'm a western Pennsylvania
 
01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:00.840 align:start position:0%
guy so that should probably answer your
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
question so
 
01:58:04.629 --> 01:58:04.639 align:start position:0%
I'm okay but I root for the Eagles
 
01:58:06.149 --> 01:58:06.159 align:start position:0%
because I represented Philadelphia so
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm for them to uh for the Super
 
01:58:10.030 --> 01:58:10.040 align:start position:0%
Bowl well the Eagles did beat the
 
01:58:12.109 --> 01:58:12.119 align:start position:0%
Patriots one year but we need to move on
 
01:58:15.830 --> 01:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so much senator for your time
 
01:58:19.109 --> 01:58:19.119 align:start position:0%
pleasure okay uh we have 15 cards we're
 
01:58:21.430 --> 01:58:21.440 align:start position:0%
going to uh let everyone have time to
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
speak uh we're going to have to uh by
 
01:58:29.510 --> 01:58:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh by uh the reality of time uh limit
 
01:58:31.109 --> 01:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
subsequent speakers to two minutes or
 
01:58:34.950 --> 01:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
less our vice chair represent Rollins
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
when when you are coming up on two
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
minutes will'll wave his hat or give you
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
a signal because we want to let everyone
 
01:58:42.709 --> 01:58:42.719 align:start position:0%
have a chance to
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
speak uh seconds before uh 15 seconds
 
01:58:48.189 --> 01:58:48.199 align:start position:0%
before he'll give you the he some of you
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
have only asked for a minute and uh and
 
01:58:54.310 --> 01:58:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's fine so uh we're going to have to
 
01:58:56.510 --> 01:58:56.520 align:start position:0%
do that to make sure everybody gets a
 
01:58:59.790 --> 01:58:59.800 align:start position:0%
chance to speak uh so let's go right to
 
01:59:00.990 --> 01:59:01.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
01:59:04.550 --> 01:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
ulery is uh representative YY still here
 
01:59:15.629 --> 01:59:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:18.990 --> 01:59:19.000 align:start position:0%
is nowhere near as eloquent and I'll be
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
much more brief uh in listening to the
 
01:59:24.310 --> 01:59:24.320 align:start position:0%
testimony thus far there appears to be
 
01:59:27.629 --> 01:59:27.639 align:start position:0%
some confusion HB 264 regulates the
 
01:59:29.870 --> 01:59:29.880 align:start position:0%
delegates to a convention for the
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
purpose of proposing amendments does not
 
01:59:36.629 --> 01:59:36.639 align:start position:0%
establish or have any other except uh
 
01:59:39.750 --> 01:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
restriction on who is a delegate
 
01:59:43.189 --> 01:59:43.199 align:start position:0%
delegate uh also delegate selection is
 
01:59:46.510 --> 01:59:46.520 align:start position:0%
present is made by the body that is the
 
01:59:48.750 --> 01:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
general court in New Hampshire it may be
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
the legislature in Nebraska or Kansas
 
01:59:54.189 --> 01:59:54.199 align:start position:0%
whichever has a uni camera on one or the
 
01:59:56.430 --> 01:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
two bodies meeting together in joint
 
02:00:00.629 --> 02:00:00.639 align:start position:0%
convention in most cases and for most um
 
02:00:03.149 --> 02:00:03.159 align:start position:0%
application standard State
 
02:00:06.030 --> 02:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
compacts a Convention of states is not
 
02:00:08.310 --> 02:00:08.320 align:start position:0%
another form of government it is only a
 
02:00:12.910 --> 02:00:12.920 align:start position:0%
convention to propose substantially
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
similar proposals for example you have a
 
02:00:19.830 --> 02:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
soccer game if you have a soccer game
 
02:00:21.550 --> 02:00:21.560 align:start position:0%
you could bring a black and white ball
 
02:00:23.350 --> 02:00:23.360 align:start position:0%
you could bring a yellow and black ball
 
02:00:26.109 --> 02:00:26.119 align:start position:0%
you could bring a yellow and white ball
 
02:00:28.270 --> 02:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
but you're bringing a soccer ball you
 
02:00:29.669 --> 02:00:29.679 align:start position:0%
bring a
 
02:00:32.069 --> 02:00:32.079 align:start position:0%
football you're not ex unless you're
 
02:00:34.270 --> 02:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
playing Australian rules and we're not
 
02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:36.350 align:start position:0%
playing Australian rules and we're not
in

02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
Australia you're not going to be able to
 
02:00:41.069 --> 02:00:41.079 align:start position:0%
play the foot play in that game because
 
02:00:43.990 --> 02:00:44.000 align:start position:0%
you brought a football to a soccer game
 
02:00:46.430 --> 02:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
which is why the purpose of establishing
 
02:00:48.870 --> 02:00:48.880 align:start position:0%
the convention is is made by the
 
02:00:51.510 --> 02:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
legislature the miracle of Article 5 is
 
02:00:53.709 --> 02:00:53.719 align:start position:0%
that there is is a method for congress
 
02:00:56.270 --> 02:00:56.280 align:start position:0%
big government to propose
 
02:01:01.470 --> 02:01:01.480 align:start position:0%
amendments and for the other onethird of
 
02:01:04.390 --> 02:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
the federalism that is the state
 
02:01:06.790 --> 02:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
governments which are directly elected
 
02:01:07.950 --> 02:01:07.960 align:start position:0%
by the
 
02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
people to propose amendments to the
 
02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:13.189 align:start position:0%
people to propose amendments to the
foundation

02:01:13.189 --> 02:01:13.199 align:start position:0%
foundation
 
02:01:15.390 --> 02:01:15.400 align:start position:0%
document thank
 
02:01:18.229 --> 02:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
you thank you representative I'm not
 
02:01:20.790 --> 02:01:20.800 align:start position:0%
going to ask if everybody needs wants to
 
02:01:23.629 --> 02:01:23.639 align:start position:0%
ask a question if any rep or any uh
 
02:01:25.550 --> 02:01:25.560 align:start position:0%
member of the committee wants to ask a
 
02:01:27.270 --> 02:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
question go ahead and sound off if you
 
02:01:30.350 --> 02:01:30.360 align:start position:0%
have a Salient important question uh
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
please do otherwise uh we will uh try to
 
02:01:35.510 --> 02:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
let everybody have a chance to to weigh
 
02:01:38.470 --> 02:01:38.480 align:start position:0%
in uh representative Timothy Horan is
 
02:01:42.550 --> 02:01:42.560 align:start position:0%
here he opposes the bill uh welcome
 
02:01:42.560 --> 02:01:43.629 align:start position:0%
here he opposes the bill uh welcome
representative

02:01:43.629 --> 02:01:43.639 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:01:47.229 --> 02:01:47.239 align:start position:0%
Horan he opposes the resolution hcr3
 
02:01:50.030 --> 02:01:50.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a bill yes um so I'm I'm resent
 
02:01:51.910 --> 02:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
Timothy Timothy Horan from straford
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
County District 10 so Senator sanor
 
02:01:57.189 --> 02:01:57.199 align:start position:0%
that's a hard act to follow I've never
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
been a US senator or run for president
 
02:02:03.350 --> 02:02:03.360 align:start position:0%
or been a CNN commentator so uh I'm not
 
02:02:05.149 --> 02:02:05.159 align:start position:0%
not quite as polished as he is and
 
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
probably not even as polished as
 
02:02:09.910 --> 02:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
represent ery so um I mostly came here
 
02:02:12.589 --> 02:02:12.599 align:start position:0%
this morning to speak in favor of the
 
02:02:14.709 --> 02:02:14.719 align:start position:0%
next bill but this is a flip side of the
 
02:02:17.910 --> 02:02:17.920 align:start position:0%
same thing so I think uh a con you know
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
an article 5 constitutional convention
 
02:02:21.910 --> 02:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
is a bad idea I mean it probably doesn't
 
02:02:23.790 --> 02:02:23.800 align:start position:0%
not as bad given the chaos in Washington
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
DC you know it's better it's probably
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
better than trying to amend the
 
02:02:31.350 --> 02:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
Constitution by uh passing have the
 
02:02:34.069 --> 02:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
president signing executive orders but
 
02:02:36.990 --> 02:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a bad idea and as written this
 
02:02:40.069 --> 02:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
this um convention would inevitably
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
inevitably run away because it's uh
 
02:02:46.589 --> 02:02:46.599 align:start position:0%
scope is scope is so broad you know just
 
02:02:48.270 --> 02:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
about everything is related to something
 
02:02:51.189 --> 02:02:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's in that and we're talking about
 
02:02:52.870 --> 02:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the delegates selection process
 
02:02:54.830 --> 02:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
that's actually not for the states to
 
02:02:57.189 --> 02:02:57.199 align:start position:0%
determine the Congress will pass an
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
enabling act um they've never needed to
 
02:03:02.629 --> 02:03:02.639 align:start position:0%
uh send one to the president's desk but
 
02:03:04.510 --> 02:03:04.520 align:start position:0%
some have been considered in the past
 
02:03:06.069 --> 02:03:06.079 align:start position:0%
and they've always
 
02:03:08.390 --> 02:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's a good possibility they might
 
02:03:10.189 --> 02:03:10.199 align:start position:0%
have a direct election of of the
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
delegates and certainly the delegates
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
would have the same rights as a members
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
of Congress this convention would have
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
essentially be a third branch of a third
 
02:03:21.790 --> 02:03:21.800 align:start position:0%
congression a third chamber of Cong
 
02:03:22.830 --> 02:03:22.840 align:start position:0%
Congress so they would have the same
 
02:03:25.069 --> 02:03:25.079 align:start position:0%
rights that US Representative Senators
 
02:03:27.870 --> 02:03:27.880 align:start position:0%
do and that uh does not extend to the
 
02:03:29.390 --> 02:03:29.400 align:start position:0%
state being able to recall them if they
 
02:03:31.510 --> 02:03:31.520 align:start position:0%
vote the wrong way and thank you
 
02:03:33.030 --> 02:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative and we look forward to
 
02:03:35.069 --> 02:03:35.079 align:start position:0%
hearing you speak to the next measure
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
yeah uh once we get through this one
 
02:03:38.950 --> 02:03:38.960 align:start position:0%
yeah I have a hard stop at 12:30 so we
 
02:03:40.310 --> 02:03:40.320 align:start position:0%
may not get through them all but if
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
everybody keeps it to two minutes like
 
02:03:43.910 --> 02:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
I've just failed to do um I guess we'll
 
02:03:46.549 --> 02:03:46.559 align:start position:0%
be there by about noon so
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
thank uh honorable Scott Wallace former
 
02:03:51.149 --> 02:03:51.159 align:start position:0%
representative is in the house welcome
 
02:03:54.069 --> 02:03:54.079 align:start position:0%
back uh representative Wallace uh who
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:05.229 --> 02:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
measure thank you chairman Moffett
 
02:04:06.750 --> 02:04:06.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
02:04:08.950 --> 02:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
my name is Scott Wallace uh representing
 
02:04:10.350 --> 02:04:10.360 align:start position:0%
myself from the town of
 
02:04:12.669 --> 02:04:12.679 align:start position:0%
Danville um I'll read a little bit
 
02:04:15.229 --> 02:04:15.239 align:start position:0%
faster considering the time constraints
 
02:04:18.030 --> 02:04:18.040 align:start position:0%
hcr3 deserves your support an article 5
 
02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:19.719 align:start position:0%
convention is the people's way to amend
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
the US Constitution when a Runway
 
02:04:23.910 --> 02:04:23.920 align:start position:0%
Congress will not do its constitutional
 
02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:26.440 align:start position:0%
Duty historically Congress has refused
 
02:04:28.629 --> 02:04:28.639 align:start position:0%
to heal itself unless and until the
 
02:04:31.189 --> 02:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
people have made their discontent plane
 
02:04:33.069 --> 02:04:33.079 align:start position:0%
by aggregating sufficient support for
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
amening the US Constitution this is most
 
02:04:37.310 --> 02:04:37.320 align:start position:0%
effectively done by the aggregation of
 
02:04:39.109 --> 02:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
Article Five petitions from the several
 
02:04:41.390 --> 02:04:41.400 align:start position:0%
States I suggest that the people of New
 
02:04:42.750 --> 02:04:42.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in the United States spoke
 
02:04:45.189 --> 02:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
loud and clear of their desires to reign
 
02:04:47.030 --> 02:04:47.040 align:start position:0%
in a Runway Federal Leviathan by their
 
02:04:48.870 --> 02:04:48.880 align:start position:0%
choices at the ballot boxes last
 
02:04:50.950 --> 02:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
November the federal government uses
 
02:04:53.069 --> 02:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates to effectively control
 
02:04:55.069 --> 02:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
State legislatures local governments and
 
02:04:57.510 --> 02:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
we the people they insert themselves
 
02:04:59.830 --> 02:04:59.840 align:start position:0%
into America's most personal decisions
 
02:05:01.270 --> 02:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
and they have destroyed our nation's
 
02:05:03.790 --> 02:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
fiscal security New Hampshire has a
 
02:05:05.229 --> 02:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment petition
 
02:05:07.750 --> 02:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
waiting to be acted upon we are all well
 
02:05:09.790 --> 02:05:09.800 align:start position:0%
aware that the impending debt crisis is
 
02:05:11.790 --> 02:05:11.800 align:start position:0%
a Sword of Damocles hanging over
 
02:05:14.510 --> 02:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers heads it's time to bring their
 
02:05:16.229 --> 02:05:16.239 align:start position:0%
tyranny to an end and a Convention of
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
states is the way to do it we have long
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
talked about the split between the
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
establish establishment policy itics and
 
02:05:24.990 --> 02:05:25.000 align:start position:0%
agitators the agitators unseated former
 
02:05:26.629 --> 02:05:26.639 align:start position:0%
house Speaker McCarthy by supporting
 
02:05:28.750 --> 02:05:28.760 align:start position:0%
Mike Johnson given the establishment a
 
02:05:31.149 --> 02:05:31.159 align:start position:0%
painful lesson agitators will only be
 
02:05:33.870 --> 02:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
ignored for so long the American voters
 
02:05:35.390 --> 02:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
have just delivered part two of this
 
02:05:37.270 --> 02:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
lesson to the dumbstruck political
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
establishment for both parties part two
 
02:05:41.950 --> 02:05:41.960 align:start position:0%
is simple the class of agitators is much
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
larger than you thought we consist of
 
02:05:45.790 --> 02:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
workingclass Americans across the
 
02:05:47.830 --> 02:05:47.840 align:start position:0%
Nations and our patience has run
 
02:05:50.149 --> 02:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
out both parties are scrambling to
 
02:05:51.790 --> 02:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
figure out what the wave of populism
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
means for the future and what
 
02:05:54.870 --> 02:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
adjustments must be made in light of the
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
new political realities let's be honest
 
02:06:00.030 --> 02:06:00.040 align:start position:0%
District of Columbia politicians are
 
02:06:02.669 --> 02:06:02.679 align:start position:0%
more DC politicians than anything else
 
02:06:04.750 --> 02:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
the chances are extremely high they'll
 
02:06:07.189 --> 02:06:07.199 align:start position:0%
get it wrong if they get it at all here
 
02:06:08.870 --> 02:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
amongst the Grassroots is how elected
 
02:06:10.270 --> 02:06:10.280 align:start position:0%
officials in both the states and the
 
02:06:12.149 --> 02:06:12.159 align:start position:0%
federal government can get it right and
 
02:06:14.709 --> 02:06:14.719 align:start position:0%
why we must not get it wrong the
 
02:06:16.589 --> 02:06:16.599 align:start position:0%
American people want their power back
 
02:06:18.669 --> 02:06:18.679 align:start position:0%
passing hcr3 would be a step in that
 
02:06:20.870 --> 02:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
direction Mason had it right when he
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
included a way for the new PE for the
 
02:06:24.910 --> 02:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
people to reassert control of the
 
02:06:26.910 --> 02:06:26.920 align:start position:0%
federal government we know New
 
02:06:28.549 --> 02:06:28.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's people no longer trust their
 
02:06:30.270 --> 02:06:30.280 align:start position:0%
government at the federal level we want
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
to govern ourselves again at the state
 
02:06:34.149 --> 02:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
and local level we are tired of watching
 
02:06:35.950 --> 02:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
a money gobling District of Columbia
 
02:06:37.709 --> 02:06:37.719 align:start position:0%
machine crank out policies that don't
 
02:06:40.149 --> 02:06:40.159 align:start position:0%
work don't help and don't line up with
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
what the Constitution says the federal
 
02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
government should and should not be
 
02:06:47.109 --> 02:06:47.119 align:start position:0%
doing thank you uh Senator Senators
 
02:06:50.109 --> 02:06:50.119 align:start position:0%

02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
he's been involved with this before he's
 
02:07:16.270 --> 02:07:16.280 align:start position:0%
been here
 
02:07:20.270 --> 02:07:20.280 align:start position:0%

resolution the cosos resolution just
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to differ with Senator Santorum in

two places modest difference because we
 
02:08:07.750 --> 02:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly support this resolution
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
number one it would likely be uh deemed
 
02:08:14.990 --> 02:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
germine should a proposal come up to the
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
floor of an amending convention on the
 
02:08:20.350 --> 02:08:20.360 align:start position:0%
subject of limitation on federal power a
 
02:08:24.270 --> 02:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh a proposal to limit to allow State
 
02:08:27.589 --> 02:08:27.599 align:start position:0%
limitations on campaign money I also
 
02:08:29.510 --> 02:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
serve on the board of American promise

money limits bill so again right now the
 
02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:37.920 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court has ruled that the states
 
02:08:39.870 --> 02:08:39.880 align:start position:0%
do not have power to limit campaign
 
02:08:42.030 --> 02:08:42.040 align:start position:0%
money in most places uh except for
 
02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
direct contributions to candidates uh we
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
perceive that that would be
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
U deemed Germain on the floor of an
 
02:08:52.390 --> 02:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
amending conv vention under the
 
02:08:55.629 --> 02:08:55.639 align:start position:0%
limitations of federal power second um I
 
02:08:57.870 --> 02:08:57.880 align:start position:0%
think a uh fiscal responsibility
 
02:09:00.669 --> 02:09:00.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment would pass it's supported by
 
02:09:03.470 --> 02:09:03.480 align:start position:0%

problem in our government uh the polling
 
02:09:12.629 --> 02:09:12.639 align:start position:0%
shows this and while a balanced budget
 
02:09:16.430 --> 02:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
amendment might not pass a more flexible
 
02:09:18.830 --> 02:09:18.840 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility amendment that
 
02:09:20.549 --> 02:09:20.559 align:start position:0%
allows for the growth of the government
 
02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
Etc would likely pass thank

02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
resolution um you should pass or or U
 
02:09:49.709 --> 02:09:49.719 align:start position:0%
reject it based on your view of the
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
policies that it abdicates uh not based
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
on the Article 5 convention procedure
 
02:09:56.470 --> 02:09:56.480 align:start position:0%
itself um I want to offer myself up to
 
02:09:58.149 --> 02:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
the committee as uh one of the leading
 
02:09:59.990 --> 02:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
experts in the country on the convention
 
02:10:02.270 --> 02:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
process uh to help you understand that
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
aspect of it um there there are multiple
 
02:10:07.549 --> 02:10:07.559 align:start position:0%
Protections in this process there's
 
02:10:09.189 --> 02:10:09.199 align:start position:0%
roles to be played with the federalism
 
02:10:11.470 --> 02:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
and separation of power system designed
 
02:10:13.790 --> 02:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
by our Founders roles to be played for
 
02:10:16.189 --> 02:10:16.199 align:start position:0%
the Congress the courts the states and
 
02:10:19.470 --> 02:10:19.480 align:start position:0%
the delegates um each one of those uh
 
02:10:22.149 --> 02:10:22.159 align:start position:0%
have uh interplay between them creating
 
02:10:24.589 --> 02:10:24.599 align:start position:0%
numerous uh protections over this
 
02:10:27.870 --> 02:10:27.880 align:start position:0%
process uh ones Beyond those that were
 
02:10:30.629 --> 02:10:30.639 align:start position:0%
originally explicitly written in uh such
 
02:10:34.669 --> 02:10:34.679 align:start position:0%
as the um the uh ratification of three
 
02:10:38.069 --> 02:10:38.079 align:start position:0%
quarters um there and specifically as an
 
02:10:39.229 --> 02:10:39.239 align:start position:0%
example I want to speak to some of the
 
02:10:40.709 --> 02:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
things that have been brought off by
 
02:10:42.109 --> 02:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
representative C Burton uh
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd um when I in terms
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
of delegate selection and and
 
02:10:51.750 --> 02:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
regulations over them um the
 
02:10:55.270 --> 02:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
when uh when there was a ratif
 
02:10:56.990 --> 02:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
ratification convention for the 21st
 
02:10:59.470 --> 02:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
amendment uh none of the states had res
 
02:11:01.549 --> 02:11:01.559 align:start position:0%
had bills in place to choose their
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
delegates to those ratification
 
02:11:05.390 --> 02:11:05.400 align:start position:0%
conventions those were all passed very
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
quickly the whole process went off very
 
02:11:09.950 --> 02:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
easily it would be better if states did
 
02:11:11.750 --> 02:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
that in advance which is why I advocated
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
for such a bill that this committee and
 
02:11:15.669 --> 02:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
the house passed last year and I hope
 
02:11:18.430 --> 02:11:18.440 align:start position:0%
that the full uh body will pass that
 
02:11:21.629 --> 02:11:21.639 align:start position:0%
soon um but even without that that is
 
02:11:24.709 --> 02:11:24.719 align:start position:0%
still in place um in addition the
 
02:11:26.189 --> 02:11:26.199 align:start position:0%
delegates when they're chosen for
 
02:11:28.589 --> 02:11:28.599 align:start position:0%
specific purpose that does help add an
 
02:11:30.790 --> 02:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
additional level of protection that they
 
02:11:33.470 --> 02:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
will serve for that purpose it is an
 
02:11:35.229 --> 02:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
extra protection when that purpose is
 
02:11:37.270 --> 02:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance which is uh a
 
02:11:38.910 --> 02:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
protection that you get with the
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
resolution that Wolfpack advocates for
 
02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is not in place here then campaign
 
02:11:46.910 --> 02:11:46.920 align:start position:0%
Finance uh violations tend to hurt those
 
02:11:48.870 --> 02:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
people rather than help uh but it is
 
02:11:50.069 --> 02:11:50.079 align:start position:0%
still a protection that it's single
 
02:11:51.830 --> 02:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
subject and thank you for speaking to
 
02:11:53.310 --> 02:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative cyber representative
 
02:11:56.549 --> 02:11:56.559 align:start position:0%
Lloyd's uh question uh I have a quick
 
02:11:59.350 --> 02:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
one for you before you step away uh 21st
 
02:12:02.229 --> 02:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
Amendment rescinded the 18th Amendment
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
the prohibition one yes was there a
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
movement uh for a Convention of the
 
02:12:09.950 --> 02:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
states uh that led to the 21st amendment
 
02:12:12.589 --> 02:12:12.599 align:start position:0%
that maybe can you speak to that real
 
02:12:14.270 --> 02:12:14.280 align:start position:0%
quick or do you know yes yes the there
 
02:12:17.390 --> 02:12:17.400 align:start position:0%
was a a an effort to um get an article 5
 
02:12:19.830 --> 02:12:19.840 align:start position:0%
convention for that purpose it was not a
 
02:12:23.470 --> 02:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
significant part of it but was um it was
 
02:12:27.589 --> 02:12:27.599 align:start position:0%
I I advocated pretty um uh pretty well
 
02:12:30.549 --> 02:12:30.559 align:start position:0%
there there was at one point the um the
 
02:12:32.510 --> 02:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
representative in New York who uh who
 
02:12:34.750 --> 02:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
got it passed in New York um got a
 
02:12:37.270 --> 02:12:37.280 align:start position:0%
standing ovation when it was uh when
 
02:12:39.990 --> 02:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
they voted in favor of it um because the
 
02:12:42.069 --> 02:12:42.079 align:start position:0%
people were so in favor of it but
 
02:12:45.830 --> 02:12:45.840 align:start position:0%
ultimately um there was the way that
 
02:12:47.390 --> 02:12:47.400 align:start position:0%
that got passed was through a massive
 
02:12:50.350 --> 02:12:50.360 align:start position:0%
organizing effort uh primarily from a
 
02:12:52.229 --> 02:12:52.239 align:start position:0%
group called women's Organization for
 
02:12:54.430 --> 02:12:54.440 align:start position:0%
national prohibition reform and Wolfpack
 
02:12:56.629 --> 02:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
has learned a tremendous amount from
 
02:12:59.310 --> 02:12:59.320 align:start position:0%
that organization's history in terms of
 
02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
how we're redesigning our approach and
 
02:13:04.510 --> 02:13:04.520 align:start position:0%
trying to get the amendment through the
 
02:13:06.589 --> 02:13:06.599 align:start position:0%
use of the convention process as well as
 
02:13:09.189 --> 02:13:09.199 align:start position:0%

02:13:36.229 --> 02:13:36.239 align:start position:0%
Article 5 of the convention of States
 
02:13:37.910 --> 02:13:37.920 align:start position:0%
because I swore an oath to the whole
 
02:13:40.310 --> 02:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution and everything in
 
02:13:43.229 --> 02:13:43.239 align:start position:0%
it uh these words set the standard for
 
02:13:48.069 --> 02:13:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:50.470 --> 02:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
sorry a government instituted among men
 
02:13:52.470 --> 02:13:52.480 align:start position:0%
deres its Power by the consent of the
 
02:13:55.750 --> 02:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
people to be governed uh it's a contract
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
that the government shall preserve and
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
enforce the rights afforded to we the
 
02:14:00.109 --> 02:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
people of the United States the
 
02:14:01.589 --> 02:14:01.599 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence clearly
 
02:14:03.390 --> 02:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
states that whenever any form of
 
02:14:04.990 --> 02:14:05.000 align:start position:0%
government becomes destructed of these
 
02:14:06.589 --> 02:14:06.599 align:start position:0%
ends it is the right of the people to
 
02:14:08.470 --> 02:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
alter abolish it Institute new
 
02:14:10.910 --> 02:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
government these words set the standard
 
02:14:12.750 --> 02:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
for Liberty and freedom around the world
 
02:14:14.430 --> 02:14:14.440 align:start position:0%
these words filled me with a pride and
 
02:14:15.549 --> 02:14:15.559 align:start position:0%
courage when I shipped off to
 
02:14:18.149 --> 02:14:18.159 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan to defend the country uh to
 
02:14:19.910 --> 02:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
defend the nation in the time of need at
 
02:14:22.750 --> 02:14:22.760 align:start position:0%
the age of 18 it's a circumvention in
 
02:14:24.030 --> 02:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
disregard for the constitution of
 
02:14:25.350 --> 02:14:25.360 align:start position:0%
corruption within our government that is
 
02:14:27.830 --> 02:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
a problem and my concern the American
 
02:14:30.189 --> 02:14:30.199 align:start position:0%
people deserve better so to the families
 
02:14:31.510 --> 02:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
of those that gave the ultimate
 
02:14:33.470 --> 02:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
sacrifice for this nation my brothers
 
02:14:34.990 --> 02:14:35.000 align:start position:0%
and sisters and the arms that fought and
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
bled for two decades just to witness the
 
02:14:38.589 --> 02:14:38.599 align:start position:0%
abomination of the withdrawal from the
 
02:14:41.189 --> 02:14:41.199 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan we deserve a government that
 
02:14:43.109 --> 02:14:43.119 align:start position:0%
isn't so out of touch in respond to the
 
02:14:45.589 --> 02:14:45.599 align:start position:0%
people I support Article 5 convention
 
02:14:47.069 --> 02:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
States because it gives We the People a
 
02:14:48.790 --> 02:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
way to stifle this long too encroaching
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
tyranny it gives more power back to the
 
02:14:53.549 --> 02:14:53.559 align:start position:0%
States and the people and will be a
 
02:14:58.990 --> 02:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:00.750 --> 02:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
direction the authors of our
 
02:15:02.390 --> 02:15:02.400 align:start position:0%
constitution knew all too well of the
 
02:15:03.750 --> 02:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
dangers of the government obtaining too
 
02:15:05.109 --> 02:15:05.119 align:start position:0%
much power and that the people needed a
 
02:15:07.030 --> 02:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
recourse of action if this should arise
 
02:15:08.750 --> 02:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the future Article 5 was the only
 
02:15:10.950 --> 02:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that was unanimously adopted
 
02:15:13.470 --> 02:15:13.480 align:start position:0%
by the authors some of you served in the
 
02:15:15.910 --> 02:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
military and I also you also took the
 
02:15:18.470 --> 02:15:18.480 align:start position:0%
same moth I did to our
 
02:15:21.350 --> 02:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
constitution so once again do we take an
 
02:15:23.310 --> 02:15:23.320 align:start position:0%
oath to our constitution with everything
 
02:15:25.790 --> 02:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
in it or do we just pick and choose what
 
02:15:29.069 --> 02:15:29.079 align:start position:0%
amendments that we support we the people
 
02:15:30.750 --> 02:15:30.760 align:start position:0%
that are already aware they understand
 
02:15:32.750 --> 02:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
and understand Article 5 want it and we
 
02:15:34.069 --> 02:15:34.079 align:start position:0%
are asking for you to pass this to the
 
02:15:36.310 --> 02:15:36.320 align:start position:0%

Chester I'm here today to express my
 
02:16:50.070 --> 02:16:50.080 align:start position:0%
deep concern for this nation's future
 
02:16:51.669 --> 02:16:51.679 align:start position:0%
our federal government has gone out of
 
02:16:53.389 --> 02:16:53.399 align:start position:0%
control and if not corrected will soon
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
end in Failure Article 5 of the US
 
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
Constitution is the only process to fix
 
02:17:00.469 --> 02:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
this problem Article 5 allows the states
 
02:17:02.030 --> 02:17:02.040 align:start position:0%
to propose amendments that will limit
 
02:17:03.790 --> 02:17:03.800 align:start position:0%
government overreach federal debt and
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
impose term limits on Congress when the
 
02:17:08.190 --> 02:17:08.200 align:start position:0%
Constitution was written elected
 
02:17:09.750 --> 02:17:09.760 align:start position:0%
officials were expected to be General
 
02:17:11.349 --> 02:17:11.359 align:start position:0%
citizens who would represent their
 
02:17:13.429 --> 02:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
communities over time Congress has
 
02:17:15.190 --> 02:17:15.200 align:start position:0%
become a place to make a career rather
 
02:17:16.790 --> 02:17:16.800 align:start position:0%
than to Serve the
 
02:17:19.309 --> 02:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
People additionally the Constitution was
 
02:17:21.469 --> 02:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
formed with the idea of many bodies of
 
02:17:22.910 --> 02:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
government however the federal
 
02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
government constantly takes power away
 
02:17:27.110 --> 02:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
from the states furthermore the national
 
02:17:29.070 --> 02:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
debt has scaled to stagger in 36
 
02:17:30.990 --> 02:17:31.000 align:start position:0%
trillion climbing at a rate of $1
 
02:17:33.990 --> 02:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
million every 20 seconds if broken down
 
02:17:35.790 --> 02:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
by state New Hampshire alone would owe
 
02:17:38.669 --> 02:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
728 b400
 
02:17:41.349 --> 02:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
million Daniel Webster stated there's no
 
02:17:43.030 --> 02:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
Nation on Earth powerful enough to
 
02:17:45.230 --> 02:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
accomplish our overthrow our destruction
 
02:17:46.669 --> 02:17:46.679 align:start position:0%
should it come at all will be from
 
02:17:48.669 --> 02:17:48.679 align:start position:0%
another quarter from the inattention of
 
02:17:50.110 --> 02:17:50.120 align:start position:0%
the people to the concerns of their
 
02:17:52.230 --> 02:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
government from their carelessness and
 
02:17:54.389 --> 02:17:54.399 align:start position:0%
negligence he referred to the government
 
02:17:56.070 --> 02:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
as the people's government made for the
 
02:17:58.190 --> 02:17:58.200 align:start position:0%
people made by the people and answerable
 
02:18:00.309 --> 02:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
to the people it is time that we the
 
02:18:02.589 --> 02:18:02.599 align:start position:0%
people make Washington answer to us our
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
founding fathers knew that the federal
 
02:18:05.709 --> 02:18:05.719 align:start position:0%
government would grow too large and
 
02:18:07.309 --> 02:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
eventually no longer care about its
 
02:18:09.230 --> 02:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
residents that is why they gave us
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
Article 5 so we could prevent it from
 
02:18:11.040 --> 02:18:13.190 align:start position:0%
Article 5 so we could prevent it from
becoming

02:18:13.190 --> 02:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
becoming
 
02:18:16.030 --> 02:18:16.040 align:start position:0%

02:18:43.270 --> 02:18:43.280 align:start position:0%
took place
 
02:18:47.389 --> 02:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
today the Constitution is very well
 
02:18:50.110 --> 02:18:50.120 align:start position:0%
organized and the first 4,000 words talk
 
02:18:52.110 --> 02:18:52.120 align:start position:0%

Article Five Article 5 is only one
 
02:19:02.309 --> 02:19:02.319 align:start position:0%
sentence long it's the only part of the
 
02:19:05.150 --> 02:19:05.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution where the state legislature
 
02:19:08.230 --> 02:19:08.240 align:start position:0%

02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
inali rights they too will receive that
 
02:22:18.510 --> 02:22:18.520 align:start position:0%

02:22:20.510 --> 02:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
know what you knew when you passed HC
 
02:22:23.590 --> 02:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
cr3 that article 5 is the only way to
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
return the federal government to its
 
02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:26.349 align:start position:0%
return the federal government to its
jurisdictional

02:22:26.349 --> 02:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
jurisdictional
 
02:22:29.670 --> 02:22:29.680 align:start position:0%
Lane I gave you guys a packet and it's
 
02:22:32.670 --> 02:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
very uh information to help support you
 
02:22:35.150 --> 02:22:35.160 align:start position:0%
and your constituents feel free to share
 
02:22:36.910 --> 02:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
it with your seatmates in legislative
 
02:22:38.429 --> 02:22:38.439 align:start position:0%
Hall and with your Senator friends
 
02:22:39.870 --> 02:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
across the aisle and if you need any
 
02:22:42.349 --> 02:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
more don't hesitate to ask the first one
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
is about the map of the 19 states that
 
02:22:45.630 --> 02:22:45.640 align:start position:0%
have pass the exact resolution that
 
02:22:47.550 --> 02:22:47.560 align:start position:0%
you're looking at today it shows the
 
02:22:49.389 --> 02:22:49.399 align:start position:0%
people that voted and you can see that
 
02:22:52.750 --> 02:22:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's evidence of the nonpartisan support
 
02:22:54.990 --> 02:22:55.000 align:start position:0%
this information supports that you what
 
02:22:56.790 --> 02:22:56.800 align:start position:0%
you are living up to your constituents
 
02:22:58.830 --> 02:22:58.840 align:start position:0%
expectations shown that the last
 
02:23:00.870 --> 02:23:00.880 align:start position:0%
presidential election the people don't
 
02:23:03.830 --> 02:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
want a party they want a political
 
02:23:07.750 --> 02:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
All-American policy that benefits
 
02:23:09.830 --> 02:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
everyone next is the double-sided
 
02:23:11.910 --> 02:23:11.920 align:start position:0%
document showing those 42 Interstate
 
02:23:13.830 --> 02:23:13.840 align:start position:0%
conventions and it's showing the
 
02:23:16.070 --> 02:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
evidence of why the founders did not
 
02:23:18.510 --> 02:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
write the how-tos of all the details of
 
02:23:20.110 --> 02:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
Article 5 just like they didn't write
 
02:23:22.790 --> 02:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
the how choose on the trial by juries
 
02:23:24.030 --> 02:23:24.040 align:start position:0%
they knew how to run Interstate
 
02:23:26.309 --> 02:23:26.319 align:start position:0%
conventions just like we know how to run
 
02:23:28.710 --> 02:23:28.720 align:start position:0%
them today there's some court cases so
 
02:23:30.030 --> 02:23:30.040 align:start position:0%
you can see how that's been all worked
 
02:23:32.389 --> 02:23:32.399 align:start position:0%
out with how the usage of Article 5 is
 
02:23:33.670 --> 02:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
and then there of course is the history
 
02:23:34.870 --> 02:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
of the calls and commissions of the
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
original Constitutional Convention of
 
02:23:39.230 --> 02:23:39.240 align:start position:0%
1787 and of course as a bonus I gave you
 
02:23:41.630 --> 02:23:41.640 align:start position:0%
an outline of the Constitution at a
 
02:23:43.349 --> 02:23:43.359 align:start position:0%
glance because that's helpful to keep on
 
02:23:45.429 --> 02:23:45.439 align:start position:0%
hand thank you for always remembering
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
that United as a New Hampshire
 
02:23:49.710 --> 02:23:49.720 align:start position:0%
legislator your only function is to
 
02:23:52.950 --> 02:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
protect and Def defend your constituents
 
02:23:56.510 --> 02:23:56.520 align:start position:0%
unenumerated inali rights passing HDR 3
 
02:23:58.510 --> 02:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
is one way to fulfill that mission I
 
02:24:00.070 --> 02:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
look forward to the fruits of any
 
02:24:01.870 --> 02:24:01.880 align:start position:0%
proposals returning to the word smithing
 
02:24:03.990 --> 02:24:04.000 align:start position:0%
convention for your ratification and I'm
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%

will not only restore the structural
 
02:24:09.870 --> 02:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
boundaries of the federal government for
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%

02:24:23.870 --> 02:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
reference to Civics education I think
 
02:24:25.950 --> 02:24:25.960 align:start position:0%
this whole hearing has been I think a
 
02:24:29.550 --> 02:24:29.560 align:start position:0%
wonderful civics lesson for for the uh
 
02:24:31.389 --> 02:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
many people that are watching who and
 
02:24:36.550 --> 02:24:36.560 align:start position:0%
who will watch okay Margaret
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
Tully welcome Margaret Miss telly from
 
02:24:42.790 --> 02:24:42.800 align:start position:0%
Manchester correct correct supporting
 
02:24:46.230 --> 02:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
the measure yes and today what I'd like
 
02:24:48.269 --> 02:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
to talk about is the character of the
 
02:24:50.750 --> 02:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
people today and can it measure up to
 
02:24:52.830 --> 02:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
the founders and the framers of the
 
02:24:54.670 --> 02:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution and the greatest people in
 
02:24:56.190 --> 02:24:56.200 align:start position:0%
the world have all risen from humble
 
02:24:58.950 --> 02:24:58.960 align:start position:0%
beginnings and we have Abraham Lincoln
 
02:25:00.870 --> 02:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
and Abraham Lincoln's father had no idea
 
02:25:02.349 --> 02:25:02.359 align:start position:0%
that Abraham Lincoln would be Abraham
 
02:25:06.750 --> 02:25:06.760 align:start position:0%
Lincoln nor did Susan B Anthony's mother
 
02:25:09.110 --> 02:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
expect her to be Susan B Anthony or
 
02:25:11.630 --> 02:25:11.640 align:start position:0%
Martin Luther King's father or mother
 
02:25:14.349 --> 02:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
expect them to be so great so I don't
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
want anybody to say that the character
 
02:25:17.590 --> 02:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the people today aren't what the
 
02:25:19.590 --> 02:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
character used to be and the second
 
02:25:21.190 --> 02:25:21.200 align:start position:0%
thing I'd like to talk about about is
 
02:25:23.790 --> 02:25:23.800 align:start position:0%
the ultimate sacrifice and when all of
 
02:25:26.469 --> 02:25:26.479 align:start position:0%
us are stepping up in order to do great
 
02:25:29.469 --> 02:25:29.479 align:start position:0%
things um one of them is the Veterans
 
02:25:31.710 --> 02:25:31.720 align:start position:0%
and whenever we pass a grave there's you
 
02:25:33.790 --> 02:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
know the flags flying over that or you
 
02:25:35.910 --> 02:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
know placed on that grave and they gave
 
02:25:37.590 --> 02:25:37.600 align:start position:0%
the ultimate sacrifice and they didn't
 
02:25:39.429 --> 02:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
pick and choose what part of the
 
02:25:42.630 --> 02:25:42.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution they were going to endorse
 
02:25:47.510 --> 02:25:47.520 align:start position:0%
and I think when I think that's a very
 
02:25:51.790 --> 02:25:51.800 align:start position:0%
um precedent to as go forward and the
 
02:25:53.110 --> 02:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
other thing that I want to talk about
 
02:25:55.710 --> 02:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
which is something that just recently um
 
02:25:58.389 --> 02:25:58.399 align:start position:0%
happened is we don't know who's going to
 
02:26:00.790 --> 02:26:00.800 align:start position:0%
come into the world and change the world
 
02:26:03.030 --> 02:26:03.040 align:start position:0%
and I really want to talk about a bishop
 
02:26:05.870 --> 02:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
um he's an Archbishop um Fulton Sheen
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
and he died in 1979 and he was a bishop
 
02:26:11.190 --> 02:26:11.200 align:start position:0%
out of New York and he um had a
 
02:26:12.309 --> 02:26:12.319 align:start position:0%
television show I don't know if
 
02:26:14.870 --> 02:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
everybody remembers who he is but I grew
 
02:26:18.630 --> 02:26:18.640 align:start position:0%
up with him and recently he has been on
 
02:26:21.269 --> 02:26:21.279 align:start position:0%
his way to his sainthood and with that
 
02:26:22.830 --> 02:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
you have your first miracle and there's
 
02:26:24.269 --> 02:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
three Miracles that you have to do to
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
become a saint so the first miracle was
 
02:26:28.910 --> 02:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
a baby born in Southern Illinois which
 
02:26:31.590 --> 02:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
is where he was from and with that the
 
02:26:34.269 --> 02:26:34.279 align:start position:0%
baby was born still born or the or the
 
02:26:35.550 --> 02:26:35.560 align:start position:0%
umbilical cord was around her neck
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of different stories
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
but the baby was um 61 minutes dead and
 
02:26:43.429 --> 02:26:43.439 align:start position:0%
it came back to life and so that is what
 
02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
made him become uh vener going past the
 
02:26:50.030 --> 02:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
first thing of a saint so I just want to
 
02:26:51.870 --> 02:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
say and that's in our you know we

remember who he is so I just want to say
 
02:26:55.830 --> 02:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
we just don't know who's coming down the
 
02:26:57.670 --> 02:26:57.680 align:start position:0%

entrenchment in Washington

02:30:11.469 --> 02:30:11.479 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman New Hampshire was the ninth
 
02:30:13.349 --> 02:30:13.359 align:start position:0%
state to ratify the US Constitution
 
02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
which made it in force for the first
 
02:30:18.389 --> 02:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
nine states I'd like New Hampshire to be
 
02:30:21.070 --> 02:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
a part of this historic
 
02:30:23.230 --> 02:30:23.240 align:start position:0%

has already been covered so I'd just
 
02:31:10.710 --> 02:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
like to say that I believe that as
 
02:31:13.550 --> 02:31:13.560 align:start position:0%
Citizens we have a duty to course
 
02:31:15.710 --> 02:31:15.720 align:start position:0%

02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
the federal government and as our
 
02:31:20.590 --> 02:31:20.600 align:start position:0%
Representatives we pass that Duty on to
 
02:31:23.429 --> 02:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
you we ask that you vote favorably on a
 
02:31:25.830 --> 02:31:25.840 align:start position:0%

from New Hampshire to participate in a
 
02:31:31.309 --> 02:31:31.319 align:start position:0%
50-state conversation on how we can
 
02:31:33.550 --> 02:31:33.560 align:start position:0%
amend the Constitution to reign in the
 
02:31:36.550 --> 02:31:36.560 align:start position:0%
federal government's overreach restrain
 
02:31:39.269 --> 02:31:39.279 align:start position:0%
it financially and enact term limits
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
wherever they may be
 
02:31:43.309 --> 02:31:43.319 align:start position:0%
warranted uh we respectfully request
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%

patience I'm trying uh to avoid
 
02:32:32.630 --> 02:32:32.640 align:start position:0%
repeating because I'm sure you've been
 
02:32:34.790 --> 02:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
hearing many of the same uh points over
 
02:32:36.910 --> 02:32:36.920 align:start position:0%
and over my name is John loose I'm a
 
02:32:39.070 --> 02:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
volunteer I'm now the director of
 
02:32:40.910 --> 02:32:40.920 align:start position:0%
Convention of States action in New
 
02:32:43.349 --> 02:32:43.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh and I do not claim to be an
 
02:32:46.190 --> 02:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
expert on this topic uh I am pretty
 
02:32:48.309 --> 02:32:48.319 align:start position:0%
passionate about the topic and I'm
 
02:32:51.110 --> 02:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
cramming like I'm expecting a big exam
 
02:32:52.830 --> 02:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
tomorrow to be able to learn more and
 
02:32:54.309 --> 02:32:54.319 align:start position:0%
more about this this has been a great
 
02:32:57.830 --> 02:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
Civics uh uh lesson so I want to just uh
 
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
Begin by reading what the late Senator
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
Tom Coburn who was a big supporter of
 
02:33:05.790 --> 02:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
convention States said um and he by the
 
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
way was somebody who reached across the
 
02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
aisle he had friends on on each side of
 
02:33:11.790 --> 02:33:11.800 align:start position:0%
the aisle if there's one thing that
 
02:33:14.349 --> 02:33:14.359 align:start position:0%
Americans have always agreed on it said
 
02:33:16.830 --> 02:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
government functions best when decisions
 
02:33:20.590 --> 02:33:20.600 align:start position:0%
are made closest to the people
 
02:33:22.429 --> 02:33:22.439 align:start position:0%
and he says only through a Convention of
 
02:33:24.590 --> 02:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
States May the clear unfettered voice of
 
02:33:26.950 --> 02:33:26.960 align:start position:0%
the people be heard and overreaching
 
02:33:30.349 --> 02:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
government be reigned in so you all are
 
02:33:33.469 --> 02:33:33.479 align:start position:0%
the closest to the people and one of the
 
02:33:36.150 --> 02:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
reasons why I think this is uh to be
 
02:33:41.349 --> 02:33:41.359 align:start position:0%
past hcr3 is because you actually are
 
02:33:43.510 --> 02:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
are so close your constituents can
 
02:33:45.950 --> 02:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
actually meet with you uh they can talk
 
02:33:48.429 --> 02:33:48.439 align:start position:0%
to you you're interacting with them uh
 
02:33:50.910 --> 02:33:50.920 align:start position:0%
there's a great deal of advantage to
 
02:33:53.269 --> 02:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
that and Convention of states is
 
02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:56.160 align:start position:0%
basically we're a big tent I we're a
 
02:33:57.910 --> 02:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
Grassroots Movement we have 5 million
 
02:34:00.070 --> 02:34:00.080 align:start position:0%
people across the across the entire
 
02:34:02.670 --> 02:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
country uh there's over 16 or excuse me
 
02:34:05.110 --> 02:34:05.120 align:start position:0%
there about 16,000 petition signers in
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire alone uh so you can see
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
the level of support that we've got and
 
02:34:12.389 --> 02:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
I think that I'm not going to review any
 
02:34:14.389 --> 02:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
of the stuff that we've gone over uh we
 
02:34:16.030 --> 02:34:16.040 align:start position:0%
are concerned about the imperial
 
02:34:18.469 --> 02:34:18.479 align:start position:0%
presidency that's going on uh that's
 
02:34:21.070 --> 02:34:21.080 align:start position:0%
acred powers and we see all these edicts
 
02:34:22.469 --> 02:34:22.479 align:start position:0%
that are being issued it doesn't make
 
02:34:23.429 --> 02:34:23.439 align:start position:0%
any difference whether you're a
 
02:34:25.790 --> 02:34:25.800 align:start position:0%
Republican or a Democrat we know that in
 
02:34:28.110 --> 02:34:28.120 align:start position:0%
four years time that can be reversed
 
02:34:31.710 --> 02:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
very quickly 180 degrees uh so that's
 
02:34:33.750 --> 02:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons why we need to have
 
02:34:36.349 --> 02:34:36.359 align:start position:0%
something like a Convention of States
 
02:34:38.230 --> 02:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
now I passed this out to some of you I'm
 
02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
not sure if you all have this but there
 
02:34:42.510 --> 02:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
was a national poll and I think this is
 
02:34:45.030 --> 02:34:45.040 align:start position:0%
really important for you to understand
 
02:34:48.150 --> 02:34:48.160 align:start position:0%
uh first of all 68% of Americans back a
 
02:34:49.790 --> 02:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
meeting of the states to propose
 
02:34:52.349 --> 02:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
amendments for fiscal responsibility
 
02:34:54.750 --> 02:34:54.760 align:start position:0%
limits on federal power and term limits
 
02:34:54.760 --> 02:34:55.630 align:start position:0%
limits on federal power and term limits
that's

02:34:55.630 --> 02:34:55.640 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:34:59.870 --> 02:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
68% 59% of Americans trust state
 
02:35:02.429 --> 02:35:02.439 align:start position:0%
legislators more than Congress that's
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
you they trust you because you are close
 
02:35:08.269 --> 02:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
to them and therefore uh actually I
 
02:35:11.990 --> 02:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
think Congress only has like a 17% uh uh
 
02:35:14.830 --> 02:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh approval rating 71% of Americans
 
02:35:16.590 --> 02:35:16.600 align:start position:0%
believe additional limits on federal
 
02:35:19.870 --> 02:35:19.880 align:start position:0%
power are needed 88% of Americans can
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
support term limits for career
 
02:35:24.150 --> 02:35:24.160 align:start position:0%
politicians that's what got me
 
02:35:26.710 --> 02:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
involved and if you look at the voter
 
02:35:29.230 --> 02:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
breakdown on this particular poll and I
 
02:35:31.550 --> 02:35:31.560 align:start position:0%
will be happy to pass this out to you
 
02:35:34.110 --> 02:35:34.120 align:start position:0%
it's uh 38%
 
02:35:36.910 --> 02:35:36.920 align:start position:0%
Democrats 37%
 
02:35:39.309 --> 02:35:39.319 align:start position:0%
Republicans 18%
 
02:35:41.590 --> 02:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
Independents 7%
 
02:35:45.230 --> 02:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
unaffiliated so we're a big tent I think
 
02:35:47.990 --> 02:35:48.000 align:start position:0%
uh we have to try to strive to
 
02:35:50.429 --> 02:35:50.439 align:start position:0%
meet common ground
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
and I do request uh that we respectfully
 
02:35:55.790 --> 02:35:55.800 align:start position:0%
request that you pass this application
 
02:35:57.349 --> 02:35:57.359 align:start position:0%
out of committee for full vote of the
 
02:35:59.349 --> 02:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
house we see it as critical for this
 
02:36:00.710 --> 02:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
committee to not restrict our
 
02:36:02.950 --> 02:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights without a debate
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%

hcr3 hi thank you after so many of my
 
02:36:47.110 --> 02:36:47.120 align:start position:0%
team members have hit home runs I feel
 
02:36:50.030 --> 02:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
like Pedro Martinez taking a net bat
 
02:36:53.469 --> 02:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
in any event uh I'm a retired physician
 
02:36:56.469 --> 02:36:56.479 align:start position:0%
and uh as a physician we have to take an
 
02:36:59.710 --> 02:36:59.720 align:start position:0%
oath uh when we graduate it's called the
 
02:36:59.720 --> 02:37:00.830 align:start position:0%
oath uh when we graduate it's called the
hypocritic

02:37:00.830 --> 02:37:00.840 align:start position:0%
hypocritic
 
02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
oath and uh and one of the most
 
02:37:07.429 --> 02:37:07.439 align:start position:0%
important admonitions of that oath is Do
 
02:37:07.439 --> 02:37:08.389 align:start position:0%
important admonitions of that oath is Do
no

02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
no
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
harm and uh the way I've looked at uh
 
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
Article Five it's I see it as a tool as
 
02:37:18.670 --> 02:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
a remedy and it's clear that there are
 
02:37:21.190 --> 02:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
uh many many signs and symptoms in our
 
02:37:24.150 --> 02:37:24.160 align:start position:0%
society today in the economy where there
 
02:37:27.469 --> 02:37:27.479 align:start position:0%
is uh significant males and I see
 
02:37:31.510 --> 02:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
Article 5 as a uh a remedy and I'm
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
hoping to appeal to your uh sense of
 
02:37:35.670 --> 02:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
Ethics because I know you all swear to
 
02:37:38.110 --> 02:37:38.120 align:start position:0%
the constitution of New Hampshire and to
 
02:37:41.950 --> 02:37:41.960 align:start position:0%
the United States and uh I'm hoping that
 
02:37:44.670 --> 02:37:44.680 align:start position:0%
in your decision you
 
02:37:49.110 --> 02:37:49.120 align:start position:0%
examine uh Article 5 as as its uh tool
 
02:37:51.429 --> 02:37:51.439 align:start position:0%
function and as a remedial remedy
 
02:37:55.309 --> 02:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
function in trying to uh help address
 
02:37:59.190 --> 02:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
these uh males in the economy and in the
 
02:38:02.630 --> 02:38:02.640 align:start position:0%

ability to discuss pros and cons on
 
02:38:51.630 --> 02:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
things and it's part of not only why
 
02:38:54.190 --> 02:38:54.200 align:start position:0%
we're in New Hampshire but also
 
02:38:57.790 --> 02:38:57.800 align:start position:0%
America so I have been uh listening
 
02:38:59.710 --> 02:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
carefully to the previous
 
02:39:02.510 --> 02:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
testimony um from the various folks that
 
02:39:05.590 --> 02:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
have been here and I don't really have
 
02:39:07.870 --> 02:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
much to say just to fill in a couple of
 
02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:08.910 align:start position:0%
much to say just to fill in a couple of
little

02:39:08.910 --> 02:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
little
 
02:39:11.269 --> 02:39:11.279 align:start position:0%
gaps first of all representative
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
belshire you have
 
02:39:18.070 --> 02:39:18.080 align:start position:0%
10% of all of the Committee Member
 
02:39:19.990 --> 02:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
constituent petitions
 
02:39:21.190 --> 02:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
are in your
 
02:39:23.309 --> 02:39:23.319 align:start position:0%
District okay there are others that are
 
02:39:25.630 --> 02:39:25.640 align:start position:0%
higher but you have
 
02:39:29.670 --> 02:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
10% um I don't know I really hope that
 
02:39:31.950 --> 02:39:31.960 align:start position:0%
when I hit the submit button yesterday
 
02:39:34.550 --> 02:39:34.560 align:start position:0%
for my five pages that it actually got
 
02:39:36.630 --> 02:39:36.640 align:start position:0%
to you because the I it came I may have
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
hit the button twice and the error
 
02:39:41.030 --> 02:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
message came up saying you've already
 
02:39:44.110 --> 02:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
submitted and it's like I didn't get
 
02:39:46.070 --> 02:39:46.080 align:start position:0%
anything that said that I had submitted
 
02:39:47.510 --> 02:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
except the error that it didn't so if
 
02:39:49.870 --> 02:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
you do not have the five page
 
02:39:53.309 --> 02:39:53.319 align:start position:0%
I can easily send a PDF or airdrop it to
 
02:39:56.710 --> 02:39:56.720 align:start position:0%
a phone there's a lot of really good
 
02:39:58.870 --> 02:39:58.880 align:start position:0%
information in here that's good for
 
02:40:02.150 --> 02:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
review between now and executive session
 
02:40:05.469 --> 02:40:05.479 align:start position:0%
and also to ask subsequent questions
 
02:40:09.790 --> 02:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
okay so Linda used the term conversation
 
02:40:11.590 --> 02:40:11.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm thinking maybe we could make it
 
02:40:14.550 --> 02:40:14.560 align:start position:0%
Article 5 conversation of States because
 
02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
they use the word convention back in the
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
1700s to say it's a meeting
 
02:40:24.070 --> 02:40:24.080 align:start position:0%
and so I like conversation of States um
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
this is I'm a Undeclared voter in New
 
02:40:29.950 --> 02:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a lot of
 
02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
reasons I feel that this is possibly the
 
02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:34.429 align:start position:0%
reasons I feel that this is possibly the
most

02:40:34.429 --> 02:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
most
 
02:40:38.190 --> 02:40:38.200 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan effort that could be
 
02:40:41.910 --> 02:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
hitting the United States because it
 
02:40:45.150 --> 02:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
solves problems for both sides it it
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
comes to compromise and anybody that
 
02:40:50.309 --> 02:40:50.319 align:start position:0%
that goes into a legisl
 
02:40:51.990 --> 02:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
knows that you really can't get anything
 
02:40:53.230 --> 02:40:53.240 align:start position:0%
done without
 
02:40:56.349 --> 02:40:56.359 align:start position:0%
compromise and when I referred to the
 
02:40:56.359 --> 02:40:57.830 align:start position:0%
compromise and when I referred to the
previous

02:40:57.830 --> 02:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
previous
 
02:41:02.349 --> 02:41:02.359 align:start position:0%
uh uh mention of Charles pikney Pinkney
 
02:41:04.309 --> 02:41:04.319 align:start position:0%
it originally started May 29th the
 
02:41:05.910 --> 02:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
ascent of the legislature of States
 
02:41:07.790 --> 02:41:07.800 align:start position:0%
shall be sufficient to invest future
 
02:41:10.269 --> 02:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
additional powers in Us in
 
02:41:13.630 --> 02:41:13.640 align:start position:0%
c. do which is in Congress assembled and
 
02:41:16.030 --> 02:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
shall bind the whole Confederacy so that
 
02:41:17.630 --> 02:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
was end of May
 
02:41:20.150 --> 02:41:20.160 align:start position:0%
1787 when we get to June is when
 
02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton comes in and says no
 
02:41:24.710 --> 02:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
it's got to be Congress so they added
 
02:41:28.349 --> 02:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
Congress to it and then they compromised
 
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
as part of the debate process leading
 
02:41:33.429 --> 02:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
into September September 10th is when
 
02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
George Mason who was twice as old as
 
02:41:40.150 --> 02:41:40.160 align:start position:0%
James Madison at the time so picture
 
02:41:42.630 --> 02:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
that James Madison's
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
26 comes up and says okay well let's put
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
this in let's put the or and have the
 
02:41:51.070 --> 02:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
state as part of it so that's a big one
 
02:41:53.590 --> 02:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
one state one voice I'm sorry one state
 
02:41:57.510 --> 02:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
one vote 17th amendment I look at needs
 
02:42:01.550 --> 02:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
to be repealed personally but we what
 
02:42:02.870 --> 02:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
the original plan was It was supposed to
 
02:42:05.110 --> 02:42:05.120 align:start position:0%
be the ambassador representing the state
 
02:42:06.870 --> 02:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire to the government of
 
02:42:10.389 --> 02:42:10.399 align:start position:0%
the United States last Point checks and
 
02:42:13.630 --> 02:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
balances so we have legislative branch
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
can impeach the executive the executive
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
can veto to check the legislature and
 
02:42:21.510 --> 02:42:21.520 align:start position:0%
judici can strike down
 
02:42:24.590 --> 02:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
legislation and this is absolutely
 
02:42:28.269 --> 02:42:28.279 align:start position:0%
critical um the the framers and the
 
02:42:30.030 --> 02:42:30.040 align:start position:0%
ratifiers chose you the state
 
02:42:31.590 --> 02:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
legislatures to break glass and
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
emergencies somebody used my term before
 
02:42:35.269 --> 02:42:35.279 align:start position:0%
James Madison Benjamin Franklin
 
02:42:37.150 --> 02:42:37.160 align:start position:0%
Alexander Hamilton George Mason and yes
 
02:42:40.670 --> 02:42:40.680 align:start position:0%
the other George Washington bestowed on
 
02:42:43.790 --> 02:42:43.800 align:start position:0%
you our state legislator legislators the
 
02:42:45.550 --> 02:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
power and influence to apply for a
 
02:42:47.950 --> 02:42:47.960 align:start position:0%
convention for proposing amendments I
 
02:42:50.349 --> 02:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
hope you vote in favor of H R3 and I
 
02:42:53.110 --> 02:42:53.120 align:start position:0%
hope we get an ability to share this
 
02:42:56.230 --> 02:42:56.240 align:start position:0%
with the rest of the body um in the
 
02:42:58.429 --> 02:42:58.439 align:start position:0%

committee prepping for today and I did
 
02:43:08.469 --> 02:43:08.479 align:start position:0%

format so that everybody can have know
 
02:43:14.790 --> 02:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
how to go online to see uh who who has
 
02:43:17.309 --> 02:43:17.319 align:start position:0%

house concurrent resolution number five
 
02:44:44.590 --> 02:44:44.600 align:start position:0%
resending house concurrent resolution
 
02:44:46.710 --> 02:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
number 40 passed by the 2012 New
 
02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General Court asking that
 
02:44:50.030 --> 02:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
Congress call and Convention under
 
02:44:51.670 --> 02:44:51.680 align:start position:0%
Article 5 of the United States
 
02:44:54.910 --> 02:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution this bill is a refile of
 
02:44:56.750 --> 02:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
last year's house concurrent resolution
 
02:44:58.990 --> 02:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
number n which passed the house we
 
02:45:00.349 --> 02:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
anticipate that this would pass the
 
02:45:02.349 --> 02:45:02.359 align:start position:0%
house again this year and we just need
 
02:45:04.710 --> 02:45:04.720 align:start position:0%
to work onto the Senate uh I would say
 
02:45:06.030 --> 02:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
that this bill has a little something
 
02:45:08.150 --> 02:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
for everyone in it if you don't like the
 
02:45:10.190 --> 02:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
idea of a Convention of States well it's
 
02:45:12.510 --> 02:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
already built in and if you uh believe
 
02:45:14.349 --> 02:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
in the idea of a Convention of states of
 
02:45:14.359 --> 02:45:15.230 align:start position:0%
in the idea of a Convention of states of
the

02:45:15.230 --> 02:45:15.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:45:17.910 --> 02:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
2012 uh resolution was asking for a
 
02:45:19.710 --> 02:45:19.720 align:start position:0%
balanced budget of Amendment it doesn't
 
02:45:22.230 --> 02:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
seem to be that it's the strongest of
 
02:45:24.670 --> 02:45:24.680 align:start position:0%
the uh amendments proposed for the idea
 
02:45:26.469 --> 02:45:26.479 align:start position:0%
of a Convention of States I personally
 
02:45:27.870 --> 02:45:27.880 align:start position:0%
believe that a balanced budget amendment
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
would result in higher taxes for
 
02:45:32.349 --> 02:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
American citizens um that's pretty much
 
02:45:32.359 --> 02:45:33.550 align:start position:0%
American citizens um that's pretty much
it

02:45:33.550 --> 02:45:33.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:45:36.110 --> 02:45:36.120 align:start position:0%
um just wanted to introduce the
 
02:45:39.110 --> 02:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for that uh succinct
 
02:45:41.790 --> 02:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
introduction representative so obviously
 
02:45:44.190 --> 02:45:44.200 align:start position:0%
from looking at the measure here
 
02:45:47.469 --> 02:45:47.479 align:start position:0%
acr5 uh calling for resending the
 
02:45:51.309 --> 02:45:51.319 align:start position:0%
earlier resolutions passed uh about 133
 
02:45:55.510 --> 02:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
years ago yeah so you if if I if we
 
02:45:57.030 --> 02:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
understand you correctly you want that
 
02:45:59.389 --> 02:45:59.399 align:start position:0%
rescinded but you're not opposed to the
 
02:46:02.269 --> 02:46:02.279 align:start position:0%
Article 5 convention process is that
 
02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
correct um I I think there's there's
 
02:46:08.070 --> 02:46:08.080 align:start position:0%
Merit to the idea there's it seems to be
 
02:46:10.269 --> 02:46:10.279 align:start position:0%
popular uh I'm I don't have strong
 
02:46:12.790 --> 02:46:12.800 align:start position:0%
feelings one way or the or the other
 
02:46:14.429 --> 02:46:14.439 align:start position:0%
about it I think it has to do more with
 
02:46:17.910 --> 02:46:17.920 align:start position:0%
the Amendments that would be proposed
 
02:46:20.950 --> 02:46:20.960 align:start position:0%
um I would say I'm still I I'm still
 
02:46:25.070 --> 02:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
haven't fully I don't know but I know
 
02:46:26.190 --> 02:46:26.200 align:start position:0%
this was for the balanced budget
 
02:46:27.510 --> 02:46:27.520 align:start position:0%
amendment and that's something I think
 
02:46:30.790 --> 02:46:30.800 align:start position:0%
that that we don't need to ask
 
02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:33.560 align:start position:0%
for questions we take questions if there
 
02:46:36.630 --> 02:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
are any uh yes I'll answer the best that
 
02:46:40.269 --> 02:46:40.279 align:start position:0%

than my remarks at the end of my remarks

members our chairman of the board is uh
 
02:47:35.230 --> 02:47:35.240 align:start position:0%

uh supported in the US Senate three
 
02:47:47.630 --> 02:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
times he's our chairman he knows more
 
02:47:49.469 --> 02:47:49.479 align:start position:0%
about the federal budget than I think
 
02:47:51.429 --> 02:47:51.439 align:start position:0%
anyone else I've ever
 
02:47:54.510 --> 02:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
met um another of our board members is a
 
02:47:56.510 --> 02:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
fellow named Steve hanky Professor Steve
 
02:47:59.269 --> 02:47:59.279 align:start position:0%
hanky who's a uh professor ameritus at
 
02:48:01.590 --> 02:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
John's Hopkins University he's probably
 
02:48:05.550 --> 02:48:05.560 align:start position:0%
on TV about two times a week uh
 
02:48:07.990 --> 02:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
interviewed on the issue of economics
 
02:48:12.269 --> 02:48:12.279 align:start position:0%
and he instructed me about the following
 
02:48:14.110 --> 02:48:14.120 align:start position:0%
if you look at the history of leading
 
02:48:16.670 --> 02:48:16.680 align:start position:0%
economies of the world hegemonic
 
02:48:20.670 --> 02:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
economies whose currency was used uh in
 
02:48:22.630 --> 02:48:22.640 align:start position:0%
within their own nation and outside the
 
02:48:24.590 --> 02:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
nation you could start with Rome for
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
example and you could continue on
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
through history and you get to Spain and
 
02:48:30.710 --> 02:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
the Netherlands and then Great Britain
 
02:48:33.349 --> 02:48:33.359 align:start position:0%
and now the United States We Are The
 
02:48:35.630 --> 02:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
Keeper of the world's Reserve currency
 
02:48:38.349 --> 02:48:38.359 align:start position:0%
our currency the US dollar has the
 
02:48:41.389 --> 02:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
position that these prior dozen uh
 
02:48:43.550 --> 02:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
leading economies of the world
 
02:48:47.269 --> 02:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
had and unfortunately we've hit a red
 
02:48:48.750 --> 02:48:48.760 align:start position:0%
line and if you look at the history
 
02:48:50.710 --> 02:48:50.720 align:start position:0%
history of these dominant economies and
 
02:48:52.910 --> 02:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
their currencies when they hit the red
 
02:48:57.110 --> 02:48:57.120 align:start position:0%
line we're at right now these economies
 
02:49:00.030 --> 02:49:00.040 align:start position:0%
never recovered and the red line that
 
02:49:02.429 --> 02:49:02.439 align:start position:0%
we've hit is our debt in the United
 
02:49:04.110 --> 02:49:04.120 align:start position:0%
States is equal to the size of our
 
02:49:08.070 --> 02:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
economy our debt to GDP ratio is 100%
 
02:49:11.190 --> 02:49:11.200 align:start position:0%
now we've hit the red line from which
 
02:49:15.550 --> 02:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
all the world's prior leading economies
 
02:49:18.429 --> 02:49:18.439 align:start position:0%
never recovered their preeminent status
 
02:49:21.510 --> 02:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
in the the past what this is telling us
 
02:49:23.510 --> 02:49:23.520 align:start position:0%
what economists across the political
 
02:49:25.510 --> 02:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
Spectrum are now telling us and you can
 
02:49:28.190 --> 02:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
read this in the newspaper and in trade
 
02:49:30.830 --> 02:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
journals and economics analysis every
 
02:49:32.990 --> 02:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
single day people warning us the federal
 
02:49:36.030 --> 02:49:36.040 align:start position:0%
government is a of control Congress is
 
02:49:38.790 --> 02:49:38.800 align:start position:0%
addicted to debt they're conflicted
 
02:49:41.309 --> 02:49:41.319 align:start position:0%
because the handing out of freebies with
 
02:49:44.229 --> 02:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
printed money uh and gets people
 
02:49:46.750 --> 02:49:46.760 align:start position:0%
reelected Congress began to get
 
02:49:50.590 --> 02:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
concerned about this in the 1980s when
 
02:49:53.670 --> 02:49:53.680 align:start position:0%
the movement to adopt balance budget
 
02:49:56.670 --> 02:49:56.680 align:start position:0%
amendment uh resolutions by States under
 
02:49:59.469 --> 02:49:59.479 align:start position:0%
Article 5 began to take root we got to
 
02:50:02.550 --> 02:50:02.560 align:start position:0%
39 States having uh submitted
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
applications including New Hampshire in
 
02:50:08.870 --> 02:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
1979 39 States more than the required 34
 
02:50:10.550 --> 02:50:10.560 align:start position:0%
at that time and debt in the United
 
02:50:12.429 --> 02:50:12.439 align:start position:0%
States was under a trillion dollars a
 
02:50:15.429 --> 02:50:15.439 align:start position:0%
year okay we all know it's now $ 36.1
 
02:50:18.229 --> 02:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
trillion a year and Congress in response
 
02:50:19.309 --> 02:50:19.319 align:start position:0%
to the
 
02:50:22.190 --> 02:50:22.200 align:start position:0%
States uh using their powers under
 
02:50:26.870 --> 02:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
Article 5 uh adopted the gr Grand Rudman
 
02:50:30.389 --> 02:50:30.399 align:start position:0%
resolution and Congress breached its
 
02:50:32.750 --> 02:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
self-restraint under Graham Rudman and
 
02:50:35.950 --> 02:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
recurrently four more times since then
 
02:50:39.630 --> 02:50:39.640 align:start position:0%
uh Congress has breached all its own
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
self-restraint with respect to debt
 
02:50:45.670 --> 02:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
spending and it's very very clear
 
02:50:47.950 --> 02:50:47.960 align:start position:0%
Congress cannot control itself the
 
02:50:50.150 --> 02:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
framers put this power in the
 
02:50:52.510 --> 02:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution because when we hit
 
02:50:54.510 --> 02:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
circumstances like this the framers
 
02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
understood that when the United States
 
02:50:59.429 --> 02:50:59.439 align:start position:0%
confronts problem like this problems
 
02:51:01.790 --> 02:51:01.800 align:start position:0%
like this that Congress will not solve
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
Congress is not able to not willing to
 
02:51:07.469 --> 02:51:07.479 align:start position:0%
solve its addiction to debt the states
 
02:51:10.790 --> 02:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
are allowed to step in and amend the
 
02:51:13.670 --> 02:51:13.680 align:start position:0%
Constitution by proposing an
 
02:51:13.680 --> 02:51:15.469 align:start position:0%
Constitution by proposing an
amendment

02:51:15.469 --> 02:51:15.479 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
02:51:18.229 --> 02:51:18.239 align:start position:0%
so our constitution is very clear I'll
 
02:51:20.269 --> 02:51:20.279 align:start position:0%
just talk briefly about this runaway
 
02:51:22.670 --> 02:51:22.680 align:start position:0%
thing which is the reason that it's been
 
02:51:25.309 --> 02:51:25.319 align:start position:0%
very very hard to move this process
 
02:51:27.790 --> 02:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
forward even for congress Congress is
 
02:51:30.030 --> 02:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
breaching the Constitution and failing
 
02:51:32.830 --> 02:51:32.840 align:start position:0%
to call the Article 5 Amendment
 
02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
conention convention with respect to the
 
02:51:36.070 --> 02:51:36.080 align:start position:0%
balance budget amendment fiscal
 
02:51:38.150 --> 02:51:38.160 align:start position:0%
responsibility Amendment Congress is so
 
02:51:40.150 --> 02:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
opposed to the states doing this that
 
02:51:44.030 --> 02:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
they failed to call uh let's look at the
 
02:51:45.790 --> 02:51:45.800 align:start position:0%
threat of the runaway Convent first
 
02:51:48.070 --> 02:51:48.080 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the states have to agree
 
02:51:50.830 --> 02:51:50.840 align:start position:0%
on a subject matter in resolutions
 
02:51:52.750 --> 02:51:52.760 align:start position:0%
adopted like the one that this
 
02:51:55.630 --> 02:51:55.640 align:start position:0%
legislature adopted in 1979 since
 
02:51:59.030 --> 02:51:59.040 align:start position:0%
rescinded and reopt it in 2012 so we
 
02:52:01.269 --> 02:52:01.279 align:start position:0%
have a live New Hampshire has a live
 
02:52:04.550 --> 02:52:04.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal responsibility BBA resolution on
 
02:52:06.950 --> 02:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
the books right now making us one of the
 
02:52:08.870 --> 02:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
states calling for this two-thirds of
 
02:52:11.309 --> 02:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
the states first have to do this then as
 
02:52:13.150 --> 02:52:13.160 align:start position:0%
you've heard in prior testimony and the
 
02:52:16.070 --> 02:52:16.080 align:start position:0%
prior bill you folks here in this room
 
02:52:18.510 --> 02:52:18.520 align:start position:0%
and the wider legislature you deter
 
02:52:20.150 --> 02:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
determine who the delegates will be to
 
02:52:21.870 --> 02:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
the amending convention who will
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
deliberate and struggle with the very
 
02:52:26.910 --> 02:52:26.920 align:start position:0%
difficult job of adopting an amendment
 
02:52:29.550 --> 02:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
to restrain congress's addiction to
 
02:52:32.590 --> 02:52:32.600 align:start position:0%
debt uh you will select those delegates
 
02:52:34.510 --> 02:52:34.520 align:start position:0%
you will control those delegates if you
 
02:52:36.990 --> 02:52:37.000 align:start position:0%
look at uh and and this is reference to
 
02:52:39.389 --> 02:52:39.399 align:start position:0%
this the Supreme Court's unanimous 2020
 
02:52:41.910 --> 02:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
chalao versus Washington decision a
 
02:52:44.229 --> 02:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
unanimous decision by by an
 
02:52:46.990 --> 02:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
ideologically divided Supreme Court has
 
02:52:49.990 --> 02:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
made abundantly clear that you folks in
 
02:52:52.150 --> 02:52:52.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature determine how the
 
02:52:54.190 --> 02:52:54.200 align:start position:0%
delegates will be selected and you
 
02:52:56.070 --> 02:52:56.080 align:start position:0%
determine how they'll be governed and
 
02:52:57.910 --> 02:52:57.920 align:start position:0%
you have the ability to sanction and
 
02:53:02.070 --> 02:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
remove them even without HB 264 should
 
02:53:05.469 --> 02:53:05.479 align:start position:0%
they diverge from the application that
 
02:53:07.630 --> 02:53:07.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has in 2012 our balance
 
02:53:10.429 --> 02:53:10.439 align:start position:0%
budget application you have complete
 
02:53:12.550 --> 02:53:12.560 align:start position:0%
Authority ruled unanimously by the
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court to select and control and
 
02:53:17.550 --> 02:53:17.560 align:start position:0%
remove these delegates should you should
 
02:53:20.030 --> 02:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
you see fit to do that and finally the
 
02:53:21.950 --> 02:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
convention for proposing amendments
 
02:53:25.030 --> 02:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
those are the words in Article 5 give
 
02:53:28.229 --> 02:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
this amending convention no power to do
 
02:53:30.269 --> 02:53:30.279 align:start position:0%
anything whatsoever and you hear people
 
02:53:32.349 --> 02:53:32.359 align:start position:0%
who oppose this tell you the runaway
 
02:53:34.190 --> 02:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
convention will shred the
 
02:53:36.750 --> 02:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution the amending convention has
 
02:53:39.269 --> 02:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
no power to do anything other than
 
02:53:41.070 --> 02:53:41.080 align:start position:0%
propose and this is going to be a
 
02:53:42.830 --> 02:53:42.840 align:start position:0%
difficult problem on on the Deb limit
 
02:53:45.710 --> 02:53:45.720 align:start position:0%
question anyway and should they succeed
 
02:53:45.720 --> 02:53:46.510 align:start position:0%
question anyway and should they succeed
in

02:53:46.510 --> 02:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:53:49.110 --> 02:53:49.120 align:start position:0%
proposing one state one vote vote then
 
02:53:51.590 --> 02:53:51.600 align:start position:0%
it has to go back in 38 states to ratify
 
02:53:54.110 --> 02:53:54.120 align:start position:0%
and you heard that 13 states simply by
 
02:53:56.750 --> 02:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
doing nothing cause that proposed
 
02:53:59.429 --> 02:53:59.439 align:start position:0%
amendment to go nowhere we have the mo
 
02:54:01.389 --> 02:54:01.399 align:start position:0%
we have the free world's most difficult
 
02:54:03.990 --> 02:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
to amend Constitution another point I'd
 
02:54:06.110 --> 02:54:06.120 align:start position:0%
make with respect to the balanced budget
 
02:54:08.429 --> 02:54:08.439 align:start position:0%
amendment the amending convention is a
 
02:54:11.630 --> 02:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
deliberative assembly of delegates in
 
02:54:14.750 --> 02:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
the same way that Congress uh deals with
 
02:54:17.229 --> 02:54:17.239 align:start position:0%
proposed amendments uh an amendment
 
02:54:19.030 --> 02:54:19.040 align:start position:0%
might be proposed by an individual in
 
02:54:22.910 --> 02:54:22.920 align:start position:0%
Congress it's debated it's amended it's
 
02:54:25.229 --> 02:54:25.239 align:start position:0%
altered it goes through a lengthy and
 
02:54:27.630 --> 02:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the the the 27
 
02:54:29.469 --> 02:54:29.479 align:start position:0%
Amendments that have been ratified to
 
02:54:31.710 --> 02:54:31.720 align:start position:0%
date all of them have gone through an
 
02:54:35.229 --> 02:54:35.239 align:start position:0%
arduous process in Congress at reaching
 
02:54:39.429 --> 02:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
sufficient uh deliberative uh support
 
02:54:40.990 --> 02:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
even to get back to the States for
 
02:54:43.070 --> 02:54:43.080 align:start position:0%
ratification so the the deliberative
 
02:54:45.710 --> 02:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
amending convention may choose to
 
02:54:47.630 --> 02:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
propose a line item veto for the
 
02:54:49.429 --> 02:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
president to deal with the spending and
 
02:54:52.229 --> 02:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
debt problem it may propose a Swiss debt
 
02:54:54.030 --> 02:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
break that the people of Switzerland
 
02:54:57.070 --> 02:54:57.080 align:start position:0%
adopted by 83% in in a referendum
 
02:54:59.150 --> 02:54:59.160 align:start position:0%
adopting their debt limit Amendment the
 
02:55:01.710 --> 02:55:01.720 align:start position:0%
Swiss debt break uh it may propose a
 
02:55:04.950 --> 02:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
debt to GDP limit a ratio limit on the
 
02:55:06.590 --> 02:55:06.600 align:start position:0%
extent to which debt relative to the
 
02:55:08.510 --> 02:55:08.520 align:start position:0%
size of our economy uh the amending
 
02:55:10.990 --> 02:55:11.000 align:start position:0%
convention May adopt a uh something like
 
02:55:13.950 --> 02:55:13.960 align:start position:0%
a tabore a what Colorado has in its
 
02:55:16.950 --> 02:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
state constitution
 
02:55:20.510 --> 02:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
so um I would I would conclude just
 
02:55:25.229 --> 02:55:25.239 align:start position:0%
simply by saying this the opponents who
 
02:55:29.670 --> 02:55:29.680 align:start position:0%
wish to resend New Hampshire's live BBA
 
02:55:32.110 --> 02:55:32.120 align:start position:0%
application which we oppose at Federal
 
02:55:34.510 --> 02:55:34.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal sustainability Foundation please
 
02:55:37.110 --> 02:55:37.120 align:start position:0%
vote this down please vote this itl
 
02:55:40.389 --> 02:55:40.399 align:start position:0%
remember you folks have control over
 
02:55:44.229 --> 02:55:44.239 align:start position:0%
this entire process and and the question
 
02:55:46.750 --> 02:55:46.760 align:start position:0%
the opponents put to you or the case
 
02:55:48.790 --> 02:55:48.800 align:start position:0%
they put to you is that you should not
 
02:55:52.110 --> 02:55:52.120 align:start position:0%
trust yourself you have control over the
 
02:55:54.269 --> 02:55:54.279 align:start position:0%
delegates you you determin who the
 
02:55:56.349 --> 02:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
delegates will be you have the ability
 
02:55:58.229 --> 02:55:58.239 align:start position:0%
to sanction and remove them they're
 
02:56:02.870 --> 02:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
asking you not to trust yourself I trust
 
02:56:05.429 --> 02:56:05.439 align:start position:0%

Congress is not solving we've got a fire
 
02:56:24.469 --> 02:56:24.479 align:start position:0%

resolving the opponents are telling you
 
02:56:39.830 --> 02:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
let's buy this runaway convention risk
 
02:56:42.630 --> 02:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
let's use that and say let the house let
 
02:56:45.389 --> 02:56:45.399 align:start position:0%
our fiscal House burn down that's an
 
02:56:49.349 --> 02:56:49.359 align:start position:0%

year so we we were resending um all
 
02:58:15.590 --> 02:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
previous uh Article 5 convention calls
 
02:58:18.670 --> 02:58:18.680 align:start position:0%
um and I think Senator Rubin stated
 
02:58:21.070 --> 02:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
which I believe is correct that the one
 
02:58:22.550 --> 02:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
the only one we had outstanding the time
 
02:58:25.790 --> 02:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
was from 1979 for balance
 
02:58:29.030 --> 02:58:29.040 align:start position:0%
budget and I mean I could go on about
 
02:58:31.510 --> 02:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
why a balanced budget uh amendment is a
 
02:58:33.309 --> 02:58:33.319 align:start position:0%
bad idea especially if you turn it over
 
02:58:35.870 --> 02:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
to an article 5 convention which is
 
02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
prone to a run away even though anything
 
02:58:40.710 --> 02:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
it proposes after a runways has to be
 
02:58:43.630 --> 02:58:43.640 align:start position:0%
ratified by super majority of the states
 
02:58:46.910 --> 02:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
so and um so we event to get that pass
 
02:58:49.389 --> 02:58:49.399 align:start position:0%
with bipartisan bipartisan support I
 
02:58:51.710 --> 02:58:51.720 align:start position:0%
think it passed both Chambers by a Voice
 
02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
vote and then ironically the next year
 
02:58:54.359 --> 02:58:55.309 align:start position:0%
vote and then ironically the next year
in

02:58:55.309 --> 02:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:58:59.150 --> 02:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
2012 we had a we had a resolution
 
02:59:03.550 --> 02:59:03.560 align:start position:0%
calling for a um Article 5 convention or
 
02:59:05.870 --> 02:59:05.880 align:start position:0%
a or to have the Senate propose a
 
02:59:07.710 --> 02:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
constitutional convention on their own
 
02:59:09.030 --> 02:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:59:11.910 --> 02:59:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh and that and that also passed and the
 
02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
two sponsors that are actually still in
 
02:59:16.469 --> 02:59:16.479 align:start position:0%
the legislature R erery who's
 
02:59:19.150 --> 02:59:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh still sitting back to the room and
 
02:59:21.070 --> 02:59:21.080 align:start position:0%
Senator Sharon Carson who's now the
 
02:59:23.750 --> 02:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate so I I
 
02:59:26.590 --> 02:59:26.600 align:start position:0%
um basically I supported this because I
 
02:59:29.550 --> 02:59:29.560 align:start position:0%
think uh any Article 5 convention is a
 
02:59:32.670 --> 02:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
bad idea at this time it uh you know I
 
02:59:35.030 --> 02:59:35.040 align:start position:0%
may be may be necessary someday but it's
 
02:59:38.269 --> 02:59:38.279 align:start position:0%
not necessarily for necessary um was it
 
02:59:40.750 --> 02:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
necessary in 2012 it's not necessary now
 
02:59:42.229 --> 02:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
even though things are worse than in
 
02:59:44.750 --> 02:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
2012 you know large Southern California
 
02:59:48.630 --> 02:59:48.640 align:start position:0%
is literally on fire but um they I don't
 
02:59:50.150 --> 02:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
think the convention could do much about
 
02:59:53.990 --> 02:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
that and um so and also think the
 
02:59:56.190 --> 02:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
national the national debt that's a
 
02:59:59.550 --> 02:59:59.560 align:start position:0%
complicated issue I think uh uh it's
 
03:00:01.469 --> 03:00:01.479 align:start position:0%
about half of it is the money supply so
 
03:00:03.630 --> 03:00:03.640 align:start position:0%
we actually tried to pay off the
 
03:00:05.190 --> 03:00:05.200 align:start position:0%
national debt first of all I'm not sure
 
03:00:06.910 --> 03:00:06.920 align:start position:0%
how you'd pay off the money supply
 
03:00:10.110 --> 03:00:10.120 align:start position:0%
except by printing more money and also
 
03:00:12.429 --> 03:00:12.439 align:start position:0%
it would cause more problems then it
 
03:00:14.229 --> 03:00:14.239 align:start position:0%
solves will you take any questions if
 
03:00:15.309 --> 03:00:15.319 align:start position:0%
there are
 
03:00:17.630 --> 03:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
any are there any questions for one of
 
03:00:19.110 --> 03:00:19.120 align:start position:0%
the coach
 
03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
sponsors seeing none uh thank you again
 
03:00:25.950 --> 03:00:25.960 align:start position:0%
I'll just refer you back to HCR 28 and
 
03:00:28.870 --> 03:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
2010 which also laid out a very good
 
03:00:31.110 --> 03:00:31.120 align:start position:0%
case so resent comaford like re sapper
 
03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
and dhir did a did a very good job
 
03:00:35.630 --> 03:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
drafting it a me drafting a a resolution
 
03:00:37.750 --> 03:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
so I hope uh hope it'll meet the same
 
03:00:39.510 --> 03:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
fate we had in 2010 which is a
 
03:00:42.510 --> 03:00:42.520 align:start position:0%
bipartisan uh bipartisan majority in
 
03:00:44.429 --> 03:00:44.439 align:start position:0%
both the house and in the other chamber
 
03:00:45.670 --> 03:00:45.680 align:start position:0%
that I guess we're not supposed to
 
03:00:49.190 --> 03:00:49.200 align:start position:0%
mention here but so thank you very much
 
03:00:53.910 --> 03:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for uh staying around okay uh
 
03:00:58.309 --> 03:00:58.319 align:start position:0%
Carol Pusa witz is still here she's
 
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
asked for 2 minutes and 45 seconds and I
 
03:01:03.150 --> 03:01:03.160 align:start position:0%
really appreciate how you time out
 
03:01:04.710 --> 03:01:04.720 align:start position:0%
obviously you're doing your homework and
 
03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
T timing out uh your preparation so
 
03:01:08.830 --> 03:01:08.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for that and welcome back for
 
03:01:11.790 --> 03:01:11.800 align:start position:0%
the third time thank you um yesterday on
 
03:01:14.710 --> 03:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
Article 5 library.org they showed 36
 
03:01:17.630 --> 03:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
current Balan budget resolutions yet as
 
03:01:20.190 --> 03:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
We Know know 34 is all that's needed for
 
03:01:22.110 --> 03:01:22.120 align:start position:0%
Congress to set the time in place and I
 
03:01:23.550 --> 03:01:23.560 align:start position:0%
know the courts are going to work that
 
03:01:25.670 --> 03:01:25.680 align:start position:0%
out regardless of that New Hampshire
 
03:01:28.469 --> 03:01:28.479 align:start position:0%
should not resend the 2012 balance
 
03:01:31.229 --> 03:01:31.239 align:start position:0%
balance budget resolution yes that
 
03:01:33.510 --> 03:01:33.520 align:start position:0%
legislator that passed that knew the
 
03:01:35.790 --> 03:01:35.800 align:start position:0%
spending of Congress was out of control
 
03:01:38.030 --> 03:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
and would bankrupt the nation and today
 
03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
of course the debt is way worse the
 
03:01:42.150 --> 03:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
legislature understood it's its duty to
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
protect New Hampshire and its posterity
 
03:01:46.830 --> 03:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
someone I know and admire was very
 
03:01:49.309 --> 03:01:49.319 align:start position:0%
influential when passing that bill in
 
03:01:52.150 --> 03:01:52.160 align:start position:0%
2012 at that time he was a Senator it
 
03:01:55.229 --> 03:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
was Senator Fenton groan he continued to
 
03:01:57.429 --> 03:01:57.439 align:start position:0%
serve in the house for years committing
 
03:01:59.870 --> 03:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
himself to upholding the Statesman
 
03:02:03.229 --> 03:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
status and I thank him for his service
 
03:02:05.269 --> 03:02:05.279 align:start position:0%
this resolution is written portraying
 
03:02:07.030 --> 03:02:07.040 align:start position:0%
that the sponsors admire the
 
03:02:08.950 --> 03:02:08.960 align:start position:0%
Constitution except that they feel the
 
03:02:10.710 --> 03:02:10.720 align:start position:0%
founders made a mistake when they
 
03:02:13.110 --> 03:02:13.120 align:start position:0%
unanimously agreed to the necessity of
 
03:02:15.910 --> 03:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
the second part of Article 5 to support
 
03:02:18.510 --> 03:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
the sponsors that wrote this bill
 
03:02:19.990 --> 03:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
and anyone who agrees with this
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
resolution my recommendation is for them
 
03:02:24.710 --> 03:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
to write a new resolution removing the
 
03:02:27.710 --> 03:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
second part of Article 5 they can see if
 
03:02:30.030 --> 03:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
34 States agree that only Congress
 
03:02:32.349 --> 03:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
should be authorized to make Amendment
 
03:02:34.790 --> 03:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
proposals the founders understood human
 
03:02:36.950 --> 03:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
nature and their desire for control and
 
03:02:39.429 --> 03:02:39.439 align:start position:0%
power and so felt this safety net from
 
03:02:42.670 --> 03:02:42.680 align:start position:0%
congressional usurpations was absolutely
 
03:02:44.870 --> 03:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
essential to protect the states and the
 
03:02:46.910 --> 03:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
people's rights maybe the people of
 
03:02:48.269 --> 03:02:48.279 align:start position:0%
today think Human Nature Nature has
 
03:02:50.550 --> 03:02:50.560 align:start position:0%
changed the sponsors certainly are
 
03:02:52.790 --> 03:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
empowered to write a new resolution and
 
03:02:54.670 --> 03:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
see if the public if there's any public
 
03:02:56.630 --> 03:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
support but that's not what we're here
 
03:02:59.429 --> 03:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
to discuss today the problem back in
 
03:03:03.790 --> 03:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
2012 is the same Congress is bankrupting
 
03:03:05.990 --> 03:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
our nation today's Congressional
 
03:03:08.150 --> 03:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
overspending is eviden that we need to
 
03:03:10.150 --> 03:03:10.160 align:start position:0%
keep this balanced budget resolution in
 
03:03:12.269 --> 03:03:12.279 align:start position:0%
good standing New Hampshire's balanced
 
03:03:16.750 --> 03:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
budget um Amendment resolution is not
 
03:03:19.710 --> 03:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
plenary it's not open-ended for any
 
03:03:22.269 --> 03:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
subject matter but rather specific to
 
03:03:25.229 --> 03:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
just discussing a balanced budget the
 
03:03:27.990 --> 03:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
last plary application was in
 
03:03:31.190 --> 03:03:31.200 align:start position:0%
1929 once the nation realized the risks
 
03:03:33.950 --> 03:03:33.960 align:start position:0%
of plenary resolutions States rescinded
 
03:03:36.590 --> 03:03:36.600 align:start position:0%
all their applications I don't know of
 
03:03:38.590 --> 03:03:38.600 align:start position:0%
any state that wants a convention that
 
03:03:40.950 --> 03:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
is able to discuss any topic I don't
 
03:03:44.710 --> 03:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
know any none hd40 is bound to only
 
03:03:47.349 --> 03:03:47.359 align:start position:0%
discuss a balanced budget proposal
 
03:03:49.870 --> 03:03:49.880 align:start position:0%
without a faithful delegate Bill basic
 
03:03:51.910 --> 03:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
agency law protects New Hampshire
 
03:03:53.630 --> 03:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
against delegates who disobey their
 
03:03:56.309 --> 03:03:56.319 align:start position:0%
instruction Most states avoid confusion
 
03:03:58.670 --> 03:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
of how to use basic agency laws and
 
03:04:01.110 --> 03:04:01.120 align:start position:0%
write delegation laws defining how the
 
03:04:03.469 --> 03:04:03.479 align:start position:0%
delegates will be selected financed and
 
03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
held accountable if they violate the
 
03:04:08.389 --> 03:04:08.399 align:start position:0%
state's directives HB 264 Was Heard
 
03:04:10.630 --> 03:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
earlier today on the subject matter even
 
03:04:12.110 --> 03:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
though the current Administration is
 
03:04:14.070 --> 03:04:14.080 align:start position:0%
taking some actions to reverse this
 
03:04:16.750 --> 03:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
bankruptcy the next Administration can
 
03:04:20.070 --> 03:04:20.080 align:start position:0%
just undo their efforts only in Article
 
03:04:22.269 --> 03:04:22.279 align:start position:0%
5 has the ability to make a permanent
 
03:04:24.790 --> 03:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
change in the structure for lasting
 
03:04:28.150 --> 03:04:28.160 align:start position:0%

um the parts of this resolution we
 
03:05:02.830 --> 03:05:02.840 align:start position:0%

inaccurate um the uh we have no
 
03:05:09.229 --> 03:05:09.239 align:start position:0%
objection to resending a call for
 
03:05:11.349 --> 03:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
balanced budget amendment um we're
 
03:05:12.990 --> 03:05:13.000 align:start position:0%
single issue focused on the issue of
 
03:05:14.990 --> 03:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
campaign Finance reform and if this
 
03:05:16.550 --> 03:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
resolution were limited to the first
 
03:05:18.830 --> 03:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
Wares clause and the first two resolve
 
03:05:21.110 --> 03:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
Clauses then we would be neutral on it
 
03:05:23.950 --> 03:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
we would have no objection um the issue
 
03:05:27.910 --> 03:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
is that the um the rest of the um
 
03:05:30.190 --> 03:05:30.200 align:start position:0%
resolution talks about the Declaration
 
03:05:30.200 --> 03:05:30.870 align:start position:0%
resolution talks about the Declaration
of

03:05:30.870 --> 03:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:05:34.150 --> 03:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
Independence um and the uh the right to
 
03:05:36.269 --> 03:05:36.279 align:start position:0%
uh abolish and replace the government
 
03:05:39.510 --> 03:05:39.520 align:start position:0%
and just utterly conflates the idea of a
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
true Constitutional Convention with an
 
03:05:44.469 --> 03:05:44.479 align:start position:0%
article 5 amending convention uh which
 
03:05:46.630 --> 03:05:46.640 align:start position:0%
is an easy mistake to make because most
 
03:05:48.510 --> 03:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
of the scholarly Rec search up until
 
03:05:51.550 --> 03:05:51.560 align:start position:0%
about 15 years ago or so um used the
 
03:05:53.349 --> 03:05:53.359 align:start position:0%
term Constitutional Convention and then
 
03:05:56.110 --> 03:05:56.120 align:start position:0%
used other language to clarify which
 
03:05:57.990 --> 03:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
type of Constitutional Convention they
 
03:06:00.630 --> 03:06:00.640 align:start position:0%
meant and because of that confusion more
 
03:06:03.190 --> 03:06:03.200 align:start position:0%
recent scholarship has uh changed the
 
03:06:05.070 --> 03:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
the name and specifically called it a
 
03:06:06.670 --> 03:06:06.680 align:start position:0%
convention for proposing amendments or
 
03:06:09.030 --> 03:06:09.040 align:start position:0%
an article 5 convention or uh or
 
03:06:12.150 --> 03:06:12.160 align:start position:0%
something to that effect um but the one
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
of the reasons I actually like use of
 
03:06:15.510 --> 03:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
the term Constitutional Convention
 
03:06:17.870 --> 03:06:17.880 align:start position:0%
unlike most people who who work in this
 
03:06:21.830 --> 03:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh who studied this is that we have good
 
03:06:23.750 --> 03:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
precedent from various types of
 
03:06:26.309 --> 03:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
constitutional conventions uh including
 
03:06:29.030 --> 03:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
the Philadelphia Convention including
 
03:06:31.510 --> 03:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
the the 40 uh Interstate conventions
 
03:06:33.469 --> 03:06:33.479 align:start position:0%
that were mentioned by Senator sorum and
 
03:06:35.269 --> 03:06:35.279 align:start position:0%
others and also which has not been
 
03:06:38.429 --> 03:06:38.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh about 50 uh conventions
 
03:06:41.469 --> 03:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
held under the US Constitution um about
 
03:06:45.030 --> 03:06:45.040 align:start position:0%
a dozen under article more than about 14
 
03:06:47.110 --> 03:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
under article 7 to ratify the US
 
03:06:47.120 --> 03:06:48.590 align:start position:0%
under article 7 to ratify the US
Constitution

03:06:48.590 --> 03:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
03:06:52.030 --> 03:06:52.040 align:start position:0%
and uh more than 40 under um Article 5
 
03:06:56.150 --> 03:06:56.160 align:start position:0%
to ratify the 21st amendment um and all
 
03:06:58.269 --> 03:06:58.279 align:start position:0%
of these as well as the more than 200
 
03:07:00.229 --> 03:07:00.239 align:start position:0%
State conventions to either amend or
 
03:07:02.830 --> 03:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
propose uh constitutions give us a
 
03:07:04.630 --> 03:07:04.640 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of precedent that help
 
03:07:07.630 --> 03:07:07.640 align:start position:0%
us understand how this process works um
 
03:07:08.830 --> 03:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous treatises
 
03:07:10.630 --> 03:07:10.640 align:start position:0%
written about that going all the way
 
03:07:13.229 --> 03:07:13.239 align:start position:0%
back to the founding of the Republic um
 
03:07:15.990 --> 03:07:16.000 align:start position:0%
and I and among just to give you an
 
03:07:18.269 --> 03:07:18.279 align:start position:0%
example of of the precedent
 
03:07:21.030 --> 03:07:21.040 align:start position:0%
um here in New Hampshire in uh in
 
03:07:24.830 --> 03:07:24.840 align:start position:0%
1788 um the convention to ratify the US
 
03:07:27.429 --> 03:07:27.439 align:start position:0%
Constitution um about half the delegates
 
03:07:29.309 --> 03:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
were Bound by their constituents and
 
03:07:31.550 --> 03:07:31.560 align:start position:0%
they were bound specifically to vote
 
03:07:34.429 --> 03:07:34.439 align:start position:0%
against the US Constitution uh and they
 
03:07:38.190 --> 03:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
were held um they were held to that they
 
03:07:39.590 --> 03:07:39.600 align:start position:0%
considered themselves held to it the
 
03:07:41.550 --> 03:07:41.560 align:start position:0%
convention that was called considered
 
03:07:43.309 --> 03:07:43.319 align:start position:0%
them held to it and that's why they
 
03:07:45.070 --> 03:07:45.080 align:start position:0%
adjourned that convention and sent them
 
03:07:47.590 --> 03:07:47.600 align:start position:0%
back to their constituents uh to argue
 
03:07:49.710 --> 03:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
with their constituents that they should
 
03:07:51.790 --> 03:07:51.800 align:start position:0%
have uh they should get broader
 
03:07:55.309 --> 03:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
Authority um the constituents then uh
 
03:07:58.110 --> 03:07:58.120 align:start position:0%
enough of the constituents um listened
 
03:07:59.469 --> 03:07:59.479 align:start position:0%
to the arguments and agreed that the
 
03:08:02.510 --> 03:08:02.520 align:start position:0%
constitution actually was a good idea uh
 
03:08:05.630 --> 03:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
to uh to change the minds of enough uh
 
03:08:07.830 --> 03:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
delegates that were then sent back to a
 
03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
new convention uh and then ratified the
 
03:08:12.349 --> 03:08:12.359 align:start position:0%
US Constitution putting it into effect
 
03:08:15.469 --> 03:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
and specifically in the town of basn um
 
03:08:17.469 --> 03:08:17.479 align:start position:0%
they uh were the the first to not only
 
03:08:19.950 --> 03:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
recognize their authority to um bind
 
03:08:23.429 --> 03:08:23.439 align:start position:0%
their delegates but the authority to um
 
03:08:26.510 --> 03:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
to re uh to remove their delegate and
 
03:08:29.150 --> 03:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
send a new one if they uh thought that
 
03:08:30.790 --> 03:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
that delegate wasn't going to adequately
 
03:08:32.990 --> 03:08:33.000 align:start position:0%
represent them they ultimately decided
 
03:08:34.269 --> 03:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
to keep that delegate but there was
 
03:08:35.870 --> 03:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
another one ready to go and it was a
 
03:08:38.349 --> 03:08:38.359 align:start position:0%
close vote to replace their existing
 
03:08:40.670 --> 03:08:40.680 align:start position:0%
delegate with a new one or to to keep
 
03:08:40.680 --> 03:08:42.349 align:start position:0%
delegate with a new one or to to keep
the

03:08:42.349 --> 03:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%

amendment we we are a single focused
 
03:09:30.190 --> 03:09:30.200 align:start position:0%
organization on campaign Finance reform
 
03:09:32.790 --> 03:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
what we have a problem with is the
 
03:09:35.790 --> 03:09:35.800 align:start position:0%
inflammatory language about Article 5
 
03:09:39.389 --> 03:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
that it is a dangerous um uh Pursuit
 
03:09:41.710 --> 03:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
that is a dangerous method of amending
 
03:09:43.630 --> 03:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
the Constitution we just do not believe
 
03:09:46.389 --> 03:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
in that again and that is not just us
 
03:09:48.389 --> 03:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
talking about it
 
03:09:50.510 --> 03:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
the majority of leading experts that
 
03:09:52.590 --> 03:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
make it their career to study the
 
03:09:55.389 --> 03:09:55.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution and constitutional law
 
03:09:58.150 --> 03:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
agree that it is a safe process it will
 
03:10:00.950 --> 03:10:00.960 align:start position:0%
not run away there are multiple reports
 
03:10:03.349 --> 03:10:03.359 align:start position:0%
that you can peer-reviewed reports from
 
03:10:06.309 --> 03:10:06.319 align:start position:0%
the from the uh Harvard Law review from
 
03:10:08.269 --> 03:10:08.279 align:start position:0%
the uh American Bar Association from the
 
03:10:09.950 --> 03:10:09.960 align:start position:0%
Congressional research report from the
 
03:10:12.990 --> 03:10:13.000 align:start position:0%
doj under two presidents there's just a
 
03:10:16.429 --> 03:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
multitude of reports that say it is safe
 
03:10:18.030 --> 03:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
now there are opinions out there that
 
03:10:19.750 --> 03:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
say is not safe there are plenty of
 
03:10:22.469 --> 03:10:22.479 align:start position:0%
opinions and people are entitled to
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
their opinions but when those opinions
 
03:10:28.229 --> 03:10:28.239 align:start position:0%
are brought to the experts to review
 
03:10:30.429 --> 03:10:30.439 align:start position:0%
they are dismissed because in order to
 
03:10:32.349 --> 03:10:32.359 align:start position:0%
make those opinions you have to ignore
 
03:10:36.269 --> 03:10:36.279 align:start position:0%
history precedent facts um and and they
 
03:10:38.750 --> 03:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
are easily disputed so that's all I have
 
03:10:40.429 --> 03:10:40.439 align:start position:0%
to say on that matter I would like to
 
03:10:42.830 --> 03:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
correct the record Madam clerk from my
 
03:10:45.750 --> 03:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
comments earlier um I looked at my notes
 
03:10:48.190 --> 03:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
it was 25 States have introduced
 
03:10:51.150 --> 03:10:51.160 align:start position:0%
faithful delegate laws not passed them
 
03:10:53.110 --> 03:10:53.120 align:start position:0%
and according to my records and
 
03:10:55.910 --> 03:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
obviously uh Senator Santorum said
 
03:10:58.389 --> 03:10:58.399 align:start position:0%
something different he said a dozen
 
03:11:00.030 --> 03:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
under my records there have only been
 
03:11:01.830 --> 03:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
seven states that have actually passed
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
and have put in place those laws so but
 
03:11:06.469 --> 03:11:06.479 align:start position:0%
there are 25 and I I hate giving
 
03:11:08.429 --> 03:11:08.439 align:start position:0%
misinformation so I wanted to correct
 
03:11:10.309 --> 03:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
the record on that we're opposed to
 
03:11:12.469 --> 03:11:12.479 align:start position:0%
misinformation in the official record
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
thank you for clarifying that and and
 
03:11:16.190 --> 03:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
and being a being a librarian a
 
03:11:18.309 --> 03:11:18.319 align:start position:0%
university librarian 10 years I hate
 
03:11:20.910 --> 03:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
misinformation I like research and I
 
03:11:23.990 --> 03:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
like good information so um so uh that's
 
03:11:26.309 --> 03:11:26.319 align:start position:0%
all I have to say uh again um I hope you
 
03:11:29.630 --> 03:11:29.640 align:start position:0%
will uh vote no on this Madam chair
 
03:11:33.349 --> 03:11:33.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so is it 12
 
03:11:36.190 --> 03:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
that passed that's what senator sorm
 
03:11:39.429 --> 03:11:39.439 align:start position:0%
says my records show seven okay um but
 
03:11:42.469 --> 03:11:42.479 align:start position:0%
maybe he has different um uh information
 
03:11:44.710 --> 03:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
that I don't have as far as I can see
 
03:11:46.389 --> 03:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
there has been only seven states that
 
03:11:49.510 --> 03:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
have actually passed and implemented uh
 
03:11:51.550 --> 03:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
faithful delegate laws thank
 
03:11:54.910 --> 03:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
you I'm going to recognize Senator Rubin
 
03:11:57.990 --> 03:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
because I can uh before I go to the last
 
03:12:01.870 --> 03:12:01.880 align:start position:0%
uh the last speaker uh sen may call
 
03:12:05.030 --> 03:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
Senator uh go ahead uh you can go to an
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
organization called path to reform you
 
03:12:10.030 --> 03:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
can Google it and I think they have a
 
03:12:12.150 --> 03:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
compendium of states that actually have
 
03:12:14.830 --> 03:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
on the books delegate limitation laws I
 
03:12:18.349 --> 03:12:18.359 align:start position:0%
think it's about 14 path to reform
 
03:12:20.550 --> 03:12:20.560 align:start position:0%
path to reform and you can see which
 
03:12:23.990 --> 03:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
states aded delegate limitation laws
 
03:12:26.950 --> 03:12:26.960 align:start position:0%
good good good to know path to
 
03:12:29.750 --> 03:12:29.760 align:start position:0%
reform.com we just Google that
 
03:12:32.469 --> 03:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you again thank
 
03:12:36.229 --> 03:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
you okay our final card uh Joe trelli is
 
03:12:38.510 --> 03:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
is back he's asked for a minute uh
 
03:12:41.790 --> 03:12:41.800 align:start position:0%
batting cleanup he also opposes HCR 5
 
03:12:44.590 --> 03:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
welcome back Mr trelli thank you very
 
03:12:46.510 --> 03:12:46.520 align:start position:0%
much and I have one correction from my
 
03:12:47.670 --> 03:12:47.680 align:start position:0%
previous test
 
03:12:50.990 --> 03:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
also for Madam clerk I referred to James
 
03:12:53.510 --> 03:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
Madison as being 26 he was 26 when the
 
03:12:54.990 --> 03:12:55.000 align:start position:0%
Declaration of
 
03:12:59.110 --> 03:12:59.120 align:start position:0%
Independence but Mason was 30 years
 
03:13:03.150 --> 03:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
older or something around that okay so I
 
03:13:04.309 --> 03:13:04.319 align:start position:0%
don't know if anybody's ever been
 
03:13:07.309 --> 03:13:07.319 align:start position:0%
involved in a patent anybody any of the
 
03:13:09.309 --> 03:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
committee members so a patent is where
 
03:13:12.750 --> 03:13:12.760 align:start position:0%
you describe something so well that
 
03:13:16.110 --> 03:13:16.120 align:start position:0%
someone outside the knowledge of that
 
03:13:17.950 --> 03:13:17.960 align:start position:0%
should be able to build
 
03:13:20.190 --> 03:13:20.200 align:start position:0%
it I look at the Declaration of
 
03:13:22.950 --> 03:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
Independence as the patent and when I
 
03:13:26.349 --> 03:13:26.359 align:start position:0%
look at HCR 5 they're referring to the
 
03:13:28.070 --> 03:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
Declaration of Independence as having
 
03:13:30.790 --> 03:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
all that's the right of the people yeah
 
03:13:32.510 --> 03:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
okay and when I look at this I'm
 
03:13:35.030 --> 03:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
thinking this is
 
03:13:37.830 --> 03:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
not what we think it is there's a lot of
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
years between declaration Articles of
 
03:13:42.710 --> 03:13:42.720 align:start position:0%
Confederation and Constitution Articles
 
03:13:45.750 --> 03:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
of Confederation failed to have an
 
03:13:48.950 --> 03:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
amendment cap ability that was used they
 
03:13:51.229 --> 03:13:51.239 align:start position:0%
never bothered using it so everybody
 
03:13:53.030 --> 03:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
worked forward to the Constitutional
 
03:13:54.710 --> 03:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
Convention the actual Constitutional
 
03:13:57.790 --> 03:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
Convention starting in May of 1787 and
 
03:13:59.229 --> 03:13:59.239 align:start position:0%
they built the
 
03:14:01.349 --> 03:14:01.359 align:start position:0%
product and they made the product
 
03:14:03.510 --> 03:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
successful and it's the Envy of the
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
world except maybe South
 
03:14:08.870 --> 03:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
Africa so I just wanted to say that I
 
03:14:14.030 --> 03:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
think this this HCR 5 is folly and it's
 
03:14:17.150 --> 03:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
useless because there's been enough case
 
03:14:19.070 --> 03:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
over the testimonies that we've heard
 
03:14:21.150 --> 03:14:21.160 align:start position:0%
today and and
 
03:14:23.950 --> 03:14:23.960 align:start position:0%
provided that an article 5 convention
 
03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
should happen the recision should not
 
03:14:28.510 --> 03:14:28.520 align:start position:0%
and this should be put in front of the
 
03:14:31.550 --> 03:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
full body and we I I ask for your
 
03:14:34.550 --> 03:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
support any questions for Mr
 
03:14:37.429 --> 03:14:37.439 align:start position:0%

03:14:41.229 --> 03:14:41.239 align:start position:0%

04:07:45.670 --> 04:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
okay at this time at 1307 we're just a
 
04:07:48.269 --> 04:07:48.279 align:start position:0%
little bit behind um but we're good to
 
04:07:51.229 --> 04:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
go we have one hearing this afternoon
 
04:07:52.950 --> 04:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be on house joint
 
04:07:56.189 --> 04:07:56.199 align:start position:0%
resolution one affirming the natural
 
04:07:59.149 --> 04:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
right of persons and affirming that the
 
04:08:00.630 --> 04:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
state and federal government are
 
04:08:03.710 --> 04:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
established for the purpose of upholding
 
04:08:07.469 --> 04:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
protecting and securing these rights the
 
04:08:09.149 --> 04:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor is from this committee
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
representative Belzer uh he's in place
 
04:08:14.030 --> 04:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
ready to go
 
04:08:18.229 --> 04:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh and Mr Prime sponsor uh have at it
 
04:08:21.070 --> 04:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members uh
 
04:08:23.309 --> 04:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
this fits rather nicely a lot of
 
04:08:24.750 --> 04:08:24.760 align:start position:0%
commonality between the things we
 
04:08:26.710 --> 04:08:26.720 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning and what we'll
 
04:08:28.790 --> 04:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
find in here I'm not going to read the
 
04:08:31.030 --> 04:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
whole thing uh front to back for you I
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
just want to touch on some of the uh big
 
04:08:38.030 --> 04:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
points in here and what the purpose is
 
04:08:42.469 --> 04:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
so the purpose of this is to identify
 
04:08:44.109 --> 04:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
the nature
 
04:08:47.710 --> 04:08:47.720 align:start position:0%
of Rights the rights that people possess
 
04:08:49.590 --> 04:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
in our country in our
 
04:08:53.510 --> 04:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
society and update them just a little
 
04:08:56.630 --> 04:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
bit so they properly fit in the modern
 
04:08:59.550 --> 04:08:59.560 align:start position:0%
context compared to where they were
 
04:09:01.349 --> 04:09:01.359 align:start position:0%
couple hundred years ago before the
 
04:09:03.269 --> 04:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
internet and such
 
04:09:06.269 --> 04:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
things so first we have the fact that
 
04:09:09.109 --> 04:09:09.119 align:start position:0%
rights exist before and after the state
 
04:09:10.790 --> 04:09:10.800 align:start position:0%
they are not legitimated by the state
 
04:09:12.630 --> 04:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
nor provided by the state and because of
 
04:09:14.469 --> 04:09:14.479 align:start position:0%
that the state does not have the
 
04:09:17.830 --> 04:09:17.840 align:start position:0%
authority to take them from you
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
either goes on to establish the consent
 
04:09:24.429 --> 04:09:24.439 align:start position:0%
of the governed is the foundational
 
04:09:26.510 --> 04:09:26.520 align:start position:0%
principle for legitimating our
 
04:09:29.429 --> 04:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
government which is effectively what a
 
04:09:31.830 --> 04:09:31.840 align:start position:0%
republic is the consent of a govern
 
04:09:34.269 --> 04:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
legitimates a
 
04:09:37.550 --> 04:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
republic moving on we talk
 
04:09:37.560 --> 04:09:39.070 align:start position:0%
republic moving on we talk
about

04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:09:41.670 --> 04:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
the freedom from the official
 
04:09:43.710 --> 04:09:43.720 align:start position:0%
establishment of a state Church or
 
04:09:47.309 --> 04:09:47.319 align:start position:0%
coercion toward certain spiritual
 
04:09:50.630 --> 04:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
Dogma the freedom of speech and right to
 
04:09:53.030 --> 04:09:53.040 align:start position:0%
disseminate information in good faith
 
04:09:57.269 --> 04:09:57.279 align:start position:0%
that shall not be infringed directly by
 
04:10:00.469 --> 04:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
proxy nor subject to prosecution under
 
04:10:02.389 --> 04:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
hate crime statutes and the absence of a
 
04:10:03.830 --> 04:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
crime against persons or property so
 
04:10:06.109 --> 04:10:06.119 align:start position:0%
let's talk about this one for just a
 
04:10:09.309 --> 04:10:09.319 align:start position:0%
minute we have seen some very
 
04:10:09.319 --> 04:10:11.149 align:start position:0%
minute we have seen some very
significant

04:10:11.149 --> 04:10:11.159 align:start position:0%
significant
 
04:10:13.469 --> 04:10:13.479 align:start position:0%
transgressions against the rights to to
 
04:10:15.950 --> 04:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
free speech especially at the federal
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
level in the last perhaps
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
decade we have seen various federal
 
04:10:26.550 --> 04:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
agencies going through certain private
 
04:10:28.750 --> 04:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
companies social media companies
 
04:10:32.109 --> 04:10:32.119 align:start position:0%
especially to see American citizens
 
04:10:34.990 --> 04:10:35.000 align:start position:0%
censored and unable to spread whatever
 
04:10:37.349 --> 04:10:37.359 align:start position:0%
message that they wanted to spread on
 
04:10:39.950 --> 04:10:39.960 align:start position:0%
social media which is why that's where
 
04:10:42.109 --> 04:10:42.119 align:start position:0%
the byox part comes in it is an
 
04:10:45.269 --> 04:10:45.279 align:start position:0%
unfortunate um very unfortunate
 
04:10:47.750 --> 04:10:47.760 align:start position:0%
situation that the Supreme Court
 
04:10:52.590 --> 04:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
recently held that it was okay for the
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
government to censor by proxy to put
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
pressure on companies like Facebook or
 
04:10:59.670 --> 04:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
Twitter or others to see American
 
04:11:01.389 --> 04:11:01.399 align:start position:0%
citizen speech
 
04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
removed that never should have
 
04:11:06.870 --> 04:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
happened moving on to the part about the
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
hate crime
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
statutes we have a problem in this
 
04:11:15.630 --> 04:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
state now I'm particular fan of uh
 
04:11:19.469 --> 04:11:19.479 align:start position:0%
rather terrible white supremacist nazes
 
04:11:22.189 --> 04:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
groups they're pretty bad their ideology
 
04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
is pretty bad but because the rights of
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
free speech don't come from government
 
04:11:30.590 --> 04:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
they come from a Transcendent source and
 
04:11:33.030 --> 04:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
they cannot be taken by government even
 
04:11:34.550 --> 04:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
those people have the right to free
 
04:11:39.030 --> 04:11:39.040 align:start position:0%
speech and twice in the last few years
 
04:11:41.309 --> 04:11:41.319 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Justice
 
04:11:44.590 --> 04:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
has gone after one of these uh I forget
 
04:11:45.710 --> 04:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
the name over the top of my head one of
 
04:11:50.269 --> 04:11:50.279 align:start position:0%
these groups for speech
 
04:11:54.269 --> 04:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
crimes simply hanging a banner it said
 
04:11:56.429 --> 04:11:56.439 align:start position:0%
something horrible but you get to say
 
04:11:58.349 --> 04:11:58.359 align:start position:0%
something horrible because of free
 
04:12:02.229 --> 04:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
speech both times the New Hampshire doj
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
was laughed out of court and the New
 
04:12:08.269 --> 04:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court called the
 
04:12:10.510 --> 04:12:10.520 align:start position:0%
precedent that they were trying to set
 
04:12:14.429 --> 04:12:14.439 align:start position:0%
dangerous to free speech
 
04:12:17.109 --> 04:12:17.119 align:start position:0%
so it's important that we reiterate the
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
fact that people have the right to say
 
04:12:20.229 --> 04:12:20.239 align:start position:0%
things even bad things even things we
 
04:12:23.269 --> 04:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.910 --> 04:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
hear moving
 
04:12:29.349 --> 04:12:29.359 align:start position:0%
on the right to assemble and to receive
 
04:12:31.149 --> 04:12:31.159 align:start position:0%
reasonable protection from authorities
 
04:12:33.309 --> 04:12:33.319 align:start position:0%
against lawlessness and criminality in
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
such assembly unfortunately this is a
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
problem we've seen especially on college
 
04:12:41.750 --> 04:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
campuses where certain times for certain
 
04:12:45.189 --> 04:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
speakers they have refused to provide
 
04:12:47.389 --> 04:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
the necessary protection in place to
 
04:12:50.070 --> 04:12:50.080 align:start position:0%
allow events to go forward and you've
 
04:12:52.349 --> 04:12:52.359 align:start position:0%
had heckler's vetos where people shut
 
04:12:54.870 --> 04:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
people down and assaults were committed
 
04:12:57.309 --> 04:12:57.319 align:start position:0%
because there was not adequate despite
 
04:12:59.670 --> 04:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
forn knowledge of various protests that
 
04:13:00.910 --> 04:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
were going to happen there was not
 
04:13:04.790 --> 04:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:08.510 --> 04:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
place the right to bear arms and to self
 
04:13:10.469 --> 04:13:10.479 align:start position:0%
militia in defense of oneself one's
 
04:13:12.630 --> 04:13:12.640 align:start position:0%
family private property Community State
 
04:13:13.710 --> 04:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
nation and
 
04:13:16.429 --> 04:13:16.439 align:start position:0%
Liberties that no Soldier nor any person
 
04:13:18.389 --> 04:13:18.399 align:start position:0%
whatsoever shall be forcibly or
 
04:13:20.429 --> 04:13:20.439 align:start position:0%
coercively quartered in any house or
 
04:13:22.429 --> 04:13:22.439 align:start position:0%
home now that's another important little
 
04:13:24.710 --> 04:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
update that I'm adding in here because
 
04:13:28.070 --> 04:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution it's very clear
 
04:13:31.510 --> 04:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
that there shall not be any Soldier
 
04:13:34.229 --> 04:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
quartered in a private home without an
 
04:13:36.590 --> 04:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
act of Congress to do so but what we've
 
04:13:38.109 --> 04:13:38.119 align:start position:0%
seen recently is something that I don't
 
04:13:39.990 --> 04:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
think the founders actually anticipated
 
04:13:41.790 --> 04:13:41.800 align:start position:0%
we've seen places especially places like
 
04:13:44.189 --> 04:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and some other places
 
04:13:47.950 --> 04:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
actually looking to quarter uh various
 
04:13:50.510 --> 04:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
persons refugees Asylum Seekers illegal
 
04:13:54.189 --> 04:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
immigrants in private homes without the
 
04:13:57.149 --> 04:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
permission of the homeowners this is
 
04:13:59.750 --> 04:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
something that's been moving forward and
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
it we need to add this protection in
 
04:14:03.149 --> 04:14:03.159 align:start position:0%
place to make sure that it's clear that
 
04:14:06.590 --> 04:14:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:09.870 --> 04:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
that unreasonable search and seizure by
 
04:14:12.070 --> 04:14:12.080 align:start position:0%
all government entities by proxy of
 
04:14:14.189 --> 04:14:14.199 align:start position:0%
government or by any entity Furnishing
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
such knowledge to
 
04:14:17.590 --> 04:14:17.600 align:start position:0%
government the fourth amendment was
 
04:14:19.710 --> 04:14:19.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to be pretty clear and explicit
 
04:14:22.269 --> 04:14:22.279 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately we've had some
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
judicial precedence and frankly just
 
04:14:27.790 --> 04:14:27.800 align:start position:0%
ignoring of the law and you now have
 
04:14:29.590 --> 04:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
especially the federal
 
04:14:32.030 --> 04:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
government consistently spying on
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
American citizens including through the
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
purchase of meta data from third parties
 
04:14:39.429 --> 04:14:39.439 align:start position:0%
so that cell phone you have in your
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
pocket it's collecting data on you and
 
04:14:43.630 --> 04:14:43.640 align:start position:0%
the federal government is quite likely
 
04:14:45.910 --> 04:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
buying that data from your cell phone
 
04:14:48.630 --> 04:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
company in order to compile that data on
 
04:14:51.830 --> 04:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
you which ought to be viewed as a
 
04:14:56.269 --> 04:14:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:56.279 --> 04:14:57.870 align:start position:0%
 
rights

04:14:57.870 --> 04:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
rights
 
04:15:02.269 --> 04:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
here those are the big highlights I
 
04:15:05.870 --> 04:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to take up too much time but
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:17.510 --> 04:15:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:21.349 --> 04:15:21.359 align:start position:0%
as as I look at this and I am trying to
 
04:15:23.269 --> 04:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
project this forward to if it goes to
 
04:15:26.269 --> 04:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
the full floor depending upon what we do
 
04:15:30.790 --> 04:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
next week presumably if we exact this
 
04:15:33.910 --> 04:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
resolution um I'm seeing it is a little
 
04:15:33.920 --> 04:15:35.349 align:start position:0%
resolution um I'm seeing it is a little
bit

04:15:35.349 --> 04:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
bit
 
04:15:38.309 --> 04:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
esoteric um
 
04:15:43.870 --> 04:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm anticipating people um saying
 
04:15:46.670 --> 04:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
what does that mean what do natural
 
04:15:48.950 --> 04:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
rights mean and I read it and reread it
 
04:15:50.510 --> 04:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm and I'm just like I said I'm
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
trying to anticipate questions for us or
 
04:15:55.550 --> 04:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:15:57.870 --> 04:15:57.880 align:start position:0%
uh what this is about I understand a
 
04:15:59.429 --> 04:15:59.439 align:start position:0%
little bit better thank you for for
 
04:16:01.630 --> 04:16:01.640 align:start position:0%
introducing it helped have some specific
 
04:16:03.790 --> 04:16:03.800 align:start position:0%
examples which you you
 
04:16:08.910 --> 04:16:08.920 align:start position:0%
provided um so the essence is that a a
 
04:16:11.469 --> 04:16:11.479 align:start position:0%
natural right is not derived from the
 
04:16:13.510 --> 04:16:13.520 align:start position:0%
state you you said that
 
04:16:15.590 --> 04:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
correct and I I wasn't sure how deep
 
04:16:17.349 --> 04:16:17.359 align:start position:0%
down the particular philosophy roote we
 
04:16:18.630 --> 04:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to go here but I'll just touch on
 
04:16:20.790 --> 04:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
it briefly
 
04:16:24.750 --> 04:16:24.760 align:start position:0%
so rights are going to be considered
 
04:16:26.870 --> 04:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
either derived from a Transcendent
 
04:16:30.109 --> 04:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
Source or an imminent Source if it's a
 
04:16:31.870 --> 04:16:31.880 align:start position:0%
Transcendent Source we're saying like
 
04:16:33.830 --> 04:16:33.840 align:start position:0%
our Founders said in the Declaration of
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
Independence they come from the our
 
04:16:38.229 --> 04:16:38.239 align:start position:0%
creator they come from God an eminent
 
04:16:40.269 --> 04:16:40.279 align:start position:0%
Source if you go look at the philosophy
 
04:16:42.870 --> 04:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
of uh such as German idealist Hegel who
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
marks built his philosophy off of
 
04:16:47.469 --> 04:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
considers the state to take that role of
 
04:16:50.990 --> 04:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
being like God and giving those rights
 
04:16:53.469 --> 04:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
the problem is when the state takes that
 
04:16:56.790 --> 04:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
position and it is seen as not merely
 
04:16:59.309 --> 04:16:59.319 align:start position:0%
affirming and upholding rights but the
 
04:17:02.269 --> 04:17:02.279 align:start position:0%
originator of Rights well then the state
 
04:17:04.510 --> 04:17:04.520 align:start position:0%
can change its mind and it can take
 
04:17:07.830 --> 04:17:07.840 align:start position:0%
those rights and that's a little bit of
 
04:17:09.070 --> 04:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
the situation that we're finding
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
ourselves moving toward where our
 
04:17:13.750 --> 04:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
government are for of government has
 
04:17:16.309 --> 04:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
been slowly transitioned over an rather
 
04:17:19.429 --> 04:17:19.439 align:start position:0%
extended period of time away from a
 
04:17:21.389 --> 04:17:21.399 align:start position:0%
Transcendent natural source of rights
 
04:17:22.670 --> 04:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
where the rights are inherent to the
 
04:17:26.950 --> 04:17:26.960 align:start position:0%
person existing separate from the state
 
04:17:31.830 --> 04:17:31.840 align:start position:0%
versus they exist at the pleasure of the
 
04:17:35.510 --> 04:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
state thank you for that line eight
 
04:17:39.189 --> 04:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
refers to our create our creator and
 
04:17:40.670 --> 04:17:40.680 align:start position:0%
that's language that's in the
 
04:17:41.830 --> 04:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
Declaration of
 
04:17:43.910 --> 04:17:43.920 align:start position:0%
Independence again looking forward I'm
 
04:17:47.389 --> 04:17:47.399 align:start position:0%
wondering if there may be any folks in
 
04:17:50.030 --> 04:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
the house who if they read this or in
 
04:17:53.269 --> 04:17:53.279 align:start position:0%
committee who read this who if they are
 
04:17:55.990 --> 04:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
agnostic or atheistic or whatever are
 
04:17:58.030 --> 04:17:58.040 align:start position:0%
they going to have a problem with of
 
04:18:01.229 --> 04:18:01.239 align:start position:0%
course this is a resolution it's not
 
04:18:03.189 --> 04:18:03.199 align:start position:0%
wording that'll be in
 
04:18:06.670 --> 04:18:06.680 align:start position:0%
statute uh potentially so the notion of
 
04:18:09.269 --> 04:18:09.279 align:start position:0%
our creator uh is that anything that you
 
04:18:12.469 --> 04:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
see as being an issue moving forward um
 
04:18:13.750 --> 04:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
well that that's a good question it
 
04:18:15.910 --> 04:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
could be an issue going forward but it's
 
04:18:18.710 --> 04:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
100% necessary to be there because as I
 
04:18:21.550 --> 04:18:21.560 align:start position:0%
said going back to the the philosophy of
 
04:18:23.269 --> 04:18:23.279 align:start position:0%
right the philosophy where rights are
 
04:18:25.870 --> 04:18:25.880 align:start position:0%
derived from there's really only two
 
04:18:28.590 --> 04:18:28.600 align:start position:0%
primary tracts there's the tract based
 
04:18:32.109 --> 04:18:32.119 align:start position:0%
on the American tradition which is a
 
04:18:33.790 --> 04:18:33.800 align:start position:0%
tradition based off of the Protestant
 
04:18:36.429 --> 04:18:36.439 align:start position:0%
Reformation and the enlightenment that
 
04:18:38.630 --> 04:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
says that our rights come from God the
 
04:18:42.550 --> 04:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
other tradition is the tradition that is
 
04:18:45.269 --> 04:18:45.279 align:start position:0%
it self actually esoteric it comes from
 
04:18:47.670 --> 04:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
the ideas of Plato of the ideas of
 
04:18:50.109 --> 04:18:50.119 align:start position:0%
Aristotle the ideas of Hegel the ideas
 
04:18:53.389 --> 04:18:53.399 align:start position:0%
of Marx that says that actually this
 
04:18:55.710 --> 04:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
there is no such thing as rights because
 
04:18:57.710 --> 04:18:57.720 align:start position:0%
there is no Transcendent source and
 
04:18:59.830 --> 04:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
therefore the government doesn't have to
 
04:18:59.840 --> 04:19:02.149 align:start position:0%
therefore the government doesn't have to
respect

04:19:02.149 --> 04:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
respect
 
04:19:04.910 --> 04:19:04.920 align:start position:0%
them thank you for that the committee is
 
04:19:07.070 --> 04:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
going to have a week to process and
 
04:19:11.030 --> 04:19:11.040 align:start position:0%
digest and Ponder uh and we're here just
 
04:19:13.229 --> 04:19:13.239 align:start position:0%
to listen to you um so so thank you for
 
04:19:14.429 --> 04:19:14.439 align:start position:0%
taking out a couple of questions
 
04:19:18.429 --> 04:19:18.439 align:start position:0%
representative Foss thank you thank you
 
04:19:21.670 --> 04:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
well uh if we can get a little political
 
04:19:24.309 --> 04:19:24.319 align:start position:0%
philosophical um you said there are two
 
04:19:28.910 --> 04:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
main tracks but it don't we know from
 
04:19:32.349 --> 04:19:32.359 align:start position:0%
people like uh RS or nosic or um you
 
04:19:33.389 --> 04:19:33.399 align:start position:0%
know the whole philosophy of
 
04:19:35.510 --> 04:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
utilitarianism there's actually a lot of
 
04:19:38.109 --> 04:19:38.119 align:start position:0%
different ideas of where rights come
 
04:19:40.590 --> 04:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
from so this would seem to be giving us
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
a really strong political philosophical
 
04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
a a state stance rather uh so is that
 
04:19:53.990 --> 04:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
uh is that not a rather
 
04:19:56.670 --> 04:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
overreach um so no no it's not an
 
04:19:59.070 --> 04:19:59.080 align:start position:0%
overreach and it's not an overreach for
 
04:20:00.990 --> 04:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
no other reason than the language is
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
taken directly from the founding
 
04:20:05.670 --> 04:20:05.680 align:start position:0%
documents of America but to your point
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
about utilitarianism and others yes
 
04:20:10.750 --> 04:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
there have been numerous over the years
 
04:20:15.149 --> 04:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
attempts to craft a philosophy to
 
04:20:17.710 --> 04:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
legitimate the concept of Rights without
 
04:20:21.389 --> 04:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
a Transcendent source and as nii V very
 
04:20:25.590 --> 04:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
clearly it's not possible you cannot you
 
04:20:28.870 --> 04:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
cannot legitimate a source of rights
 
04:20:30.630 --> 04:20:30.640 align:start position:0%
that is not something that can be taken
 
04:20:36.550 --> 04:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:38.870 --> 04:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
Transcendent I think folks watching at
 
04:20:44.469 --> 04:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
home are Googling nitki Hegel uh
 
04:20:45.830 --> 04:20:45.840 align:start position:0%
we all know who he's talking about I'm
 
04:20:48.269 --> 04:20:48.279 align:start position:0%
sure but uh uh I need to do a little bit
 
04:20:50.790 --> 04:20:50.800 align:start position:0%
of homework myself on some of this uh
 
04:20:52.269 --> 04:20:52.279 align:start position:0%
this thank you for that question ripson
 
04:20:54.950 --> 04:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
f f is there a
 
04:20:59.109 --> 04:20:59.119 align:start position:0%
followup I feel like that would get uh
 
04:21:00.510 --> 04:21:00.520 align:start position:0%
actually I think I took a whole semester
 
04:21:02.990 --> 04:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
of political philosophy so uh if you
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
want to Joint teach a class with h two
 
04:21:07.630 --> 04:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
different perspectives then uh but I
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
think it's beyond the uh five minutes we
 
04:21:13.269 --> 04:21:13.279 align:start position:0%
have scheduled sure uh
 
04:21:15.550 --> 04:21:15.560 align:start position:0%
so beyond if there's more questions
 
04:21:17.630 --> 04:21:17.640 align:start position:0%
we'll take them our role here today
 
04:21:19.750 --> 04:21:19.760 align:start position:0%
really is to listen to you uh if there's
 
04:21:21.469 --> 04:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
anything that we have a question about
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
we've already given you a couple uh like
 
04:21:25.630 --> 04:21:25.640 align:start position:0%
I said we'll have a week to process this
 
04:21:28.070 --> 04:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then in executive session next week
 
04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
I think some some of the uh thought some
 
04:21:35.510 --> 04:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
thoughts that may uh Blossom uh once we
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
process and and reread this and and
 
04:21:40.950 --> 04:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
maybe even Google a couple of things uh
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
we'll have a I think be a very
 
04:21:45.590 --> 04:21:45.600 align:start position:0%
interesting exec session on this house
 
04:21:49.469 --> 04:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
joint resolution which if it pass the if
 
04:21:51.670 --> 04:21:51.680 align:start position:0%
it passes the house the way that works
 
04:21:53.070 --> 04:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
is it would go to the Senate and the
 
04:21:55.870 --> 04:21:55.880 align:start position:0%
governor is involved in an hjr
 
04:22:00.309 --> 04:22:00.319 align:start position:0%
correct so uh other questions for the
 
04:22:02.469 --> 04:22:02.479 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor of this
 
04:22:05.469 --> 04:22:05.479 align:start position:0%
hjr representative mandal bomb uh thank
 
04:22:07.670 --> 04:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um and thanks for taking
 
04:22:11.070 --> 04:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
my question representative Belcher so I
 
04:22:13.870 --> 04:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
know this is a resolution um so it's
 
04:22:16.950 --> 04:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a different standard than our
 
04:22:19.670 --> 04:22:19.680 align:start position:0%
house bills are I'm just curious kind of
 
04:22:22.550 --> 04:22:22.560 align:start position:0%
how much leeway you see in within these
 
04:22:25.510 --> 04:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
rights I'm just thinking about um I
 
04:22:27.750 --> 04:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
think one notable one that's mentioned
 
04:22:29.710 --> 04:22:29.720 align:start position:0%
is the right to Bel to bear arms and
 
04:22:32.910 --> 04:22:32.920 align:start position:0%
self militia and defense and we've had
 
04:22:36.030 --> 04:22:36.040 align:start position:0%
some some bills related to Firearms
 
04:22:39.269 --> 04:22:39.279 align:start position:0%
recently um and I think there are some
 
04:22:43.070 --> 04:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
folks who think that
 
04:22:46.710 --> 04:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
putting um what they see to be
 
04:22:49.870 --> 04:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
reasonable um like safety regulations
 
04:22:53.030 --> 04:22:53.040 align:start position:0%
around around Firearms is infringing
 
04:22:56.389 --> 04:22:56.399 align:start position:0%
upon that right I mean does is there
 
04:22:59.630 --> 04:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
room within kind of this text from your
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
perspective to accommodate different
 
04:23:04.309 --> 04:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
perspectives related to what these
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
rights are thank you for the question
 
04:23:09.109 --> 04:23:09.119 align:start position:0%
excuse me thank you for the question I
 
04:23:10.990 --> 04:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
certainly did not expect this to be
 
04:23:14.910 --> 04:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
uncontroversial or um universally
 
04:23:18.189 --> 04:23:18.199 align:start position:0%
supported um as far as your specific
 
04:23:21.870 --> 04:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
example it would be my uh contention and
 
04:23:23.550 --> 04:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
based on the history of the Second
 
04:23:25.469 --> 04:23:25.479 align:start position:0%
Amendment right in the United States
 
04:23:28.109 --> 04:23:28.119 align:start position:0%
that there are relatively few reasonable
 
04:23:29.670 --> 04:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
restrictions that can be placed on it
 
04:23:32.870 --> 04:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
for instance when uh a privateer wrote
 
04:23:34.630 --> 04:23:34.640 align:start position:0%
Thomas Jefferson for permission to put
 
04:23:37.189 --> 04:23:37.199 align:start position:0%
cannons on his vessel Thomas Jefferson
 
04:23:39.109 --> 04:23:39.119 align:start position:0%
wrote back scolding him for even
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
bothering because the Second Amendment
 
04:23:43.590 --> 04:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
covered that up until the first world
 
04:23:46.710 --> 04:23:46.720 align:start position:0%
war every conflict in America was fought
 
04:23:50.429 --> 04:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
primarily with private arms and and uh
 
04:23:51.910 --> 04:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
as well as private
 
04:23:54.510 --> 04:23:54.520 align:start position:0%
artillery uh so there's a long
 
04:23:57.590 --> 04:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
historical precedent there thank
 
04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
you follow up um I mean just to to be a
 
04:24:02.910 --> 04:24:02.920 align:start position:0%
little bit more specific I was thinking
 
04:24:07.109 --> 04:24:07.119 align:start position:0%
about how um there's recently a bill
 
04:24:10.149 --> 04:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
that um didn't even make it out of
 
04:24:15.990 --> 04:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
um on background checks for firearms
 
04:24:24.590 --> 04:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
and I think some folks do see that as a
 
04:24:27.790 --> 04:24:27.800 align:start position:0%
infringing upon their rights to bear
 
04:24:27.800 --> 04:24:30.189 align:start position:0%
infringing upon their rights to bear
arms

04:24:30.189 --> 04:24:30.199 align:start position:0%
arms
 
04:24:32.870 --> 04:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
and I I'm just
 
04:24:35.510 --> 04:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
curious like with holding that
 
04:24:38.189 --> 04:24:38.199 align:start position:0%
perspective or holding the perspective
 
04:24:41.630 --> 04:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
that you know having a wait time or
 
04:24:44.710 --> 04:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
running a certain background check is
 
04:24:48.109 --> 04:24:48.119 align:start position:0%
that is that would that would holding
 
04:24:52.710 --> 04:24:52.720 align:start position:0%
that view be in contradiction of of this
 
04:24:55.229 --> 04:24:55.239 align:start position:0%
resolution thank you for the question
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
those are a little bit more nuanced
 
04:24:58.349 --> 04:24:58.359 align:start position:0%
they're a little bit more difficult to
 
04:25:01.149 --> 04:25:01.159 align:start position:0%
to pin down in terms of this resolution
 
04:25:05.149 --> 04:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
um right off the bat I would say that
 
04:25:08.149 --> 04:25:08.159 align:start position:0%
historically given the precedents that
 
04:25:11.269 --> 04:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
exist there is an argument to be made
 
04:25:13.429 --> 04:25:13.439 align:start position:0%
that background check are not something
 
04:25:16.070 --> 04:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
that was meant to be in place however
 
04:25:18.469 --> 04:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
there was also the fact that if you were
 
04:25:20.269 --> 04:25:20.279 align:start position:0%
considered to be too dangerous to have a
 
04:25:22.070 --> 04:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
firearm you would have either been kept
 
04:25:24.630 --> 04:25:24.640 align:start position:0%
in jail or an asylum so there's there's
 
04:25:27.149 --> 04:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
a bit of a a bit of a push and pull
 
04:25:29.910 --> 04:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
there as far as that goes so I I can't I
 
04:25:32.309 --> 04:25:32.319 align:start position:0%
don't think I can say definitely Which
 
04:25:34.950 --> 04:25:34.960 align:start position:0%
Way those would go under under this
 
04:25:34.960 --> 04:25:37.950 align:start position:0%
Way those would go under under this
concept

04:25:37.950 --> 04:25:37.960 align:start position:0%
concept
 
04:25:40.229 --> 04:25:40.239 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's that's the best I could
 
04:25:42.910 --> 04:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
do on that one than
 
04:25:45.149 --> 04:25:45.159 align:start position:0%
representative cyber I actually have a
 
04:25:46.550 --> 04:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
question you might be able but the
 
04:25:48.269 --> 04:25:48.279 align:start position:0%
chairman might be able to address it as
 
04:25:50.030 --> 04:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
well as far as I've been in this
 
04:25:52.510 --> 04:25:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee I don't remember us having an
 
04:25:55.030 --> 04:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
hjr could you please explain the
 
04:25:57.630 --> 04:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
difference between that and like the
 
04:26:00.109 --> 04:26:00.119 align:start position:0%
HCR I could take that if you don't mind
 
04:26:03.550 --> 04:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
uh so the the big difference is this
 
04:26:06.510 --> 04:26:06.520 align:start position:0%
goes if it passes this house this would
 
04:26:08.830 --> 04:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and if it passes the
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
Senate it would go to the governor and
 
04:26:12.950 --> 04:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
unlike a
 
04:26:15.550 --> 04:26:15.560 align:start position:0%
the resolu other resolutions you've seen
 
04:26:18.070 --> 04:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
this if going through that whole process
 
04:26:20.710 --> 04:26:20.720 align:start position:0%
just like a bill would be treated as
 
04:26:22.590 --> 04:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
having the effect of
 
04:26:27.830 --> 04:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
law so it's oh sorry um
 
04:26:30.870 --> 04:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
um so I I mean I get that I'm just say
 
04:26:32.389 --> 04:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
like so why wouldn't we just call it a
 
04:26:32.399 --> 04:26:34.870 align:start position:0%
like so why wouldn't we just call it a
bill

04:26:34.870 --> 04:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:26:38.790 --> 04:26:38.800 align:start position:0%
or well to your point representative a
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
bill would be something that would go
 
04:26:42.349 --> 04:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
into statute is I think I touched on
 
04:26:44.830 --> 04:26:44.840 align:start position:0%
that earlier in a resolution does not
 
04:26:49.109 --> 04:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
become law it's a sense of the body so
 
04:26:51.790 --> 04:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
we've had uh a number of resolutions uh
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
some that passed some that don't if it
 
04:26:57.990 --> 04:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
gets a majority vote uh HR is just the
 
04:27:01.990 --> 04:27:02.000 align:start position:0%
house HCR goes to the Senate and as we
 
04:27:03.950 --> 04:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
just talked about hjr involves the
 
04:27:09.269 --> 04:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
governor so did the force of law I I if
 
04:27:12.349 --> 04:27:12.359 align:start position:0%
the governor signs an hjr it's it's not
 
04:27:15.990 --> 04:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
a law but it's it's as the imprimer of
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
the legislature and the executive branch
 
04:27:21.590 --> 04:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
is supporting the Notions expressed in
 
04:27:25.630 --> 04:27:25.640 align:start position:0%
the resolution fear to say it's not a
 
04:27:28.309 --> 04:27:28.319 align:start position:0%
law it's not a proposed
 
04:27:30.910 --> 04:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
law followup yeah a quick little
 
04:27:32.550 --> 04:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
followup I'm just curious so I mean I
 
04:27:34.550 --> 04:27:34.560 align:start position:0%
get all that I was just curious is it I
 
04:27:36.550 --> 04:27:36.560 align:start position:0%
guess what I meant is is it enforcable
 
04:27:39.349 --> 04:27:39.359 align:start position:0%
in any way is it able to like pull it up
 
04:27:42.710 --> 04:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
as a precedent or be referred to saying
 
04:27:44.590 --> 04:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
like a court case or
 
04:27:47.309 --> 04:27:47.319 align:start position:0%
anything I could take that one yes uh
 
04:27:50.670 --> 04:27:50.680 align:start position:0%
yes it is um it is not it is not a bill
 
04:27:52.910 --> 04:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
so it is not a law in terms of it would
 
04:27:54.790 --> 04:27:54.800 align:start position:0%
go into the books in the same way the
 
04:27:57.269 --> 04:27:57.279 align:start position:0%
law would but under the New Hampshire
 
04:28:00.269 --> 04:28:00.279 align:start position:0%
Constitution it is treated as having the
 
04:28:02.189 --> 04:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
effect of
 
04:28:06.590 --> 04:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
law so next week we will hear a couple
 
04:28:08.950 --> 04:28:08.960 align:start position:0%
of resolutions uh the Jones act being
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
one of them that I I'm have been
 
04:28:13.229 --> 04:28:13.239 align:start position:0%
involved with in we did this last year
 
04:28:16.349 --> 04:28:16.359 align:start position:0%
you'll recall and that was very specific
 
04:28:18.950 --> 04:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
we wanted to have this resolution move
 
04:28:21.149 --> 04:28:21.159 align:start position:0%
forward calling for the Jones act to be
 
04:28:24.510 --> 04:28:24.520 align:start position:0%
repealed so that's a very narrow
 
04:28:27.070 --> 04:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
specific uh resolution repeal the Jones
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
act it passes or doesn't or gets gets
 
04:28:33.590 --> 04:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
tabled um so this case as I said right
 
04:28:35.149 --> 04:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
up front it's a little more broader
 
04:28:38.750 --> 04:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
esoteric and I'm trying to uh
 
04:28:40.870 --> 04:28:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh understand the intent in the
 
04:28:44.189 --> 04:28:44.199 align:start position:0%
background and I I need to do some more
 
04:28:46.109 --> 04:28:46.119 align:start position:0%
reading on it and I may have some more
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
questions representative beler if this
 
04:28:51.790 --> 04:28:51.800 align:start position:0%
does move forward will you please be the
 
04:28:54.630 --> 04:28:54.640 align:start position:0%
one that speaks to it on the house floor
 
04:28:57.429 --> 04:28:57.439 align:start position:0%
yes I would be happy to okay and I and
 
04:29:00.109 --> 04:29:00.119 align:start position:0%
if someone wants to speak against it uh
 
04:29:02.550 --> 04:29:02.560 align:start position:0%
you have plenty of time to uh to work it
 
04:29:06.950 --> 04:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
up uh repon Foss you have a hand up I do
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
um sorry to get back to the the theory
 
04:29:12.510 --> 04:29:12.520 align:start position:0%
of Rights if the this perspective AC IST
 
04:29:15.630 --> 04:29:15.640 align:start position:0%
that they come from a Transcendent
 
04:29:19.070 --> 04:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
source is it and but isn't that
 
04:29:22.429 --> 04:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
inherently contradictory with the free
 
04:29:24.510 --> 04:29:24.520 align:start position:0%
exercise of religion and if we're saying
 
04:29:27.950 --> 04:29:27.960 align:start position:0%
that this is the position of the state
 
04:29:30.990 --> 04:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
as a us as a representative body of the
 
04:29:32.990 --> 04:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
state that rights come from a
 
04:29:36.389 --> 04:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
Transcendent Source isn't that
 
04:29:39.429 --> 04:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
inherently uh putting forth as an
 
04:29:42.030 --> 04:29:42.040 align:start position:0%
official state position that there is a
 
04:29:44.590 --> 04:29:44.600 align:start position:0%
Transcendent Source from which our
 
04:29:47.189 --> 04:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
rights could come so isn't that kind of
 
04:29:49.950 --> 04:29:49.960 align:start position:0%
an internal contradiction no it's not an
 
04:29:52.870 --> 04:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
internal contradiction uh no more so
 
04:29:54.790 --> 04:29:54.800 align:start position:0%
than the founding documents of America
 
04:29:57.510 --> 04:29:57.520 align:start position:0%
are that cited in the exact same
 
04:30:00.070 --> 04:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
language the Creator is the source of
 
04:30:02.950 --> 04:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
these rights um because what you're what
 
04:30:05.670 --> 04:30:05.680 align:start position:0%
you're effectively saying is that there
 
04:30:08.870 --> 04:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
is a source of these rights that exists
 
04:30:11.510 --> 04:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
outside of government and it's not
 
04:30:13.710 --> 04:30:13.720 align:start position:0%
coming from government so the government
 
04:30:15.790 --> 04:30:15.800 align:start position:0%
therefore because it didn't create them
 
04:30:19.590 --> 04:30:19.600 align:start position:0%
it can't take them away either uh but
 
04:30:21.710 --> 04:30:21.720 align:start position:0%
that said you move on to the right to
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
the free exercise clause and there's no
 
04:30:26.429 --> 04:30:26.439 align:start position:0%
contradiction that you can you can have
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
an affirmative right to the freedom of
 
04:30:30.630 --> 04:30:30.640 align:start position:0%
exercise of religion and no compulsion
 
04:30:32.990 --> 04:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
to the exercise of religion under the
 
04:30:35.149 --> 04:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
standard that there is also a
 
04:30:38.910 --> 04:30:38.920 align:start position:0%
Transcendent source for that right
 
04:30:41.790 --> 04:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
too so that's a good question question
 
04:30:44.469 --> 04:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
that helps to clarify what this is all
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
about uh it's starting almost to touch
 
04:30:49.229 --> 04:30:49.239 align:start position:0%
on a little bit of what an executive
 
04:30:52.229 --> 04:30:52.239 align:start position:0%
session might entail in terms of uh
 
04:30:56.189 --> 04:30:56.199 align:start position:0%
drilling down into what we want to do or
 
04:30:57.990 --> 04:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that's kind of what I'm
 
04:31:01.109 --> 04:31:01.119 align:start position:0%
sensing here uh but uh representa manal
 
04:31:03.630 --> 04:31:03.640 align:start position:0%
bomb go go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
04:31:04.910 --> 04:31:04.920 align:start position:0%
um and thank you representative for
 
04:31:06.550 --> 04:31:06.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
04:31:11.229 --> 04:31:11.239 align:start position:0%
so um a this is more of a request than a
 
04:31:15.510 --> 04:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
question um but and you know this might
 
04:31:17.469 --> 04:31:17.479 align:start position:0%
be something I have to do in my own and
 
04:31:18.990 --> 04:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if it's reasonable to ask
 
04:31:23.790 --> 04:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
you but I'd be curious um I mean you say
 
04:31:26.070 --> 04:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
that these rights are enumerated in part
 
04:31:27.590 --> 04:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
in the New Hampshire Constitution the
 
04:31:29.469 --> 04:31:29.479 align:start position:0%
Federal Constitution and the Bill of
 
04:31:32.189 --> 04:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
Rights and I would just be curious where
 
04:31:34.429 --> 04:31:34.439 align:start position:0%
these different pieces of the resolution
 
04:31:39.630 --> 04:31:39.640 align:start position:0%
are coming from um and in what way the
 
04:31:41.389 --> 04:31:41.399 align:start position:0%
language might differ or are you taking
 
04:31:43.870 --> 04:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
things directly from say the Bill of
 
04:31:48.229 --> 04:31:48.239 align:start position:0%
Rights um because I I feel like there's
 
04:31:50.670 --> 04:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
a difference perhaps
 
04:31:50.680 --> 04:31:52.550 align:start position:0%
a difference perhaps
between

04:31:52.550 --> 04:31:52.560 align:start position:0%
between
 
04:31:56.910 --> 04:31:56.920 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of reiterating the rights
 
04:31:56.920 --> 04:31:59.389 align:start position:0%
um uh kind of reiterating the rights
that

04:31:59.389 --> 04:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:32:02.710 --> 04:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
are um that are kind of out there and
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
using that exact text versus kind of
 
04:32:10.070 --> 04:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
taking the like the sentiment around the
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
text yes that that's a very good
 
04:32:15.910 --> 04:32:15.920 align:start position:0%
question so the source is variable some
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the language is taken directly from a
 
04:32:19.550 --> 04:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
founding documents the Declaration of
 
04:32:20.750 --> 04:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
Independence the
 
04:32:24.229 --> 04:32:24.239 align:start position:0%
Constitutions uh some of it is taken um
 
04:32:26.830 --> 04:32:26.840 align:start position:0%
either in whole or at least paraphrasing
 
04:32:28.510 --> 04:32:28.520 align:start position:0%
from The Federalist Papers and other
 
04:32:31.070 --> 04:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
debates leading up to the Constitutional
 
04:32:35.269 --> 04:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
Convention and some of it is taken from
 
04:32:39.229 --> 04:32:39.239 align:start position:0%
the the concept itself so for instance
 
04:32:42.429 --> 04:32:42.439 align:start position:0%
where we have the idea that where we
 
04:32:44.590 --> 04:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
have the idea that Free Speech ought to
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
also prevent government from telling
 
04:32:51.149 --> 04:32:51.159 align:start position:0%
social media companies to censor you is
 
04:32:53.309 --> 04:32:53.319 align:start position:0%
going it's not something that is
 
04:32:56.030 --> 04:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
directly found in the First Amendment as
 
04:32:58.309 --> 04:32:58.319 align:start position:0%
written in the letter but it is
 
04:32:59.630 --> 04:32:59.640 align:start position:0%
something that can be reasonably
 
04:33:01.309 --> 04:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
articulated from the spirit of the First
 
04:33:04.230 --> 04:33:04.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment or the principle behind
 
04:33:09.070 --> 04:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:12.390 --> 04:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative go ahead uh thank
 
04:33:15.349 --> 04:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so representative uh in
 
04:33:19.789 --> 04:33:19.799 align:start position:0%
your testimony you said people have
 
04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
right to say whatever message they want
 
04:33:25.990 --> 04:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
to share whatever messages don't don't
 
04:33:29.750 --> 04:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
you think if a person calls for violence
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
wouldn't that be a
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for the question so
 
04:33:37.230 --> 04:33:37.240 align:start position:0%
they they have a right to free speech
 
04:33:40.230 --> 04:33:40.240 align:start position:0%
but there are things that you can say
 
04:33:41.910 --> 04:33:41.920 align:start position:0%
noises you can make when you move your
 
04:33:44.230 --> 04:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
mouth that don't technically qualify as
 
04:33:47.590 --> 04:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
speech uh such exclusions include true
 
04:33:49.869 --> 04:33:49.879 align:start position:0%
threats incitement to
 
04:33:53.510 --> 04:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
violence um defamation of character so
 
04:33:55.029 --> 04:33:55.039 align:start position:0%
these these are some exception
 
04:33:56.949 --> 04:33:56.959 align:start position:0%
categories that are not free speech
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
because they're actually um they're
 
04:34:02.551 --> 04:34:02.561 align:start position:0%
actually a criminal or civil offense
 
04:34:04.830 --> 04:34:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
04:34:07.869 --> 04:34:07.879 align:start position:0%
questions seeing No Hands uh thank you
 
04:34:09.910 --> 04:34:09.920 align:start position:0%

earlier we're going to have a a
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%

04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
not so confrontational in some matters
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
but um this this body has always been
 
04:36:30.910 --> 04:36:30.920 align:start position:0%
very good to me um I'm also a veteran

six years in the US Army um did three
 
04:37:00.189 --> 04:37:00.199 align:start position:0%
tours um so familiar with what veterans
 
04:37:01.709 --> 04:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
go through when they come back and
 
04:37:03.310 --> 04:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
transition back into this life and the
 
04:37:05.910 --> 04:37:05.920 align:start position:0%
challenges that a lot of them face um
 
04:37:07.590 --> 04:37:07.600 align:start position:0%

service members and their families the
 
04:37:25.590 --> 04:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
endgame is that we will have created a
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
center of excellence for our veterans
 
04:37:28.949 --> 04:37:28.959 align:start position:0%

holistic support housing Workforce
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
Development Behavioral Health
 
04:37:39.789 --> 04:37:39.799 align:start position:0%
recreational activities substance use

treatment and other social services
 
04:37:44.709 --> 04:37:44.719 align:start position:0%
in order to ensure long-term stability
 
04:37:46.390 --> 04:37:46.400 align:start position:0%
and SEC and success for those who have
 
04:37:48.590 --> 04:37:48.600 align:start position:0%
sacrificed so much for our nation so
 
04:37:50.189 --> 04:37:50.199 align:start position:0%
current progress Nick if you don't mind
 
04:37:52.429 --> 04:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
holding that map up I'd appreciate it so
 
04:37:54.629 --> 04:37:54.639 align:start position:0%
as most of you be aware in Fall of 2022
 
04:37:57.269 --> 04:37:57.279 align:start position:0%
EA seals received $23 million in state
 
04:37:59.429 --> 04:37:59.439 align:start position:0%
oper funding to develop and build the
 
04:38:02.310 --> 04:38:02.320 align:start position:0%
campus on a 15 Acre Site in Franklin
 
04:38:05.869 --> 04:38:05.879 align:start position:0%
excuse me uh we can see the the uh the
 
04:38:07.869 --> 04:38:07.879 align:start position:0%
map but if you could hold it right next
 
04:38:10.189 --> 04:38:10.199 align:start position:0%
to the speaker right next to Al so that
 
04:38:13.590 --> 04:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
the folks can see get a sense on TV what
 
04:38:14.750 --> 04:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about and if you can
 
04:38:16.269 --> 04:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
move it just a little closer to the
 
04:38:18.789 --> 04:38:18.799 align:start position:0%
speaker so that some of that can get on
 
04:38:21.910 --> 04:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
the on TV uh thank you go ahead go ahead
 
04:38:24.310 --> 04:38:24.320 align:start position:0%
thanks Nick all right so phase one of
 
04:38:26.629 --> 04:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
the project will be completed in June of
 
04:38:28.830 --> 04:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
this year and by phase one that's going
 
04:38:31.150 --> 04:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
to be 29 units of permanent affordable
 
04:38:34.150 --> 04:38:34.160 align:start position:0%
housing for Veterans um of those 29
 
04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
units five of them will be two bedroom
 
04:38:39.590 --> 04:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
15 of that 29 will be eligible for the
 
04:38:42.269 --> 04:38:42.279 align:start position:0%
VA bash program so the the the amount
 
04:38:44.830 --> 04:38:44.840 align:start position:0%
that the veteran or their family has to
 
04:38:46.510 --> 04:38:46.520 align:start position:0%
pay will be greatly reduced I think it's
 
04:38:48.551 --> 04:38:48.561 align:start position:0%
at about a 30% that they'll be
 
04:38:52.429 --> 04:38:52.439 align:start position:0%
responsible for so 15 of those are um
 
04:38:54.230 --> 04:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
very very affordable for
 
04:38:57.310 --> 04:38:57.320 align:start position:0%
veterans um part of that phase two so
 
04:38:59.629 --> 04:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
that housing will be right here and you
 
04:39:01.830 --> 04:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
have a map in your packet will be these
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
two buildings right here that have been
 
04:39:06.869 --> 04:39:06.879 align:start position:0%
completely rehabbed um gutted right down
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
um so those are um and this whole
 
04:39:10.629 --> 04:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
Project's being done by procon
 
04:39:13.310 --> 04:39:13.320 align:start position:0%
Construction agre partner so that's
 
04:39:15.789 --> 04:39:15.799 align:start position:0%
those two are phase one for June across
 
04:39:17.709 --> 04:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
the street on your map you see a hub of
 
04:39:21.070 --> 04:39:21.080 align:start position:0%
services and a retreat center um and
 
04:39:22.551 --> 04:39:22.561 align:start position:0%
that's going to have meeting and event
 
04:39:26.070 --> 04:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
space um the goal here is to have space
 
04:39:27.551 --> 04:39:27.561 align:start position:0%
for all of our veteran service
 
04:39:30.629 --> 04:39:30.639 align:start position:0%
organizations to come to the campus um
 
04:39:32.949 --> 04:39:32.959 align:start position:0%
on a you know we don't we don't expect
 
04:39:35.750 --> 04:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
all the vsos to live there but the goal
 
04:39:39.350 --> 04:39:39.360 align:start position:0%
is to have a um a good Rhythm when
 
04:39:40.830 --> 04:39:40.840 align:start position:0%
veterans not only that live there but
 
04:39:42.390 --> 04:39:42.400 align:start position:0%
from across the state know that one
 
04:39:43.948 --> 04:39:43.958 align:start position:0%
particular vsos is are going to be on
 
04:39:45.830 --> 04:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
site from legal assistance Financial
 
04:39:49.670 --> 04:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
employment um we also have a um e ofs
 
04:39:51.590 --> 04:39:51.600 align:start position:0%
has a substance abuse Grant um
 
04:39:52.990 --> 04:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient that we're going to have on
 
04:39:55.590 --> 04:39:55.600 align:start position:0%
site as well um so just a lot of things
 
04:39:56.830 --> 04:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
that we're going to bring to that Hub of
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
services um the goal here is to make it
 
04:40:01.350 --> 04:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
a premier destination for veterans
 
04:40:04.470 --> 04:40:04.480 align:start position:0%
military nonprofits First Responders and
 
04:40:08.390 --> 04:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:11.390 --> 04:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
um and the big another big part of this
 
04:40:12.830 --> 04:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
Retreat Center is you're going to have
 
04:40:16.430 --> 04:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
22 Host Hotel style rooms as well um
 
04:40:18.030 --> 04:40:18.040 align:start position:0%
that will be available to people the
 
04:40:20.230 --> 04:40:20.240 align:start position:0%
organizations that use the retreat
 
04:40:21.708 --> 04:40:21.718 align:start position:0%
center hey we want to bring in an
 
04:40:24.390 --> 04:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
organization we want to do a a camp
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
resilience let's say Retreat um we're
 
04:40:27.948 --> 04:40:27.958 align:start position:0%

lodging available for them um so that's
 
04:40:34.510 --> 04:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
another great addition that's kind of
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
another thing that's going to set this
 
04:40:38.948 --> 04:40:38.958 align:start position:0%
campus is um you know separate us from
 
04:40:41.350 --> 04:40:41.360 align:start position:0%
other organizations um that on top of
 
04:40:42.750 --> 04:40:42.760 align:start position:0%
the um the permanent housing for
 
04:40:44.550 --> 04:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
Veterans which we all know in this state
 
04:40:46.670 --> 04:40:46.680 align:start position:0%
um and I know from my experience as a
 
04:40:48.110 --> 04:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officer that
 
04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
homelessness not only for veterans but
 
04:40:51.868 --> 04:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
across the straight is across the state
 
04:40:55.390 --> 04:40:55.400 align:start position:0%
is a major issue um phase two uh where
 
04:40:57.310 --> 04:40:57.320 align:start position:0%
efforts are currently under under
 
04:40:59.470 --> 04:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
underway to raise an additional 23
 
04:41:01.830 --> 04:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
million to fund fund our next uh next
 
04:41:04.990 --> 04:41:05.000 align:start position:0%
phase and that's phase two which will be
 
04:41:07.830 --> 04:41:07.840 align:start position:0%
an indoor Aquatics and fitness center so
 
04:41:09.628 --> 04:41:09.638 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a inground pool four
 
04:41:12.430 --> 04:41:12.440 align:start position:0%
lanes um we're partnering with swim with
 
04:41:13.628 --> 04:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
the mission which I'm sure many of you
 
04:41:16.190 --> 04:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
are familiar with um so that will be
 
04:41:18.750 --> 04:41:18.760 align:start position:0%
located next to the retreat center
 
04:41:20.550 --> 04:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
across the street we're going to have a
 
04:41:22.750 --> 04:41:22.760 align:start position:0%
um these are going to be new builds new
 
04:41:25.990 --> 04:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
construction um Recreation uh indoor
 
04:41:29.830 --> 04:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
Recreation climbing wall ecoin facility
 
04:41:33.070 --> 04:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
um the value of um I can speak from you
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
know personal experience the value of
 
04:41:37.230 --> 04:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
ecoin therapy is um very very valuable
 
04:41:39.550 --> 04:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
and is real we're also going to have a
 
04:41:43.070 --> 04:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
dog dog C if you will um so we'll have a
 
04:41:45.708 --> 04:41:45.718 align:start position:0%
k9 program on site we hope to be working
 
04:41:49.628 --> 04:41:49.638 align:start position:0%
with Delta dog on that um so they've um
 
04:41:51.390 --> 04:41:51.400 align:start position:0%
they've already committed to to come to
 
04:41:53.390 --> 04:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
the team so that's going to be extremely
 
04:41:54.788 --> 04:41:54.798 align:start position:0%
valuable particularly for them because
 
04:41:56.150 --> 04:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
they're really hitting the the Southern
 
04:41:58.628 --> 04:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
Tier of the state right now but we we
 
04:42:00.788 --> 04:42:00.798 align:start position:0%
think we're missing veterans that can't
 
04:42:02.788 --> 04:42:02.798 align:start position:0%
travel um to the southern part of the
 
04:42:04.470 --> 04:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
state so that's why they'll have a
 
04:42:06.750 --> 04:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
facility there as well um we're going to
 
04:42:11.190 --> 04:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
have an outdoor um challenge course High
 
04:42:13.868 --> 04:42:13.878 align:start position:0%
challenges low challenges really for all
 
04:42:17.270 --> 04:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
abilities and at the end of the road
 
04:42:18.788 --> 04:42:18.798 align:start position:0%
there on your map you'll see what's
 
04:42:20.550 --> 04:42:20.560 align:start position:0%
called the Burley Cottage that's an
 
04:42:23.070 --> 04:42:23.080 align:start position:0%
historical building that's being um we
 
04:42:24.868 --> 04:42:24.878 align:start position:0%
have to maintain that that's being
 
04:42:26.788 --> 04:42:26.798 align:start position:0%
completely rehabbed um and that will
 
04:42:28.030 --> 04:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
include where probably we're going to
 
04:42:30.350 --> 04:42:30.360 align:start position:0%
hang uh veterans count as you all know
 
04:42:32.070 --> 04:42:32.080 align:start position:0%
is part of Easter Seals and has been
 
04:42:35.230 --> 04:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
since 2007 um but that's probably what
 
04:42:38.230 --> 04:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
they land um and also there's you know
 
04:42:39.788 --> 04:42:39.798 align:start position:0%
there's 59 those are familiar with the
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
area there's 59 mies of 55 Mi of Trail
 
04:42:45.190 --> 04:42:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh natural Trail and we're going to try
 
04:42:46.990 --> 04:42:47.000 align:start position:0%
to take advantage of all the N natural
 
04:42:49.110 --> 04:42:49.120 align:start position:0%
Recreation that's available in the area
 
04:42:52.628 --> 04:42:52.638 align:start position:0%
um so we have the equin doyard outdoor
 
04:42:55.230 --> 04:42:55.240 align:start position:0%
challenge course um and then this Burley
 
04:42:58.510 --> 04:42:58.520 align:start position:0%
col cottage which I mentioned um we're
 
04:43:01.830 --> 04:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
seeking approval to an addition off the
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
back of that um for like that that's
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
part is going to really Overlook the
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
river um and that's where we hope to
 
04:43:13.230 --> 04:43:13.240 align:start position:0%
have art therapy um yoga type style um
 
04:43:16.310 --> 04:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
you know therapy if you will uh for
 
04:43:18.110 --> 04:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
veterans and First Responders and their
 
04:43:21.030 --> 04:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
families um so that's that will bring us
 
04:43:24.070 --> 04:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
to completion um frankly I think we're
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
had of schedule um if fundraising goes
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
as planned um in 2025 we hope to start
 
04:43:32.310 --> 04:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
construction on phase two with all the
 
04:43:33.670 --> 04:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
permitting and working with the city of
 
04:43:35.510 --> 04:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
Franklin who by the way has been U Been
 
04:43:38.310 --> 04:43:38.320 align:start position:0%
a great partner in this um our goal is
 
04:43:40.150 --> 04:43:40.160 align:start position:0%
to begin Construction in phase two in
 
04:43:43.868 --> 04:43:43.878 align:start position:0%
the fall of 201 5 um so we could be
 
04:43:48.270 --> 04:43:48.280 align:start position:0%
fully complete um sometime you know mid
 
04:43:50.830 --> 04:43:50.840 align:start position:0%
2026 which I think is um maybe a little
 
04:43:53.230 --> 04:43:53.240 align:start position:0%
aggressive but um there's really no time
 
04:43:53.240 --> 04:43:55.030 align:start position:0%
aggressive but um there's really no time
to

04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
wait any other questions on are any
 
04:43:58.350 --> 04:43:58.360 align:start position:0%
questions on the
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
map so really the call that you can sit
 
04:44:02.788 --> 04:44:02.798 align:start position:0%
down Nick if you
 
04:44:05.910 --> 04:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
want make me nervous behind me like that
 
04:44:07.708 --> 04:44:07.718 align:start position:0%
um so the call to action you know the
 
04:44:11.788 --> 04:44:11.798 align:start position:0%
need is dire um in 2021 an average of 17
 
04:44:13.990 --> 04:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
veterans died by Suicide each day I'm
 
04:44:15.310 --> 04:44:15.320 align:start position:0%
all I'm sure all of you are familiar
 
04:44:17.670 --> 04:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
with these statistics in New Hampshire a
 
04:44:19.910 --> 04:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
veteran takes their life on life every 8
 
04:44:22.830 --> 04:44:22.840 align:start position:0%
Days um heartbreakingly the US
 
04:44:23.910 --> 04:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
Department of Housing and urb
 
04:44:26.390 --> 04:44:26.400 align:start position:0%
Development reported that about s 7 and
 
04:44:28.708 --> 04:44:28.718 align:start position:0%
a half% increase in veteran homelessness
 
04:44:28.718 --> 04:44:29.868 align:start position:0%
a half% increase in veteran homelessness
in

04:44:29.868 --> 04:44:29.878 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:44:33.590 --> 04:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
2023 with 20 with close to 36,000
 
04:44:35.628 --> 04:44:35.638 align:start position:0%
veterans living in shelters cars parks
 
04:44:37.590 --> 04:44:37.600 align:start position:0%
are on the streets our New Hampshire
 
04:44:39.150 --> 04:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
service members deserve to come home to
 
04:44:40.510 --> 04:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
the same support that they had while
 
04:44:41.910 --> 04:44:41.920 align:start position:0%
they served
 
04:44:43.830 --> 04:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
there was no wrong door for individuals
 
04:44:47.030 --> 04:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
seeking assistance in the Easter Seals
 
04:44:48.510 --> 04:44:48.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire military and Veterans
 
04:44:50.550 --> 04:44:50.560 align:start position:0%
campus promises to provide the necessary
 
04:44:51.868 --> 04:44:51.878 align:start position:0%
tools for our veterans and their
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
families so representative Mr chairman I
 
04:44:56.550 --> 04:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
hope that met your intent but I'm happy
 
04:44:58.788 --> 04:44:58.798 align:start position:0%
to take any questions I know you're
 
04:45:01.550 --> 04:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
crunched for time thank you Alan the
 
04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
handout folder is fabulous and uh I have
 
04:45:08.030 --> 04:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
to tell I can't take credit for that uh
 
04:45:11.510 --> 04:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's okay um so I do want to make sure
 
04:45:14.430 --> 04:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that this is in Franklin
 
04:45:16.670 --> 04:45:16.680 align:start position:0%
it's a campus it used to be a like a
 
04:45:19.110 --> 04:45:19.120 align:start position:0%
monastery type thing it was in um it was
 
04:45:21.270 --> 04:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
an orphanage okay that's right yep they
 
04:45:24.628 --> 04:45:24.638 align:start position:0%
went back my my history tells me like
 
04:45:28.510 --> 04:45:28.520 align:start position:0%
late 1800s into the early 1900s um
 
04:45:31.230 --> 04:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
Easter Seals Came Upon the property um
 
04:45:35.310 --> 04:45:35.320 align:start position:0%
it was farham North in about 2015 and
 
04:45:38.868 --> 04:45:38.878 align:start position:0%
then um Co happened and so that
 
04:45:40.550 --> 04:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
substance abuse treatment facility shut
 
04:45:43.470 --> 04:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
down so it's been dormant for about 4
 
04:45:46.510 --> 04:45:46.520 align:start position:0%
years um so it was in the total need of
 
04:45:49.230 --> 04:45:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh repurposing and really this is where
 
04:45:51.708 --> 04:45:51.718 align:start position:0%
EA seals and many other organizations in
 
04:45:54.310 --> 04:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
this probably many in this body and this
 
04:45:55.868 --> 04:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
stepped up and provided the initial
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
funding which we're um extremely
 
04:46:00.948 --> 04:46:00.958 align:start position:0%
grateful for and I think this is going
 
04:46:03.910 --> 04:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
to be a game Cher um for veterans in the
 
04:46:05.788 --> 04:46:05.798 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and maybe Beyond
 
04:46:07.750 --> 04:46:07.760 align:start position:0%
um the goal here sir is that this
 
04:46:10.470 --> 04:46:10.480 align:start position:0%
becomes a model for the nation that they
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
look to New Hampshire and say look how
 
04:46:15.830 --> 04:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
they're doing it um and let's try to
 
04:46:17.270 --> 04:46:17.280 align:start position:0%
mirror what they're doing that's our
 
04:46:19.990 --> 04:46:20.000 align:start position:0%
goal it's a big goal I recognize that
 
04:46:23.150 --> 04:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
but I'm proud to be part of it yes I was
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
there for the ribbon cutting and I could
 
04:46:26.230 --> 04:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
see the footprint I could see the
 
04:46:28.110 --> 04:46:28.120 align:start position:0%
buildings there and at the ribbon
 
04:46:30.110 --> 04:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
cutting in the presentation and I get a
 
04:46:32.190 --> 04:46:32.200 align:start position:0%
walk through they showed us their vision
 
04:46:34.430 --> 04:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
of what these buildings would turn into
 
04:46:36.470 --> 04:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
so even then before You' even started
 
04:46:39.190 --> 04:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
any construction it was exciting as
 
04:46:41.350 --> 04:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
could be to imagine what is going to
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
happen there and governor sonuna was
 
04:46:46.190 --> 04:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
there for the ribbon cutting yes he was
 
04:46:49.190 --> 04:46:49.200 align:start position:0%
and he said what you just said this has
 
04:46:52.470 --> 04:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
the potential to become uh uh a
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
prototype a model as you said and as the
 
04:46:57.788 --> 04:46:57.798 align:start position:0%
governor said for the nation uh so I
 
04:47:00.628 --> 04:47:00.638 align:start position:0%
just encourage you all to get there
 
04:47:03.310 --> 04:47:03.320 align:start position:0%
sometime so the middle of next year it
 
04:47:05.708 --> 04:47:05.718 align:start position:0%
could be completed June we'll probably
 
04:47:08.750 --> 04:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
also be in office most of us by then and
 
04:47:10.948 --> 04:47:10.958 align:start position:0%
uh maybe a field trip or something uh
 
04:47:12.628 --> 04:47:12.638 align:start position:0%
it's amazing what's what's happening
 
04:47:14.230 --> 04:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
there so that's that's all I want to say
 
04:47:16.948 --> 04:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
any other questions go ahead rson mle B
 
04:47:18.628 --> 04:47:18.638 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
04:47:20.390 --> 04:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
for for sharing the work you've been
 
04:47:22.788 --> 04:47:22.798 align:start position:0%
doing with Easter Seals and this this
 
04:47:25.110 --> 04:47:25.120 align:start position:0%
project I think it's really an
 
04:47:27.310 --> 04:47:27.320 align:start position:0%
incredible plan and I'm very excited to
 
04:47:29.510 --> 04:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
see how it comes together so I'm looking
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
at your methodology for Community
 
04:47:34.510 --> 04:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
engagement I see that you did some site
 
04:47:37.110 --> 04:47:37.120 align:start position:0%
visits um I'm wondering if you could
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
share maybe one or two Lessons Learned
 
04:47:41.948 --> 04:47:41.958 align:start position:0%
From the site visit and how you've
 
04:47:44.750 --> 04:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
Incorporated those findings into one was
 
04:47:47.390 --> 04:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
the permanent housing okay um and the
 
04:47:49.948 --> 04:47:49.958 align:start position:0%
other one was the the need for
 
04:47:52.670 --> 04:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
recreation okay um and getting people
 
04:47:56.190 --> 04:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
out um and really those are two big
 
04:47:57.910 --> 04:47:57.920 align:start position:0%
lessons I wasn't part of that because I
 
04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't on board yet but speaking with
 
04:48:01.670 --> 04:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
the people that did it um that's really
 
04:48:03.150 --> 04:48:03.160 align:start position:0%
what the big takeaway and that's why you
 
04:48:05.990 --> 04:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
see the emphasis that we're on um and I
 
04:48:07.948 --> 04:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
think that's why um you know we've been
 
04:48:09.708 --> 04:48:09.718 align:start position:0%
able to get swim swim of the mission to
 
04:48:11.948 --> 04:48:11.958 align:start position:0%
come to the table on the Recreation side
 
04:48:14.470 --> 04:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
um Aquatics therapy so we're trying to
 
04:48:18.628 --> 04:48:18.638 align:start position:0%
cover every Recreation angle that we can
 
04:48:21.390 --> 04:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
um in who knows there may be a phase
 
04:48:23.110 --> 04:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
three right I'm I'm eating up the 15
 
04:48:25.110 --> 04:48:25.120 align:start position:0%
Acres pretty quick um but I want to
 
04:48:27.990 --> 04:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
emphasize that the city of Franklin um
 
04:48:30.948 --> 04:48:30.958 align:start position:0%
has been really excellent to deal with
 
04:48:32.470 --> 04:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
particularly the Historical Society
 
04:48:34.670 --> 04:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're sensitive to those things as well
 
04:48:37.190 --> 04:48:37.200 align:start position:0%
um but I also think this is this is
 
04:48:39.390 --> 04:48:39.400 align:start position:0%
going to be great for Franklin and
 
04:48:41.310 --> 04:48:41.320 align:start position:0%
Beyond um I'll be honest with you
 
04:48:42.670 --> 04:48:42.680 align:start position:0%
represent when I first heard about this
 
04:48:45.270 --> 04:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
I was like oh Franklin like who's you
 
04:48:47.990 --> 04:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
know I've been there nice you know it's
 
04:48:49.830 --> 04:48:49.840 align:start position:0%
a city I think is going to make a
 
04:48:51.470 --> 04:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
comeback in a lot of ways and probably
 
04:48:55.548 --> 04:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
already has um but I got in my car and I
 
04:48:57.390 --> 04:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
drove to Franklin from manchest and I'm
 
04:48:59.470 --> 04:48:59.480 align:start position:0%
like yeah that's not that bad right if I
 
04:49:01.990 --> 04:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
was a veteran i' I'd make the trip here
 
04:49:04.628 --> 04:49:04.638 align:start position:0%
um it's beautiful it has a lot to
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
offer just you know Recreation natural
 
04:49:10.708 --> 04:49:10.718 align:start position:0%
Recreation um so to your point
 
04:49:12.628 --> 04:49:12.638 align:start position:0%
representative maet my business card is
 
04:49:16.230 --> 04:49:16.240 align:start position:0%

of you will get you up there so you can

get eyes on um because it's come a long
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
way since that initial ribbon cutting
 
04:49:29.230 --> 04:49:29.240 align:start position:0%
can only imagine uh other questions uh
 
04:49:33.070 --> 04:49:33.080 align:start position:0%
represent Foss thank you uh and expect
 
04:49:34.470 --> 04:49:34.480 align:start position:0%
an email from me because I would love it
 
04:49:36.190 --> 04:49:36.200 align:start position:0%
toour this looks gorgeous if you if it
 
04:49:37.470 --> 04:49:37.480 align:start position:0%
has to be a weekend too I we'll
 
04:49:39.868 --> 04:49:39.878 align:start position:0%
accommodate oh fantastic um I'm a
 
04:49:43.750 --> 04:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
housing nerd so I'm I'm learning so
 
04:49:46.030 --> 04:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
affordable is that tied into the uh
 
04:49:48.110 --> 04:49:48.120 align:start position:0%
median income in Franklin is that the
 
04:49:49.750 --> 04:49:49.760 align:start position:0%
definition you're using for affordable
 
04:49:53.030 --> 04:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding yeah yeah um am
 
04:49:55.470 --> 04:49:55.480 align:start position:0%
I allowed to ask another question uh
 
04:49:58.150 --> 04:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
yeah so um just the you said permanent
 
04:50:00.070 --> 04:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
housing so is this the expectation that
 
04:50:02.548 --> 04:50:02.558 align:start position:0%
it's going to be um people are going to
 
04:50:04.750 --> 04:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
live there it's not like a transitional
 
04:50:06.948 --> 04:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
people live there while they y do you
 
04:50:09.310 --> 04:50:09.320 align:start position:0%
have a plan for uh are you going to use
 
04:50:11.070 --> 04:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
like a lottery cuz I can imagine there's
 
04:50:12.868 --> 04:50:12.878 align:start position:0%
probably going to be a huge weight list
 
04:50:16.030 --> 04:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
or huge demand for being in this housing
 
04:50:18.110 --> 04:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
yeah right now we um we open the portal
 
04:50:20.110 --> 04:50:20.120 align:start position:0%
and if you go to the website at the top
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
of the bar you you can navigate right to
 
04:50:23.708 --> 04:50:23.718 align:start position:0%
the housing application oh so you're
 
04:50:24.708 --> 04:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
already taking applications you're
 
04:50:27.590 --> 04:50:27.600 align:start position:0%
already taking applications and as of um
 
04:50:29.030 --> 04:50:29.040 align:start position:0%
as of a couple days ago they were up to
 
04:50:31.628 --> 04:50:31.638 align:start position:0%
about 24 um doesn't mean they've all
 
04:50:34.590 --> 04:50:34.600 align:start position:0%
qualified um so Easter sales has a whole
 
04:50:36.830 --> 04:50:36.840 align:start position:0%
housing um Department if you will
 
04:50:39.110 --> 04:50:39.120 align:start position:0%
residential Department that is handling
 
04:50:41.070 --> 04:50:41.080 align:start position:0%
that part of the permanent um um but
 
04:50:44.230 --> 04:50:44.240 align:start position:0%
yeah we we haven't done any paid
 
04:50:46.150 --> 04:50:46.160 align:start position:0%
advertising yet that's probably the next
 
04:50:48.868 --> 04:50:48.878 align:start position:0%
step um because we we really got to get
 
04:50:50.430 --> 04:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
those those numbers up we want to get to
 
04:50:52.548 --> 04:50:52.558 align:start position:0%
a point where we you know have a
 
04:50:54.750 --> 04:50:54.760 align:start position:0%
legitimate weight list and maybe we can
 
04:50:57.910 --> 04:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
then refer those people somewhere else
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
that we can't accommodate you but
 
04:51:02.190 --> 04:51:02.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps Harbor care can help and vice
 
04:51:04.750 --> 04:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
versa so we're all working together
 
04:51:06.510 --> 04:51:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you so you mentioned residential
 
04:51:08.548 --> 04:51:08.558 align:start position:0%
and Recreation is there much potential
 
04:51:11.310 --> 04:51:11.320 align:start position:0%
for an event uh what kind of events if
 
04:51:14.110 --> 04:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
any could this uh campus that's where
 
04:51:15.510 --> 04:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
that's where Nick's going to come in I
 
04:51:17.310 --> 04:51:17.320 align:start position:0%
brought him on as my marketing
 
04:51:20.510 --> 04:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
salesperson um he's got a almost you
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
know close to 20 years of experience
 
04:51:23.470 --> 04:51:23.480 align:start position:0%
doing that type of work so yeah we're
 
04:51:25.150 --> 04:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
we're looking at that could this be a
 
04:51:28.788 --> 04:51:28.798 align:start position:0%
potential wedding venue um could it be
 
04:51:31.390 --> 04:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
you know a location for corporations to
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
hold an event um right you know we have
 
04:51:35.430 --> 04:51:35.440 align:start position:0%
because we have to think sustainability
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
from a business plan side so you know
 
04:51:39.430 --> 04:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
veterans and First resp Responders are
 
04:51:41.150 --> 04:51:41.160 align:start position:0%
the priority but
 
04:51:43.270 --> 04:51:43.280 align:start position:0%
we have to build a model that allows us
 
04:51:45.270 --> 04:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
to sustain ourselves over the next 20 to
 
04:51:48.110 --> 04:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
30 years whatever it is um really what
 
04:51:50.788 --> 04:51:50.798 align:start position:0%
I'm at with this is all of you know we
 
04:51:53.430 --> 04:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
live in a volatile world right now um
 
04:51:56.110 --> 04:51:56.120 align:start position:0%
we've had our deployments um we don't
 
04:51:57.350 --> 04:51:57.360 align:start position:0%
know what's going to happen in this
 
04:52:01.310 --> 04:52:01.320 align:start position:0%
world um so as a campus as an
 
04:52:04.150 --> 04:52:04.160 align:start position:0%
organization we need to be ready um so
 
04:52:06.350 --> 04:52:06.360 align:start position:0%
should we find ourselves as a nation at
 
04:52:11.070 --> 04:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
War again I hope not um that should that
 
04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
happen we're going to have a whole new
 
04:52:16.470 --> 04:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
batch of veterans and families that are
 
04:52:18.708 --> 04:52:18.718 align:start position:0%
going to be struggling and those that's
 
04:52:22.350 --> 04:52:22.360 align:start position:0%
the Fallout we all know that of war um
 
04:52:24.510 --> 04:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
you know well we had a presentation from
 
04:52:27.788 --> 04:52:27.798 align:start position:0%
the veterans home uh comendant and
 
04:52:29.670 --> 04:52:29.680 align:start position:0%
that's for veterans but this is a place
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
for families uh potentially more than
 
04:52:35.150 --> 04:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
just a veteran in some cases so that to
 
04:52:36.230 --> 04:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
me is very
 
04:52:39.150 --> 04:52:39.160 align:start position:0%
exciting uh thanks so much L and Nick
 
04:52:40.910 --> 04:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
for this any other questions or anything
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
for either Al or
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
neck make a comment um I just wanted to
 
04:52:50.510 --> 04:52:50.520 align:start position:0%
point out um it really stood out to me
 
04:52:53.788 --> 04:52:53.798 align:start position:0%
the range of the therapy options that
 
04:52:55.990 --> 04:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
you have here I think a lot of people
 
04:52:58.070 --> 04:52:58.080 align:start position:0%
don't always equate you know veterans in
 
04:53:00.788 --> 04:53:00.798 align:start position:0%
yoga you know but I think that's I tried
 
04:53:04.470 --> 04:53:04.480 align:start position:0%
it it was ugly I tried it's really
 
04:53:06.230 --> 04:53:06.240 align:start position:0%
important you know especially if people
 
04:53:08.350 --> 04:53:08.360 align:start position:0%
have PTSD things like that we need to be
 
04:53:10.670 --> 04:53:10.680 align:start position:0%
using all the tools we can put in her
 
04:53:12.628 --> 04:53:12.638 align:start position:0%
toolbox so I really appreciate that and
 
04:53:14.628 --> 04:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
the other thing we're going to have a um
 
04:53:16.510 --> 04:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
a playground on site as well so when
 
04:53:18.788 --> 04:53:18.798 align:start position:0%
families come with children um it's a
 
04:53:20.670 --> 04:53:20.680 align:start position:0%
military themed playground if you will
 
04:53:21.910 --> 04:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm sure all of you probably
 
04:53:23.030 --> 04:53:23.040 align:start position:0%

urging Congress to review the state
 
05:03:13.788 --> 05:03:13.798 align:start position:0%
boundary in the piscatqua river that's
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
the boundary uh between Maine and New
 
05:03:17.548 --> 05:03:17.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire apparently there is some gray
 
05:03:20.628 --> 05:03:20.638 align:start position:0%
area some ambiguity some uncertainty uh
 
05:03:23.590 --> 05:03:23.600 align:start position:0%
that the uh sponsors would like to
 
05:03:27.830 --> 05:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
request some definition on uh represent
 
05:03:30.190 --> 05:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
Manion do you have a motion for this one
 
05:03:33.830 --> 05:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
I do Mr chair I move OTP on hd8 and do
 
05:03:35.590 --> 05:03:35.600 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
05:03:38.708 --> 05:03:38.718 align:start position:0%
second second representative Rollins
 
05:03:42.030 --> 05:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
seconds the OTP motion representative
 
05:03:43.948 --> 05:03:43.958 align:start position:0%
Manion would you care to speak to that
 
05:03:46.230 --> 05:03:46.240 align:start position:0%
motion yeah so uh with the ever change I
 
05:03:47.670 --> 05:03:47.680 align:start position:0%
know that they've made rulings on this
 
05:03:49.230 --> 05:03:49.240 align:start position:0%
before on like what uh whether the
 
05:03:51.430 --> 05:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
Portman Port Portsmouth Naval Shipyard
 
05:03:53.430 --> 05:03:53.440 align:start position:0%
is on our territory and their ter Main's
 
05:03:55.830 --> 05:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
territory uh and I think with the
 
05:03:58.190 --> 05:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
everchanging uh landscape at the federal
 
05:04:00.788 --> 05:04:00.798 align:start position:0%
level it's worth urging the Congress to
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
take another look at this uh currently
 
05:04:04.708 --> 05:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
we have a lot of um residents that
 
05:04:06.270 --> 05:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
currently live on our side that are
 
05:04:08.430 --> 05:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
being taxed main income tax amongst
 
05:04:10.830 --> 05:04:10.840 align:start position:0%
other things uh just from crossing the
 
05:04:14.310 --> 05:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
river um uh as a guy who lives down on
 
05:04:16.110 --> 05:04:16.120 align:start position:0%
the mass border I'm already experiencing
 
05:04:17.670 --> 05:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
this kind of Taxation all the time
 
05:04:19.948 --> 05:04:19.958 align:start position:0%
because I work in Mass uh and I was
 
05:04:21.670 --> 05:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
taxed even though I wasn't allowed to
 
05:04:23.190 --> 05:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
set foot in the country in the state in
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
2020 and that was taxation without
 
05:04:28.430 --> 05:04:28.440 align:start position:0%
representation I would say thank
 
05:04:30.990 --> 05:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you for that uh anything to
 
05:04:32.628 --> 05:04:32.638 align:start position:0%
add representative
 
05:04:36.110 --> 05:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
Rollins uh not really um basically I
 
05:04:37.548 --> 05:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
don't think it I don't think it's right
 
05:04:39.190 --> 05:04:39.200 align:start position:0%
that that people in New Hampshire have
 
05:04:41.510 --> 05:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
to pay the taxes I I see this should
 
05:04:42.510 --> 05:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
should have been right from the
 
05:04:45.868 --> 05:04:45.878 align:start position:0%
beginning in Portsmouth in New
 
05:04:48.868 --> 05:04:48.878 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the the shipy should be
 
05:04:50.470 --> 05:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
located in New Hampshire and we should
 
05:04:53.510 --> 05:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
have full say
 
05:04:58.070 --> 05:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
in okay uh sovereignty issue you're
 
05:05:01.830 --> 05:05:01.840 align:start position:0%
supporting there anything else on on
 
05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
05:05:06.390 --> 05:05:06.400 align:start position:0%
HCR uh Madam CL before I ask you to read
 
05:05:08.910 --> 05:05:08.920 align:start position:0%
the role I know you are from Portsmith
 
05:05:10.708 --> 05:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
yourself I believe and I know and I
 
05:05:12.030 --> 05:05:12.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate I could tell you you've done
 
05:05:14.270 --> 05:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
some due diligence and reached out uh
 
05:05:16.708 --> 05:05:16.718 align:start position:0%
anything be being that you that is your
 
05:05:18.510 --> 05:05:18.520 align:start position:0%
District so to speak uh anything that
 
05:05:22.030 --> 05:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
you want to say to this um just that the
 
05:05:24.948 --> 05:05:24.958 align:start position:0%
city of Portsmith is neutral on this
 
05:05:29.150 --> 05:05:29.160 align:start position:0%
resolution um Congressman Chris papis is
 
05:05:32.230 --> 05:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
also neutral um and the town of
 
05:05:35.910 --> 05:05:35.920 align:start position:0%
Newington is in support of
 
05:05:38.788 --> 05:05:38.798 align:start position:0%
it so Newton is forward and the elected
 
05:05:41.910 --> 05:05:41.920 align:start position:0%
officials are neutral okay um yes
 
05:05:44.310 --> 05:05:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative gagy thank you Mr
 
05:05:47.430 --> 05:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
chairman as we all know the state seal
 
05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
has the ship the Raleigh that's our
 
05:05:53.230 --> 05:05:53.240 align:start position:0%
state seal so why shouldn't the ship
 
05:05:57.150 --> 05:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:59.628 --> 05:05:59.638 align:start position:0%
belongs yes our state flag the ship on
 
05:06:01.230 --> 05:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
that if you didn't know is the Raleigh
 
05:06:03.350 --> 05:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
which presumably was built uh I'm
 
05:06:05.590 --> 05:06:05.600 align:start position:0%
guessing in Portsmouth there certainly a
 
05:06:07.910 --> 05:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth connection right anything
 
05:06:11.788 --> 05:06:11.798 align:start position:0%
else a representative Lloyd thank you um
 
05:06:15.070 --> 05:06:15.080 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to say on on record that
 
05:06:17.990 --> 05:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
um I believe that this is the proper
 
05:06:20.548 --> 05:06:20.558 align:start position:0%
procedure to have our federal delegation
 
05:06:23.430 --> 05:06:23.440 align:start position:0%
figure this out and try to push for this
 
05:06:28.190 --> 05:06:28.200 align:start position:0%
and and um to push through a resolution
 
05:06:30.910 --> 05:06:30.920 align:start position:0%
on that piece of of
 
05:06:33.868 --> 05:06:33.878 align:start position:0%
of of uh
 
05:06:36.430 --> 05:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
argument sorry thank you representative
 
05:06:39.190 --> 05:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
Lloyd this resolution does not offer a
 
05:06:41.628 --> 05:06:41.638 align:start position:0%
prescri of solution to your point I
 
05:06:43.868 --> 05:06:43.878 align:start position:0%
believe what this does is shine a light
 
05:06:45.990 --> 05:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
on a situation that we're looking for
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
better definition presumably because
 
05:06:50.628 --> 05:06:50.638 align:start position:0%
it's a New Hampshire resolution uh we
 
05:06:53.470 --> 05:06:53.480 align:start position:0%
want to be treated uh fairly as the as
 
05:06:56.070 --> 05:06:56.080 align:start position:0%
this definition comes about anything
 
05:06:58.390 --> 05:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
else representative
 
05:07:02.030 --> 05:07:02.040 align:start position:0%
Jones Thank you Mr chair um I believe in
 
05:07:03.590 --> 05:07:03.600 align:start position:0%
what everyone's saying I just think that
 
05:07:07.150 --> 05:07:07.160 align:start position:0%
timing is off because of uh I think with
 
05:07:10.110 --> 05:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
po politics in DC right now if it
 
05:07:12.948 --> 05:07:12.958 align:start position:0%
becomes uh New Hampshire versus Maine
 
05:07:14.230 --> 05:07:14.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is on the wrong side of
 
05:07:16.470 --> 05:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
the aisle right now and uh so I don't
 
05:07:18.708 --> 05:07:18.718 align:start position:0%
think it's the right time to pass
 
05:07:23.150 --> 05:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:26.390 --> 05:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
else okay Madame clerk when you are
 
05:07:31.150 --> 05:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
hcr8 is ought to pass on
 
05:07:37.150 --> 05:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
the recommendation the resolution to
 
05:07:38.430 --> 05:07:38.440 align:start position:0%
review the state boundary and the
 
05:07:38.440 --> 05:07:41.510 align:start position:0%
review the state boundary and the
piscatqua

05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%

all leave today okay okay so there's
 
05:09:13.788 --> 05:09:13.798 align:start position:0%
four down uh next up on our list is hp64
 
05:09:15.830 --> 05:09:15.840 align:start position:0%
which deals with hiring preferences for
 
05:09:19.310 --> 05:09:19.320 align:start position:0%
military person uh military spouses uh
 
05:09:20.430 --> 05:09:20.440 align:start position:0%
I've been in touch with the ranking
 
05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
member and there's some interest in
 
05:09:25.670 --> 05:09:25.680 align:start position:0%
working on a amendment in tweaking some
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
of the language so we are going to I am
 
05:09:32.910 --> 05:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
going to postpone executing this measure
 
05:09:35.190 --> 05:09:35.200 align:start position:0%
until a week from today uh
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
representative cyber so the uh Amendment
 
05:09:40.750 --> 05:09:40.760 align:start position:0%
if this one forth coming if that could
 
05:09:42.910 --> 05:09:42.920 align:start position:0%
be pushed out to the committee as soon
 
05:09:46.350 --> 05:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
as as soon as it's ready so I I actually
 
05:09:49.990 --> 05:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
stand corrected with that one is that we
 
05:09:52.830 --> 05:09:52.840 align:start position:0%
um that other issue wasn't as big that
 
05:09:54.868 --> 05:09:54.878 align:start position:0%
I'd sent over to you just about the
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
clarification of that whatever word but
 
05:10:00.350 --> 05:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
um one thing that was brought up to me
 
05:10:01.590 --> 05:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
and I wasn't here that day of the
 
05:10:03.590 --> 05:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
hearing was in regards to the Department
 
05:10:06.430 --> 05:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
of Labor's request in regards to how do
 
05:10:08.310 --> 05:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
they defining how they
 
05:10:11.350 --> 05:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
specify you know if a spouse is really
 
05:10:13.270 --> 05:10:13.280 align:start position:0%
an active military duty spouse because
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
they really have nothing to prove that
 
05:10:17.310 --> 05:10:17.320 align:start position:0%
which I think is an issue that has been
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
brought up by our veterans affairs um
 
05:10:19.760 --> 05:10:21.470 align:start position:0%
brought up by our veterans affairs um
folks

05:10:21.470 --> 05:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
folks
 
05:10:26.110 --> 05:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
previously um so it's up to us if or you
 
05:10:27.708 --> 05:10:27.718 align:start position:0%
know the committee as a whole if we want
 
05:10:29.510 --> 05:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
to just go ahead and send it over to the
 
05:10:31.350 --> 05:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
Senate and let them do it there or do we
 
05:10:34.190 --> 05:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
want to do that within the week yes uh
 
05:10:35.548 --> 05:10:35.558 align:start position:0%
representative what you just said about
 
05:10:37.670 --> 05:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
sending it over to the Senate where we
 
05:10:40.350 --> 05:10:40.360 align:start position:0%
try not to say that especially
 
05:10:42.948 --> 05:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
sorry I forgot about that I forgot
 
05:10:45.390 --> 05:10:45.400 align:start position:0%
that're qualified like everywhere but
 
05:10:47.788 --> 05:10:47.798 align:start position:0%
the uh but your point is well taken the
 
05:10:52.590 --> 05:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
language is uh is is fairly close uh I I
 
05:10:54.548 --> 05:10:54.558 align:start position:0%
have spoken to the prime sponsor about
 
05:10:57.830 --> 05:10:57.840 align:start position:0%
this and that we don't necessarily want
 
05:10:59.830 --> 05:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
the perfect to be the enemy of the good
 
05:11:02.910 --> 05:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
I think that uh my sense is that the uh
 
05:11:04.948 --> 05:11:04.958 align:start position:0%
consensus here is that we support the
 
05:11:09.310 --> 05:11:09.320 align:start position:0%
notion of of supporting military spouses
 
05:11:13.390 --> 05:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
were getting uh a chance that maybe they
 
05:11:17.070 --> 05:11:17.080 align:start position:0%
would not get otherwise at an employment
 
05:11:20.628 --> 05:11:20.638 align:start position:0%
situation the hearing provided ample
 
05:11:24.590 --> 05:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
testimony and rationale behind this and
 
05:11:28.750 --> 05:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
I uh understand it and support it uh we
 
05:11:31.628 --> 05:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
could exact this today if if there is
 
05:11:33.750 --> 05:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
not going to be Amendment forthcoming
 
05:11:37.628 --> 05:11:37.638 align:start position:0%
then we can um I I would make the motion
 
05:11:41.190 --> 05:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
for OTP if if yeah if you wanted to
 
05:11:44.628 --> 05:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
second that and then we can um we can
 
05:11:46.270 --> 05:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
move it
 
05:11:50.030 --> 05:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
forward right Madam clerk uh I am going
 
05:11:53.310 --> 05:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
to make the motion for OTP on
 
05:11:57.948 --> 05:11:57.958 align:start position:0%
hp64 with regard to uh military
 
05:12:02.070 --> 05:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
spouses and the as I just said the
 
05:12:04.390 --> 05:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
testimony was very compelling and the
 
05:12:07.670 --> 05:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
rationale for supporting military
 
05:12:11.270 --> 05:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
families uh for many reasons is as I
 
05:12:14.070 --> 05:12:14.080 align:start position:0%
just said is compelling given the
 
05:12:16.910 --> 05:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
sacrifices that not only the the
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
military people make M male or female in
 
05:12:23.110 --> 05:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
and the spouses uh which some of us know
 
05:12:25.430 --> 05:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
firsthand uh would you like to add is
 
05:12:29.590 --> 05:12:29.600 align:start position:0%
the second or um no I I completely agree
 
05:12:32.230 --> 05:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's totally straightforward
 
05:12:35.430 --> 05:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
so makes sense representative cyber did
 
05:12:38.150 --> 05:12:38.160 align:start position:0%
the second oh yeah second sorry would
 
05:12:40.548 --> 05:12:40.558 align:start position:0%
would anyone else like to add anything
 
05:12:42.670 --> 05:12:42.680 align:start position:0%

05:12:55.230 --> 05:12:55.240 align:start position:0%
um military retirement pay um but there
 
05:12:57.990 --> 05:12:58.000 align:start position:0%
were a number of military spouses um and
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
former spouses that came to testify on
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
our Bell um and they spoke at length at
 
05:13:06.708 --> 05:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
the difficulty that they had finding
 
05:13:08.270 --> 05:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
either full-time employment or
 
05:13:10.670 --> 05:13:10.680 align:start position:0%
employment that offered benefits um
 
05:13:12.430 --> 05:13:12.440 align:start position:0%
during all of the deployments that they
 
05:13:14.510 --> 05:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
experienced during their marriage and so
 
05:13:17.510 --> 05:13:17.520 align:start position:0%

05:13:19.310 --> 05:13:19.320 align:start position:0%

05:13:21.150 --> 05:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
lot of the issues that the spouses were
 
05:13:24.190 --> 05:13:24.200 align:start position:0%

05:18:21.708 --> 05:18:21.718 align:start position:0%
187-a colon 39 paragraph 1 sections a b
 
05:18:25.830 --> 05:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
c and d it if you're tracking me the
 
05:18:30.030 --> 05:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
original sought to remove all those from
 
05:18:34.590 --> 05:18:34.600 align:start position:0%
statute uh so the concern that came up
 
05:18:36.990 --> 05:18:37.000 align:start position:0%
that this amendment tries to address is
 
05:18:39.910 --> 05:18:39.920 align:start position:0%
that uh folks we listen to that I listen
 
05:18:42.270 --> 05:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
to We all listen to from uh the veteran
 
05:18:46.910 --> 05:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
Community dmav uh did not support the
 
05:18:50.990 --> 05:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
measure that had some of the aspects in
 
05:18:54.270 --> 05:18:54.280 align:start position:0%
it that would be precluded from sections
 
05:18:56.868 --> 05:18:56.878 align:start position:0%
from that uh paragraph one section c and
 
05:19:00.910 --> 05:19:00.920 align:start position:0%
d so the amendment uh removes C and
 
05:19:04.510 --> 05:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
D from the the bill but it keeps in A
 
05:19:07.030 --> 05:19:07.040 align:start position:0%
and B which is what postsecondary was
 
05:19:08.708 --> 05:19:08.718 align:start position:0%
hoping for was important to postc
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
secondary so this compromise Amendment
 
05:19:13.750 --> 05:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
will satisfy postsecondary in that it
 
05:19:15.830 --> 05:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
takes out the parts of the selective
 
05:19:19.270 --> 05:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
service requirements that impact uh the
 
05:19:21.868 --> 05:19:21.878 align:start position:0%
university in the in the
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%
colleges but it leaves in the part that
 
05:19:29.230 --> 05:19:29.240 align:start position:0%
DMS wanted to stay in which is uh sub
 
05:19:33.430 --> 05:19:33.440 align:start position:0%
paragraphs C and D under paragraph one
 
05:19:38.230 --> 05:19:38.240 align:start position:0%
under 187-a 39 so that is the uh the
 
05:19:38.240 --> 05:19:39.350 align:start position:0%
under 187-a 39 so that is the uh the
amendment

05:19:39.350 --> 05:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:19:41.990 --> 05:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
which I hope the committee will support
 
05:19:45.548 --> 05:19:45.558 align:start position:0%
compromise Amendment and uh R Rollins do
 
05:19:47.190 --> 05:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
you want to add
 
05:19:49.470 --> 05:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
anything uh no thank
 
05:19:53.590 --> 05:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
you anyone else repr Manion yes so the
 
05:19:54.990 --> 05:19:55.000 align:start position:0%
compromise here is that uh since the
 
05:19:56.548 --> 05:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
federal government isn't even enforcing
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
this with their fasta reg regulations
 
05:19:59.788 --> 05:19:59.798 align:start position:0%
that are going through this year that
 
05:20:01.390 --> 05:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
they're no longer requiring compliance
 
05:20:03.548 --> 05:20:03.558 align:start position:0%
with the Selective Service registration
 
05:20:04.788 --> 05:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
uh it doesn't make any sense for the
 
05:20:06.750 --> 05:20:06.760 align:start position:0%
state to do it either so removing just
 
05:20:08.430 --> 05:20:08.440 align:start position:0%
the components that have to do with the
 
05:20:11.270 --> 05:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
the the SEC postsecondary is puts us in
 
05:20:12.470 --> 05:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
sync with what the federal government's
 
05:20:12.480 --> 05:20:13.708 align:start position:0%
sync with what the federal government's
doing

05:20:13.708 --> 05:20:13.718 align:start position:0%
doing
 
05:20:15.990 --> 05:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
already thank you rep representative
 
05:20:18.190 --> 05:20:18.200 align:start position:0%
Manion who was the Prime sponsor of this
 
05:20:20.948 --> 05:20:20.958 align:start position:0%
originally anything else representative
 
05:20:25.910 --> 05:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
for uh yes and just uh to go further on
 
05:20:28.350 --> 05:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
that uh it's my understanding that this
 
05:20:31.628 --> 05:20:31.638 align:start position:0%
uh the aspect of the current
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
postsecondary requirement is very
 
05:20:36.190 --> 05:20:36.200 align:start position:0%
honorous for the University system of
 
05:20:38.350 --> 05:20:38.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because they need to do
 
05:20:41.548 --> 05:20:41.558 align:start position:0%
EXT extra leg work because it's not on
 
05:20:44.190 --> 05:20:44.200 align:start position:0%
the FAFSA people don't have to check off
 
05:20:46.070 --> 05:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
whether or not they they uh complied
 
05:20:47.510 --> 05:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
with the selective service act so the
 
05:20:51.548 --> 05:20:51.558 align:start position:0%
university system has to uh expend extra
 
05:20:53.390 --> 05:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
effort to determine whether or not they
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
did in order to allow them to apply for
 
05:20:58.510 --> 05:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
a state school and state aid and uh I
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
know they are strapped for cash right
 
05:21:03.030 --> 05:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
now so that's if we got rid of this then
 
05:21:04.990 --> 05:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
that would help them a lot with their
 
05:21:06.990 --> 05:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
workload and their
 
05:21:09.628 --> 05:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
budget thank you for amplifying that rep
 
05:21:13.230 --> 05:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
of Ross rep representative F yes the
 
05:21:15.590 --> 05:21:15.600 align:start position:0%
university system was very much in favor
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
of uh of this of this HB anything else
 
05:21:21.788 --> 05:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
show on
 
05:21:26.628 --> 05:21:26.638 align:start position:0%
this yes we can before before we go to
 
05:21:29.070 --> 05:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
represent gagne's idea or suggestion
 
05:21:30.430 --> 05:21:30.440 align:start position:0%
represent of hening way you had a hand
 
05:21:33.070 --> 05:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chairman I just like to
 
05:21:35.670 --> 05:21:35.680 align:start position:0%
speak to this uh I appreciate the
 
05:21:37.590 --> 05:21:37.600 align:start position:0%
amendment uh if it wasn't for this
 
05:21:39.910 --> 05:21:39.920 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd probably vote no on this
 
05:21:41.110 --> 05:21:41.120 align:start position:0%
only because I think there is a
 
05:21:44.030 --> 05:21:44.040 align:start position:0%
requirement to have a ready force in the
 
05:21:46.270 --> 05:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
backup with the many theaters that
 
05:21:48.990 --> 05:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
were're on front right now uh I thought
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
that to take away the right for or the
 
05:21:53.548 --> 05:21:53.558 align:start position:0%
requirement for Selective Service
 
05:21:56.830 --> 05:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
registry uh was not a good one but as
 
05:21:59.430 --> 05:21:59.440 align:start position:0%
long as we keep the requirement to
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
register but we've taken away the
 
05:22:04.070 --> 05:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
funding piece for the colleges I'm good
 
05:22:06.110 --> 05:22:06.120 align:start position:0%
with that thank you representative
 
05:22:09.070 --> 05:22:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hemingway yes I think the amendment was
 
05:22:11.150 --> 05:22:11.160 align:start position:0%
something that hopefully will work
 
05:22:13.190 --> 05:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
because it satisfies postsecondary and
 
05:22:16.470 --> 05:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
it also satisfies the the military side
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
anything else represent Jones Thank you
 
05:22:20.708 --> 05:22:20.718 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I just wanted to tell you yes I
 
05:22:23.230 --> 05:22:23.240 align:start position:0%
do appreciate the amendment um I didn't
 
05:22:25.070 --> 05:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
like the amendment that that the was
 
05:22:28.110 --> 05:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
suggested by the uh General um I thought
 
05:22:29.948 --> 05:22:29.958 align:start position:0%
that brought us backwards to where we to
 
05:22:31.910 --> 05:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
the very beginning but uh I think this
 
05:22:34.310 --> 05:22:34.320 align:start position:0%
this amendment um makes a good
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
fix thank you representative anything
 
05:22:40.628 --> 05:22:40.638 align:start position:0%
else okay veteran legislator lawmaker
 
05:22:43.230 --> 05:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
gagy pointed out that we do have the
 
05:22:44.750 --> 05:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
option or I have the option of calling
 
05:22:48.350 --> 05:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
for a a hand vote uh on the amendment
 
05:22:50.310 --> 05:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
which I'm going to do so if you support
 
05:22:52.910 --> 05:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh would you please raise
 
05:22:56.430 --> 05:22:56.440 align:start position:0%
your right hand so that the clerk can
 
05:22:59.670 --> 05:22:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:02.310 --> 05:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
is like everyone has does anyone not
 
05:23:05.350 --> 05:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
have their hand up right okay the clerk
 
05:23:05.360 --> 05:23:06.390 align:start position:0%

certified that the Amendment passed is
 
05:23:14.190 --> 05:23:14.200 align:start position:0%
18 to Zer so now that brings us to
 
05:23:15.788 --> 05:23:15.798 align:start position:0%
another motion that we will need if
 
05:23:16.990 --> 05:23:17.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to move this forward which
 
05:23:19.708 --> 05:23:19.718 align:start position:0%
would be uh a motion I'm going to look
 
05:23:20.628 --> 05:23:20.638 align:start position:0%
would be an
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
otpa ought to pass as amended motion I'm
 
05:23:24.788 --> 05:23:24.798 align:start position:0%
going to look to the prime sponsor
 
05:23:27.470 --> 05:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
representative Manion for a motion thank
 
05:23:32.868 --> 05:23:32.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
hp55 representative JY seconds the
 
05:23:37.750 --> 05:23:37.760 align:start position:0%
motion represent Manion would you like
 
05:23:39.548 --> 05:23:39.558 align:start position:0%
to add anything I think we covered the
 
05:23:41.230 --> 05:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
the issues that a lot of people had with
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
the original bill and I think this
 
05:23:44.708 --> 05:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
covers everything here the postsecondary
 
05:23:46.470 --> 05:23:46.480 align:start position:0%
is Happy the agent General's happy and
 
05:23:50.030 --> 05:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
we can move on representative
 
05:23:58.190 --> 05:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:02.270 --> 05:24:02.280 align:start position:0%
everything any further comment reps and
 
05:24:06.070 --> 05:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
F thank you um I just wanted to add that
 
05:24:09.190 --> 05:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
um because I am uh
 
05:24:12.788 --> 05:24:12.798 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic in general uh I did a lot
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
of research on other states requirements
 
05:24:17.510 --> 05:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
and how that correlates with their
 
05:24:20.270 --> 05:24:20.280 align:start position:0%
Selective Service compliant rates uh New
 
05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a
 
05:24:27.510 --> 05:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
75.1% compliance rate uh but there's not
 
05:24:31.110 --> 05:24:31.120 align:start position:0%
really a strong correlation with having
 
05:24:34.390 --> 05:24:34.400 align:start position:0%
uh laws like this in place compliance at
 
05:24:37.708 --> 05:24:37.718 align:start position:0%
the state level and a higher rate of
 
05:24:40.670 --> 05:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
compliance for example Connecticut has a
 
05:24:44.830 --> 05:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
100% compliance but does not have uh a
 
05:24:46.868 --> 05:24:46.878 align:start position:0%
requirement for State schools or a
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
requirement for uh State Employment uh
 
05:24:54.670 --> 05:24:54.680 align:start position:0%
let's see I did um if anything it seems
 
05:24:57.510 --> 05:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
as though places that automatically
 
05:24:59.510 --> 05:24:59.520 align:start position:0%
register you when you get your driver's
 
05:25:01.910 --> 05:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
license or places that have you have to
 
05:25:04.350 --> 05:25:04.360 align:start position:0%
actively opt out have higher rates of
 
05:25:06.190 --> 05:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
compliance in New Hampshire you have to
 
05:25:09.030 --> 05:25:09.040 align:start position:0%
actively opt in uh
 
05:25:11.590 --> 05:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
but in general it doesn't seem as though
 
05:25:15.310 --> 05:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
this Le this current legislation uh not
 
05:25:17.628 --> 05:25:17.638 align:start position:0%
the legisl yes exactly the current law
 
05:25:20.788 --> 05:25:20.798 align:start position:0%
is really serving its
 
05:25:22.868 --> 05:25:22.878 align:start position:0%
purpose thank you very much for that we
 
05:25:24.948 --> 05:25:24.958 align:start position:0%
have a a very good researcher Davis

Moffet yes all right so uh 180
 
05:26:42.910 --> 05:26:42.920 align:start position:0%
okay I will do the report for that and I
 
05:26:46.990 --> 05:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
believe it can go on consent uh with the
 
05:26:49.070 --> 05:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
amendment the uh speaker will ask the
 
05:26:51.548 --> 05:26:51.558 align:start position:0%
Full House to approve the amendment so
 
05:26:54.708 --> 05:26:54.718 align:start position:0%
that would be a consent item as well yes
 
05:26:56.430 --> 05:26:56.440 align:start position:0%
uh can I question that uh go ahead
 
05:26:58.510 --> 05:26:58.520 align:start position:0%
represent Jones yeah go ahead only uh I
 
05:27:01.350 --> 05:27:01.360 align:start position:0%
don't know because it was amended after
 
05:27:03.910 --> 05:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
the public hearing for transparency's
 
05:27:05.830 --> 05:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
sake should we not put it on the consent
 
05:27:08.190 --> 05:27:08.200 align:start position:0%
agenda yeah that's an interesting point
 
05:27:09.470 --> 05:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
that's kind of what I was touching on
 
05:27:12.310 --> 05:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
because we did amend it uh if it
 
05:27:16.830 --> 05:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
qualifies for for um for consent and I
 
05:27:20.030 --> 05:27:20.040 align:start position:0%
think we can uh to be safe we won't put
 
05:27:22.390 --> 05:27:22.400 align:start position:0%
it on consent Madam
 
05:27:25.750 --> 05:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
clerk thank you for that
 
05:27:29.510 --> 05:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:29.520 --> 05:27:31.310 align:start position:0%
 
you

05:27:31.310 --> 05:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:27:35.510 --> 05:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
okay that brings us to HB 256 that's the
 
05:27:39.110 --> 05:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh recommended proposed us s Liberty
 
05:27:43.750 --> 05:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
study committee uh that was a motion
 
05:27:45.750 --> 05:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
that was a measure that was a bill that
 
05:27:48.150 --> 05:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
came about based on an interim study
 
05:27:51.110 --> 05:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
recommendation from a similar bill that
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
we dealt with last term repent Manion
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
was the Prime sponsor ranion I'm going
 
05:27:59.830 --> 05:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
to look to you for a motion here cor I
 
05:28:02.590 --> 05:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't the prime but uh yeah I'm so my
 
05:28:05.030 --> 05:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
motion here is to
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
retain and uh a second we need a second
 
05:28:11.190 --> 05:28:11.200 align:start position:0%
for that I'll second that represent
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
Rollins seconds that uh okay so
 
05:28:15.750 --> 05:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
represent Manion if you would speak to
 
05:28:15.760 --> 05:28:16.910 align:start position:0%
represent Manion if you would speak to
your

05:28:16.910 --> 05:28:16.920 align:start position:0%
your
 
05:28:19.470 --> 05:28:19.480 align:start position:0%
motion absolutely
 
05:28:23.110 --> 05:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
so I fully I I support the underlying uh
 
05:28:24.750 --> 05:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee that we should be doing I
 
05:28:26.990 --> 05:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
think we need time to kind of come I
 
05:28:29.230 --> 05:28:29.240 align:start position:0%
think as a committee uh perhaps find the
 
05:28:31.070 --> 05:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
best solution forward for these men uh
 
05:28:32.590 --> 05:28:32.600 align:start position:0%
the committee is a great idea there's
 
05:28:34.548 --> 05:28:34.558 align:start position:0%
also another potential idea coming
 
05:28:37.548 --> 05:28:37.558 align:start position:0%
forward uh but we need more time uh that
 
05:28:38.708 --> 05:28:38.718 align:start position:0%
we put over
 
05:28:39.990 --> 05:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
over the summer we can come back to this
 
05:28:41.548 --> 05:28:41.558 align:start position:0%
in the fall and then really give these
 
05:28:46.750 --> 05:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
men something uh anything to help
 
05:28:50.628 --> 05:28:50.638 align:start position:0%
them representative Rollins thank you Mr
 
05:28:53.750 --> 05:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
chair in the 13 years I've been here I
 
05:28:55.708 --> 05:28:55.718 align:start position:0%
have never had a bill that I've been
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
more passionate about than getting
 
05:29:00.390 --> 05:29:00.400 align:start position:0%
something done with this bill in EN
 
05:29:03.030 --> 05:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
closure for these men that were on that
 
05:29:05.310 --> 05:29:05.320 align:start position:0%
ship I'm very
 
05:29:07.270 --> 05:29:07.280 align:start position:0%
pro-israel don't have a problem with
 
05:29:11.190 --> 05:29:11.200 align:start position:0%
that but to me I put I put our men and
 
05:29:13.110 --> 05:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
women in the service first before
 
05:29:15.270 --> 05:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
anything else these men and women signed
 
05:29:18.390 --> 05:29:18.400 align:start position:0%
on the dotted line up to and including
 
05:29:21.948 --> 05:29:21.958 align:start position:0%
their own lives okay they did not sign
 
05:29:23.868 --> 05:29:23.878 align:start position:0%
that dotted line to be a sacrificial
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
lamb we have got to get to the get down
 
05:29:30.350 --> 05:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
to this I'm praying next year we get on
 
05:29:33.230 --> 05:29:33.240 align:start position:0%
it to give these men on that ship and
 
05:29:36.750 --> 05:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
their family's closure on this issue
 
05:29:39.350 --> 05:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
okay and I understand that this may be a
 
05:29:40.910 --> 05:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
quicker way to do it than a study
 
05:29:42.470 --> 05:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
committee because it would probably take
 
05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
longer we can have this have a fall
 
05:29:46.548 --> 05:29:46.558 align:start position:0%
meeting on this we can get it first on
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
the first on the list for voting next
 
05:29:52.190 --> 05:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
year so it may be a quicker solution to
 
05:29:54.190 --> 05:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
the problem but we've got to we got to
 
05:29:56.350 --> 05:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
stand by this we've got to stick to this
 
05:29:58.628 --> 05:29:58.638 align:start position:0%
we've got to do something for these men
 
05:30:01.110 --> 05:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
and women my my heart bleeds for every
 
05:30:03.150 --> 05:30:03.160 align:start position:0%
one of these guys I think the stories
 
05:30:05.470 --> 05:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
that we heard in the testimonies the
 
05:30:08.350 --> 05:30:08.360 align:start position:0%
first guy that spoke it was the first
 
05:30:10.708 --> 05:30:10.718 align:start position:0%
time that he's ever spoke to anyone
 
05:30:13.350 --> 05:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
about what his experiences were on this
 
05:30:15.948 --> 05:30:15.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:17.910 --> 05:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
closure thank you very much
 
05:30:21.070 --> 05:30:21.080 align:start position:0%
representative Rollins I'll say that the
 
05:30:23.030 --> 05:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
testimony we received last term in this
 
05:30:25.628 --> 05:30:25.638 align:start position:0%
term was very very emotional there's a
 
05:30:28.110 --> 05:30:28.120 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire connection to the there
 
05:30:31.230 --> 05:30:31.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire people on the ship a lot
 
05:30:34.270 --> 05:30:34.280 align:start position:0%
of new englanders were on the ship the
 
05:30:36.270 --> 05:30:36.280 align:start position:0%
uh I think it was the intelligence
 
05:30:38.270 --> 05:30:38.280 align:start position:0%
officer died not that long ago from
 
05:30:40.310 --> 05:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
coldbrook so there is a New Hampshire
 
05:30:41.750 --> 05:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
connection of
 
05:30:45.590 --> 05:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
course and as the vice chair just
 
05:30:49.868 --> 05:30:49.878 align:start position:0%
touched on to to do a committee uh would
 
05:30:52.470 --> 05:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
certainly maybe
 
05:30:54.948 --> 05:30:54.958 align:start position:0%
hopefully end up with something out of
 
05:30:57.750 --> 05:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
that that would move this situation
 
05:30:59.628 --> 05:30:59.638 align:start position:0%
forward so that some light can be shined
 
05:31:01.948 --> 05:31:01.958 align:start position:0%
where it needs to be shined for these
 
05:31:05.110 --> 05:31:05.120 align:start position:0%
men who came from uh different parts of
 
05:31:07.910 --> 05:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
the country last term and this term
 
05:31:10.750 --> 05:31:10.760 align:start position:0%
looking to be
 
05:31:14.270 --> 05:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
heard so what can happen with this being
 
05:31:15.948 --> 05:31:15.958 align:start position:0%
retained we'll come back to it we will
 
05:31:18.110 --> 05:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
have to come back to it in some fashion
 
05:31:19.830 --> 05:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
but one of the things that we're we've
 
05:31:22.548 --> 05:31:22.558 align:start position:0%
talked about doing is putting in an hjr
 
05:31:25.310 --> 05:31:25.320 align:start position:0%
we talked about an hjr earlier today on
 
05:31:27.590 --> 05:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
a different matter house joint
 
05:31:30.030 --> 05:31:30.040 align:start position:0%
resolution which we could put in in
 
05:31:32.628 --> 05:31:32.638 align:start position:0%
September in some fashion submit it for
 
05:31:36.270 --> 05:31:36.280 align:start position:0%
the next uh for next year and house Jr
 
05:31:37.990 --> 05:31:38.000 align:start position:0%
would maybe do what a committee would
 
05:31:40.670 --> 05:31:40.680 align:start position:0%
have recommended anyway which should
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
which may have been to do uh NH hjr we
 
05:31:46.830 --> 05:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
can just go ahead and and work one up
 
05:31:49.350 --> 05:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
put something together submit it in
 
05:31:51.350 --> 05:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
September and of course as we said
 
05:31:53.350 --> 05:31:53.360 align:start position:0%
earlier a house joint resolution
 
05:31:54.990 --> 05:31:55.000 align:start position:0%
involves the house if it goes forward
 
05:31:56.590 --> 05:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
from the house it goes to the Senate and
 
05:31:59.310 --> 05:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
then it also involves the governor uh
 
05:32:01.310 --> 05:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
perhaps there could be a proclamation
 
05:32:04.270 --> 05:32:04.280 align:start position:0%
it's a touchy issue for those of you
 
05:32:07.948 --> 05:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
watching remotely or are aware of the
 
05:32:11.670 --> 05:32:11.680 align:start position:0%
the hearing that we had this year and
 
05:32:11.680 --> 05:32:12.708 align:start position:0%
the hearing that we had this year and
last

05:32:12.708 --> 05:32:12.718 align:start position:0%
last
 
05:32:16.788 --> 05:32:16.798 align:start position:0%
term what happened in 1967 the USS
 
05:32:19.390 --> 05:32:19.400 align:start position:0%
liberity was a US Naval vessel that was
 
05:32:21.670 --> 05:32:21.680 align:start position:0%
attacked by the Israeli armed forces and
 
05:32:24.510 --> 05:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
almost sunk uh many men were killed many
 
05:32:27.150 --> 05:32:27.160 align:start position:0%
more were injured the captain got a
 
05:32:29.110 --> 05:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
medal of honor but it was covered up
 
05:32:32.070 --> 05:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
frankly uh it was uh hush hushed it was
 
05:32:33.948 --> 05:32:33.958 align:start position:0%
covered up the men were
 
05:32:38.430 --> 05:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
threatened not to talk about it and uh I
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
was I'm old enough to remember that
 
05:32:43.628 --> 05:32:43.638 align:start position:0%
incident and the survivors were told not
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about it and most of them lot of
 
05:32:46.788 --> 05:32:46.798 align:start position:0%
them were gone but some of the ones who
 
05:32:48.510 --> 05:32:48.520 align:start position:0%
took the time to come and look to us
 
05:32:49.910 --> 05:32:49.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire for whatever
 
05:32:52.990 --> 05:32:53.000 align:start position:0%
reason however that first came up the
 
05:32:55.670 --> 05:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
survivors are begging
 
05:32:59.030 --> 05:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
literally for some answers that still
 
05:33:02.230 --> 05:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
have not been forthcoming so if if our
 
05:33:05.948 --> 05:33:05.958 align:start position:0%
body if our committee if our house our
 
05:33:07.750 --> 05:33:07.760 align:start position:0%
legislature possibly even the Govern
 
05:33:11.110 --> 05:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
govern if this goes to an hjr can shine
 
05:33:14.110 --> 05:33:14.120 align:start position:0%
a light and maybe get some answers maybe
 
05:33:16.990 --> 05:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
get some things Declassified so that the
 
05:33:19.510 --> 05:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
men while they're still around can get
 
05:33:20.948 --> 05:33:20.958 align:start position:0%
some answers and hopefully as
 
05:33:22.670 --> 05:33:22.680 align:start position:0%
representative Rowan said some closure
 
05:33:24.910 --> 05:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
so that's our intent so by retaining
 
05:33:26.548 --> 05:33:26.558 align:start position:0%
this it's not that we are not going to
 
05:33:28.788 --> 05:33:28.798 align:start position:0%
take immediate action we are looking to
 
05:33:34.868 --> 05:33:34.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:39.750 --> 05:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
cyber uh do you mind Mr chairman if I is
 
05:33:42.670 --> 05:33:42.680 align:start position:0%
that okay yes please representative
 
05:33:47.948 --> 05:33:47.958 align:start position:0%
Lloyd um so sorry um so I have I
 
05:33:50.708 --> 05:33:50.718 align:start position:0%
appreciate um your suggestion of putting
 
05:33:53.430 --> 05:33:53.440 align:start position:0%
through a resolution to this uh or for
 
05:33:55.990 --> 05:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
this especially because I feel like if
 
05:33:57.948 --> 05:33:57.958 align:start position:0%
this had been brought to us as a
 
05:34:00.910 --> 05:34:00.920 align:start position:0%
resolution I think it would have been
 
05:34:04.948 --> 05:34:04.958 align:start position:0%
across the board OTP immediately my I
 
05:34:06.830 --> 05:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
guess my concern with retain and I have
 
05:34:09.270 --> 05:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
no objection to retaining this is is it
 
05:34:12.230 --> 05:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
going to prolong the length of time that
 
05:34:14.590 --> 05:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
we have to wait do we need to itl it
 
05:34:15.830 --> 05:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
first and
 
05:34:18.590 --> 05:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
then put through the
 
05:34:20.948 --> 05:34:20.958 align:start position:0%
resolution I understand your
 
05:34:26.590 --> 05:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
point by not passing it the option was a
 
05:34:28.670 --> 05:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
of doing a committee the thought was
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to take a lot of time and
 
05:34:34.470 --> 05:34:34.480 align:start position:0%
is it is that the best use of our time
 
05:34:35.910 --> 05:34:35.920 align:start position:0%
when we have another option which would
 
05:34:37.788 --> 05:34:37.798 align:start position:0%
be an HDR
 
05:34:41.868 --> 05:34:41.878 align:start position:0%
if but if we I if we itl it it's done of
 
05:34:43.190 --> 05:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
course we would go to the house and the
 
05:34:44.310 --> 05:34:44.320 align:start position:0%
house would have to approve our
 
05:34:46.708 --> 05:34:46.718 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation if we retain it
 
05:34:48.910 --> 05:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
it gives us the option of coming back to
 
05:34:51.628 --> 05:34:51.638 align:start position:0%
it which we will have to in in the fall
 
05:34:55.030 --> 05:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
and then the first session in January
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
the retain motions will be uh attended
 
05:35:00.628 --> 05:35:00.638 align:start position:0%
to so I get your point it's a good point
 
05:35:02.628 --> 05:35:02.638 align:start position:0%
I think I think retention works because
 
05:35:04.548 --> 05:35:04.558 align:start position:0%
it gives us in a sense two btes at the
 
05:35:07.750 --> 05:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
Apple if you're tracking me
 
05:35:13.110 --> 05:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
other comments represent gagy Naval
 
05:35:17.670 --> 05:35:17.680 align:start position:0%

05:35:38.070 --> 05:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
century I was a kickboxer it's Etc
 
05:35:39.990 --> 05:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to be a tough guy but I'm

Sailor so I know that when you're on
 
05:35:53.270 --> 05:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
board ship there's no place to hide when
 
05:35:55.510 --> 05:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
the stuff starts coming in there's no
 
05:35:57.788 --> 05:35:57.798 align:start position:0%
place to hide if you're if you're above
 
05:36:00.270 --> 05:36:00.280 align:start position:0%
deck then you get shrapnel if you're

below deck you take an incoming and
 
05:36:06.150 --> 05:36:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:36:08.788 --> 05:36:08.798 align:start position:0%
drown anyway
 
05:36:12.070 --> 05:36:12.080 align:start position:0%
you have not been abandoned this whole
 
05:36:14.110 --> 05:36:14.120 align:start position:0%
the whole reason why we're retaining
 
05:36:17.230 --> 05:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
this so we can get some more clout so
 
05:36:20.788 --> 05:36:20.798 align:start position:0%

Congressional
 
05:36:33.948 --> 05:36:33.958 align:start position:0%
Delegation because my understanding I

get a lot of email from uh congressman
 
05:36:39.910 --> 05:36:39.920 align:start position:0%
papis Pro
 
05:36:42.670 --> 05:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
veteran things will happen if they get
 
05:36:45.830 --> 05:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
involved with this my problem was why
 
05:36:48.990 --> 05:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
was that ship moved from the west coast
 
05:36:52.390 --> 05:36:52.400 align:start position:0%
of Africa which was its stomping grounds
 
05:36:56.830 --> 05:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
ordered to go just barely beyond the
 
05:37:01.548 --> 05:37:01.558 align:start position:0%
statues of limitation the the U the
 
05:37:04.990 --> 05:37:05.000 align:start position:0%
boundaries the 12 mile boundary of
 
05:37:07.990 --> 05:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
Israel and why was it covered up when
 
05:37:10.110 --> 05:37:10.120 align:start position:0%
the Jets were coming they were told to
 
05:37:12.788 --> 05:37:12.798 align:start position:0%
stand down something happened there
 
05:37:16.470 --> 05:37:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's not right you're not
 
05:37:18.390 --> 05:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
abandoned thank you for that

thank you Mr chairman um so this is more
 
05:38:38.788 --> 05:38:38.798 align:start position:0%
of a a rules question I suppose but is
 
05:38:42.150 --> 05:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
there any way that we could come
 
05:38:44.708 --> 05:38:44.718 align:start position:0%
together as a committee to try to come
 
05:38:47.390 --> 05:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
up with some other workarounds that
 
05:38:49.830 --> 05:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
might actually help these veterans in
 
05:38:52.110 --> 05:38:52.120 align:start position:0%
the meantime while we're waiting for
 
05:38:54.510 --> 05:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
some type of resolution to
 
05:38:57.230 --> 05:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
this sure represent thank you for your
 
05:38:59.468 --> 05:38:59.478 align:start position:0%
question and comment uh to your point of
 
05:39:03.310 --> 05:39:03.320 align:start position:0%
course uh we're all of us to some degree
 
05:39:06.270 --> 05:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
are invested and in and care about this
 
05:39:08.030 --> 05:39:08.040 align:start position:0%
is we spent a lot of time on it last
 
05:39:11.468 --> 05:39:11.478 align:start position:0%
term and this term uh my my response
 
05:39:13.788 --> 05:39:13.798 align:start position:0%
would be that if we're going to put in a
 
05:39:16.468 --> 05:39:16.478 align:start position:0%
resolution hjr which needs to be
 
05:39:19.468 --> 05:39:19.478 align:start position:0%
submitted September not that far off we
 
05:39:23.390 --> 05:39:23.400 align:start position:0%
we can use this time to put together a
 
05:39:25.948 --> 05:39:25.958 align:start position:0%
njr worded in such a fashion that could
 
05:39:28.430 --> 05:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
site some new information to your point
 
05:39:30.830 --> 05:39:30.840 align:start position:0%
to make that uh a more powerful
 
05:39:30.840 --> 05:39:32.350 align:start position:0%
to make that uh a more powerful
meaningful

05:39:32.350 --> 05:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
meaningful
 
05:39:35.350 --> 05:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
substantive uh resolution does that
 
05:39:38.468 --> 05:39:38.478 align:start position:0%
touch on your your point yes thank you
 
05:39:40.310 --> 05:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um I'm just wondering if
 
05:39:41.948 --> 05:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
there's anything outside of the
 
05:39:43.868 --> 05:39:43.878 align:start position:0%
legislative process that we could look
 
05:39:47.868 --> 05:39:47.878 align:start position:0%
into as a as a group to try to get these
 
05:39:50.350 --> 05:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
veterans some relief um in the meantime
 
05:39:53.110 --> 05:39:53.120 align:start position:0%
as far as um working with veteran
 
05:39:55.910 --> 05:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
services or or something along those
 
05:39:58.868 --> 05:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
lines yes I think that's a very great
 
05:40:02.270 --> 05:40:02.280 align:start position:0%
idea and that's something as you said uh
 
05:40:04.430 --> 05:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
off I'm trying to think of the right
 
05:40:07.670 --> 05:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
term um offline or whatever not formally
 
05:40:09.468 --> 05:40:09.478 align:start position:0%
or officially but I think that those of
 
05:40:11.868 --> 05:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
us who are invested in this can
 
05:40:15.750 --> 05:40:15.760 align:start position:0%
certainly we let's talk later uh not not
 
05:40:17.548 --> 05:40:17.558 align:start position:0%
right here about some things that we can
 
05:40:19.468 --> 05:40:19.478 align:start position:0%
look at doing to to make a difference
 
05:40:22.310 --> 05:40:22.320 align:start position:0%
and move this forward I I
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
agree anything else representa
 
05:40:29.230 --> 05:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
Jones um I'm sorry M Mr chair but can I
 
05:40:31.390 --> 05:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
ask you or the motion maker just to once
 
05:40:34.990 --> 05:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
again tell me the benefit of retaining
 
05:40:39.708 --> 05:40:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:43.430 --> 05:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
the motion to retain I I'll speak to it
 
05:40:46.510 --> 05:40:46.520 align:start position:0%
and then uh ranion or anybody else can
 
05:40:48.390 --> 05:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
can add to
 
05:40:53.150 --> 05:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
this and the concern was doing a
 
05:40:54.468 --> 05:40:54.478 align:start position:0%
committee and committees are not
 
05:40:56.628 --> 05:40:56.638 align:start position:0%
necessarily popular with with everybody
 
05:40:59.070 --> 05:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
for a combination of reasons one of
 
05:41:01.910 --> 05:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
which being the the the Personnel
 
05:41:03.070 --> 05:41:03.080 align:start position:0%
demands who's going to be in the
 
05:41:04.830 --> 05:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
committee when are they going to
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
meet and also the time Factor
 
05:41:11.110 --> 05:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
if a committee meets and then they
 
05:41:13.628 --> 05:41:13.638 align:start position:0%
recommend action we can't take any
 
05:41:17.468 --> 05:41:17.478 align:start position:0%
action until September uh or next year
 
05:41:19.628 --> 05:41:19.638 align:start position:0%
anyway uh at least in terms of
 
05:41:22.070 --> 05:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
legislative action so if the committee
 
05:41:23.708 --> 05:41:23.718 align:start position:0%
is going to take all this time and
 
05:41:25.990 --> 05:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
recommend uh which I would anticipate
 
05:41:28.990 --> 05:41:29.000 align:start position:0%
they would do maybe a series of actions
 
05:41:31.350 --> 05:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
Beyond a resolution that to
 
05:41:33.030 --> 05:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
representative Lloyd's point I think we
 
05:41:35.110 --> 05:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
can look at some of those alternative
 
05:41:39.750 --> 05:41:39.760 align:start position:0%
actions on our own to support the uh the
 
05:41:43.190 --> 05:41:43.200 align:start position:0%
survivors but to do a committee that's
 
05:41:46.910 --> 05:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
going to recommend a resolution we can
 
05:41:49.468 --> 05:41:49.478 align:start position:0%
just do the resolution without going
 
05:41:52.190 --> 05:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
through all that's involved with with
 
05:41:54.548 --> 05:41:54.558 align:start position:0%
getting a committee approved by the Full
 
05:41:56.750 --> 05:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
House which we don't know that would
 
05:41:59.670 --> 05:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
would necessarily happen so so that's
 
05:42:01.150 --> 05:42:01.160 align:start position:0%
hopefully answers your question some
 
05:42:03.350 --> 05:42:03.360 align:start position:0%
whatat representative Manion do can you
 
05:42:05.070 --> 05:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
amplify that I think that's kind of like
 
05:42:06.868 --> 05:42:06.878 align:start position:0%
the discussion we've been having is
 
05:42:08.110 --> 05:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
that's probably the best course of
 
05:42:11.070 --> 05:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
action that's a very good answer thank
 
05:42:14.150 --> 05:42:14.160 align:start position:0%
you anything
 
05:42:17.830 --> 05:42:17.840 align:start position:0%
else seeing no other hands the motion on
 
05:42:21.990 --> 05:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
the floor is to retain HB 256 with
 
05:42:25.310 --> 05:42:25.320 align:start position:0%

05:42:27.350 --> 05:42:27.360 align:start position:0%

through Congress concerning the
 
05:44:07.190 --> 05:44:07.200 align:start position:0%
brutality in Bangladesh we had a
 
05:44:10.110 --> 05:44:10.120 align:start position:0%
extended hearing on that we had uh some
 
05:44:12.590 --> 05:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh folks who spoke at Great length I did
 
05:44:15.310 --> 05:44:15.320 align:start position:0%

manions OTP motion on
 
05:44:34.990 --> 05:44:35.000 align:start position:0%
hcr1 representative Manion to your
 
05:44:37.270 --> 05:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
motion yeah so uh we heard a great
 
05:44:38.510 --> 05:44:38.520 align:start position:0%
amount of testimony from people that
 
05:44:41.270 --> 05:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
have lived there know first or
 
05:44:43.830 --> 05:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
secondhand what's going on uh I'm
 
05:44:46.150 --> 05:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
personally very interested in US foreign
 
05:44:48.310 --> 05:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
policy and I like to know what's going
 
05:44:50.390 --> 05:44:50.400 align:start position:0%
on with the inter workings of other
 
05:44:53.110 --> 05:44:53.120 align:start position:0%
countries where we have Investments um
 
05:44:54.788 --> 05:44:54.798 align:start position:0%
and from the sounds of this uh I mean I
 
05:44:56.110 --> 05:44:56.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to make too many judgment
 
05:44:57.750 --> 05:44:57.760 align:start position:0%
calls but it sounds an awful lot like
 
05:44:59.270 --> 05:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
this could have been an external uh
 
05:45:01.548 --> 05:45:01.558 align:start position:0%
Force came into this country and as uh
 
05:45:03.350 --> 05:45:03.360 align:start position:0%
fomenting Rebellion it could be an
 
05:45:05.150 --> 05:45:05.160 align:start position:0%
adversary to the United States could be
 
05:45:06.510 --> 05:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
linked to Al-Qaeda an enemy of the
 
05:45:08.830 --> 05:45:08.840 align:start position:0%
United States States uh and I would so I
 
05:45:12.030 --> 05:45:12.040 align:start position:0%
urge Congress to investigate
 
05:45:15.510 --> 05:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
this R
 
05:45:18.390 --> 05:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
gagy all that the representative said
 
05:45:18.400 --> 05:45:19.150 align:start position:0%
gagy all that the representative said
and

05:45:19.150 --> 05:45:19.160 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:45:22.030 --> 05:45:22.040 align:start position:0%
also to boil it all down to one sentence
 
05:45:25.070 --> 05:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
save Bangladesh and its people from
 
05:45:26.990 --> 05:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
Injustice thank you representative I'll
 
05:45:28.708 --> 05:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
just say which I started to say before I
 
05:45:31.948 --> 05:45:31.958 align:start position:0%
did not realize what was going on there
 
05:45:33.868 --> 05:45:33.878 align:start position:0%
and I do try to stay somewhat AB breast
 
05:45:35.590 --> 05:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
of what's going on in the world and I
 
05:45:37.708 --> 05:45:37.718 align:start position:0%
did not know until this
 
05:45:41.510 --> 05:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
resolution came forward uh exactly how
 
05:45:44.230 --> 05:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
bad it sounds like what has happened in
 
05:45:48.270 --> 05:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
Bangladesh formerly East Pakistan so we
 
05:45:50.468 --> 05:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
had a good uh history lesson during the
 
05:45:53.270 --> 05:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
hearing very passionate testimony from
 
05:45:56.030 --> 05:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor and from other uh
 
05:46:00.628 --> 05:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
people from his his Circle so uh I want
 
05:46:02.430 --> 05:46:02.440 align:start position:0%
to thank the prime sponsor for helping
 
05:46:04.510 --> 05:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
shine a light on something that people
 
05:46:06.110 --> 05:46:06.120 align:start position:0%
need to know about and so I think this
 
05:46:08.590 --> 05:46:08.600 align:start position:0%
resolution can help with that if it
 
05:46:10.948 --> 05:46:10.958 align:start position:0%
moves forward to raise awareness and
 
05:46:13.190 --> 05:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
shine a light on something that needs to
 
05:46:15.628 --> 05:46:15.638 align:start position:0%
be that people need to be more aware of
 
05:46:20.670 --> 05:46:20.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:24.070 --> 05:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh representative cyber I would
 
05:46:26.548 --> 05:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
just like to say that U on top of this
 
05:46:29.430 --> 05:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
measure which I fully agree with um I
 
05:46:33.070 --> 05:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
also just want to add that um I condemn
 
05:46:36.990 --> 05:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
any religious persecution or or
 
05:46:40.468 --> 05:46:40.478 align:start position:0%
oppression anywhere in the world by any
 
05:46:40.478 --> 05:46:41.390 align:start position:0%
oppression anywhere in the world by any
other

05:46:41.390 --> 05:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
other
 
05:46:44.628 --> 05:46:44.638 align:start position:0%
religion and and I definitely even more
 
05:46:46.750 --> 05:46:46.760 align:start position:0%
so and for a separation of church and
 
05:46:50.230 --> 05:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
state that's what causes a lot of these
 
05:46:52.708 --> 05:46:52.718 align:start position:0%
problems that certainly ties into the
 
05:46:54.150 --> 05:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
greater issue
 
05:46:56.868 --> 05:46:56.878 align:start position:0%
here anything
 
05:46:59.030 --> 05:46:59.040 align:start position:0%

and I I recommended uh changing the word
 
05:47:09.150 --> 05:47:09.160 align:start position:0%
allegations incidents but I think we're
 
05:47:11.670 --> 05:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
better off sticking with allegations the
 
05:47:13.750 --> 05:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
way it is so I just want to say I'm not
 
05:47:15.510 --> 05:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
going to
 
05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%

05:48:39.830 --> 05:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
I I would not put this on the regular
 
05:48:41.948 --> 05:48:41.958 align:start position:0%
calendar because I would want someone to
 
05:48:44.390 --> 05:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
speak to it on the
 
05:48:47.310 --> 05:48:47.320 align:start position:0%
floor right so this will not be a
 
05:48:48.910 --> 05:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
consent item even though it was
 
05:48:51.990 --> 05:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous so good question no not on
 
05:48:53.390 --> 05:48:53.400 align:start position:0%
consent it will go to the floor for a
 
05:48:53.400 --> 05:49:12.310 align:start position:0%
consent it will go to the floor for a
vote

05:49:12.310 --> 05:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:16.548 --> 05:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
okay we have two more to go uh which uh
 
05:49:18.510 --> 05:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
we'll get to right
 
05:49:20.948 --> 05:49:20.958 align:start position:0%

hcr1 hcr9 is what we're up to now and
 
05:49:29.750 --> 05:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
that has to do with rejecting compliance
 
05:49:33.390 --> 05:49:33.400 align:start position:0%
with the European unions
 
05:49:37.750 --> 05:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
csdd and we need a that was the the uh
 
05:49:39.708 --> 05:49:39.718 align:start position:0%
HCR brought in by representative

pass and do we have a
 
05:49:58.110 --> 05:49:58.120 align:start position:0%
second rep some Manion seconds okay uh
 
05:50:00.110 --> 05:50:00.120 align:start position:0%

speak to your OTP motion yes thank you
Mr

05:50:03.230 --> 05:50:03.240 align:start position:0%
Mr
 
05:50:06.670 --> 05:50:06.680 align:start position:0%
chairman so the EU corporate syst
 
05:50:09.390 --> 05:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
stainability due diligence directive
 
05:50:12.150 --> 05:50:12.160 align:start position:0%
represents an attempt to inflict on the
 
05:50:15.708 --> 05:50:15.718 align:start position:0%
United States extr territorially a host
 
05:50:18.110 --> 05:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
of rather awful measures that were just
 
05:50:20.590 --> 05:50:20.600 align:start position:0%
recently resoundingly defeated in
 
05:50:23.390 --> 05:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
America at The Ballot Box what is
 
05:50:24.948 --> 05:50:24.958 align:start position:0%
happening here is
 
05:50:28.190 --> 05:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
Insidious these measures would reduce
 
05:50:29.868 --> 05:50:29.878 align:start position:0%
the quality of life by promoting
 
05:50:33.030 --> 05:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
degrowth of energy and economics and

05:50:40.190 --> 05:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
policies if these corporations got
 
05:50:42.990 --> 05:50:43.000 align:start position:0%
together of their own accord and schemed
 
05:50:45.468 --> 05:50:45.478 align:start position:0%
behind closed doors to adopt these
 
05:50:48.270 --> 05:50:48.280 align:start position:0%
policies we would call that a crime
 
05:50:50.430 --> 05:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
under anti-competitive laws it
 
05:50:52.830 --> 05:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
represents cartel activity it goes

coerces corporations into the same
 
05:51:05.270 --> 05:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
behavior we have something worse than a

the governments in compelling these
 
05:51:16.510 --> 05:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
corporations effectively turned them
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
into an arm of government itself and
 
05:51:21.948 --> 05:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
they utilize these quasi private quasi
 
05:51:24.990 --> 05:51:25.000 align:start position:0%
public entities to circumvent laws meant
 
05:51:26.110 --> 05:51:26.120 align:start position:0%
to limit
 
05:51:28.670 --> 05:51:28.680 align:start position:0%
government let me make the point via a
 
05:51:30.390 --> 05:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
couple brief historic
 
05:51:32.708 --> 05:51:32.718 align:start position:0%
quotes the first quote that is relevant
 
05:51:34.350 --> 05:51:34.360 align:start position:0%
here relates to government efforts to
 
05:51:37.590 --> 05:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
require social activism via Private
 
05:51:40.590 --> 05:51:40.600 align:start position:0%
Business everything within the state
 
05:51:43.030 --> 05:51:43.040 align:start position:0%
nothing outside the state nothing
 
05:51:44.590 --> 05:51:44.600 align:start position:0%
against the
 
05:51:47.190 --> 05:51:47.200 align:start position:0%
state that quote is attributable to
 
05:51:50.590 --> 05:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
Italian fascist dictator Bonito musolini
 
05:51:52.350 --> 05:51:52.360 align:start position:0%
further making this point musolini can
 
05:51:54.708 --> 05:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
be quoted as saying fascism should more
 
05:51:57.150 --> 05:51:57.160 align:start position:0%
properly be called corporatism because
 
05:52:00.150 --> 05:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
it is a merger of state and corporate
 
05:52:03.670 --> 05:52:03.680 align:start position:0%
power this is precisely what this EU
 
05:52:06.548 --> 05:52:06.558 align:start position:0%
measure is trying to inflict it is a
 
05:52:08.590 --> 05:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
fascistic means to implement an
 
05:52:11.150 --> 05:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
ideological agenda that was rejected by
 
05:52:13.230 --> 05:52:13.240 align:start position:0%
the American people now what is the
 
05:52:15.670 --> 05:52:15.680 align:start position:0%
agenda itself as I already noted the
 
05:52:17.590 --> 05:52:17.600 align:start position:0%
foundation of so-called sustainability
 
05:52:19.390 --> 05:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
according to the United Nations and the
 
05:52:23.430 --> 05:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
EU is the concept of degrowth simply put
 
05:52:25.270 --> 05:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
it is the destruction of economic
 
05:52:27.310 --> 05:52:27.320 align:start position:0%
activity the reduction of human
 
05:52:29.910 --> 05:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
population the strict limiting of energy
 
05:52:32.670 --> 05:52:32.680 align:start position:0%
production travel restrictions and much
 
05:52:35.230 --> 05:52:35.240 align:start position:0%
more where can we learn about this model
 
05:52:37.070 --> 05:52:37.080 align:start position:0%
of degrowth
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
for that we look to the work of
 
05:52:41.830 --> 05:52:41.840 align:start position:0%
prominent German educated Japanese
 
05:52:45.590 --> 05:52:45.600 align:start position:0%
philosopher kohi Saito and his book
 
05:52:47.910 --> 05:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
marks in the anthropos scene toward the
 
05:52:49.948 --> 05:52:49.958 align:start position:0%
idea of degrowth
 
05:52:52.270 --> 05:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
Communism should you doubt this is real
 
05:52:53.468 --> 05:52:53.478 align:start position:0%
I would encourage you to look up the
 
05:52:56.110 --> 05:52:56.120 align:start position:0%
plans already formulated in the EU EU
 
05:52:58.230 --> 05:52:58.240 align:start position:0%
under this policy to shutter the
 
05:52:59.750 --> 05:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
majority of airports in the coming
 
05:53:02.430 --> 05:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
decades to reserve air travel solely for
 
05:53:02.440 --> 05:53:03.430 align:start position:0%
decades to reserve air travel solely for
privileged

05:53:03.430 --> 05:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
privileged
 
05:53:06.670 --> 05:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
Elites to Germany's historically crazy
 
05:53:09.150 --> 05:53:09.160 align:start position:0%
energy policy that produced a massive
 
05:53:11.590 --> 05:53:11.600 align:start position:0%
recession in their economy the
 
05:53:14.628 --> 05:53:14.638 align:start position:0%
censorship regime enacted across the EU
 
05:53:17.390 --> 05:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
along the construct of hate speech and
 
05:53:19.230 --> 05:53:19.240 align:start position:0%
toward the importation of a foreign
 
05:53:22.230 --> 05:53:22.240 align:start position:0%
horde into Europe in exactly the manner
 
05:53:24.270 --> 05:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
described by Aristotle over two
 
05:53:24.280 --> 05:53:25.788 align:start position:0%
described by Aristotle over two
Millennia

05:53:25.788 --> 05:53:25.798 align:start position:0%
Millennia
 
05:53:29.708 --> 05:53:29.718 align:start position:0%
ago these policies are nothing short of
 
05:53:32.390 --> 05:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
civilizational suicide on the same scale
 
05:53:35.270 --> 05:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
as mau's Great Leap Forward and Stalin's
 
05:53:37.430 --> 05:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
like lysen coist plant
 
05:53:40.070 --> 05:53:40.080 align:start position:0%
science the Soviet ties don't end there
 
05:53:42.430 --> 05:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
either as the Soviets under linen
 
05:53:44.150 --> 05:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
established the world's first Dei
 
05:53:45.948 --> 05:53:45.958 align:start position:0%
program called
 
05:53:45.958 --> 05:53:47.548 align:start position:0%
program called
Corin

05:53:47.548 --> 05:53:47.558 align:start position:0%
Corin
 
05:53:51.110 --> 05:53:51.120 align:start position:0%
corinia in Russian and this EU mandate
 
05:53:54.310 --> 05:53:54.320 align:start position:0%
includes these same inspired Dei
 
05:53:56.910 --> 05:53:56.920 align:start position:0%
programs the attempt by the EU to force
 
05:53:59.150 --> 05:53:59.160 align:start position:0%
these policies on the American people
 
05:54:02.150 --> 05:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
from across the Atlantic should be seen
 
05:54:04.230 --> 05:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
as nothing short of a hostile act
 
05:54:06.468 --> 05:54:06.478 align:start position:0%
against the United States of America and
 
05:54:09.150 --> 05:54:09.160 align:start position:0%
it should be dealt with that way by our
 
05:54:10.670 --> 05:54:10.680 align:start position:0%
federal government so I will be
 
05:54:13.708 --> 05:54:13.718 align:start position:0%
supporting this thank you thank you for
 
05:54:16.150 --> 05:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
speaking to you motion representative uh
 
05:54:18.468 --> 05:54:18.478 align:start position:0%
second or was representative Manion do
 
05:54:21.430 --> 05:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
you want to add yeah everything he said
 
05:54:22.708 --> 05:54:22.718 align:start position:0%
was brilliant uh the one thing I was
 
05:54:24.510 --> 05:54:24.520 align:start position:0%
like like during that uh testimony we
 
05:54:25.430 --> 05:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
were talking about how all the
 
05:54:27.230 --> 05:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
downstream smaller corporations are now
 
05:54:29.190 --> 05:54:29.200 align:start position:0%
going to be afflicted with this uh
 
05:54:31.110 --> 05:54:31.120 align:start position:0%
burdensome regulations coming across the
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
seas and it could uh filter down they
 
05:54:33.750 --> 05:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
were talking about I think it was
 
05:54:35.270 --> 05:54:35.280 align:start position:0%
automotives we were saying like every
 
05:54:37.110 --> 05:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
little knob in your vehicle if it's part
 
05:54:38.788 --> 05:54:38.798 align:start position:0%
of the manufacturing process that goes
 
05:54:40.910 --> 05:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
up to a company that trades in Europe is
 
05:54:42.310 --> 05:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
going to have to be compliant with these
 
05:54:43.830 --> 05:54:43.840 align:start position:0%
all the way down there's no way this
 
05:54:45.468 --> 05:54:45.478 align:start position:0%
isn't going to raise costs like
 
05:54:48.270 --> 05:54:48.280 align:start position:0%
exponentially worse than it is now and
 
05:54:50.310 --> 05:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
like I can't stand for
 
05:54:54.670 --> 05:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
it thank you other other thoughts
 
05:54:54.680 --> 05:54:56.468 align:start position:0%
it thank you other other thoughts
represent

05:54:56.468 --> 05:54:56.478 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:54:59.990 --> 05:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
Ross Yes um well I'm sure that all of my
 
05:55:04.190 --> 05:55:04.200 align:start position:0%
colleagues read the uh CS DDD uh but
 
05:55:06.030 --> 05:55:06.040 align:start position:0%
just for the folks at home I think that
 
05:55:09.510 --> 05:55:09.520 align:start position:0%
they has been a characterization that if
 
05:55:12.788 --> 05:55:12.798 align:start position:0%
you did not actually read the
 
05:55:18.070 --> 05:55:18.080 align:start position:0%
EU uh regulation uh it might be a little
 
05:55:20.788 --> 05:55:20.798 align:start position:0%
um not intentionally but misleading uh
 
05:55:23.350 --> 05:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
the due diligence aspect the requirement
 
05:55:26.270 --> 05:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
is that corporations not all of the
 
05:55:28.110 --> 05:55:28.120 align:start position:0%
American people but corporations who
 
05:55:32.190 --> 05:55:32.200 align:start position:0%
wish of their own valtion to do business
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
above a certain threshold in Europe use
 
05:55:40.548 --> 05:55:40.558 align:start position:0%
due dilig to assess risk of Human Rights
 
05:55:44.430 --> 05:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
abuses and negative climate impact this
 
05:55:47.910 --> 05:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
is related to standards if you read the
 
05:55:49.788 --> 05:55:49.798 align:start position:0%
the law and you look at the annex these
 
05:55:52.030 --> 05:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
are related to standards especially the
 
05:55:55.910 --> 05:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
human rights uh related aspects that
 
05:55:57.670 --> 05:55:57.680 align:start position:0%
were passed by the United Nations I know
 
05:55:59.830 --> 05:55:59.840 align:start position:0%
that representative Bernardi uh alluded
 
05:56:02.390 --> 05:56:02.400 align:start position:0%
to things passed by the United Nations
 
05:56:06.548 --> 05:56:06.558 align:start position:0%
as being uh more democratic than just
 
05:56:08.788 --> 05:56:08.798 align:start position:0%
the EU and and these regulations are
 
05:56:11.230 --> 05:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
based on what was passed by the United
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
Nations uh but getting back to do
 
05:56:16.590 --> 05:56:16.600 align:start position:0%
diligence at risk
 
05:56:21.310 --> 05:56:21.320 align:start position:0%
analysis uh it's not a mandate that you
 
05:56:25.310 --> 05:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
absolutely have to shut down if your uh
 
05:56:28.948 --> 05:56:28.958 align:start position:0%
one of your suppliers is using slave
 
05:56:31.548 --> 05:56:31.558 align:start position:0%
labor which is one of the the aspects
 
05:56:33.110 --> 05:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
that is that that people are supposed to
 
05:56:36.230 --> 05:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
watch for they're supposed to assess the
 
05:56:39.628 --> 05:56:39.638 align:start position:0%
a risk of one of their suppliers using
 
05:56:42.430 --> 05:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
slave labor and if it
 
05:56:49.030 --> 05:56:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:51.510 --> 05:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
overburdensome then they're allowed to
 
05:56:56.468 --> 05:56:56.478 align:start position:0%
make a a executive decision so it it's
 
05:56:59.468 --> 05:56:59.478 align:start position:0%
not quite as Draconian as I think that
 
05:57:02.510 --> 05:57:02.520 align:start position:0%
someone who actually hasn't read the law
 
05:57:06.750 --> 05:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
might might think from the um maybe just
 
05:57:09.948 --> 05:57:09.958 align:start position:0%
the way that we are are discussing it in
 
05:57:14.350 --> 05:57:14.360 align:start position:0%
addition if your supplier does violate
 
05:57:17.548 --> 05:57:17.558 align:start position:0%
any of these uh you as a company any of
 
05:57:21.350 --> 05:57:21.360 align:start position:0%
these regulations then uh the larger
 
05:57:23.708 --> 05:57:23.718 align:start position:0%
company that uses the supplier can't be
 
05:57:27.788 --> 05:57:27.798 align:start position:0%
held uh held respon reliable for that so
 
05:57:30.708 --> 05:57:30.718 align:start position:0%
that's just um some pieces on the the
 
05:57:32.990 --> 05:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
ideological aspect but what I think it's
 
05:57:35.628 --> 05:57:35.638 align:start position:0%
important to look at this absent the
 
05:57:39.468 --> 05:57:39.478 align:start position:0%
ideolog iCal aspect and the precedent
 
05:57:42.910 --> 05:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
that it sets because at its heart the
 
05:57:46.310 --> 05:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
ability of a body to regulate who does
 
05:57:49.190 --> 05:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
commerce within their
 
05:57:53.030 --> 05:57:53.040 align:start position:0%
borders I I am shocked that my
 
05:57:54.430 --> 05:57:54.440 align:start position:0%
colleagues on the other side of the
 
05:57:56.190 --> 05:57:56.200 align:start position:0%
aisle would want to put the government
 
05:57:59.468 --> 05:57:59.478 align:start position:0%
in the Affairs of a foreign State and
 
05:58:02.628 --> 05:58:02.638 align:start position:0%
private businesses private businesses
 
05:58:06.670 --> 05:58:06.680 align:start position:0%
have the ability to choose not to sell
 
05:58:09.628 --> 05:58:09.638 align:start position:0%
in the EU above a thir certain threshold
 
05:58:12.430 --> 05:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
where's the the place of the government
 
05:58:18.110 --> 05:58:18.120 align:start position:0%
to say no this is a private relationship
 
05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
that the American government should not
 
05:58:23.830 --> 05:58:23.840 align:start position:0%
be getting involved in uh furthermore if
 
05:58:26.708 --> 05:58:26.718 align:start position:0%
there was any enforcement mechanisms I
 
05:58:29.548 --> 05:58:29.558 align:start position:0%
believe tariffs were involved that would
 
05:58:31.310 --> 05:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
potentially get us into a trade war and
 
05:58:33.750 --> 05:58:33.760 align:start position:0%
tariffs would certainly raise prices for
 
05:58:38.628 --> 05:58:38.638 align:start position:0%
the American Consumer and just finally
 
05:58:42.510 --> 05:58:42.520 align:start position:0%
the hypocrisy of us saying no you are
 
05:58:46.430 --> 05:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
not allowed to make not even allowed we
 
05:58:47.910 --> 05:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
can't tell them that they're not allowed
 
05:58:49.430 --> 05:58:49.440 align:start position:0%
this already passed and we don't have
 
05:58:53.948 --> 05:58:53.958 align:start position:0%
any ability to unpass it on behalf of
 
05:58:56.948 --> 05:58:56.958 align:start position:0%
the European Union we don't have any
 
05:58:59.310 --> 05:58:59.320 align:start position:0%
control over what law uh laws or
 
05:59:02.468 --> 05:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
regulations they pass for themselves but
 
05:59:06.788 --> 05:59:06.798 align:start position:0%
let's say the uh us was was going
 
05:59:12.468 --> 05:59:12.478 align:start position:0%
to reject compliance and I suppose
 
05:59:16.548 --> 05:59:16.558 align:start position:0%
enforce tariffs as a
 
05:59:20.350 --> 05:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
retaliation for a law that Europe passed
 
05:59:24.990 --> 05:59:25.000 align:start position:0%
about what's allowed to go on within its
 
05:59:28.670 --> 05:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
borders that is substantively or
 
05:59:31.230 --> 05:59:31.240 align:start position:0%
procedurally absolutely no different
 
05:59:33.030 --> 05:59:33.040 align:start position:0%
than what the United States just did
 
05:59:37.628 --> 05:59:37.638 align:start position:0%
with Tik Tock we said we don't want the
 
05:59:39.628 --> 05:59:39.638 align:start position:0%
we believe that there is a compelling
 
05:59:41.708 --> 05:59:41.718 align:start position:0%
interest a national security interest
 
05:59:45.030 --> 05:59:45.040 align:start position:0%
which there was not any proof of that
 
05:59:46.910 --> 05:59:46.920 align:start position:0%
but people the lawmakers felt that there
 
05:59:50.510 --> 05:59:50.520 align:start position:0%
was a compelling interest in uh making
 
05:59:53.190 --> 05:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
sure that you do not have access to US
 
05:59:57.990 --> 05:59:58.000 align:start position:0%
citizens data he said you are
 
06:00:02.590 --> 06:00:02.600 align:start position:0%
fully Tik Tok is allowed to operate in
 
06:00:05.990 --> 06:00:06.000 align:start position:0%
this country if you divest and sell to
 
06:00:08.750 --> 06:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
American company bite Dan said bite
 
06:00:12.110 --> 06:00:12.120 align:start position:0%
dance continues to say no we are not
 
06:00:14.190 --> 06:00:14.200 align:start position:0%
going to do that as they have the a
 
06:00:17.708 --> 06:00:17.718 align:start position:0%
right to the law was passed by Congress
 
06:00:20.190 --> 06:00:20.200 align:start position:0%
it was upheld as constitutional by the
 
06:00:23.310 --> 06:00:23.320 align:start position:0%
United States Supreme Court and as
 
06:00:25.230 --> 06:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
chairman Moffet said earlier it's a good
 
06:00:27.510 --> 06:00:27.520 align:start position:0%
thing to have the Supreme Court on your
 
06:00:31.910 --> 06:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
side so the Supreme Court essentially
 
06:00:36.070 --> 06:00:36.080 align:start position:0%
has uh endorsed the idea that a body has
 
06:00:38.468 --> 06:00:38.478 align:start position:0%
ability to set their own regulations on
 
06:00:41.830 --> 06:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
who does trade within their borders so
 
06:00:44.350 --> 06:00:44.360 align:start position:0%
the idea that just because of an
 
06:00:48.110 --> 06:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
ideological difference we can use our
 
06:00:51.150 --> 06:00:51.160 align:start position:0%
power to politically influence another
 
06:00:55.190 --> 06:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
state is horrifying honestly who are we
 
06:01:00.310 --> 06:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
to say that you are our politics are
 
06:01:03.030 --> 06:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
worthy to be inflicted on another state
 
06:01:05.948 --> 06:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
what's to prevent anyone from doing that
 
06:01:10.390 --> 06:01:10.400 align:start position:0%
to us the the political
 
06:01:15.070 --> 06:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
coercion is just staggering If This Were
 
06:01:17.548 --> 06:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
if the government were to actually try
 
06:01:21.230 --> 06:01:21.240 align:start position:0%
and penalize the European Union for
 
06:01:23.788 --> 06:01:23.798 align:start position:0%
passing their own
 
06:01:27.910 --> 06:01:27.920 align:start position:0%
laws so I wholeheartedly hope that my
 
06:01:36.468 --> 06:01:36.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:39.708 --> 06:01:39.718 align:start position:0%
Ju Just a comment uh both representative
 
06:01:41.868 --> 06:01:41.878 align:start position:0%
Belzer and representative F I thought
 
06:01:44.670 --> 06:01:44.680 align:start position:0%
were wonderfully articulate and I just
 
06:01:46.708 --> 06:01:46.718 align:start position:0%
want to say that when represent
 
06:01:48.830 --> 06:01:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
 
06:01:48.840 --> 06:01:50.468 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi
introduced

06:01:50.468 --> 06:01:50.478 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
06:01:54.350 --> 06:01:54.360 align:start position:0%
hcr9 uh I thought that the questions
 
06:01:56.750 --> 06:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
that were directed at him and his
 
06:01:58.868 --> 06:01:58.878 align:start position:0%
answers were very
 
06:02:01.150 --> 06:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
interesting fact I went home that night
 
06:02:03.548 --> 06:02:03.558 align:start position:0%
believe it or not and I watched it on
 
06:02:05.910 --> 06:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
YouTube again because I thought it was
 
06:02:08.310 --> 06:02:08.320 align:start position:0%
such a good back and forth that's just a
 
06:02:11.628 --> 06:02:11.638 align:start position:0%
comment um other positions thoughts
 
06:02:11.638 --> 06:02:13.270 align:start position:0%
comment um other positions thoughts
questions

06:02:13.270 --> 06:02:13.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
06:02:16.990 --> 06:02:17.000 align:start position:0%
on hcr9 representative
 
06:02:21.910 --> 06:02:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:23.830 --> 06:02:23.840 align:start position:0%
so excuse
 
06:02:32.270 --> 06:02:32.280 align:start position:0%
me so the the CD or the CSD DD is
 
06:02:36.070 --> 06:02:36.080 align:start position:0%
started out basically as you got to
 
06:02:39.548 --> 06:02:39.558 align:start position:0%
comply with certain standards of
 
06:02:42.510 --> 06:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
environment social economics and and
 
06:02:44.030 --> 06:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
governance and how you run your your
 
06:02:47.310 --> 06:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
businesses ESG is the same thing and
 
06:02:50.270 --> 06:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
it's right there in the CD or
 
06:02:54.070 --> 06:02:54.080 align:start position:0%
csdd that ESG is part of
 
06:02:57.750 --> 06:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
it CSG is active in up and running not
 
06:03:01.150 --> 06:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
only will that happen it is happening
 
06:03:04.390 --> 06:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
and and and businesses within the United
 
06:03:08.230 --> 06:03:08.240 align:start position:0%
States are being evaluated and ranked
 
06:03:13.190 --> 06:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:16.150 --> 06:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
csdd any smaller as as I said as it
 
06:03:18.310 --> 06:03:18.320 align:start position:0%
progresses down to 28 you're going to
 
06:03:21.510 --> 06:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
look at $50 million and 50 million euros
 
06:03:23.270 --> 06:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
and X number of employees are going to
 
06:03:27.270 --> 06:03:27.280 align:start position:0%
follow into this this standard so any
 
06:03:32.030 --> 06:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
small organization or company that has a
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
cash flow problem of being able to put
 
06:03:37.948 --> 06:03:37.958 align:start position:0%
in a solar field uh uh wind turbines and
 
06:03:42.948 --> 06:03:42.958 align:start position:0%
everything to bring down their um green
 
06:03:46.548 --> 06:03:46.558 align:start position:0%
uh uh their carbon use uh will not be
 
06:03:48.468 --> 06:03:48.478 align:start position:0%
able to participate in
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
this and when they ship that off to the
 
06:03:53.390 --> 06:03:53.400 align:start position:0%
next higher level and they're doing
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
business with the
 
06:03:57.310 --> 06:03:57.320 align:start position:0%
EU that company will have to take the
 
06:04:00.548 --> 06:04:00.558 align:start position:0%
risk and will get docked those points
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
and lower their rating to be able to do
 
06:04:06.070 --> 06:04:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh trade within the EU and this is going
 
06:04:09.150 --> 06:04:09.160 align:start position:0%
to happen across the world as I said uh
 
06:04:12.190 --> 06:04:12.200 align:start position:0%
right now in the in Asia they're already
 
06:04:16.788 --> 06:04:16.798 align:start position:0%
using ESG on on the public so if you are
 
06:04:19.510 --> 06:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
not doing environmental social and
 
06:04:19.520 --> 06:04:20.670 align:start position:0%
not doing environmental social and
governance

06:04:20.670 --> 06:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
governance
 
06:04:24.030 --> 06:04:24.040 align:start position:0%
within your your household you can't get
 
06:04:27.070 --> 06:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
a you can't get a loan at a bank uh they
 
06:04:29.830 --> 06:04:29.840 align:start position:0%
look at that they look at your your all
 
06:04:32.510 --> 06:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
your posts your you know what you're
 
06:04:35.110 --> 06:04:35.120 align:start position:0%
doing how you're living and making sure
 
06:04:36.948 --> 06:04:36.958 align:start position:0%
that you're it in a proper it's going to
 
06:04:39.030 --> 06:04:39.040 align:start position:0%
come down to more than just the
 
06:04:41.430 --> 06:04:41.440 align:start position:0%
companies so I think we need to make a
 
06:04:43.110 --> 06:04:43.120 align:start position:0%
stand and
 
06:04:45.150 --> 06:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
say we don't
 
06:04:47.670 --> 06:04:47.680 align:start position:0%
want to deal with this because we've
 
06:04:49.670 --> 06:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
already we already get rid of the new
 
06:04:51.868 --> 06:04:51.878 align:start position:0%
green deal we got rid of
 
06:04:55.788 --> 06:04:55.798 align:start position:0%
Dei and if you look at the csdd it's the
 
06:04:57.030 --> 06:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
same thing that's in there they had the
 
06:04:58.750 --> 06:04:58.760 align:start position:0%
green deal it's not the green new green
 
06:05:00.390 --> 06:05:00.400 align:start position:0%
deal but it's a green deal and that's
 
06:05:02.270 --> 06:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
basically what it is it's saying that
 
06:05:06.150 --> 06:05:06.160 align:start position:0%
you have to do this to be able to work
 
06:05:09.390 --> 06:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
or or produce something and trade in in
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
Europe we got rid of it in new in the in
 
06:05:15.510 --> 06:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
the United States and I I don't think
 
06:05:16.868 --> 06:05:16.878 align:start position:0%
that we should put our companies through
 
06:05:20.110 --> 06:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
that if they want to put that out
 
06:05:23.270 --> 06:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
there thank you very much represent
 
06:05:26.628 --> 06:05:26.638 align:start position:0%

um beler who made the motion would that
 
06:05:45.390 --> 06:05:45.400 align:start position:0%

06:05:53.468 --> 06:05:53.478 align:start position:0%
represent uh beler will you take a
 
06:05:55.628 --> 06:05:55.638 align:start position:0%
question from representative mandle bomb

thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
06:05:59.270 --> 06:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative beler so I believe that
 
06:06:01.468 --> 06:06:01.478 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
06:06:06.030 --> 06:06:06.040 align:start position:0%
that what this bill is asking is not
 
06:06:08.070 --> 06:06:08.080 align:start position:0%
allowed in the New Hampshire
 
06:06:09.948 --> 06:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
Constitution I heard something about the
 
06:06:11.310 --> 06:06:11.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution and just
 
06:06:15.190 --> 06:06:15.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify I yes I'd be happy to
 
06:06:17.548 --> 06:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
okay so um the New Hampshire
 
06:06:19.708 --> 06:06:19.718 align:start position:0%
Constitution was amended I think it was
 
06:06:21.310 --> 06:06:21.320 align:start position:0%
roughly 1950 but you have to look that
 
06:06:24.868 --> 06:06:24.878 align:start position:0%
up uh to add under article 83 a section
 
06:06:26.350 --> 06:06:26.360 align:start position:0%
in our constitution against
 
06:06:28.270 --> 06:06:28.280 align:start position:0%
anti-competitive Behavior against
 
06:06:31.948 --> 06:06:31.958 align:start position:0%
monopoly laws uh so what happens is when
 
06:06:34.788 --> 06:06:34.798 align:start position:0%
companies the example I was giving when
 
06:06:37.430 --> 06:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
companies go come together and they
 
06:06:39.990 --> 06:06:40.000 align:start position:0%
decide to manipulate the market in a way
 
06:06:42.670 --> 06:06:42.680 align:start position:0%
that limits choice in the market
 
06:06:46.350 --> 06:06:46.360 align:start position:0%
or creates in this instance a set of uh
 
06:06:50.548 --> 06:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
social uh activist conditions that all
 
06:06:54.948 --> 06:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
players in the market are agreeing to do
 
06:06:57.190 --> 06:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
simultaneously it's it's a manipulation
 
06:06:59.468 --> 06:06:59.478 align:start position:0%
of the free market that's not allowable
 
06:07:01.390 --> 06:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
under the Constitution it's also uh
 
06:07:03.510 --> 06:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
against federal law and the whole
 
06:07:06.030 --> 06:07:06.040 align:start position:0%
Monopoly busting uh
 
06:07:09.150 --> 06:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
stuff that happened in the early 20th
 
06:07:14.670 --> 06:07:14.680 align:start position:0%
century um it was a point to make that
 
06:07:16.190 --> 06:07:16.200 align:start position:0%
these these companies would be in
 
06:07:18.270 --> 06:07:18.280 align:start position:0%
violation of if they were doing this on
 
06:07:20.590 --> 06:07:20.600 align:start position:0%
their own it would be
 
06:07:22.590 --> 06:07:22.600 align:start position:0%
criminal but because they're actually
 
06:07:24.750 --> 06:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
being manipulated by a government into
 
06:07:26.390 --> 06:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
doing this it's actually worse than that
 
06:07:28.110 --> 06:07:28.120 align:start position:0%
so that was the point I was making and
 
06:07:29.830 --> 06:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
followup does
 
06:07:32.750 --> 06:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
that when we talk about being
 
06:07:35.070 --> 06:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
manipulated by government is does that
 
06:07:38.708 --> 06:07:38.718 align:start position:0%
refer ref to governments outside of the
 
06:07:40.030 --> 06:07:40.040 align:start position:0%
us as
 
06:07:42.590 --> 06:07:42.600 align:start position:0%
well yes that that was the exact point
 
06:07:46.270 --> 06:07:46.280 align:start position:0%
the EU in this in making this uh law is
 
06:07:48.468 --> 06:07:48.478 align:start position:0%
saying that any government operate or
 
06:07:50.110 --> 06:07:50.120 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry any Corporation over a certain
 
06:07:52.350 --> 06:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
measure even American corporation that
 
06:07:55.110 --> 06:07:55.120 align:start position:0%
operates in Europe has to implement
 
06:07:56.670 --> 06:07:56.680 align:start position:0%
these uh
 
06:07:58.510 --> 06:07:58.520 align:start position:0%
procedures but they don't just have to
 
06:07:59.708 --> 06:07:59.718 align:start position:0%
implement them in Europe they have to
 
06:08:01.468 --> 06:08:01.478 align:start position:0%
implement them companywide including
 
06:08:03.430 --> 06:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
implementing them on Americans in
 
06:08:05.548 --> 06:08:05.558 align:start position:0%
America even though it's an it's
 
06:08:08.150 --> 06:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
American company thank you
 
06:08:11.708 --> 06:08:11.718 align:start position:0%
yes represent cyber I was just going to
 
06:08:13.670 --> 06:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
say like you know first of all we're
 
06:08:15.830 --> 06:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
making very good points about you know
 
06:08:18.990 --> 06:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
this being not the US who is doing this
 
06:08:21.070 --> 06:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
I mean that's the big point and our
 
06:08:23.310 --> 06:08:23.320 align:start position:0%
companies here can choose to opt out we
 
06:08:26.830 --> 06:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
really don't have a say in what the EU
 
06:08:28.788 --> 06:08:28.798 align:start position:0%
wants to do they're in a also in a
 
06:08:31.350 --> 06:08:31.360 align:start position:0%
totally different situation you know
 
06:08:33.990 --> 06:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
it's totally understandable that they
 
06:08:36.390 --> 06:08:36.400 align:start position:0%
have a mindset that they're like a lot
 
06:08:38.070 --> 06:08:38.080 align:start position:0%
of different countries but they're all
 
06:08:40.590 --> 06:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
tied together so what one does can
 
06:08:42.350 --> 06:08:42.360 align:start position:0%
directly affect the other and actually
 
06:08:44.910 --> 06:08:44.920 align:start position:0%
does a lot of the time so it's a way of
 
06:08:47.190 --> 06:08:47.200 align:start position:0%
them keeping themselves in check and
 
06:08:49.750 --> 06:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
it's a policy they want to
 
06:08:53.708 --> 06:08:53.718 align:start position:0%
implement and so you know opt out of it
 
06:08:55.628 --> 06:08:55.638 align:start position:0%
if you don't like it I mean it's as
 
06:08:58.390 --> 06:08:58.400 align:start position:0%
simple as that and quite honestly if
 
06:09:00.468 --> 06:09:00.478 align:start position:0%
it's better and we have cleaner air I
 
06:09:02.670 --> 06:09:02.680 align:start position:0%
mean we're the biggest tourist State and
 
06:09:04.270 --> 06:09:04.280 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest ones in the nation
 
06:09:06.468 --> 06:09:06.478 align:start position:0%
like why would we not want to start
 
06:09:11.110 --> 06:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:13.868 --> 06:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
things representative
 
06:09:17.628 --> 06:09:17.638 align:start position:0%
Foss well I just want to again emphasize
 
06:09:19.670 --> 06:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
that this is not first of all it's not a
 
06:09:22.230 --> 06:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
mandate because companies are fully able
 
06:09:24.310 --> 06:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
to choose not to do business in the EU
 
06:09:28.468 --> 06:09:28.478 align:start position:0%
but it's also requiring them to do due
 
06:09:30.830 --> 06:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
diligence to make sure that they are not
 
06:09:32.830 --> 06:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
committing human rights
 
06:09:36.628 --> 06:09:36.638 align:start position:0%
abuses and if they find that potentially
 
06:09:38.430 --> 06:09:38.440 align:start position:0%
there is a conflict of interest there to
 
06:09:40.510 --> 06:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
do risk
 
06:09:44.548 --> 06:09:44.558 align:start position:0%
assessment but it's they have the choice
 
06:09:47.548 --> 06:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
if anything inserting the government in
 
06:09:50.110 --> 06:09:50.120 align:start position:0%
there is a form of government overreach
 
06:09:52.468 --> 06:09:52.478 align:start position:0%
but also we we're talking on an
 
06:09:54.590 --> 06:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
ideological level as though we have the
 
06:09:57.110 --> 06:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
ability to repeal a regulation that the
 
06:10:00.628 --> 06:10:00.638 align:start position:0%
European Union has already passed we
 
06:10:03.030 --> 06:10:03.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to go and say
 
06:10:06.310 --> 06:10:06.320 align:start position:0%
that they are not able to enact these
 
06:10:08.548 --> 06:10:08.558 align:start position:0%
especially when as I said we have just
 
06:10:11.390 --> 06:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
done something very similar with Tik Tok
 
06:10:14.468 --> 06:10:14.478 align:start position:0%
and I think there's a misconception that
 
06:10:18.230 --> 06:10:18.240 align:start position:0%
uh there has been some sort of extension
 
06:10:20.750 --> 06:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
when the executive branch can't
 
06:10:22.750 --> 06:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
unilaterally overrule a law that was
 
06:10:24.788 --> 06:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
passed by the Legislative and upheld by
 
06:10:26.110 --> 06:10:26.120 align:start position:0%
the judicial
 
06:10:28.910 --> 06:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
branch but we have just done exactly the
 
06:10:31.628 --> 06:10:31.638 align:start position:0%
same thing and I I know in our other in
 
06:10:34.070 --> 06:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
hearing we've discussed and I anticipate
 
06:10:37.310 --> 06:10:37.320 align:start position:0%
that it will come up in 104 uh forever
 
06:10:40.468 --> 06:10:40.478 align:start position:0%
Wars and the problems that happen when
 
06:10:44.110 --> 06:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
the United States goes and it interferes
 
06:10:47.150 --> 06:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
with uh the government or the political
 
06:10:52.030 --> 06:10:52.040 align:start position:0%
system of another state so how if we are
 
06:10:55.310 --> 06:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
imposing our political ideology on the
 
06:10:55.320 --> 06:10:56.670 align:start position:0%
imposing our political ideology on the
European

06:10:56.670 --> 06:10:56.680 align:start position:0%
European
 
06:11:00.788 --> 06:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
Union then that's the same as Iran in
 
06:11:05.910 --> 06:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
the 70s or Afghanistan or Iraq
 
06:11:08.510 --> 06:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
the principle is the same so if you
 
06:11:11.670 --> 06:11:11.680 align:start position:0%
divorce it from any ideological points
 
06:11:14.628 --> 06:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
that you do or do not agree with the
 
06:11:21.910 --> 06:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:25.708 --> 06:11:25.718 align:start position:0%
stand uh hold that for just a moment if
 
06:11:28.030 --> 06:11:28.040 align:start position:0%
you would repres Manion represent you
 
06:11:31.628 --> 06:11:31.638 align:start position:0%
just uh use the Expression imposing
 
06:11:34.590 --> 06:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
ideology and I'm not sure if I see us
 
06:11:37.270 --> 06:11:37.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily as is imposing ideology I
 
06:11:39.868 --> 06:11:39.878 align:start position:0%
see us as maybe trying to
 
06:11:39.878 --> 06:11:41.830 align:start position:0%
see us as maybe trying to
influence

06:11:41.830 --> 06:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
influence
 
06:11:45.548 --> 06:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
Commerce um but I don't know that we're
 
06:11:47.708 --> 06:11:47.718 align:start position:0%
NE necessarily trying to impose ideology
 
06:11:49.948 --> 06:11:49.958 align:start position:0%
I think we'd maybe like to see some EU
 
06:11:51.788 --> 06:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
countries have different
 
06:11:54.030 --> 06:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
systems but I think there's a long
 
06:11:58.788 --> 06:11:58.798 align:start position:0%
history of Nations and countries and
 
06:12:02.510 --> 06:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
organizations trying to influence
 
06:12:05.510 --> 06:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
commercial situations to their advantage
 
06:12:07.110 --> 06:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
that do you do you really think that
 
06:12:09.070 --> 06:12:09.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to impose ideology here
 
06:12:10.628 --> 06:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
well I think that the discussion that
 
06:12:12.750 --> 06:12:12.760 align:start position:0%
we've been having since it comes from
 
06:12:15.788 --> 06:12:15.798 align:start position:0%
such an ideological lens um you know the
 
06:12:19.628 --> 06:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
terms Dei has been thrown around and uh
 
06:12:22.788 --> 06:12:22.798 align:start position:0%
you know for reference uh hiring
 
06:12:24.628 --> 06:12:24.638 align:start position:0%
preferences for veterans military
 
06:12:26.910 --> 06:12:26.920 align:start position:0%
spouses and active duty service members
 
06:12:30.750 --> 06:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
is a Dei effort so I suppose we're all
 
06:12:34.628 --> 06:12:34.638 align:start position:0%
not in compliance but it's the way we're
 
06:12:37.830 --> 06:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
discussing it from whether or not these
 
06:12:41.910 --> 06:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
are right or these are wrong it is an
 
06:12:44.830 --> 06:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
ideological imposition because that is
 
06:12:49.150 --> 06:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
seems to be the basis upon which we are
 
06:12:53.868 --> 06:12:53.878 align:start position:0%
uh the uh folks who are arguing for this
 
06:12:57.270 --> 06:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
OTP are are saying that it should pass
 
06:13:01.990 --> 06:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
because the majority of Americans uh are
 
06:13:06.708 --> 06:13:06.718 align:start position:0%
inferred to have rejected this so we are
 
06:13:09.868 --> 06:13:09.878 align:start position:0%
uh if it's being rejected on ideological
 
06:13:13.030 --> 06:13:13.040 align:start position:0%
grounds because as as I said and as I
 
06:13:15.708 --> 06:13:15.718 align:start position:0%
believe the European Union right has the
 
06:13:15.718 --> 06:13:16.788 align:start position:0%
believe the European Union right has the
right

06:13:16.788 --> 06:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:13:19.750 --> 06:13:19.760 align:start position:0%
to make their own regulations around who
 
06:13:21.948 --> 06:13:21.958 align:start position:0%
is allowed to do business within their
 
06:13:26.430 --> 06:13:26.440 align:start position:0%
borders furthermore the uh it's not a
 
06:13:29.548 --> 06:13:29.558 align:start position:0%
mom and pop shop doing business in the
 
06:13:32.948 --> 06:13:32.958 align:start position:0%
EU who is going to be so financially
 
06:13:35.548 --> 06:13:35.558 align:start position:0%
burdened by these regulations
 
06:13:37.868 --> 06:13:37.878 align:start position:0%
everything is owned by Nestle and
 
06:13:41.350 --> 06:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
Unilever and Johnson and Johnson so it's
 
06:13:43.990 --> 06:13:44.000 align:start position:0%
not as though you know this small
 
06:13:48.310 --> 06:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
struggling company is going to be uh
 
06:13:51.070 --> 06:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
effectively shut down completely shut
 
06:13:54.150 --> 06:13:54.160 align:start position:0%
out of business in the European Union
 
06:13:56.390 --> 06:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
but it just the the discussion that
 
06:13:59.350 --> 06:13:59.360 align:start position:0%
we've been having does make it seem like
 
06:14:01.948 --> 06:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
it's being uh argued against from an
 
06:14:04.390 --> 06:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
ideological standpoint so I do see it as
 
06:14:07.030 --> 06:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
imposing an ideology on the people of a
 
06:14:07.040 --> 06:14:08.070 align:start position:0%
imposing an ideology on the people of a
foreign

06:14:08.070 --> 06:14:08.080 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
06:14:10.310 --> 06:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
State thank you for that representative
 
06:14:12.430 --> 06:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
Manion I just want to say that
 
06:14:13.948 --> 06:14:13.958 align:start position:0%
everything that we did in the 21st
 
06:14:15.310 --> 06:14:15.320 align:start position:0%
century as far as conflicts was
 
06:14:17.070 --> 06:14:17.080 align:start position:0%
absolutely abhorent so I don't support
 
06:14:18.468 --> 06:14:18.478 align:start position:0%
that whatsoever so I don't think that
 
06:14:20.468 --> 06:14:20.478 align:start position:0%
the the comparison is fair because I I I
 
06:14:22.230 --> 06:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say that uh because we did
 
06:14:24.430 --> 06:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
these awful things it's okay for the EU
 
06:14:26.910 --> 06:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
to do this to us uh I also want to kind
 
06:14:28.948 --> 06:14:28.958 align:start position:0%
of speak from a pers uh perspective of
 
06:14:30.628 --> 06:14:30.638 align:start position:0%
somebody who's really uh Upstream of
 
06:14:32.430 --> 06:14:32.440 align:start position:0%
like a manufacturers so I work in
 
06:14:33.708 --> 06:14:33.718 align:start position:0%
automotive cameras like we build
 
06:14:35.708 --> 06:14:35.718 align:start position:0%
Automotive cameras but we make the
 
06:14:37.350 --> 06:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
machines that build the cameras that go
 
06:14:40.270 --> 06:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
to the auto manufacturers so for example
 
06:14:42.590 --> 06:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
if we were sell uh Ford were to sell C
 
06:14:45.670 --> 06:14:45.680 align:start position:0%
these cars uh in the European Union we
 
06:14:47.390 --> 06:14:47.400 align:start position:0%
are Upstream from that so my business
 
06:14:49.430 --> 06:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
would be directly affected uh we're not
 
06:14:50.990 --> 06:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
a mama pop shop but we definitely
 
06:14:53.150 --> 06:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
started with like 20 people and we would
 
06:14:55.310 --> 06:14:55.320 align:start position:0%
be subject to these EU regulations
 
06:14:58.150 --> 06:14:58.160 align:start position:0%
because we are Upstream from
 
06:15:01.030 --> 06:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you for personalizing that
 
06:15:01.040 --> 06:15:03.190 align:start position:0%
Ford thank you for personalizing that
that

06:15:03.190 --> 06:15:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:15:07.390 --> 06:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
wayos play any other hands okay uh R
 
06:15:10.548 --> 06:15:10.558 align:start position:0%
rips and F go ahead but when you look at
 
06:15:14.670 --> 06:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
the law to respond to that it um has
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
recourse for these small suppliers
 
06:15:21.868 --> 06:15:21.878 align:start position:0%
they're very large um folks to whom they
 
06:15:24.430 --> 06:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
provide these can help them as part of
 
06:15:26.948 --> 06:15:26.958 align:start position:0%
their due diligence and risk assessment
 
06:15:30.868 --> 06:15:30.878 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't leave people out to dry
 
06:15:33.030 --> 06:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
but again I I really can't emphasize
 
06:15:36.310 --> 06:15:36.320 align:start position:0%
enough that this is at asking large
 
06:15:43.150 --> 06:15:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:46.590 --> 06:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
assessment rep Manion first and then uh
 
06:15:48.628 --> 06:15:48.638 align:start position:0%
Representative mandal Bob just I mean I
 
06:15:49.948 --> 06:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
know this is anecdotal from my
 
06:15:51.270 --> 06:15:51.280 align:start position:0%
experience but I know that for example
 
06:15:52.670 --> 06:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
in a competitive market where we're a
 
06:15:55.430 --> 06:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
small supplier if we are now uh if if
 
06:15:57.830 --> 06:15:57.840 align:start position:0%
our buyers our customers like which are
 
06:15:59.948 --> 06:15:59.958 align:start position:0%
like the companies that sell to Ford now
 
06:16:01.350 --> 06:16:01.360 align:start position:0%
look at us and say oh well they're not
 
06:16:03.150 --> 06:16:03.160 align:start position:0%
EU compliant but this other business
 
06:16:05.230 --> 06:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
over here is EU compliant we will just
 
06:16:07.190 --> 06:16:07.200 align:start position:0%
lose business based off this mandate
 
06:16:07.200 --> 06:16:08.070 align:start position:0%
lose business based off this mandate
from

06:16:08.070 --> 06:16:08.080 align:start position:0%
from
 
06:16:11.110 --> 06:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
Europe representative Mandel bom thank
 
06:16:12.548 --> 06:16:12.558 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman
 
06:16:15.708 --> 06:16:15.718 align:start position:0%
so this question I think is coming about
 
06:16:16.990 --> 06:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
a little bit because I did not
 
06:16:21.230 --> 06:16:21.240 align:start position:0%
thoroughly read through the um
 
06:16:25.390 --> 06:16:25.400 align:start position:0%
csdd um but I'm wondering when it the
 
06:16:28.510 --> 06:16:28.520 align:start position:0%
term due diligence seems really broad to
 
06:16:32.230 --> 06:16:32.240 align:start position:0%
me and I'm wondering if representative
 
06:16:34.948 --> 06:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
fost or or any of of the rest to be on
 
06:16:37.750 --> 06:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
this committee have a kind of a more
 
06:16:39.830 --> 06:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
tangible understanding of what that
 
06:16:43.310 --> 06:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
means because how you know my business
 
06:16:45.030 --> 06:16:45.040 align:start position:0%
might Define that might not be how
 
06:16:47.190 --> 06:16:47.200 align:start position:0%
representative manion's business defines
 
06:16:50.110 --> 06:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
that um you know or I don't even know
 
06:16:52.990 --> 06:16:53.000 align:start position:0%
how the the EU is
 
06:16:57.270 --> 06:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
um is um is is thinking of that so I'm
 
06:16:58.708 --> 06:16:58.718 align:start position:0%
just curious if you have any thoughts
 
06:17:00.670 --> 06:17:00.680 align:start position:0%
about that or if anyone else
 
06:17:03.150 --> 06:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
does are you directing a question to
 
06:17:05.708 --> 06:17:05.718 align:start position:0%
representative Foss or to anyone large I
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
think to anyone but I think
 
06:17:10.110 --> 06:17:10.120 align:start position:0%
representative f is probably like the
 
06:17:12.628 --> 06:17:12.638 align:start position:0%
primary target uh representative F
 
06:17:14.868 --> 06:17:14.878 align:start position:0%
you're the primary target
 
06:17:18.990 --> 06:17:19.000 align:start position:0%
here uh I'm flattered uh due diligence
 
06:17:24.990 --> 06:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
is extremely Broad and uh up for a a lot
 
06:17:27.468 --> 06:17:27.478 align:start position:0%
of interpretation so if if you want to
 
06:17:30.030 --> 06:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
hold that against this regulation then
 
06:17:32.510 --> 06:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's worthy of
 
06:17:35.270 --> 06:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
another conversation but what it says is
 
06:17:38.628 --> 06:17:38.638 align:start position:0%
that these cor large corporations doing
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
business in the European Union are
 
06:17:45.990 --> 06:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to look at their supply chain
 
06:17:48.310 --> 06:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
and their processes and the the the way
 
06:17:50.788 --> 06:17:50.798 align:start position:0%
in which they do business to make sure
 
06:17:54.670 --> 06:17:54.680 align:start position:0%
that they are not uh involved in human
 
06:17:57.390 --> 06:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
trafficking for example is specifically
 
06:18:01.350 --> 06:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned in the regulation or slave
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
labor or um you know anti-
 
06:18:09.350 --> 06:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
uh anti-human rights and anti what we
 
06:18:12.070 --> 06:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
consider very basic labor protections
 
06:18:16.430 --> 06:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
that we have in this country so they are
 
06:18:19.310 --> 06:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
uh supposed to investigate their
 
06:18:21.750 --> 06:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
processes and their wide
 
06:18:25.190 --> 06:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
operations to make sure that they are
 
06:18:28.110 --> 06:18:28.120 align:start position:0%
not to their knowledge due diligence
 
06:18:33.708 --> 06:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
again it it is extremely broad uh and to
 
06:18:35.350 --> 06:18:35.360 align:start position:0%
uh look that that make sure that they're
 
06:18:39.150 --> 06:18:39.160 align:start position:0%
not supporting that if they do find that
 
06:18:42.670 --> 06:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
there is a risk that possibly one of
 
06:18:46.910 --> 06:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
their suppliers is you know using uh
 
06:18:50.948 --> 06:18:50.958 align:start position:0%
trafficed labor then they should
 
06:18:53.750 --> 06:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
assess whether or not there's a
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
certainty or how that would affect their
 
06:18:59.030 --> 06:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
business and if there are potentially
 
06:19:02.350 --> 06:19:02.360 align:start position:0%
multiple risks then they are allowed to
 
06:19:04.948 --> 06:19:04.958 align:start position:0%
assess which is the larger risk it
 
06:19:08.670 --> 06:19:08.680 align:start position:0%
leaves a lot of room for the
 
06:19:11.390 --> 06:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
corporations to adapt it to their
 
06:19:11.400 --> 06:19:13.910 align:start position:0%
corporations to adapt it to their
business

06:19:13.910 --> 06:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:17.750 --> 06:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
practices anything else uh from anybody
 
06:19:19.868 --> 06:19:19.878 align:start position:0%

awesome so
 
06:21:37.390 --> 06:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
what we noticed uh as always in all the
 
06:21:38.868 --> 06:21:38.878 align:start position:0%
different states that this thing gets
 
06:21:41.468 --> 06:21:41.478 align:start position:0%
filed is uh they roll in a bunch of
 
06:21:44.270 --> 06:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
generals uh to oppose uh their key
 
06:21:46.510 --> 06:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
argument is always funding and it's
 
06:21:50.670 --> 06:21:50.680 align:start position:0%
never we we will lose X it is it puts X
 
06:21:53.750 --> 06:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
at risk and we're seeing this all in a
 
06:21:55.070 --> 06:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
bunch of states that this has been filed
 
06:21:56.670 --> 06:21:56.680 align:start position:0%
in already we saw I've been watching the
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
testimonies in all the different states
 
06:21:59.948 --> 06:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
it's almost as if they were handed a
 
06:22:02.670 --> 06:22:02.680 align:start position:0%
script from somewhere Department of
 
06:22:05.030 --> 06:22:05.040 align:start position:0%
Defense that says these are your talking
 
06:22:07.590 --> 06:22:07.600 align:start position:0%
points deliver on these and they they've
 
06:22:09.670 --> 06:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
changed over from the last time we heard
 
06:22:11.830 --> 06:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
this thing a little bit but they're
 
06:22:13.788 --> 06:22:13.798 align:start position:0%
still unanimous like a uniform across
 
06:22:16.510 --> 06:22:16.520 align:start position:0%
all the different states so part of the
 
06:22:19.868 --> 06:22:19.878 align:start position:0%
funding question here is so are we part
 
06:22:22.110 --> 06:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
of a big a defensive Network are all
 
06:22:23.590 --> 06:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
guard units part of a defensive Network
 
06:22:26.548 --> 06:22:26.558 align:start position:0%
or not if they are why would they defund
 
06:22:28.510 --> 06:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
us for the other functionalities that
 
06:22:31.230 --> 06:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
the guard use at they have three
 
06:22:34.110 --> 06:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
missions repel Invasion quell uh quell
 
06:22:35.830 --> 06:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
upright and execute the laws of the
 
06:22:38.310 --> 06:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
nation so if the threat here is that the
 
06:22:39.670 --> 06:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
federal government is going to
 
06:22:41.910 --> 06:22:41.920 align:start position:0%
completely defund the guard that
 
06:22:43.948 --> 06:22:43.958 align:start position:0%
undermines the Constitutional Authority
 
06:22:46.390 --> 06:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
and the the missions that these guard
 
06:22:49.110 --> 06:22:49.120 align:start position:0%
units have by default the Constitutional
 
06:22:52.430 --> 06:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
role then then they argue about peas uh
 
06:22:54.510 --> 06:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
peas is not just a military base it's
 
06:22:56.548 --> 06:22:56.558 align:start position:0%
also a civilian air base it's it has a
 
06:22:57.788 --> 06:22:57.798 align:start position:0%
hybrid role so there's no way they're's
 
06:23:00.788 --> 06:23:00.798 align:start position:0%
going to close an Airfield uh secondly
 
06:23:02.868 --> 06:23:02.878 align:start position:0%
we have a strategic location of peas
 
06:23:04.990 --> 06:23:05.000 align:start position:0%
being near near the North Atlantic with
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
a long enough Runway to accommodate
 
06:23:08.670 --> 06:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
these just saying they're going to close
 
06:23:10.910 --> 06:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
it seems crazy to me uh we have
 
06:23:13.868 --> 06:23:13.878 align:start position:0%
Congressman on record Paul gosar uh from
 
06:23:16.590 --> 06:23:16.600 align:start position:0%
Arizona Thomas Massie from Kentucky oh
 
06:23:18.110 --> 06:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
yes from Kentucky senator Paul from
 
06:23:21.230 --> 06:23:21.240 align:start position:0%
Kentucky saying that no act of Congress
 
06:23:23.350 --> 06:23:23.360 align:start position:0%
will be done to defund the guard and not
 
06:23:24.510 --> 06:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
only that they walked around and they
 
06:23:26.788 --> 06:23:26.798 align:start position:0%
asked all their compatriots at the State
 
06:23:28.230 --> 06:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
House would any of you file a bill to
 
06:23:29.670 --> 06:23:29.680 align:start position:0%
defund any state guard should this
 
06:23:31.868 --> 06:23:31.878 align:start position:0%
legislation pass none there's a house
 
06:23:34.510 --> 06:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
resolution from gosar saying saying such
 
06:23:36.788 --> 06:23:36.798 align:start position:0%
so during the testimony we heard quotes
 
06:23:39.110 --> 06:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
um on our side in in favor of the bill
 
06:23:41.310 --> 06:23:41.320 align:start position:0%
we had Daniel Webster quoted that it is
 
06:23:42.990 --> 06:23:43.000 align:start position:0%
the duty of the state to interpose
 
06:23:44.708 --> 06:23:44.718 align:start position:0%
itself between an overzealous federal
 
06:23:46.830 --> 06:23:46.840 align:start position:0%
government and its militia to protect
 
06:23:48.990 --> 06:23:49.000 align:start position:0%
them from at the time they were familiar
 
06:23:50.830 --> 06:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
with the Kings sending their the Kings
 
06:23:52.310 --> 06:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
from Europe sending their men off to
 
06:23:54.350 --> 06:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
these useless Wars to die for nothing
 
06:23:55.990 --> 06:23:56.000 align:start position:0%
and it is the job of the the state
 
06:23:58.110 --> 06:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
legislature to interpose between their
 
06:24:01.030 --> 06:24:01.040 align:start position:0%
men and the overzealous uh warmongers in
 
06:24:03.548 --> 06:24:03.558 align:start position:0%
DC then we had two times medal of hon uh
 
06:24:05.030 --> 06:24:05.040 align:start position:0%
Medal of Honor winners Smedley Butler
 
06:24:06.548 --> 06:24:06.558 align:start position:0%
from the United States Marine Corps
 
06:24:08.390 --> 06:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
wrote a very short little essay about
 
06:24:10.310 --> 06:24:10.320 align:start position:0%
the war is a racket that still applies
 
06:24:12.868 --> 06:24:12.878 align:start position:0%
to this day in my opinion uh we then
 
06:24:14.110 --> 06:24:14.120 align:start position:0%
were had a quote from President
 
06:24:16.510 --> 06:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
Eisenhower about the the Fe the the
 
06:24:17.990 --> 06:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
potential problem of the
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
military-industrial complex that we have
 
06:24:23.548 --> 06:24:23.558 align:start position:0%
not that he he waren then but we are
 
06:24:26.468 --> 06:24:26.478 align:start position:0%
very familiar with today um what was not
 
06:24:28.990 --> 06:24:29.000 align:start position:0%
addressed on the opposition side was
 
06:24:30.590 --> 06:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of talk about this
 
06:24:33.310 --> 06:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
patriotic propaganda word of the
 
06:24:35.788 --> 06:24:35.798 align:start position:0%
mission can anybody Define to me what
 
06:24:37.510 --> 06:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
the mission
 
06:24:40.310 --> 06:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
is like Ser like I would like to know
 
06:24:41.670 --> 06:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
because as a guy that had joined the
 
06:24:42.948 --> 06:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
Marine Corps I went to go fight the
 
06:24:44.750 --> 06:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
enemies of the United States including
 
06:24:47.030 --> 06:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
Al-Qaeda specifically I went to go find
 
06:24:48.910 --> 06:24:48.920 align:start position:0%
Bin Laden and kill Bin Laden bin Laden
 
06:24:51.910 --> 06:24:51.920 align:start position:0%
died in uh 2012 and uh we stayed in
 
06:24:54.390 --> 06:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan for another 10 years uh my
 
06:24:55.868 --> 06:24:55.878 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the CIA was aware
 
06:24:58.110 --> 06:24:58.120 align:start position:0%
that uh Bin Laden wasn't in Afghanistan
 
06:25:01.190 --> 06:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
as early as November 2001 and we
 
06:25:05.110 --> 06:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
remained there for two decades the 2001
 
06:25:07.350 --> 06:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
aumf was specifically crafted for this
 
06:25:09.628 --> 06:25:09.638 align:start position:0%
purpose to go destroy the enemies of the
 
06:25:11.788 --> 06:25:11.798 align:start position:0%
United States that attacked us on 911
 
06:25:14.350 --> 06:25:14.360 align:start position:0%
and the countries that harbored them
 
06:25:17.310 --> 06:25:17.320 align:start position:0%
fast forward to this past December when
 
06:25:20.350 --> 06:25:20.360 align:start position:0%
we helped Al-Qaeda I am not kidding you
 
06:25:22.350 --> 06:25:22.360 align:start position:0%
all need to go look up Abu Muhammad Al
 
06:25:24.590 --> 06:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
jolani that name write it down look it
 
06:25:27.030 --> 06:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
up that dude is now in charge of Syria
 
06:25:31.390 --> 06:25:31.400 align:start position:0%
he helped al-Qaeda in Iraq we he shot at
 
06:25:34.270 --> 06:25:34.280 align:start position:0%
guys like me he was detained for an EXT
 
06:25:36.270 --> 06:25:36.280 align:start position:0%
ex long time till we released him then
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
he went to go form alosra front then
 
06:25:40.510 --> 06:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
which was an offshoot of al-Qaeda and
 
06:25:42.430 --> 06:25:42.440 align:start position:0%
Syria joined Isis for a little bit of
 
06:25:44.310 --> 06:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
time then went back to his Al-Qaeda
 
06:25:46.190 --> 06:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
offet we have handed the country of
 
06:25:48.590 --> 06:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
Syria to that man and the people that
 
06:25:52.548 --> 06:25:52.558 align:start position:0%
work with him all under this 2001 aumf
 
06:25:54.150 --> 06:25:54.160 align:start position:0%
we have people there are National
 
06:25:55.830 --> 06:25:55.840 align:start position:0%
Guardsmen in the beginning of the Syrian
 
06:25:57.910 --> 06:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
conflict made up less than 5% of the the
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
boots on the ground there it is now over
 
06:26:03.948 --> 06:26:03.958 align:start position:0%
50% the tower 22 base in Jordan Northern
 
06:26:06.030 --> 06:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
Jordan it borders the corner between
 
06:26:08.110 --> 06:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
Syria and Iraq this area has been used
 
06:26:10.350 --> 06:26:10.360 align:start position:0%
for to there's a main Supply route that
 
06:26:13.270 --> 06:26:13.280 align:start position:0%
goes from uh Iran through Iraq into
 
06:26:15.430 --> 06:26:15.440 align:start position:0%
Syria our job at that Tower was to
 
06:26:17.910 --> 06:26:17.920 align:start position:0%
basically infiltrate any type of Iranian
 
06:26:19.190 --> 06:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
supplies that may be going to the Bashar
 
06:26:20.990 --> 06:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
al-assad regime That Base came under
 
06:26:23.150 --> 06:26:23.160 align:start position:0%
attack because the Iraqis are pissed off
 
06:26:24.430 --> 06:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
that we're still sitting in their
 
06:26:26.868 --> 06:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
goddamn country right now and that came
 
06:26:29.948 --> 06:26:29.958 align:start position:0%
under sorry language representative uh
 
06:26:32.070 --> 06:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
uh roll I back would you please my my
 
06:26:34.868 --> 06:26:34.878 align:start position:0%
apologies GD uh we're still in their
 
06:26:37.390 --> 06:26:37.400 align:start position:0%
country since the Isis has been
 
06:26:40.110 --> 06:26:40.120 align:start position:0%
basically defanged destroyed we are
 
06:26:42.350 --> 06:26:42.360 align:start position:0%
still in Iraq under the pretenses that
 
06:26:45.110 --> 06:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
we are protecting them from Isis which
 
06:26:47.430 --> 06:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
would not have existed if we didn't
 
06:26:50.788 --> 06:26:50.798 align:start position:0%
invade that country under a lie behead
 
06:26:53.788 --> 06:26:53.798 align:start position:0%
their entire uh government dismantle
 
06:26:55.510 --> 06:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
their army so they couldn't defend
 
06:26:58.190 --> 06:26:58.200 align:start position:0%
themselves and then bomb their country
 
06:27:00.430 --> 06:27:00.440 align:start position:0%
and cause all kinds of Martyrs and
 
06:27:02.190 --> 06:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
people who have nothing left to live for
 
06:27:03.830 --> 06:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
so they went to go join a terrorist
 
06:27:05.948 --> 06:27:05.958 align:start position:0%
organiz a because they had nothing left
 
06:27:05.958 --> 06:27:09.750 align:start position:0%
organiz a because they had nothing left
to

06:27:09.750 --> 06:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:27:13.230 --> 06:27:13.240 align:start position:0%
lose yeah it is add in but I think it
 
06:27:15.350 --> 06:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
also goes a bit further back just to
 
06:27:16.788 --> 06:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
kind of add to that on the Charlie
 
06:27:18.948 --> 06:27:18.958 align:start position:0%
Wilson's War and all that fun oh yes
 
06:27:20.390 --> 06:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I'm really back to
 
06:27:22.510 --> 06:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
partitioning of the British I agree yes
 
06:27:24.948 --> 06:27:24.958 align:start position:0%
I I will not argue that whatsoever but I
 
06:27:26.150 --> 06:27:26.160 align:start position:0%
would say that the United States like
 
06:27:28.070 --> 06:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
directly in our lifetime this has
 
06:27:31.270 --> 06:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
occurred um so back to so all that so
 
06:27:32.750 --> 06:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
Tower 22 I want to go back to this so
 
06:27:34.628 --> 06:27:34.638 align:start position:0%
Tower 22 came under attack last year
 
06:27:36.948 --> 06:27:36.958 align:start position:0%
about one year ago today and uh it
 
06:27:38.628 --> 06:27:38.638 align:start position:0%
killed three it became under a drone
 
06:27:40.830 --> 06:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
attack from Iraqi militia they always
 
06:27:43.788 --> 06:27:43.798 align:start position:0%
use the damn phrase uh Iranian backed
 
06:27:45.390 --> 06:27:45.400 align:start position:0%
because they want to provoke us into
 
06:27:47.468 --> 06:27:47.478 align:start position:0%
conflict with Iran for the record Iran
 
06:27:49.230 --> 06:27:49.240 align:start position:0%
is bigger than Afghanistan and Iraq
 
06:27:51.590 --> 06:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
combined with the population bigger than
 
06:27:53.150 --> 06:27:53.160 align:start position:0%
that combined it has the worst features
 
06:27:55.548 --> 06:27:55.558 align:start position:0%
of both and we lost both the Iraq and
 
06:27:57.350 --> 06:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan Wars so anybody who's trying
 
06:28:00.110 --> 06:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
to push us to attack Iran like I want to
 
06:28:03.750 --> 06:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
know what you're smoking um the so the
 
06:28:05.430 --> 06:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
tower 22 came under attack by these
 
06:28:08.510 --> 06:28:08.520 align:start position:0%
militia and it killed three uh Georgia
 
06:28:11.110 --> 06:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
reservists and it Def and it wounded
 
06:28:13.830 --> 06:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
over 40 National Guardsmen from across
 
06:28:16.590 --> 06:28:16.600 align:start position:0%
four different states the kicker the
 
06:28:18.430 --> 06:28:18.440 align:start position:0%
United the New Hampshire National Guard
 
06:28:20.830 --> 06:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
had just left that Airbase two weeks
 
06:28:22.510 --> 06:28:22.520 align:start position:0%
prior it could have been our guys coming
 
06:28:24.628 --> 06:28:24.638 align:start position:0%
back in critical wound and for what like
 
06:28:26.788 --> 06:28:26.798 align:start position:0%
this goes back to the mission we kept
 
06:28:28.310 --> 06:28:28.320 align:start position:0%

06:28:29.628 --> 06:28:29.638 align:start position:0%

retain it for now but get get ready for
 
06:29:14.990 --> 06:29:15.000 align:start position:0%

06:29:18.510 --> 06:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire National Guard in a
 
06:29:22.190 --> 06:29:22.200 align:start position:0%
box between now and then thank
 
06:29:24.230 --> 06:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
you thank you for speaking to your
 
06:29:27.190 --> 06:29:27.200 align:start position:0%
motion representative Manion uh other
 
06:29:30.230 --> 06:29:30.240 align:start position:0%
other thoughts on the retain motion uh
 
06:29:32.468 --> 06:29:32.478 align:start position:0%
represent Bel you did the second
 
06:29:38.750 --> 06:29:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:41.628 --> 06:29:41.638 align:start position:0%
representative cyber yeah so I don't
 
06:29:44.510 --> 06:29:44.520 align:start position:0%
mind you know honestly retaining this
 
06:29:46.628 --> 06:29:46.638 align:start position:0%
but I would like to look at it further I
 
06:29:48.270 --> 06:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
feel like it's a little
 
06:29:51.628 --> 06:29:51.638 align:start position:0%
oversimplified in what it could cost the
 
06:29:53.990 --> 06:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
state not just in that but there's a lot
 
06:29:56.590 --> 06:29:56.600 align:start position:0%
of people and I talked to a fellow
 
06:29:59.350 --> 06:29:59.360 align:start position:0%
representative um who's actually new
 
06:30:01.350 --> 06:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
he's the new Pat long is what we call
 
06:30:04.390 --> 06:30:04.400 align:start position:0%
him Patrick long he's a new repres ative
 
06:30:09.750 --> 06:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
this year and um he served two tours um
 
06:30:11.910 --> 06:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
in Afghanistan through the National
 
06:30:14.708 --> 06:30:14.718 align:start position:0%
Guard and you know he's a lawyer now he
 
06:30:17.310 --> 06:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
was able to go to college um he would
 
06:30:19.070 --> 06:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise not have been afforded those
 
06:30:21.628 --> 06:30:21.638 align:start position:0%
opportunities and to be able to buy a
 
06:30:25.310 --> 06:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
home and you know these we're kind of
 
06:30:27.548 --> 06:30:27.558 align:start position:0%
not listening to the actual people that
 
06:30:30.590 --> 06:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
are out there right now that want to
 
06:30:32.310 --> 06:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
leave after their four years and just
 
06:30:34.030 --> 06:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
get those four years done and then be
 
06:30:37.110 --> 06:30:37.120 align:start position:0%
able to you know go on with their life
 
06:30:39.510 --> 06:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
and this is the way that they've chosen
 
06:30:42.910 --> 06:30:42.920 align:start position:0%
to do it and so I just to me that's
 
06:30:44.788 --> 06:30:44.798 align:start position:0%
really hard to reconcile is the people
 
06:30:48.590 --> 06:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:51.590 --> 06:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
here thank you repres
 
06:30:53.910 --> 06:30:53.920 align:start position:0%
cyber representative
 
06:30:57.070 --> 06:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
Jones thank you if I just may throw out
 
06:30:59.590 --> 06:30:59.600 align:start position:0%
a kudos to representative Manion uh I
 
06:31:02.468 --> 06:31:02.478 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say uh you you came over
 
06:31:04.868 --> 06:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
and reminded me that I asked a question
 
06:31:07.230 --> 06:31:07.240 align:start position:0%
of a presenter and and they skirted my
 
06:31:08.628 --> 06:31:08.638 align:start position:0%
question and I just wanted to thank you
 
06:31:11.150 --> 06:31:11.160 align:start position:0%
for reminding me of that would would you
 
06:31:12.868 --> 06:31:12.878 align:start position:0%
care to say what your question was
 
06:31:14.310 --> 06:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
because it's pretty
 
06:31:16.430 --> 06:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
important I mean I can I can reiterate
 
06:31:19.190 --> 06:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
what your question was it was the
 
06:31:20.468 --> 06:31:20.478 align:start position:0%
difference between recruiting for
 
06:31:22.910 --> 06:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
National Guard and recruiting for the
 
06:31:24.788 --> 06:31:24.798 align:start position:0%
military yeah and I think it was
 
06:31:26.510 --> 06:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
specifically if when they recruit these
 
06:31:27.948 --> 06:31:27.958 align:start position:0%
teenagers out of high school if they
 
06:31:29.070 --> 06:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
tell them when they're joining the
 
06:31:30.868 --> 06:31:30.878 align:start position:0%
National Guard that they may be sent to
 
06:31:37.030 --> 06:31:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:31:39.628 --> 06:31:39.638 align:start position:0%
other comments
 
06:31:42.388 --> 06:31:42.398 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
Bennett thank you for taking my question
 
06:31:51.628 --> 06:31:51.638 align:start position:0%
um yes sorry um I just I have gotten a
 
06:31:56.270 --> 06:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
lot of um response to vote for
 
06:32:01.150 --> 06:32:01.160 align:start position:0%
this and I'm hearing that I did hear
 
06:32:02.788 --> 06:32:02.798 align:start position:0%
something about the funding actually I
 
06:32:05.388 --> 06:32:05.398 align:start position:0%
know somebody um close to the family
 
06:32:07.590 --> 06:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
that is in the National Guard and I
 
06:32:09.388 --> 06:32:09.398 align:start position:0%
asked them if they knew about this
 
06:32:11.628 --> 06:32:11.638 align:start position:0%
situation and what they would think
 
06:32:16.110 --> 06:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
about it and this was a young person and
 
06:32:18.350 --> 06:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
definitely you know did their time and
 
06:32:21.350 --> 06:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
got some education has a good job and
 
06:32:24.110 --> 06:32:24.120 align:start position:0%
everything um and that was the thing
 
06:32:26.350 --> 06:32:26.360 align:start position:0%
they pointed out was the funding but I
 
06:32:29.230 --> 06:32:29.240 align:start position:0%
didn't really completely understand that
 
06:32:32.270 --> 06:32:32.280 align:start position:0%
um but I think the people that want this
 
06:32:32.280 --> 06:32:34.110 align:start position:0%
um but I think the people that want this
situation

06:32:34.110 --> 06:32:34.120 align:start position:0%
situation
 
06:32:36.590 --> 06:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
um are concern not for the people who
 
06:32:39.230 --> 06:32:39.240 align:start position:0%
come back but the people that might not
 
06:32:42.788 --> 06:32:42.798 align:start position:0%
come back you know sending your person
 
06:32:45.590 --> 06:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
over there they might not come back and
 
06:32:47.430 --> 06:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
we can help the people that did come
 
06:32:51.030 --> 06:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
back but we can't bring back the people
 
06:32:54.030 --> 06:32:54.040 align:start position:0%
that gave their lives and I think that's
 
06:32:55.948 --> 06:32:55.958 align:start position:0%
what who we want to
 
06:32:58.750 --> 06:32:58.760 align:start position:0%
protect and I think that we can't lose
 
06:33:00.750 --> 06:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
sight of that you know that's what I
 
06:33:03.548 --> 06:33:03.558 align:start position:0%
thought of when I had the choice at that
 
06:33:07.830 --> 06:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
age to go into the military was I might
 
06:33:10.350 --> 06:33:10.360 align:start position:0%
have to go to war and when I was in
 
06:33:13.510 --> 06:33:13.520 align:start position:0%
college actually people that signed up
 
06:33:16.270 --> 06:33:16.280 align:start position:0%
went to like Saudi Arabia and stuff and
 
06:33:18.868 --> 06:33:18.878 align:start position:0%
they were surprised because they didn't
 
06:33:21.788 --> 06:33:21.798 align:start position:0%
they didn't sign up for that you know
 
06:33:23.830 --> 06:33:23.840 align:start position:0%
but I'm thinking that's why I didn't
 
06:33:27.388 --> 06:33:27.398 align:start position:0%
sign up you know um but I do have a son
 
06:33:29.788 --> 06:33:29.798 align:start position:0%
who went into the military and you know
 
06:33:32.230 --> 06:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
every day you're wondering I wonder if
 
06:33:34.670 --> 06:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
they'll come back or not and some of it
 
06:33:37.548 --> 06:33:37.558 align:start position:0%
their friends don't come back so I just
 
06:33:39.868 --> 06:33:39.878 align:start position:0%
think we should keep that in mind and I
 
06:33:41.750 --> 06:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
don't understand all the process if
 
06:33:45.110 --> 06:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
retain means that we can still pursue
 
06:33:47.230 --> 06:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
this I think that's what I'm hearing so
 
06:33:49.430 --> 06:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
that's where I would go but I was going
 
06:33:52.510 --> 06:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
to vote for it but I appreciate your
 
06:33:54.590 --> 06:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
comments to your question about
 
06:33:58.150 --> 06:33:58.160 align:start position:0%
retention representative Bennett what
 
06:34:00.110 --> 06:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
will happen here is that we'll sit
 
06:34:01.708 --> 06:34:01.718 align:start position:0%
basically retain or sit on it in the
 
06:34:03.270 --> 06:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
first year of a term and the second year
 
06:34:05.468 --> 06:34:05.478 align:start position:0%
we have an option of interim study which
 
06:34:08.468 --> 06:34:08.478 align:start position:0%
we don't have here so if if we do vote
 
06:34:10.910 --> 06:34:10.920 align:start position:0%
to retain this is which is the motion in
 
06:34:13.510 --> 06:34:13.520 align:start position:0%
the floor we would come back to it in
 
06:34:17.708 --> 06:34:17.718 align:start position:0%
the fall and U and vote on what to do
 
06:34:19.948 --> 06:34:19.958 align:start position:0%
with the retained motion and the
 
06:34:22.830 --> 06:34:22.840 align:start position:0%
there'll be several choices and then the
 
06:34:25.750 --> 06:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
first session first house session in
 
06:34:28.430 --> 06:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
January uh whatever we decide will go to
 
06:34:31.110 --> 06:34:31.120 align:start position:0%
the floor uh at that point so this gives
 
06:34:34.430 --> 06:34:34.440 align:start position:0%
us uh some time uh repres man shared
 
06:34:36.070 --> 06:34:36.080 align:start position:0%
some breaking news and that's part of
 
06:34:39.070 --> 06:34:39.080 align:start position:0%
the value of retention is sometimes
 
06:34:41.230 --> 06:34:41.240 align:start position:0%
circumstances change one way or the
 
06:34:44.788 --> 06:34:44.798 align:start position:0%
other uh from what uh the the prime
 
06:34:46.990 --> 06:34:47.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor just shared uh I didn't know
 
06:34:49.110 --> 06:34:49.120 align:start position:0%
that that that's significant we always
 
06:34:51.548 --> 06:34:51.558 align:start position:0%
look at what other states do to see if
 
06:34:53.230 --> 06:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
it works it doesn't work whatever it
 
06:34:57.990 --> 06:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
matters it's a federal system so uh we
 
06:34:59.708 --> 06:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to this and then I don't
 
06:35:01.310 --> 06:35:01.320 align:start position:0%
know what will happen when we come back
 
06:35:05.190 --> 06:35:05.200 align:start position:0%
to it it may depend on uh other things
 
06:35:08.270 --> 06:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
that develop who knows but uh we have
 
06:35:11.910 --> 06:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
time in months months and months of time
 
06:35:14.190 --> 06:35:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative man just to clarify so
 
06:35:16.150 --> 06:35:16.160 align:start position:0%
like the retain is I think to put some
 
06:35:17.548 --> 06:35:17.558 align:start position:0%
people who are on the edge like whether
 
06:35:18.708 --> 06:35:18.718 align:start position:0%
or not they're going to support or not
 
06:35:20.548 --> 06:35:20.558 align:start position:0%
because we have had buy off from the
 
06:35:22.430 --> 06:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
current Secretary of Defense Pete hget
 
06:35:24.110 --> 06:35:24.120 align:start position:0%
that he supports this bill he said it on
 
06:35:25.708 --> 06:35:25.718 align:start position:0%
Fox and Friends he said it in a closed
 
06:35:27.070 --> 06:35:27.080 align:start position:0%
door meeting with the people who who
 
06:35:29.350 --> 06:35:29.360 align:start position:0%
wrote this bill when he met with them
 
06:35:31.030 --> 06:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
and I I want him to do something that
 
06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
comes straight out and says it honestly
 
06:35:33.990 --> 06:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
I supported this bill last year before
 
06:35:36.350 --> 06:35:36.360 align:start position:0%
Pete Heth was even a name I knew uh when
 
06:35:38.388 --> 06:35:38.398 align:start position:0%
I supported this cuz I don't believe
 
06:35:40.190 --> 06:35:40.200 align:start position:0%
that the funding thing is true uh one
 
06:35:41.190 --> 06:35:41.200 align:start position:0%
thing I do want to mention about like
 
06:35:43.230 --> 06:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
the guys that go down range like uh some
 
06:35:45.628 --> 06:35:45.638 align:start position:0%
of them won do it for um they they there
 
06:35:47.788 --> 06:35:47.798 align:start position:0%
was one uh representative testified and
 
06:35:50.948 --> 06:35:50.958 align:start position:0%
they he was describing what I kind of P
 
06:35:52.510 --> 06:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
you know pejoratively call ribbon
 
06:35:54.150 --> 06:35:54.160 align:start position:0%
chasing where it's like I want to deploy
 
06:35:56.350 --> 06:35:56.360 align:start position:0%
because I want ribbons uh I served under
 
06:35:58.430 --> 06:35:58.440 align:start position:0%
officers that put men's lives at risk
 
06:35:59.948 --> 06:35:59.958 align:start position:0%
because they were ribbon chasing which
 
06:36:01.830 --> 06:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
is the equivalent of like we had a
 
06:36:03.788 --> 06:36:03.798 align:start position:0%
captain our C company Commander my
 
06:36:06.190 --> 06:36:06.200 align:start position:0%
second uh deployment would take uh foot
 
06:36:08.670 --> 06:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
patrols of 12 men into an area that was
 
06:36:10.910 --> 06:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
unn unsafe that the Iraqi Army that were
 
06:36:12.430 --> 06:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
in charge of who are notoriously
 
06:36:14.270 --> 06:36:14.280 align:start position:0%
unreliable so he would take men on foot
 
06:36:15.750 --> 06:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
patrols because he really wanted that
 
06:36:18.030 --> 06:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
Combat Action ribbon so You' take our
 
06:36:20.070 --> 06:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
guys that were in his charge into an
 
06:36:23.190 --> 06:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
area that was unsafe so I I consider
 
06:36:25.030 --> 06:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
that ribbon chasing and I think it's not
 
06:36:26.388 --> 06:36:26.398 align:start position:0%
great I understand that some people want
 
06:36:29.070 --> 06:36:29.080 align:start position:0%
experience they want deployments etc etc
 
06:36:32.310 --> 06:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
they uh you know I can't that's what
 
06:36:34.548 --> 06:36:34.558 align:start position:0%
they want but our job isn't to just like
 
06:36:36.548 --> 06:36:36.558 align:start position:0%
allow that thing to happen our job as as
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
the government is to be as the the
 
06:36:40.670 --> 06:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
legislature to over to provide oversight
 
06:36:43.030 --> 06:36:43.040 align:start position:0%
for uh the executive that may be taking
 
06:36:44.910 --> 06:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
advantage of these young men uh for
 
06:36:47.310 --> 06:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
example uh when I was recruited uh I was
 
06:36:48.628 --> 06:36:48.638 align:start position:0%
told the Iraq war is probably going to
 
06:36:50.590 --> 06:36:50.600 align:start position:0%
be over by the time you get there like I
 
06:36:51.788 --> 06:36:51.798 align:start position:0%
didn't understand the Iraq War it's like
 
06:36:53.788 --> 06:36:53.798 align:start position:0%
you're going to go fight al-Qaeda in in
 
06:36:56.868 --> 06:36:56.878 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan I was lied to they didn't
 
06:36:59.990 --> 06:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily know but you know it's our
 
06:37:02.310 --> 06:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
job as the legislature to step in where
 
06:37:03.830 --> 06:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
the executive will take advant advantage
 
06:37:06.150 --> 06:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
of our citizens we should be the people
 
06:37:08.150 --> 06:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
uh defending them we shouldn't just like
 
06:37:09.590 --> 06:37:09.600 align:start position:0%
CU When a general comes up in a we
 
06:37:11.548 --> 06:37:11.558 align:start position:0%
shouldn't just bow to his his uh
 
06:37:12.990 --> 06:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
knowledge and be like oh well he's a
 
06:37:14.190 --> 06:37:14.200 align:start position:0%
general we should listen to him as a
 
06:37:15.708 --> 06:37:15.718 align:start position:0%
low-level enlisted man I know that
 
06:37:18.628 --> 06:37:18.638 align:start position:0%
generals don't always make the best
 
06:37:20.910 --> 06:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
decisions uh represent
 
06:37:24.750 --> 06:37:24.760 align:start position:0%
floss uh thank you and I am very glad of
 
06:37:27.030 --> 06:37:27.040 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to retain this because I
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
I myself have been very conflicted uh on
 
06:37:33.628 --> 06:37:33.638 align:start position:0%
I have been uh asking everyone I know
 
06:37:36.030 --> 06:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
who was in the guard to the point of at
 
06:37:37.788 --> 06:37:37.798 align:start position:0%
my favorite bagel place I saw that
 
06:37:39.548 --> 06:37:39.558 align:start position:0%
someone had a national guard license
 
06:37:42.430 --> 06:37:42.440 align:start position:0%
plate in the parking lot and I went and
 
06:37:44.350 --> 06:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
interrupted their breakfast and asked
 
06:37:47.510 --> 06:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
them what they thought um so I uh
 
06:37:50.350 --> 06:37:50.360 align:start position:0%
wholeheartedly would appreciate this
 
06:37:54.350 --> 06:37:54.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity because I while I am
 
06:37:57.990 --> 06:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
cautious uh of the fiscal note I I mean
 
06:37:59.510 --> 06:37:59.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want
 
06:38:02.788 --> 06:38:02.798 align:start position:0%
to it it's people's livelihoods that we
 
06:38:06.270 --> 06:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
are you know rolling the dice on here
 
06:38:09.388 --> 06:38:09.398 align:start position:0%
it's I'm very conscious of my father's
 
06:38:11.948 --> 06:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
family when he was growing up the they
 
06:38:13.670 --> 06:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
had one income and it was from my
 
06:38:15.948 --> 06:38:15.958 align:start position:0%
grandfather working on PE air Fort space
 
06:38:20.230 --> 06:38:20.240 align:start position:0%
and were people to lose their jobs uh I
 
06:38:22.310 --> 06:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
I don't feel like I could go to my
 
06:38:24.830 --> 06:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
constituents and say well I thought it
 
06:38:27.468 --> 06:38:27.478 align:start position:0%
wouldn't really happen and I I certainly
 
06:38:30.990 --> 06:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
can't summon the ghost of Daniel Webster
 
06:38:34.990 --> 06:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
to quote at them and say this is why uh
 
06:38:37.150 --> 06:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
I your representative should have voted
 
06:38:40.070 --> 06:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
for that but at the same time I'm
 
06:38:44.468 --> 06:38:44.478 align:start position:0%
someone who you know the when 911
 
06:38:48.430 --> 06:38:48.440 align:start position:0%
happened I had just turned 11 so for my
 
06:38:51.030 --> 06:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
entire adult life there have been people
 
06:38:52.590 --> 06:38:52.600 align:start position:0%
in the Middle East and if people signed
 
06:38:55.708 --> 06:38:55.718 align:start position:0%
up for the guard when I was turning 18 I
 
06:38:59.350 --> 06:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
couldn't myself because I'm disabled uh
 
06:39:02.708 --> 06:39:02.718 align:start position:0%
they knew that they were going overseas
 
06:39:05.990 --> 06:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh I had a friend who his father was in
 
06:39:08.910 --> 06:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
the guard and served in Iraq and then
 
06:39:11.628 --> 06:39:11.638 align:start position:0%
when we graduated from high school he
 
06:39:13.110 --> 06:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
went and served in the Middle East and I
 
06:39:15.388 --> 06:39:15.398 align:start position:0%
used to check his Facebook every once in
 
06:39:17.548 --> 06:39:17.558 align:start position:0%
a while to make sure he was still
 
06:39:21.868 --> 06:39:21.878 align:start position:0%
alive uh he was and he's doing very well
 
06:39:26.468 --> 06:39:26.478 align:start position:0%
uh so I am definitely sensitive to both
 
06:39:28.708 --> 06:39:28.718 align:start position:0%
aspects and I I very much appreciate the
 
06:39:31.788 --> 06:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
opportunity for more study on this so we
 
06:39:32.990 --> 06:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
hadn't have the home strats going to
 
06:39:35.030 --> 06:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
vote soon and I'm going to go right to
 
06:39:38.070 --> 06:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
represent cyber in a moment uh to your
 
06:39:40.310 --> 06:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
point uh this has come up and it's been
 
06:39:42.190 --> 06:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
called the game of chicken many people
 
06:39:45.150 --> 06:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
have said that uh the folks that rban is
 
06:39:47.030 --> 06:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
talking about said they would never dare
 
06:39:50.590 --> 06:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
defund this uh and I kind of think he
 
06:39:54.430 --> 06:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
may be right but I'm not sure and uh and
 
06:39:56.948 --> 06:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
the folks we heard much testimony that
 
06:40:00.708 --> 06:40:00.718 align:start position:0%
uh they'll move asset so defund us uh
 
06:40:03.430 --> 06:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
that nobody can guarantee either way and
 
06:40:06.350 --> 06:40:06.360 align:start position:0%
and so it is a an uncertain game of
 
06:40:09.070 --> 06:40:09.080 align:start position:0%
chicken and and that's not a nice way to
 
06:40:12.070 --> 06:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
put it but that's the essence of it uh
 
06:40:14.788 --> 06:40:14.798 align:start position:0%
real you mentioned uh being 11 when 911
 
06:40:17.388 --> 06:40:17.398 align:start position:0%
hit that remind when I was growing up
 
06:40:20.910 --> 06:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
Vietnam was hanging over our heads every
 
06:40:23.830 --> 06:40:23.840 align:start position:0%
single day year after year that was a
 
06:40:25.868 --> 06:40:25.878 align:start position:0%
more intense conflict than what happened
 
06:40:28.350 --> 06:40:28.360 align:start position:0%
in the Middle East like represent like
 
06:40:31.430 --> 06:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative Manion after 911 uh I was
 
06:40:33.310 --> 06:40:33.320 align:start position:0%
I was a reservist I put a uniform on it
 
06:40:36.070 --> 06:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
they went to Central Command uh where
 
06:40:38.388 --> 06:40:38.398 align:start position:0%
they ran the War uh I work for General
 
06:40:42.230 --> 06:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
Franks uh in at sencom in mcdill and the
 
06:40:44.388 --> 06:40:44.398 align:start position:0%
focus was Afghanistan as representative
 
06:40:46.350 --> 06:40:46.360 align:start position:0%
Manion said a lot of people joined up
 
06:40:48.788 --> 06:40:48.798 align:start position:0%
after 911 as it sounds like he did I put
 
06:40:51.628 --> 06:40:51.638 align:start position:0%
a uniform on the same thing but the
 
06:40:54.110 --> 06:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
focus was Afghanistan Afghanistan
 
06:40:56.030 --> 06:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
Afghanistan I was there for quite a
 
06:41:00.150 --> 06:41:00.160 align:start position:0%
while and it shifted to Iraq and I we
 
06:41:01.830 --> 06:41:01.840 align:start position:0%
don't need to get
 
06:41:04.830 --> 06:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
into why that happen or the merits of it
 
06:41:07.150 --> 06:41:07.160 align:start position:0%
except that that did happen and and so I
 
06:41:09.830 --> 06:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
listening to the to folks like R of
 
06:41:14.548 --> 06:41:14.558 align:start position:0%
Manion who or Pat Tilman who joined up
 
06:41:19.548 --> 06:41:19.558 align:start position:0%
he was a NFL star Arizona Cardinal and
 
06:41:22.468 --> 06:41:22.478 align:start position:0%
he joined up like we did put a uniform
 
06:41:25.708 --> 06:41:25.718 align:start position:0%
on after 911 to go to Afghanistan they
 
06:41:27.948 --> 06:41:27.958 align:start position:0%
sent him to Iraq and ironically he
 
06:41:29.388 --> 06:41:29.398 align:start position:0%
eventually did get to Afghanistan where
 
06:41:32.150 --> 06:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
he was killed by friendly fire but uh I
 
06:41:33.868 --> 06:41:33.878 align:start position:0%
just wanted to personalize that a little
 
06:41:36.110 --> 06:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
bit and and thank you for for
 
06:41:37.628 --> 06:41:37.638 align:start position:0%
personalizing it as well I think that's
 
06:41:39.270 --> 06:41:39.280 align:start position:0%
important that it matters as we finish
 
06:41:40.788 --> 06:41:40.798 align:start position:0%
up representative cyber you had your
 
06:41:40.798 --> 06:41:43.910 align:start position:0%
up representative cyber you had your
hand

06:41:43.910 --> 06:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:41:46.788 --> 06:41:46.798 align:start position:0%
up I think we shouldn't mention all this
 
06:41:48.190 --> 06:41:48.200 align:start position:0%
without mentioning what happened
 
06:41:50.910 --> 06:41:50.920 align:start position:0%
recently with the what like two days ago
 
06:41:53.270 --> 06:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
with the training exercise crash I found
 
06:41:56.230 --> 06:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
out one of the kids on that that was on
 
06:41:58.388 --> 06:41:58.398 align:start position:0%
the helicopter actually went to my high
 
06:42:00.990 --> 06:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
school he was in the ROC somebody was
 
06:42:02.670 --> 06:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
passing that around he went to Parkview
 
06:42:03.948 --> 06:42:03.958 align:start position:0%
High School
 
06:42:05.990 --> 06:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
in Lilburn Georgia which is right
 
06:42:10.910 --> 06:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
outside of Atlanta um Ryan O'Hara um but
 
06:42:12.948 --> 06:42:12.958 align:start position:0%
I guess I kind of wanted to point out
 
06:42:14.830 --> 06:42:14.840 align:start position:0%
that unfortunately like all too often
 
06:42:18.868 --> 06:42:18.878 align:start position:0%
people also die in training exercises um
 
06:42:22.868 --> 06:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
just as a point of that um yeah so it's
 
06:42:25.590 --> 06:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
not just going overseas where you know
 
06:42:28.230 --> 06:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
people give their lives I felt like it's
 
06:42:29.830 --> 06:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
fair to mention
 
06:42:33.350 --> 06:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
that representa mle bum
 
06:42:34.910 --> 06:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to Echo what representative
 
06:42:37.030 --> 06:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
F said about just being appreciative
 
06:42:39.548 --> 06:42:39.558 align:start position:0%
that we are retaining this bill and not
 
06:42:42.430 --> 06:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily voting on a or not voting on
 
06:42:46.350 --> 06:42:46.360 align:start position:0%
a motion to OTP today um I agree with
 
06:42:50.350 --> 06:42:50.360 align:start position:0%
the spirit of the bill but um P's uh
 
06:42:52.310 --> 06:42:52.320 align:start position:0%
International Guard is in my district
 
06:42:57.310 --> 06:42:57.320 align:start position:0%
and I felt that as written with what we
 
06:43:00.070 --> 06:43:00.080 align:start position:0%
being told um by some of the military
 
06:43:03.270 --> 06:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
officials that I just couldn't support
 
06:43:05.150 --> 06:43:05.160 align:start position:0%
it just because of the unknowns about
 
06:43:08.430 --> 06:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
what it could mean for the people um
 
06:43:11.628 --> 06:43:11.638 align:start position:0%
working at PE so um I I think the motion
 
06:43:13.190 --> 06:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
to retain is a good
 
06:43:16.110 --> 06:43:16.120 align:start position:0%
one anything
 
06:43:19.990 --> 06:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
else can I ask a straw pole say again
 
06:43:21.708 --> 06:43:21.718 align:start position:0%
can I ask a straw poll I'm just curious
 
06:43:23.110 --> 06:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
about like potential
 
06:43:25.788 --> 06:43:25.798 align:start position:0%
amendments uh you this is executive
 
06:43:27.628 --> 06:43:27.638 align:start position:0%
session I believe in free speech
 
06:43:30.190 --> 06:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
representative uh ask whatever you want
 
06:43:32.110 --> 06:43:32.120 align:start position:0%
okay so I've been kicking around an idea
 
06:43:34.468 --> 06:43:34.478 align:start position:0%
and even the guys who the bill aren't
 
06:43:37.708 --> 06:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
like too hot on it however what if let's
 
06:43:39.350 --> 06:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
say we amend it to put a trigger clause
 
06:43:42.350 --> 06:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
in place that says if uh five states or
 
06:43:44.190 --> 06:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
some percentage of the population pass
 
06:43:49.670 --> 06:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:43:52.868 --> 06:43:52.878 align:start position:0%
effect representative I very interesting
 
06:43:54.750 --> 06:43:54.760 align:start position:0%
thought uh the wheels are turning I
 
06:43:56.430 --> 06:43:56.440 align:start position:0%
think it's putting folks on the spot a
 
06:43:59.030 --> 06:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
little bit to to to commit to anything
 
06:44:00.830 --> 06:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
without doing maybe not a straw po it's
 
06:44:02.350 --> 06:44:02.360 align:start position:0%
just something I've been mulling over
 
06:44:04.030 --> 06:44:04.040 align:start position:0%
myself because I understand the fears
 
06:44:06.110 --> 06:44:06.120 align:start position:0%
here with like funding and they move
 
06:44:07.628 --> 06:44:07.638 align:start position:0%
might move stuff somewhere else but if
 
06:44:09.150 --> 06:44:09.160 align:start position:0%
like there's nowhere to move it to
 
06:44:11.070 --> 06:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
because we all passed this bill or like
 
06:44:13.750 --> 06:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
10% of the country passed the bill we we
 
06:44:16.868 --> 06:44:16.878 align:start position:0%
can amend this uh this fall uh we can do
 
06:44:18.590 --> 06:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
a number of things with it and the
 
06:44:20.628 --> 06:44:20.638 align:start position:0%
landscape will be different then we'll
 
06:44:23.948 --> 06:44:23.958 align:start position:0%
know more the the defense secretary hegi
 
06:44:28.150 --> 06:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
piece I'm very interested in uh if if he
 
06:44:30.510 --> 06:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
says something one way or the other way
 
06:44:33.548 --> 06:44:33.558 align:start position:0%
that matters of course it matters
 
06:44:37.270 --> 06:44:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh so somebody uh so I don't want to
 
06:44:40.510 --> 06:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
squal your straw pole except that that's
 
06:44:44.510 --> 06:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
UHA uh any other I I responded to
 
06:44:47.110 --> 06:44:47.120 align:start position:0%
anybody else uh representative Lloyd
 
06:44:50.030 --> 06:44:50.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um yes I in
 
06:44:52.510 --> 06:44:52.520 align:start position:0%
response to that question specifically I
 
06:44:55.070 --> 06:44:55.080 align:start position:0%
think that that is a holding point for
 
06:44:57.310 --> 06:44:57.320 align:start position:0%
me in particular because there are so
 
06:44:59.590 --> 06:44:59.600 align:start position:0%
many unknowns of whether or not this
 
06:45:01.708 --> 06:45:01.718 align:start position:0%
would have repercussions and I would
 
06:45:03.230 --> 06:45:03.240 align:start position:0%
just like to remind the committee and
 
06:45:06.750 --> 06:45:06.760 align:start position:0%
those watching online um that even
 
06:45:09.070 --> 06:45:09.080 align:start position:0%
though we're arguing about potential
 
06:45:11.270 --> 06:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal impacts and dollar signs and
 
06:45:14.070 --> 06:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
assets and things like that in my mind
 
06:45:16.270 --> 06:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
that also equates to saving lives
 
06:45:18.110 --> 06:45:18.120 align:start position:0%
because if I'm going to ask anybody to
 
06:45:20.628 --> 06:45:20.638 align:start position:0%
send their child overseas or if I'm
 
06:45:22.750 --> 06:45:22.760 align:start position:0%
going to ask anybody to fight on my
 
06:45:25.230 --> 06:45:25.240 align:start position:0%
behalf overseas I want to ensure that
 
06:45:28.230 --> 06:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
they have the the most advanced
 
06:45:31.868 --> 06:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
equipment the most defense possible for
 
06:45:33.990 --> 06:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
their own lives and the and the safety
 
06:45:37.990 --> 06:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
of their families um so I think that
 
06:45:41.868 --> 06:45:41.878 align:start position:0%
it's not as easy and cut and dry as uh
 
06:45:44.468 --> 06:45:44.478 align:start position:0%
this has this much fiscal note impact I
 
06:45:47.750 --> 06:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
think for me it's it's the peas Air
 
06:45:50.468 --> 06:45:50.478 align:start position:0%
Force Base aspect of things that's over
 
06:45:52.868 --> 06:45:52.878 align:start position:0%
10,000 civilian jobs if that were to
 
06:45:55.868 --> 06:45:55.878 align:start position:0%
shut down and several hundred businesses
 
06:45:58.150 --> 06:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
um and that would have a huge impact
 
06:46:00.788 --> 06:46:00.798 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire Alone um in
 
06:46:02.590 --> 06:46:02.600 align:start position:0%
addition to that losing any of the
 
06:46:05.270 --> 06:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
assets sets or any of the um the
 
06:46:08.868 --> 06:46:08.878 align:start position:0%
equipment or just even the funding for
 
06:46:11.430 --> 06:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
the proper equipment um would also
 
06:46:15.510 --> 06:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
impact lives as well and so the other
 
06:46:18.990 --> 06:46:19.000 align:start position:0%
piece of it is just even being able to
 
06:46:22.388 --> 06:46:22.398 align:start position:0%
allow our guard to more easily respond
 
06:46:24.910 --> 06:46:24.920 align:start position:0%
should our troops already overseas have
 
06:46:24.920 --> 06:46:26.270 align:start position:0%
should our troops already overseas have
an

06:46:26.270 --> 06:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
an
 
06:46:30.510 --> 06:46:30.520 align:start position:0%
have an adversary or an adversarial
 
06:46:33.270 --> 06:46:33.280 align:start position:0%
interaction having yet another who to
 
06:46:36.670 --> 06:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
jump through um in order to get them the
 
06:46:39.190 --> 06:46:39.200 align:start position:0%
the relief that they might need is also
 
06:46:41.030 --> 06:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
a concern for me so it's it's those
 
06:46:43.350 --> 06:46:43.360 align:start position:0%
types of things but I do think that
 
06:46:45.868 --> 06:46:45.878 align:start position:0%
retaining it would allow hopefully if
 
06:46:47.670 --> 06:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
another state passes this or other
 
06:46:50.670 --> 06:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
states have passed this and there are no
 
06:46:53.388 --> 06:46:53.398 align:start position:0%
are no repercussions coming down from
 
06:46:56.468 --> 06:46:56.478 align:start position:0%
like the national level um I would feel
 
06:46:58.388 --> 06:46:58.398 align:start position:0%
a little more comfortable with
 
06:47:01.310 --> 06:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you for that other other
 
06:47:03.670 --> 06:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
hands repres Hemingway who is a a a
 
06:47:05.750 --> 06:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
Guardsman correct a retired Guardsman
 
06:47:08.388 --> 06:47:08.398 align:start position:0%
yes Mr so please thank you Mr chairman
 
06:47:10.350 --> 06:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
um and just want to speak on that and
 
06:47:12.910 --> 06:47:12.920 align:start position:0%
I'll be brief because uh I know we're
 
06:47:16.070 --> 06:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
we're running on time but uh you said it
 
06:47:18.230 --> 06:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
to amend if five or more States or 10%
 
06:47:21.270 --> 06:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
of the states uh did that um I would say
 
06:47:23.230 --> 06:47:23.240 align:start position:0%
if that would happen within this year I
 
06:47:24.910 --> 06:47:24.920 align:start position:0%
probably still would not vote for it
 
06:47:27.030 --> 06:47:27.040 align:start position:0%
only because you still don't know what
 
06:47:28.788 --> 06:47:28.798 align:start position:0%
the ramifications are they already have
 
06:47:30.030 --> 06:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
their funding and the funding won't
 
06:47:31.990 --> 06:47:32.000 align:start position:0%
happen again until next year and we can
 
06:47:33.750 --> 06:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
say the congressman and and
 
06:47:36.468 --> 06:47:36.478 align:start position:0%
congresswomen uh wouldn't cut the
 
06:47:38.990 --> 06:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
funding but the funding goes to NGB NGB
 
06:47:41.030 --> 06:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
would be the one na the Guard Bureau
 
06:47:42.670 --> 06:47:42.680 align:start position:0%
would be the one that would say divvy
 
06:47:44.830 --> 06:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
out the funds uh one other thing is a
 
06:47:47.788 --> 06:47:47.798 align:start position:0%
peas was shut down and a Brack and is
 
06:47:50.670 --> 06:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
now an air guard unit so it is no longer
 
06:47:53.430 --> 06:47:53.440 align:start position:0%
an Air Force unit uh it was shut down
 
06:47:55.468 --> 06:47:55.478 align:start position:0%
with Brack and Brack is federal because
 
06:47:57.110 --> 06:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
Brack's not going to come in and grab a
 
06:47:59.350 --> 06:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
a National Guard unit and pull it away
 
06:48:02.468 --> 06:48:02.478 align:start position:0%
so Brack was the base realignment en
 
06:48:05.150 --> 06:48:05.160 align:start position:0%
Clos your committee when they could
 
06:48:07.468 --> 06:48:07.478 align:start position:0%
never close any bases they I think it
 
06:48:08.990 --> 06:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
was a good idea they created a
 
06:48:11.830 --> 06:48:11.840 align:start position:0%
commission to separately take the
 
06:48:13.388 --> 06:48:13.398 align:start position:0%
politics out of it largely and
 
06:48:15.590 --> 06:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
separately recommend base closures and P
 
06:48:17.628 --> 06:48:17.638 align:start position:0%
was one of the ones that was deemed as
 
06:48:20.510 --> 06:48:20.520 align:start position:0%
less necessary is an Air Force Base but
