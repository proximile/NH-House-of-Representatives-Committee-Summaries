Department come to me and they want me

to put in bills which I would have to
 
00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
say uh in this case I pretty much know
 
00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 align:start position:0%
what's going on with each of the liquor
 
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
bills whereas some of those banking
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
insurance I'm a little little foggy on
 
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:47.120 align:start position:0%
but uh but it's uh um important is that
 
00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh that yes we're we're uh dealing all
 
00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
these different issues um and I will say
 
00:06:55.869 --> 00:06:55.879 align:start position:0%
that uh you now have an amendment that
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
we just distributed and uh the story
 
00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 align:start position:0%
behind this amendment mment is that um
 
00:07:03.629 --> 00:07:03.639 align:start position:0%
this is an issue that came to my
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
attention right after we had to put in
 
00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.440 align:start position:0%
bills and we we the bill 1018 had a lot
 
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:14.440 align:start position:0%
had a lot of stuff already in it and so
 
00:07:16.150 --> 00:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
at that point we just decide that we'll
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
wait till now to actually introduce this
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
amendment but all of these all these
 
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:23.080 align:start position:0%
things you're going to hear today from
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
the commission with my name this is the
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
commission wants these bills so it's
 
00:07:31.230 --> 00:07:31.240 align:start position:0%
it's not um and it's not like their like
 
00:07:33.469 --> 00:07:33.479 align:start position:0%
this one Amendment which is technically
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
coming separately but it is something
 
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:36.840 align:start position:0%
that they these are all issues that
 
00:07:38.550 --> 00:07:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to deal with so good
 
00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:40.150 align:start position:0%

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
to keep the microphone right in your
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
mouth and uh and the best thing to do is
 
00:07:52.629 --> 00:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
go through the bill by section certainly
 
00:07:53.909 --> 00:07:53.919 align:start position:0%

00:07:55.790 --> 00:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
section two and just so everybody

00:08:08.149 --> 00:08:08.159 align:start position:0%
my name is Matthew Culver I'm a
 
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:09.840 align:start position:0%
lieutenant with the New Hampshire State
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission division of
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing over the
 
00:08:15.270 --> 00:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
course of the past few legislative
 
00:08:18.790 --> 00:08:18.800 align:start position:0%
sessions uh we've asked for um some
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
changes on uh certain statutes to
 
00:08:24.749 --> 00:08:24.759 align:start position:0%
provide Clarity for our industry members
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
and and Clarity for uh interpretation by
 
00:08:29.869 --> 00:08:29.879 align:start position:0%
the division
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a uh technical bill that
 
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
provides some of those clarities I'll go
 
00:08:39.829 --> 00:08:39.839 align:start position:0%
by uh through each of them paragraph by
 
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph So in number one paragraph
 
00:08:45.509 --> 00:08:45.519 align:start position:0%
number one uh pertaining to the
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
combination license in RSA
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
17818 it strikes out the words not
 
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:53.360 align:start position:0%
holding on premises licenses the full
 
00:08:55.269 --> 00:08:55.279 align:start position:0%
sentence there is off premises licenses
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
shall be issued only for groceries and
 
00:08:59.389 --> 00:08:59.399 align:start position:0%
drug stores not holding on premise Li
 
00:09:01.630 --> 00:09:01.640 align:start position:0%
licenses the reason for this change is
 
00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:03.800 align:start position:0%
title 13 currently has a license type
 
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
combination conditional license that
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
combines one or more license types the
 
00:09:11.829 --> 00:09:11.839 align:start position:0%
most frequent license types utilized
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
within this license is the combination
 
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
license which is an off- premise license
 
00:09:18.069 --> 00:09:18.079 align:start position:0%
and a restaurant license an on-premise
 
00:09:20.030 --> 00:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
license the recommended change
 
00:09:22.389 --> 00:09:22.399 align:start position:0%
eliminates the contradictory wording in
 
00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:24.949 align:start position:0%
eliminates the contradictory wording in
RSA

00:09:24.949 --> 00:09:24.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:29.560 align:start position:0%
17818 okay everybody follow that one
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
good paragraph number two is a change in
 
00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
the definitions um striking out off sale
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
and uh inserting off
 
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:42.240 align:start position:0%
premises the second is striking out on
 
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:45.760 align:start position:0%
sale and inserting on premises so this
 
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
would have been something that was in
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
the statute a long long time ago and we
 
00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
just never got around to correct and the
 
00:09:53.829 --> 00:09:53.839 align:start position:0%
1990 recodification probably Aiden
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
passed that you know when he was y when
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
he was Chief perfect now paragraph
 
00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:01.200 align:start position:0%
number three on premises cocktail lounge
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
licenses um is striking out the word
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
unaccessible and inserting inaccessible
 
00:10:09.389 --> 00:10:09.399 align:start position:0%
for a grammatic
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
change did you did you use uh the the
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
computer to come up with that
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
replacement after it was brought to my
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
attention several times yes I did Google
 
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.160 align:start position:0%
it and artificial intelligence help you
 
00:10:22.829 --> 00:10:22.839 align:start position:0%
out with that one exactly um number five
 
00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
is the same striking out unaccessible
 
00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:25.990 align:start position:0%
is the same striking out unaccessible
inserting

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
inserting
 
00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:30.640 align:start position:0%
inaccessible what number four was
 
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
Club okay got rid of
 
00:10:37.230 --> 00:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
the got rid of the word Club oh I'm
 
00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
sorry yes um striking out the word uh
 
00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
club for the rental
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
facilities okay if you guys really want
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
to have entertainment you want to look
 
00:10:49.310 --> 00:10:49.320 align:start position:0%
up how many different kinds of liquor
 
00:10:53.949 --> 00:10:53.959 align:start position:0%
licenses we have and uh and clubs Club
 
00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
did become confusing because we had
 
00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
different kinds of clubs so 54 to be
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
exact 54 54 so if you would say is well
 
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:05.560 align:start position:0%
why can't we simplify that why can't we
 
00:11:07.710 --> 00:11:07.720 align:start position:0%
make them different well because each
 
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
one each one that came in had a special
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
circumstance so either you create a
 
00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
separate license for it or you put them
 
00:11:17.389 --> 00:11:17.399 align:start position:0%
in the general license and say they're
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
eligible because of so you you don't
 
00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
save any words in the statute by doing
 
00:11:24.910 --> 00:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
it separately and it's a little easier
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
for us to actually have their own
 
00:11:30.910 --> 00:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
license number or license description
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
correct all right paragraph number five
 
00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
just to reiterate was striking out
 
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
unaccessible inserting inaccessible and
 
00:11:41.069 --> 00:11:41.079 align:start position:0%
paragraph number six is striking out
 
00:11:43.389 --> 00:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
distilling and inserting license to
 
00:11:46.310 --> 00:11:46.320 align:start position:0%
distill uh twice in the same
 
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.440 align:start position:0%
paragraph and the reasoning behind this
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
is through a recent legislative change
 
00:11:53.629 --> 00:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
in 2022 the licensing fees for the
 
00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
liquor manufacturer license was tiered
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
and the in the change uh in the liquor
 
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:01.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing statute who distilled a
 
00:12:04.269 --> 00:12:04.279 align:start position:0%
th000 cases or more per year would pay
 
00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
an annual license fee of692 and a liquor
 
00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
manufacturer distill less than th000
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
cases per year would pay an annual fee
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
of 300 the proposed change provides
 
00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
consisten were those fees again 1692 and
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
300 and 300 right 300 that was right for
 
00:12:24.269 --> 00:12:24.279 align:start position:0%
the low cheap the cheap one okay the
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
proposed change provides consistency
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
with the intended provisions of RSA 1786
 
00:12:32.230 --> 00:12:32.240 align:start position:0%
and RSA 17829 the fees
 
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.790 align:start position:0%
and RSA 17829 the fees
okay

00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:37.670 --> 00:12:37.680 align:start position:0%
great and I I assume you want to have
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement talk about this amendment
 
00:12:43.069 --> 00:12:43.079 align:start position:0%
Mark do you want to talk about this this
 
00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:52.629 --> 00:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
hookah liing we're putting it that's the
 
00:12:53.949 --> 00:12:53.959 align:start position:0%
reason why we put we're putting it in
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:12:57.350 --> 00:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you so Matt were you
 
00:12:58.430 --> 00:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
were prepared to talk about this a
 
00:13:00.910 --> 00:13:00.920 align:start position:0%
little bit I was yes oh okay I'm
 
00:13:04.750 --> 00:13:04.760 align:start position:0%
sorry go ahead Matt so the amendment uh
 
00:13:08.629 --> 00:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
that is before each of you now um it is
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
relative and many of you may remember um
 
00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:15.360 align:start position:0%
two legislative sessions ago we
 
00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
discussed the cigar bar this is
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
inserting the hookah lounge uh or hookah
 
00:13:26.990 --> 00:13:27.000 align:start position:0%
um criteria to be included in the um
 
00:13:29.949 --> 00:13:29.959 align:start position:0%
cigar bar and Cigar Bar related
 
00:13:33.350 --> 00:13:33.360 align:start position:0%
items into that definition so what this
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
will do will allow the businesses that
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
primarily operate as a hookah lounge to
 
00:13:41.470 --> 00:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
be able to be in compliance with the
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
cigar bar
 
00:13:45.670 --> 00:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
license okay so they still have all the
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
same requirements in terms of sales of
 
00:13:51.749 --> 00:13:51.759 align:start position:0%
non alcohol not alcohol but related to
 
00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:53.920 align:start position:0%
60% of the quarterly gross revenue will
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
be in cigar or cigar related products
 
00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
hookah is now incl included in the cigar
 
00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.670 align:start position:0%
hookah is now incl included in the cigar
related

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:14:02.910 --> 00:14:02.920 align:start position:0%
products and and the reality is they
 
00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:06.160 align:start position:0%
have been operating anyways but this
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
clarifies it and sets the ground rules
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
that's correct chairman yes uh and and
 
00:14:13.030 --> 00:14:13.040 align:start position:0%
we got a away Way by not creating a new
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
license because we're just no new
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
license we're just exping a current
 
00:14:16.959 --> 00:14:18.670 align:start position:0%
license we're just exping a current
license

00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:18.680 align:start position:0%
license
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay any questions from the
 
00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
committee members yes representative

smoke in a hookah because I don't know
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question and it's
 
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
shisha tobacco shisha tobacco what is
 
00:14:39.230 --> 00:14:39.240 align:start position:0%
shisha tobacco uh it's a it's a region
 
00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.310 align:start position:0%
shisha tobacco uh it's a it's a region
isn't

00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
isn't
 
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:45.160 align:start position:0%
it yeah it's it's U commonly uh utilized
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
by the middle eastern culture uh but
 
00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
it's a sticky form of tobacco that's
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
smoked in the hookah
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
pipe you get high on
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
no what it's made sticky with you better
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
not be I I don't believe that you can I
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
I believe there is some sort of um you
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
know equivalent to uh nicotine in it
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
some sort of
 
00:15:15.949 --> 00:15:15.959 align:start position:0%
stimulant okay representative
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
a thank you Mr chair um thank you for
 
00:15:22.509 --> 00:15:22.519 align:start position:0%
your testimony how does this uh
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment affect existing hookah bars uh
 
00:15:29.870 --> 00:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
what additional uh burdens does it place
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
on them if
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
any thank you for the question
 
00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
um we don't have a license type for
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
hookah bars so the the hookah the
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
establishments that primarily um operate
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
as a hookah lounge fall under the cigar
 
00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
bar license and that has been the issue
 
00:15:54.069 --> 00:15:54.079 align:start position:0%
those license uh types or those business
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
models have had a difficult time
 
00:15:59.309 --> 00:15:59.319 align:start position:0%
maintaining this 60% quarterly gross
 
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:01.160 align:start position:0%
revenue in cigar related products
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
because most of what they sell is hookah
 
00:16:07.509 --> 00:16:07.519 align:start position:0%
so this change includes the hookah into
 
00:16:09.990 --> 00:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
the cigar related products making it
 
00:16:12.790 --> 00:16:12.800 align:start position:0%
much easier for them to be in compliance
 
00:16:15.629 --> 00:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
with the statute yeah and as the sponsor
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
I could say they requested this this so
 
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
so we do have a card for them to speak
 
00:16:23.389 --> 00:16:23.399 align:start position:0%
to it yeah for the question and
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
representative uh the hookah the the
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
selling of hookah actually worked
 
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.749 align:start position:0%
selling of hookah actually worked
against

00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:16:32.629 --> 00:16:32.639 align:start position:0%
um the percentage so these
 
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:35.720 align:start position:0%
establishments were were getting audited
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
not frequently but frequent enough that
 
00:16:40.509 --> 00:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
it actually works to the positive not
 
00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.470 align:start position:0%
it actually works to the positive not
the

00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:16:45.389 --> 00:16:45.399 align:start position:0%
negative just followup question yep so
 
00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
does this incentivize hookah bars to
 
00:16:52.030 --> 00:16:52.040 align:start position:0%
also sell cigars and other tobacco
 
00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
products they can sell other um tobacco
 
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:00.560 align:start position:0%
products and uh yeah cigar related items
 
00:17:03.069 --> 00:17:03.079 align:start position:0%
they have been already all along
 
00:17:05.470 --> 00:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
correct meet the requirement right it's
 
00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:07.280 align:start position:0%
the cigar related products that go
 
00:17:08.270 --> 00:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
towards the
 
00:17:10.909 --> 00:17:10.919 align:start position:0%
60% um and as the chief said that is
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely correct anything else they
 
00:17:17.309 --> 00:17:17.319 align:start position:0%
sell whether it's a t-shirt or uh uh a
 
00:17:19.870 --> 00:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
soda that goes against their 60%
 
00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.029 align:start position:0%
soda that goes against their 60%
requirement

00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:17:25.549 --> 00:17:25.559 align:start position:0%
right okay yep representating M you any
 
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
any thought on the contents of the
 
00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:30.200 align:start position:0%
shisha pellets right so they're they're
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
basically pucks like that are compressed
 
00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:34.480 align:start position:0%
like you said a bit sticky and flavored
 
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:36.200 align:start position:0%
with all sorts of flavors correct and
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
one of them is about a pack of
 
00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:40.200 align:start position:0%
cigarettes roughly if you smoke the
 
00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
whole thing yourself which is uncommon
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
but it can you can put whatever you want
 
00:17:46.909 --> 00:17:46.919 align:start position:0%
in there so is there any any thought to
 
00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
discussing in here other additives that
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
may or may not be more or less
 
00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
harmful we have and thank you for the
 
00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:00.799 align:start position:0%
question uh we have not seen that in our
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
hookah lounges uh currently um any other
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
product being utilized in those um so
 
00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.230 align:start position:0%
product being utilized in those um so
that

00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:18:13.149 --> 00:18:13.159 align:start position:0%
that is not something that um we are
 
00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:16.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
now okay representative
 
00:18:23.149 --> 00:18:23.159 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair just out of
 
00:18:23.159 --> 00:18:24.789 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair just out of
curiosity

00:18:24.789 --> 00:18:24.799 align:start position:0%
curiosity
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
but what is the point of not allowing
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:37.310 --> 00:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
bar I think it goes back to the indoor
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
smoking act um and prohibiting the the
 
00:18:43.110 --> 00:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
cigarette smoking um that is an item
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
that was discussed in this committee a
 
00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
couple sessions ago uh but uh that's
 
00:18:50.990 --> 00:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
what it is pertaining to directly
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
correct that is the
 
00:18:57.350 --> 00:18:57.360 align:start position:0%
history okay so yes Chief did you say
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%

representative um what we're looking at
 
00:19:13.630 --> 00:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
is hookah for what it is and if it's an
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
adulterated product that isn't uh in its
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
in its purest form what it is then then
 
00:19:23.470 --> 00:19:23.480 align:start position:0%
we will be looking at that as a
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
violation but thank you for your
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%

okay very and I have with me written
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
testimony from the NASA National hookah
 
00:21:16.149 --> 00:21:16.159 align:start position:0%
Community Association so I will leave
 
00:21:20.470 --> 00:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
that with you um we are here in support
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
of the amendment and we encourage you to
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
pass or recommend uh 18 1018 as a Ed um
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
we think that this is a good opportunity
 
00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
to Simply clarify the law uh the hookah
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
lounges have been operating in a bit of
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
a gray area as you've heard and
 
00:21:43.350 --> 00:21:43.360 align:start position:0%
clarifying that 60% of their quarterly
 
00:21:45.430 --> 00:21:45.440 align:start position:0%
Revenue shall come from the sale of
 
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
hookah or cigars will give them a
 
00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:51.480 align:start position:0%
regulatory construct with which they can
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
comply um I should also mention that in
 
00:21:56.990 --> 00:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment there is a provision that
 
00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:00.200 align:start position:0%
the hookah lounge would comply with what
 
00:22:02.710 --> 00:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
I'll refer to as last call imposed on
 
00:22:05.789 --> 00:22:05.799 align:start position:0%
any uh business is selling liquor so
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
that is new and hasn't been in law to
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
date um in general this will give
 
00:22:15.710 --> 00:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
everybody I think more regulatory uh
 
00:22:17.789 --> 00:22:17.799 align:start position:0%
certainty if not certainty
 
00:22:20.510 --> 00:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
predictability and um with that I'm
 
00:22:23.029 --> 00:22:23.039 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions and
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:29.110 --> 00:22:29.120 align:start position:0%
consideration represent Bros this is
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
just a curiosity question how
 
00:22:33.430 --> 00:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
carcinogenic are the um inhaling the
 
00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
Hookah Smoke do you know the total
 
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
product is as I understand it 15%
 
00:22:42.029 --> 00:22:42.039 align:start position:0%
tobacco and I don't know how that
 
00:22:46.029 --> 00:22:46.039 align:start position:0%
translates to how cars is but it is FDA
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
sure okay great thank you for your time
 
00:22:54.200 --> 00:22:54.909 align:start position:0%

and

00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:22:57.269 --> 00:22:57.279 align:start position:0%
consideration anybody else would like to
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh speak on House Bill
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
10:18 seeing none close the public
 
00:23:05.070 --> 00:23:05.080 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
1018 oh so I I gotta have a system Chris
 
00:23:11.830 --> 00:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
I'm getting the blue
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
more is there a typo in that in that
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill or this some I was going to ask the
 
00:23:30.909 --> 00:23:30.919 align:start position:0%
question on line line 30 or do I just
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:45.310 --> 00:23:45.320 align:start position:0%
means uh what what are you looking at
 
00:23:48.470 --> 00:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
just so Matt Matt
 
00:23:52.149 --> 00:23:52.159 align:start position:0%
knows where where do you see this in the
 
00:23:52.159 --> 00:23:53.710 align:start position:0%
knows where where do you see this in the
amendment

00:23:53.710 --> 00:23:53.720 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
00:23:56.549 --> 00:23:56.559 align:start position:0%
okay in the amendment and what where
 
00:24:00.190 --> 00:24:00.200 align:start position:0%
what line line
 
00:24:04.269 --> 00:24:04.279 align:start position:0%
30 oh no Z of exposure yeah do where did
 
00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
that Z come
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
from Martin do you know where the Z came
 
00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.149 --> 00:24:19.159 align:start position:0%
0110 no ounce of exposure no z z of
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
exposure but not limit to an increased
 
00:24:23.029 --> 00:24:23.039 align:start position:0%
risk of cancer and heart disease and
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
that no Z of exposure to second no
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:32.669 --> 00:24:32.679 align:start position:0%
yeah so what what's what's why is the Z
 
00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
computer filling filling in the blank I
 
00:24:40.590 --> 00:24:40.600 align:start position:0%
believe that there's a typo that I might
 
00:24:42.110 --> 00:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
not have caught when I reviewed the
 
00:24:45.190 --> 00:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
language okay um the last sentence of
 
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
Roman 4 is and that no level of exposure
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
to secondhand exposure so that must be
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
the Greek word for
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
level Greek
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:58.269 align:start position:0%
level Greek
letter

00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:25:02.549 --> 00:25:02.559 align:start position:0%
level okay great all right thank you
 
00:25:02.559 --> 00:25:03.950 align:start position:0%
level okay great all right thank you
thank

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
thank
you

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:26.679 --> 00:25:29.549 align:start position:0%
 
1076

00:25:29.549 --> 00:25:29.559 align:start position:0%
1076
 
00:25:35.470 --> 00:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
sir all set
 
00:25:41.510 --> 00:25:41.520 align:start position:0%
yep thank you Mr chairman uh the intent
 
00:25:43.230 --> 00:25:43.240 align:start position:0%
of uh Bill
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
1076 is to allow the wine manufacturer
 
00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:53.200 align:start position:0%
to uh hold their uh one on premises
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
license either on the premises of the
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility
 
00:26:01.549 --> 00:26:01.559 align:start position:0%
or on the premises of their wine uh
 
00:26:05.630 --> 00:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
outlet the intent on this bill is
 
00:26:13.350 --> 00:26:13.360 align:start position:0%
because there are circumstances with the
 
00:26:15.350 --> 00:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
wine manufacturers that have their
 
00:26:18.350 --> 00:26:18.360 align:start position:0%
location on premises that may not be
 
00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
suitable to have a restaurant there so
 
00:26:25.350 --> 00:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
this would expand if they're allowed to
 
00:26:27.669 --> 00:26:27.679 align:start position:0%
have one on premise license if they're
 
00:26:29.389 --> 00:26:29.399 align:start position:0%
allowed to have a wine manufacturer
 
00:26:31.789 --> 00:26:31.799 align:start position:0%
retail outlet they could either have
 
00:26:33.590 --> 00:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
their one on premise at their
 
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:36.200 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or at their
 
00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.430 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or at their
retail

00:26:41.430 --> 00:26:41.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:44.269 --> 00:26:44.279 align:start position:0%
outlet and this was request by there was
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
some by an industry member yes yeah
 
00:26:47.990 --> 00:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
there was an industry one manufacturer
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
that wanted to correct have have this so
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
just to jog people's memory um several
 
00:26:57.310 --> 00:26:57.320 align:start position:0%
years ago we passed allow a uh beverage
 
00:26:59.269 --> 00:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
Manu manufacturer and wine manufacturer
 
00:27:02.549 --> 00:27:02.559 align:start position:0%
to have a separate
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
facility um and uh I guess the not sure
 
00:27:08.669 --> 00:27:08.679 align:start position:0%
we mentioned names or not but there's a
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
certain wine manufacturer that's right
 
00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
on 101 and that uh
 
00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
had and um and but but that is an on-
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
premise leny anyways that location she
 
00:27:22.470 --> 00:27:22.480 align:start position:0%
hers but she did have they they did have
 
00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:25.799 align:start position:0%
another location at a mall to sell their
 
00:27:28.430 --> 00:27:28.440 align:start position:0%
wine uh but in this case it's now its
 
00:27:31.149 --> 00:27:31.159 align:start position:0%
reversed the person uh doesn't want to
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
have that arm premise license at their
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
actual location they want to do it at
 
00:27:39.149 --> 00:27:39.159 align:start position:0%
their so-called retail location
 
00:27:40.830 --> 00:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
theoretically the retail location is
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
more located for retail activity and
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
therefore U more apt to have a
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
successful on premise
 
00:27:52.710 --> 00:27:52.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant yes representative pusi thank
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
you chairman H uh question this says or
 
00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:01.240 align:start position:0%
does this allow the manufacturer to have
 
00:28:06.190 --> 00:28:06.200 align:start position:0%
one on premise and one at the retail
 
00:28:08.389 --> 00:28:08.399 align:start position:0%
location thank you for the question
 
00:28:11.029 --> 00:28:11.039 align:start position:0%
representative they are allowed one on
 
00:28:14.870 --> 00:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
premises license so that
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
license could be on the premises of
 
00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:20.080 align:start position:0%
their manufacturing facility or the
 
00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:23.000 align:start position:0%
premises of their uh retail there but
 
00:28:24.909 --> 00:28:24.919 align:start position:0%
they're only getting one they only can
 
00:28:28.230 --> 00:28:28.240 align:start position:0%
have one per statute further further
 
00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
question inquire thank you U Mr chair
 
00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
would would this prohibit a manufacture
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
from having a second license say if they
 
00:28:42.669 --> 00:28:42.679 align:start position:0%
have a a manufacturing facility in the
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
answer is yes it would Pro it would
 
00:28:48.190 --> 00:28:48.200 align:start position:0%
prohibit it thank you
 
00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:50.840 align:start position:0%
so so and I guess the other thing I I
 
00:28:53.190 --> 00:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
want to just talk everybody's memory
 
00:28:55.470 --> 00:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
where this all comes back to was the
 
00:28:59.350 --> 00:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
concept that we were a three tier State
 
00:29:01.909 --> 00:29:01.919 align:start position:0%
and that meant that if you were a
 
00:29:07.070 --> 00:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturer you would not be a
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
retailer okay and yes we we have chipped
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
away at that three tier statute uh and
 
00:29:18.509 --> 00:29:18.519 align:start position:0%
the most famous obviously was brew pubs
 
00:29:20.509 --> 00:29:20.519 align:start position:0%
uh but this is just a little bit to
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
allow the manufacturers then we allow
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to be able to sell at
 
00:29:26.830 --> 00:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
their location and then this is the next
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
step is which is to allow them to have
 
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
an on- premise license which
 
00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
theoretically if we were True Believers
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
of the three tier we would never have
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
allowed that in the first
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
place represent B yes uh thank you for
 
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
taking my question in the case of leel
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
Winery they're in uh Bedford and I think
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
that's where they produce their wines
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
and they so this bill doesn't affect
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
them it doesn't because they are they're
 
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
are there it's there on premise right
 
00:29:56.350 --> 00:29:56.360 align:start position:0%
but they also have several other
 
00:30:00.710 --> 00:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
facilities where they do they own a
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
facility where they sell their wines
 
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
correct so well one they can only have
 
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
one I don't they have a few one license
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
more than one place yeah oh okay so
 
00:30:16.149 --> 00:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
how does that happen so if a leny were
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
to have multiple uh wine manufacturing
 
00:30:22.509 --> 00:30:22.519 align:start position:0%
facilities they can already retail sell
 
00:30:24.630 --> 00:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
at their wine manufacturer facility
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
without utilizing their wine
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer retail app
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
out right because she has more than one
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
wine rate licensed as a wine
 
00:30:32.799 --> 00:30:34.750 align:start position:0%
wine rate licensed as a wine
manufacturer

00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
yes okay have we confused you all
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
yet uh thank you Mr chairman I'm I'm
 
00:30:44.310 --> 00:30:44.320 align:start position:0%
guessing that the reason for just one
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
license is to limit the the how much
 
00:30:50.110 --> 00:30:50.120 align:start position:0%
their production is is that
 
00:30:53.389 --> 00:30:53.399 align:start position:0%
correct no it's just because we had this
 
00:30:55.710 --> 00:30:55.720 align:start position:0%
we had we've always said that we were a
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
three tier State and so we were we were
 
00:31:00.509 --> 00:31:00.519 align:start position:0%
reluctantly allowing them to have this
 
00:31:03.590 --> 00:31:03.600 align:start position:0%
other retail location and mainly because
 
00:31:07.149 --> 00:31:07.159 align:start position:0%
if if theoretically uh I would say not
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
so much for wine but certainly for uh a
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturer the facility might
 
00:31:15.269 --> 00:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
be located in an industrial Zone and
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
really not appropriate for a retail like
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
location and so the rationale was that
 
00:31:22.750 --> 00:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
yes if they want to have a retail
 
00:31:26.269 --> 00:31:26.279 align:start position:0%
location that's in a mall you know down
 
00:31:28.029 --> 00:31:28.039 align:start position:0%
stre um
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
at that time we we were telling them no
 
00:31:33.470 --> 00:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
they had to make beer in the mall and
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
that seemed a little uh awkward and
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
cumbersome and probably inappropriate
 
00:31:39.509 --> 00:31:39.519 align:start position:0%
and that's when we decide to allow them
 
00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:48.669 --> 00:31:48.679 align:start position:0%
you oh representative Gibbs I'm sorry
 
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just to be sure I
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
understand um you would allow uh the
 
00:31:59.149 --> 00:31:59.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to sell for on premises
 
00:32:01.629 --> 00:32:01.639 align:start position:0%
consumption only in one
 
00:32:03.590 --> 00:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
place that is either in the
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or in a retail
 
00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:07.269 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility or in a retail
location

00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:32:10.029 --> 00:32:10.039 align:start position:0%
or just one place no matter how many
 
00:32:12.149 --> 00:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
locations they might actually
 
00:32:14.110 --> 00:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
own thank you for the question
 
00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
representative and that is correct yes
 
00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
they're only allowed by Statute one on
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
premises license thank you right but to
 
00:32:23.669 --> 00:32:23.679 align:start position:0%
make sure we everybody understands they
 
00:32:26.909 --> 00:32:26.919 align:start position:0%
can sell you know samples and sell and
 
00:32:30.389 --> 00:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
do in both locations but the key element
 
00:32:32.870 --> 00:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
the on premise location has that whole
 
00:32:36.590 --> 00:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
other extend which is food and it's a
 
00:32:38.269 --> 00:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
restaurant license it's a restaurant
 
00:32:40.029 --> 00:32:40.039 align:start position:0%
license remember when you're an on
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
premise you're a restaurant off premise
 
00:32:52.909 --> 00:32:52.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:55.720 align:start position:0%
store um thank you for taking this
 
00:32:57.950 --> 00:32:57.960 align:start position:0%
followup I still don't understand how
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
leel can have several onsite restaurants
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
cities for her for the situation with
 
00:33:13.950 --> 00:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
leel specifically I would have to review
 
00:33:15.990 --> 00:33:16.000 align:start position:0%
her licensing file to see how that
 
00:33:20.269 --> 00:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
structure is set up but um generally
 
00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
speaking per manufacturing license
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
you're allowed the one on premises
 
00:33:27.549 --> 00:33:27.559 align:start position:0%
license so her those facili would have
 
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
to be independently licensed as
 
00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:33.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers yeah so okay I know the
 
00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:35.720 align:start position:0%
one on amher is where's the other one
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
tusin Village tusin village dery tusin
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
Village and dairy now do they have
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
Vineyards there yes okay so basically
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
they have two different manufacturing
 
00:33:50.710 --> 00:33:50.720 align:start position:0%
sites so that doubles the lenser PO
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
possibilities for them do they distill
 
00:33:56.029 --> 00:33:56.039 align:start position:0%
so that no no they're Winery I mean not
 
00:33:58.629 --> 00:33:58.639 align:start position:0%
distill but do they wi they make wine
 
00:34:01.149 --> 00:34:01.159 align:start position:0%
make wine and dairy yes they do okay
 
00:34:03.430 --> 00:34:03.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and I know I know I've seen the
 
00:34:05.389 --> 00:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
wine making they do in ammer so that
 
00:34:06.830 --> 00:34:06.840 align:start position:0%
that means they're making wine in both
 
00:34:08.669 --> 00:34:08.679 align:start position:0%
locations that means they could
 
00:34:11.909 --> 00:34:11.919 align:start position:0%
theoretically have well four
 
00:34:14.669 --> 00:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
locations no you're right because excuse
 
00:34:17.950 --> 00:34:17.960 align:start position:0%
me she has a Vineyard in Dairy but I
 
00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:21.760 align:start position:0%
don't think she actually makes wine I
 
00:34:24.149 --> 00:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
think it goes back to ammer I think she
 
00:34:26.550 --> 00:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
takes it right no cuz there's no in that
 
00:34:26.560 --> 00:34:27.829 align:start position:0%
takes it right no cuz there's no in that
fac

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
fac
 
00:34:29.750 --> 00:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
I know that building it's right it's
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
four miles from my house well maybe we
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
just need to have a road trip to go
 
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.990 align:start position:0%
just need to have a road trip to go
visit

00:34:34.990 --> 00:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
visit
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
facilities yeah and I I don't even think
 
00:34:43.510 --> 00:34:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
exactly I
 
00:34:51.270 --> 00:34:51.280 align:start position:0%
okay let's not pick on one of our Port
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who we want to be
 
00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:55.869 align:start position:0%
manufacturers who we want to be
supportive

00:34:55.869 --> 00:34:55.879 align:start position:0%
supportive
 
00:34:59.430 --> 00:34:59.440 align:start position:0%
of okay so do you have a question
 
00:35:01.670 --> 00:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
representing W
 
00:35:06.030 --> 00:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
yes she has a like a little store this
 
00:35:09.109 --> 00:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
would you believe okay would you believe
 
00:35:12.790 --> 00:35:12.800 align:start position:0%
that a certain Winery four miles from my
 
00:35:18.069 --> 00:35:18.079 align:start position:0%
house has a little store there
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
so does she need a
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
license does she need two licenses or is
 
00:35:26.069 --> 00:35:26.079 align:start position:0%
she not allowed to get any Beverage Wine
 
00:35:29.069 --> 00:35:29.079 align:start position:0%
anybody you know any manufacturer is
 
00:35:32.910 --> 00:35:32.920 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell their product at the
 
00:35:36.430 --> 00:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
location and that goes back to flag Hill
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
was the first one where he was making uh
 
00:35:42.310 --> 00:35:42.320 align:start position:0%
John Stark vodka and how embarrassing
 
00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
was that this is probably when you were
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
back you on the committee when back then
 
00:35:48.230 --> 00:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
that when when that that he said you
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
know kind of ridiculous people come in
 
00:35:51.910 --> 00:35:51.920 align:start position:0%
and do a tasting but I can't sell it to
 
00:35:53.109 --> 00:35:53.119 align:start position:0%
them I got to send them to a liquor
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
store to buy it and that's how we
 
00:35:59.870 --> 00:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
trampled on the three tier system way
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
back when some of us did make a field
 
00:36:05.550 --> 00:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
trip to flag Hill just personally
 
00:36:07.710 --> 00:36:07.720 align:start position:0%
inspected well this was good this is a
 
00:36:10.270 --> 00:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
good get everybody understanding the the
 
00:36:13.030 --> 00:36:13.040 align:start position:0%
nuances of our and as you can see it's
 
00:36:15.990 --> 00:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
the consequence of each action you make
 
00:36:19.150 --> 00:36:19.160 align:start position:0%
has has a you know uh trickle down
 
00:36:21.790 --> 00:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
effect you know a domino effect that how
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
we affect it but all of it is is and I I
 
00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:26.520 align:start position:0%
look at Scott when I say this that all
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
of this is the the trampling on the
 
00:36:33.030 --> 00:36:33.040 align:start position:0%
three tier tier concept yes so and there
 
00:36:35.710 --> 00:36:35.720 align:start position:0%
will be more of that later we still
 
00:36:37.790 --> 00:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
cutting some more
 
00:36:40.670 --> 00:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
here okay how are we doing and anybody
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
sign in on the blue sheet okay waved off
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
on that all right we'll close the public
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
so um Aiden and and Matt can you guys
 
00:37:15.390 --> 00:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
just fill out a card just so we can have
 
00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:18.040 align:start position:0%
in the files when if somebody were able
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.599 --> 00:37:27.230 align:start position:0%
 
people

00:37:27.230 --> 00:37:27.240 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:36.150 align:start position:0%

00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:38:06.150 align:start position:0%
 
build

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
sticking in the each bill so that so
 
00:38:13.550 --> 00:38:13.560 align:start position:0%
that right well for because you were
 
00:38:15.790 --> 00:38:15.800 align:start position:0%
testifying on these bills so
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
theoretically if someone would open the
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
folder they say who were these people so
 
00:38:23.589 --> 00:38:23.599 align:start position:0%
if you both fill out a card right but
 
00:38:25.270 --> 00:38:25.280 align:start position:0%
you actually you could I think you could
 
00:38:28.109 --> 00:38:28.119 align:start position:0%
put both your names on one card that is
 
00:38:32.270 --> 00:38:32.280 align:start position:0%
true we we have seen that happen okay
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:54.630 --> 00:38:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.190 --> 00:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:06.839 align:start position:0%
good morning again good morning chairman
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
and thank you uh House Bill
 
00:39:14.309 --> 00:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
1358 uh it it in
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
concept is a bill that combines uh the
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturing and tenant
 
00:39:27.589 --> 00:39:27.599 align:start position:0%
manufacturing that is currently set up
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
in the beverage side of the house for
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
the wine manufacturers and liquor
 
00:39:36.309 --> 00:39:36.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturers so it's taking the
 
00:39:37.829 --> 00:39:37.839 align:start position:0%
concepts of the
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
tenant uh Brewing changing that to
 
00:39:41.280 --> 00:39:43.470 align:start position:0%
tenant uh Brewing changing that to
tenant

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480 align:start position:0%
tenant
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturing as well as the
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
contract Brewing changing that to
 
00:39:51.870 --> 00:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
contract manufacturing for all of the
 
00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing licenses the liquor
 
00:39:57.069 --> 00:39:57.079 align:start position:0%
manufacturers the wine manufacturers
 
00:40:00.309 --> 00:40:00.319 align:start position:0%
and the beverage manufacturers making
 
00:40:02.349 --> 00:40:02.359 align:start position:0%
all of those
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
consistent um there is an immense amount
 
00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:06.510 align:start position:0%
consistent um there is an immense amount
of

00:40:06.510 --> 00:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:10.200 align:start position:0%
complexity um in this bill with all of
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
the name changes we have been in touch
 
00:40:15.510 --> 00:40:15.520 align:start position:0%
with our industry partners and the New
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire beverage
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
Association uh who this week has
 
00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:21.400 align:start position:0%
provided us with some
 
00:40:23.270 --> 00:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
information um about some
 
00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
recommendations to the language in this
 
00:40:28.550 --> 00:40:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh certainly this bill were to go to
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee uh we would be in touch
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
with them and devise some or tighten up
 
00:40:37.190 --> 00:40:37.200 align:start position:0%
any uh holes in the language that exists
 
00:40:39.630 --> 00:40:39.640 align:start position:0%
now yes so I want don't to describe what
 
00:40:41.069 --> 00:40:41.079 align:start position:0%
the purpose what's the problem we're
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
trying to solve here what is say so with
 
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:48.109 align:start position:0%
trying to solve here what is say so with
contract

00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:40:48.119 --> 00:40:50.349 align:start position:0%
contract
Brewing

00:40:50.349 --> 00:40:50.359 align:start position:0%
Brewing
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
is most simply explained by I have a
 
00:40:57.550 --> 00:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
recipe in and I'm bringing it to your
 
00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facility for you to make
 
00:41:03.030 --> 00:41:03.040 align:start position:0%
that recipe tenant Brewing otherwise
 
00:41:05.589 --> 00:41:05.599 align:start position:0%
known as an alternating proprietorship
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
or alt prop in the federal system is
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
that I don't have a facility so I'm
 
00:41:15.589 --> 00:41:15.599 align:start position:0%
leasing your facility to make my own
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
product I'm using your own your
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
equipment to make my product now this
 
00:41:23.870 --> 00:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
has been attractive because of the the M
 
00:41:28.589 --> 00:41:28.599 align:start position:0%
uh um startup cost of some of these
 
00:41:31.069 --> 00:41:31.079 align:start position:0%
breweries or wine manufacturing liquor
 
00:41:33.309 --> 00:41:33.319 align:start position:0%
manufacturing facilities they can share
 
00:41:35.670 --> 00:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
the equipment in some instances at least
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
one with on the brewery side we've had
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh a ly not necessarily share equipment
 
00:41:45.109 --> 00:41:45.119 align:start position:0%
but they share space they have their own
 
00:41:48.109 --> 00:41:48.119 align:start position:0%
equipment but they share one General
 
00:41:51.349 --> 00:41:51.359 align:start position:0%
location this concept of the contract
 
00:41:53.470 --> 00:41:53.480 align:start position:0%
and tenant has never been applied to the
 
00:41:57.190 --> 00:41:57.200 align:start position:0%
liquor or wine manufacturers the intent
 
00:42:01.309 --> 00:42:01.319 align:start position:0%
of this bill is to allow the same thing
 
00:42:02.670 --> 00:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
for the liquor manufacturers and the
 
00:42:05.470 --> 00:42:05.480 align:start position:0%
wine manufacturers as we do for the
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
Brewers again it's complex and uh
 
00:42:13.390 --> 00:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.030 --> 00:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
bill this is the one that Brian Ferguson
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
called me on is that uh I believe Mr
 
00:42:24.630 --> 00:42:24.640 align:start position:0%
Ferguson had some issu concerns concerns
 
00:42:27.150 --> 00:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
so yes he called me as well well I well
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
I sent him to i s them on you well thank
 
00:42:31.230 --> 00:42:31.240 align:start position:0%
you and I have not had the opportunity
 
00:42:33.870 --> 00:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
to speak to oh to see what we have make
 
00:42:35.790 --> 00:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
sure address okay so this might this
 
00:42:37.270 --> 00:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
theoretically is going to get amended
 
00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:38.920 align:start position:0%
then when we get to sub commit I believe
 
00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:42.280 align:start position:0%
it is going to yes chman okay yeah okay
 
00:42:45.349 --> 00:42:45.359 align:start position:0%
so I can you you guys know how I like to
 
00:42:48.710 --> 00:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
tell a story so my f most famous story
 
00:42:52.750 --> 00:42:52.760 align:start position:0%
is that uh many many many many moths
 
00:42:56.829 --> 00:42:56.839 align:start position:0%
ago when um Mr kooch from uh who had had
 
00:43:00.190 --> 00:43:00.200 align:start position:0%
this his grandfather's recipe to make an
 
00:43:04.829 --> 00:43:04.839 align:start position:0%
ale and wanted to start Sam Adams ale um
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
he had no facility as a matter of fact
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
he was never in the beverage business to
 
00:43:13.790 --> 00:43:13.800 align:start position:0%
begin with and so he needed someone to
 
00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
contract Brew now here I am in going to
 
00:43:20.109 --> 00:43:20.119 align:start position:0%
college in Boston University and lone
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
behle I I'm looking at my very first
 
00:43:24.190 --> 00:43:24.200 align:start position:0%
bottle of Sam Adams and what does it say
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
on it brewed in Pittsburgh
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania and what happened well he
 
00:43:32.829 --> 00:43:32.839 align:start position:0%
his initial contract and I I've read his
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
book cuz he I got an autograph coffee of
 
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
his book uh but uh in he does talk about
 
00:43:41.710 --> 00:43:41.720 align:start position:0%
how um he to he went shopping for a
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
tenant Brewer to make the original Sam
 
00:43:47.710 --> 00:43:47.720 align:start position:0%
Adams so it Sam Adams is actually Iron
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
City Light Iron City beer but uh in
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
using that
 
00:43:56.589 --> 00:43:56.599 align:start position:0%
facility okay any question
 
00:43:59.309 --> 00:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
questions Mr chairman I I I know that
 
00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:00.960 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Brewers Association
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
sent an email this morning with
 
00:44:04.549 --> 00:44:04.559 align:start position:0%
testimony I'm not sure that that was
 
00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
received or not but um that's included
 
00:44:10.990 --> 00:44:11.000 align:start position:0%
in here as well okay all right any
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
questions committee
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
members as you can see all of this is
 
00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
enabling legislation to allow to uh to
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
do expand what these these companies
 
00:44:24.670 --> 00:44:24.680 align:start position:0%
these uh manufacturers and we have so
 
00:44:26.309 --> 00:44:26.319 align:start position:0%
many different kinds of manufacturers so
 
00:44:29.470 --> 00:44:29.480 align:start position:0%
is it gets complicated as we move along
 
00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:31.190 align:start position:0%
is it gets complicated as we move along
here

00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay and last but not least we have Brew
 
00:44:36.359 --> 00:44:37.790 align:start position:0%
okay and last but not least we have Brew
brew

00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
brew
 
00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:54.950 align:start position:0%
brew
PBS

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:45:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.589 --> 00:45:08.599 align:start position:0%
minutes ahead of
 
00:45:08.599 --> 00:45:10.750 align:start position:0%
minutes ahead of
our

00:45:10.750 --> 00:45:10.760 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:54.870 align:start position:0%
 
yourselves

00:45:54.870 --> 00:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:54.880 --> 00:46:17.790 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:46:17.790 --> 00:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.950 --> 00:46:19.960 align:start position:0%
so why restrict the hours in the hooker
 
00:46:21.829 --> 00:46:21.839 align:start position:0%
lodes I can tell you that I've been
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
driving around 3:00 in the morning to
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
Manchester and that
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
packed that
 
00:46:31.589 --> 00:46:31.599 align:start position:0%
pack where where's Lo loue on Valley you
 
00:46:33.950 --> 00:46:33.960 align:start position:0%
know the the martial arts
 
00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:36.470 align:start position:0%
know the the martial arts
places

00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:46:40.589 --> 00:46:40.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.829 align:start position:0%
 
they

00:46:58.829 --> 00:46:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:24.720 --> 00:59:35.470 align:start position:0%
 
I

00:59:35.470 --> 00:59:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
okay so as I said before the original
 
00:59:41.190 --> 00:59:41.200 align:start position:0%
tramping on the three- tier system was
 
00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:42.589 align:start position:0%
tramping on the three- tier system was
the

00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:59:45.630 --> 00:59:45.640 align:start position:0%
brub and now they're not
 
00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
done so why don't you explain this one
 
00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:49.789 align:start position:0%
done so why don't you explain this one
to

00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:52.270 --> 00:59:52.280 align:start position:0%

1380 uh affects the Brew Pub license and

uh RSA 178 colon 13 by inserting a new
 
01:00:07.990 --> 01:00:08.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph in that
 
01:00:10.230 --> 01:00:10.240 align:start position:0%
license uh which reads nothing in this
 
01:00:11.829 --> 01:00:11.839 align:start position:0%

retailer

01:00:38.990 --> 01:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
01:00:44.349 --> 01:00:44.359 align:start position:0%
this um language uh was a a collective
 
01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
um work group between the New Hampshire
 
01:00:48.589 --> 01:00:48.599 align:start position:0%
Brewers Association the Restaurant
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
loding Association and um the division
 
01:00:55.789 --> 01:00:55.799 align:start position:0%
of enforcement to um
 
01:00:58.630 --> 01:00:58.640 align:start position:0%
expand upon the Privileges of of the
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
Brew Pub license what the issue has been
 
01:01:04.390 --> 01:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
in a uh I'm sure the New Hampshire
 
01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
restaurant Lodging Association is is
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
here and they will uh testify to this
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
but um one of their constituents uh has
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
um had
 
01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
a uh several restaurant licenses
 
01:01:19.309 --> 01:01:19.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
01:01:24.109 --> 01:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
state um and the idea behind this is to
 
01:01:27.829 --> 01:01:27.839 align:start position:0%
have the ability for a brew pub license
 
01:01:30.270 --> 01:01:30.280 align:start position:0%
which by Statute is considered a
 
01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.670 align:start position:0%
which by Statute is considered a
manufacturing

01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
01:01:35.109 --> 01:01:35.119 align:start position:0%
license um integrated with the on
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
premise restaurant licenses now as uh
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
chairman hunt has
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
explained um there's a a couple concerns
 
01:01:48.230 --> 01:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
in this with RSA 17911 and the
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
prohibited interest and that is the
 
01:01:53.029 --> 01:01:53.039 align:start position:0%
whole three tier system but in of in it
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
of itself The Brew public license you
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
have to have a restaurant license in
 
01:02:00.269 --> 01:02:00.279 align:start position:0%
order to have a brew pub license it's
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
integrated within that license type so
 
01:02:04.990 --> 01:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
you're a you're considered a
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and you're considered a
 
01:02:09.230 --> 01:02:09.240 align:start position:0%
restaurant you're no more of a
 
01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:11.279 align:start position:0%
manufacturer than you are a
 
01:02:13.109 --> 01:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
restaurant and that is what
 
01:02:15.150 --> 01:02:15.160 align:start position:0%
representative Hunt is is referring to
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
in the three- tier system you're taking
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
two of the tiers and combining them
 
01:02:19.880 --> 01:02:21.789 align:start position:0%
two of the tiers and combining them
together

01:02:21.789 --> 01:02:21.799 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:02:25.870 --> 01:02:25.880 align:start position:0%
now for the purposes of
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
um the issue at hand here what was
 
01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:31.720 align:start position:0%
happening in the industry is
 
01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:35.960 align:start position:0%
that lenes who had multiple on premise
 
01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:39.799 align:start position:0%
licenses could not get a brew pub
 
01:02:42.230 --> 01:02:42.240 align:start position:0%
license because it would be considered
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
crossing the tier um in a violation of
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
17911 this expands that by
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
allowing those lenses the on premise
 
01:02:57.349 --> 01:02:57.359 align:start position:0%
restaurant licenses to have this type of
 
01:02:59.190 --> 01:02:59.200 align:start position:0%
license only not a beverage
 
01:03:09.269 --> 01:03:09.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.829 --> 01:03:12.839 align:start position:0%
license uh
 
01:03:15.990 --> 01:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
but what what's our self-distribute law
 
01:03:18.750 --> 01:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
I know I passed that many years ago what
 
01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:20.760 align:start position:0%
so in the beverage manufacturer or the
 
01:03:23.710 --> 01:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
Brew yeah right exactly so but I'm
 
01:03:25.470 --> 01:03:25.480 align:start position:0%
saying they're going to be delivering to
 
01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:27.359 align:start position:0%
their own locations or or do they have
 
01:03:28.430 --> 01:03:28.440 align:start position:0%
to use a
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
distributor that that is the part B in
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
this in in this uh section and and this
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
is sell more mean it was about self-
 
01:03:39.710 --> 01:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
Distributing right so under the beverage
 
01:03:41.630 --> 01:03:41.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing law
 
01:03:44.589 --> 01:03:44.599 align:start position:0%
17812 if you produce under 15,000
 
01:03:46.950 --> 01:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
barrels you are allowed to
 
01:03:51.670 --> 01:03:51.680 align:start position:0%
self-distribute up to 5,000 barrels so
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
this is consistent with that portion of
 
01:03:55.829 --> 01:03:55.839 align:start position:0%
the beverage manufa ufacturing law under
 
01:03:59.390 --> 01:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
the current law in the Brew Pub you only
 
01:04:03.589 --> 01:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
can produce 2500 barrels and you can
 
01:04:06.230 --> 01:04:06.240 align:start position:0%
self-distribute all 2500 of those
 
01:04:10.349 --> 01:04:10.359 align:start position:0%
barrels so what part B is saying here is
 
01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:14.839 align:start position:0%
if you have four restaurant licenses you
 
01:04:16.870 --> 01:04:16.880 align:start position:0%
can now get a brew pub
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
license if you get another Brew Pub
 
01:04:24.269 --> 01:04:24.279 align:start position:0%
license then you can self-distribute an
 
01:04:27.589 --> 01:04:27.599 align:start position:0%
extra 2500 barrels for a total of 5,000
 
01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
barrels which is the same as the
 
01:04:32.069 --> 01:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
beverage manufacturers can can self-
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
distribute and you're limited to that if
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
you got another Brew Pub license you
 
01:04:37.829 --> 01:04:37.839 align:start position:0%
couldn't you're not going to be able to
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
distribute 7500 barrels and I will tell
 
01:04:43.950 --> 01:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
you that we have 31 brew pubs right now
 
01:04:47.630 --> 01:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
amazing in in the uh in our licensing uh
 
01:04:50.230 --> 01:04:50.240 align:start position:0%
structure and I believe it's only two of
 
01:04:53.069 --> 01:04:53.079 align:start position:0%
them that are even remotely close to the
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
2500 barrels
 
01:04:57.910 --> 01:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
so nobody's even well the whole concept
 
01:04:59.430 --> 01:04:59.440 align:start position:0%
of the of the brw was that you're really
 
01:05:01.549 --> 01:05:01.559 align:start position:0%
only manufacturing enough for your for
 
01:05:03.789 --> 01:05:03.799 align:start position:0%
your own sales for your that thank you
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
chairman that's 100% correct the entire
 
01:05:08.230 --> 01:05:08.240 align:start position:0%
intent of this law that was the right
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
and I will assure you all I was not
 
01:05:12.789 --> 01:05:12.799 align:start position:0%
around when Brew Pub pet law passed you
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
can't blame me for that
 
01:05:17.029 --> 01:05:17.039 align:start position:0%
one nor was
 
01:05:19.190 --> 01:05:19.200 align:start position:0%
I were you
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
wrong so and were you enforcement were
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
you Chief at the time uh no I wasn't
 
01:05:28.309 --> 01:05:28.319 align:start position:0%
Chief chairman I was an investigator but
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
first Brew Pub showed up in Portsmouth
 
01:05:35.309 --> 01:05:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh right ports right and uh it it was
 
01:05:37.029 --> 01:05:37.039 align:start position:0%
requested by a gentleman named Peter
 
01:05:39.269 --> 01:05:39.279 align:start position:0%
Egleston who has gone on to open a
 
01:05:41.589 --> 01:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
number of other Brewery facilities in
 
01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um and his argument was I
 
01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:50.240 align:start position:0%
make beer in my other in other states
 
01:05:52.109 --> 01:05:52.119 align:start position:0%
where I have a license particularly
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I would like to be able to
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
to serve the beer that I make to the
 
01:05:57.589 --> 01:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
people who come to my
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
restaurant and the legislature in its
 
01:06:03.670 --> 01:06:03.680 align:start position:0%
infinite wisdom has always decided to
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
work and help the businessman who's
 
01:06:08.750 --> 01:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
trying to expand his presence in New
 
01:06:11.870 --> 01:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and and uh the legislature I
 
01:06:13.710 --> 01:06:13.720 align:start position:0%
believe was probably regulated revenues
 
01:06:15.589 --> 01:06:15.599 align:start position:0%
passed it was regulated revenues yeah
 
01:06:17.990 --> 01:06:18.000 align:start position:0%
passed I I can't hear you I cannot hear
 
01:06:22.589 --> 01:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
you I'm sorry uh P yeah PMI Brewery the
 
01:06:24.910 --> 01:06:24.920 align:start position:0%
first but it's yeah it's pman Brewery
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
what what was the other because his wife
 
01:06:28.230 --> 01:06:28.240 align:start position:0%
was name on one of them and his name was
 
01:06:33.670 --> 01:06:33.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.870 --> 01:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
um I mean I think what what what he did
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
was try to make take that first step
 
01:06:41.950 --> 01:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
into modernization of uh I'm not sure
 
01:06:45.190 --> 01:06:45.200 align:start position:0%
people foresaw the tier implications as
 
01:06:47.829 --> 01:06:47.839 align:start position:0%
clearly as they do today I'd be shocked
 
01:06:49.990 --> 01:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
at Clark Corson didn't do anything at
 
01:06:52.269 --> 01:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
that time I'm shocked he would not have
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
tried to say something about it
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
but I don't know if there's any other
 
01:07:01.549 --> 01:07:01.559 align:start position:0%
questions about that process all right
 
01:07:05.549 --> 01:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
represent M thank you Mr chairman it's
 
01:07:09.230 --> 01:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
Tim MCU from marac um this makes me
 
01:07:12.069 --> 01:07:12.079 align:start position:0%
think of our local folks AEL eaner
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
because they they produce and
 
01:07:15.309 --> 01:07:15.319 align:start position:0%
self-distribute and it was one of the
 
01:07:17.789 --> 01:07:17.799 align:start position:0%
first places that I knew that ran their
 
01:07:19.589 --> 01:07:19.599 align:start position:0%
own refrigerator trucks all around the
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
state delivering their beer produced in
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
marac to the restaurants
 
01:07:27.190 --> 01:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
so your first explanation was about as
 
01:07:30.190 --> 01:07:30.200 align:start position:0%
clear as a Guinness to me so I'm getting
 
01:07:32.910 --> 01:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
there um help me understand how this
 
01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:35.720 align:start position:0%
affects the little guy like that can
 
01:07:38.910 --> 01:07:38.920 align:start position:0%
this just lets them produce more F 5,000
 
01:07:40.190 --> 01:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
or what are they what are they likely to
 
01:07:41.990 --> 01:07:42.000 align:start position:0%
be licensed as now and I don't I don't
 
01:07:43.470 --> 01:07:43.480 align:start position:0%
believe they serve food I think it's all
 
01:07:47.109 --> 01:07:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:49.750 --> 01:07:49.760 align:start position:0%
in thank you representative I I'm not
 
01:07:52.069 --> 01:07:52.079 align:start position:0%
sure how that specific license is
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
licensed whether they're a beverage
 
01:07:56.549 --> 01:07:56.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturer nano brewery or their
 
01:07:59.190 --> 01:07:59.200 align:start position:0%
license as a brew pub I would have to
 
01:07:59.200 --> 01:08:01.990 align:start position:0%
license as a brew pub I would have to
check

01:08:01.990 --> 01:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:04.710 --> 01:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
that well he has a pub and he has all
 
01:08:06.390 --> 01:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of events there and music and
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
whatever and then he has a food truck in
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
the his his claim to fame was for this
 
01:08:13.710 --> 01:08:13.720 align:start position:0%
committee was that was getting to after
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
covid that to continue to allow him to
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
be reselling directly to the
 
01:08:22.110 --> 01:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
consumer yeah he does both yeah that was
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
that was we passed that legislation
 
01:08:26.349 --> 01:08:26.359 align:start position:0%
because of
 
01:08:29.070 --> 01:08:29.080 align:start position:0%
him so I just want I'm familiar I just
 
01:08:30.630 --> 01:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
want to know how this affects them
 
01:08:32.349 --> 01:08:32.359 align:start position:0%
because I don't entirely counts on what
 
01:08:35.630 --> 01:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
his underlying license is sorry it
 
01:08:38.669 --> 01:08:38.679 align:start position:0%
counts on what his underlying license is
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
which I don't know manufacturer or is he
 
01:08:43.070 --> 01:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
a brew pub I would think he's a
 
01:08:44.430 --> 01:08:44.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturer I don't believe he was a
 
01:08:46.149 --> 01:08:46.159 align:start position:0%
brew pub but so can you be a
 
01:08:48.789 --> 01:08:48.799 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and and have uh you know a
 
01:08:51.550 --> 01:08:51.560 align:start position:0%
bar and a lounge and entertainment and
 
01:08:53.030 --> 01:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know that's what the other girl were
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
talking about the having an on- premise
 
01:08:57.070 --> 01:08:57.080 align:start position:0%
license so he must have both be a
 
01:08:58.749 --> 01:08:58.759 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and have an on premise
 
01:09:00.709 --> 01:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
license so he must have both then
 
01:09:02.189 --> 01:09:02.199 align:start position:0%
because he self-d distributes and he has
 
01:09:03.789 --> 01:09:03.799 align:start position:0%
occasional transient entertainment and a
 
01:09:06.950 --> 01:09:06.960 align:start position:0%
food truck and whatnot food truck's not
 
01:09:08.749 --> 01:09:08.759 align:start position:0%
connected no he doesn't have a food
 
01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
truck he delivers he he puts in the back
 
01:09:12.550 --> 01:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
of a truck and delivers to your house
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
yes he has an actual food truck that
 
01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
serves the food what I'm saying is they
 
01:09:18.110 --> 01:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
don't serve the food they bring food
 
01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:20.560 align:start position:0%
trucks to serve alcohol no they don't
 
01:09:25.229 --> 01:09:25.239 align:start position:0%
serve alcohol food a food truck
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
but thank you for the question because I
 
01:09:28.990 --> 01:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
I I think you know the complexity of
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
this is is noted on this um I I think
 
01:09:33.990 --> 01:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
another important aspect to bring up
 
01:09:38.229 --> 01:09:38.239 align:start position:0%
with this is what has been done as
 
01:09:41.550 --> 01:09:41.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:44.950 --> 01:09:44.960 align:start position:0%
for this to be allowed to happen right
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
so if I own four restaurants and I want
 
01:09:52.110 --> 01:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
to open up a brew pub license what has
 
01:09:55.470 --> 01:09:55.480 align:start position:0%
been occurring now in is completely uh
 
01:09:58.470 --> 01:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
uh um Allowed by Statute is to turn
 
01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
those four restaurants into brew pubs so
 
01:10:06.270 --> 01:10:06.280 align:start position:0%
TTP approval is granted for a home brew
 
01:10:08.950 --> 01:10:08.960 align:start position:0%
kit that is placed on the table and now
 
01:10:11.030 --> 01:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
they're considered brw pups and licensed
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
as Brew pups and that is simply not the
 
01:10:16.510 --> 01:10:16.520 align:start position:0%
correct way to fix this
 
01:10:20.070 --> 01:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
issue um so this this is the correct way
 
01:10:24.910 --> 01:10:24.920 align:start position:0%
to fix the issue um and um
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
I think that the industry Partners will
 
01:10:31.310 --> 01:10:31.320 align:start position:0%
be able to um come to an agreement on on
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
done thank you Mr chairman you you
 
01:10:43.510 --> 01:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
mentioned the word complicated um
 
01:10:46.630 --> 01:10:46.640 align:start position:0%
convoluted seems even more more
 
01:10:49.149 --> 01:10:49.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate what why is all this
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
necessary I I don't I I guess maybe I
 
01:10:53.790 --> 01:10:53.800 align:start position:0%
don't fully understand the three-tier
 
01:10:55.870 --> 01:10:55.880 align:start position:0%
system and why we need it but it just
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
seems to
 
01:11:00.630 --> 01:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
be quite frankly ridiculous that uh all
 
01:11:03.550 --> 01:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
of a sudden you're limited to 5,000 or
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
it just doesn't make sense to me too
 
01:11:09.070 --> 01:11:09.080 align:start position:0%
many rules okay so I'll I'll take this
 
01:11:11.990 --> 01:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.310 --> 01:11:15.320 align:start position:0%
you um and and you
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
know the only only reason we actually
 
01:11:21.870 --> 01:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
have liquor now in Commerce was that cuz
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
I had um look now
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
the you know the uh Castle on the clouds
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
had a spring water and Jim deur you know
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
came in legislation to allow them to
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
self-distribute Spring Water beer they
 
01:11:40.350 --> 01:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
were making a beer probably the only
 
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
person who still has a luck now t-shirt
 
01:11:45.390 --> 01:11:45.400 align:start position:0%
but the beer and because it really was
 
01:11:47.669 --> 01:11:47.679 align:start position:0%
the very first beer that was you made
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire you know as as a
 
01:11:54.310 --> 01:11:54.320 align:start position:0%
as a small batch brewing and um needs to
 
01:11:56.030 --> 01:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
say that I had to negotiate with the
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
beer distributors and we came up with a
 
01:12:01.550 --> 01:12:01.560 align:start position:0%
compromise and and Donna citech was so
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
impressed he said okay you guys can have
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
the liquor you can have all the liquor
 
01:12:09.229 --> 01:12:09.239 align:start position:0%
bills and so the struggle is that you
 
01:12:12.629 --> 01:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
you have this concept of the three tier
 
01:12:15.310 --> 01:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
that you were going to that it was
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
literally was something that came out of
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
the end of the pro bition and which was
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
that we're going to uh ensure that we
 
01:12:26.149 --> 01:12:26.159 align:start position:0%
won't have this speak easys back of that
 
01:12:28.510 --> 01:12:28.520 align:start position:0%
that was going on you know when ille
 
01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:30.920 align:start position:0%
when all the illegal beer was being sold
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
and uh then then I say this a a trivia
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
question what state ignored the
 
01:12:40.950 --> 01:12:40.960 align:start position:0%
prohibition and I I I looked at the list
 
01:12:43.430 --> 01:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
and I said the only one I can think is
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
possibly would be Maine and that was the
 
01:12:48.629 --> 01:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
answer then Maine actually ignored the
 
01:12:50.310 --> 01:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
provision that main had nothing to do
 
01:12:52.750 --> 01:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
with the provision so so evidently you
 
01:12:54.030 --> 01:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
could you know well they're right next
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
to Canada so all the all the Canadian
 
01:12:59.189 --> 01:12:59.199 align:start position:0%
boes probably coming in there so anyway
 
01:13:01.229 --> 01:13:01.239 align:start position:0%
the three tier for whatever it's worth
 
01:13:03.270 --> 01:13:03.280 align:start position:0%
is a model that we've had a long time
 
01:13:04.990 --> 01:13:05.000 align:start position:0%
and and Scott at one time made a
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
presentation to the to the committee
 
01:13:08.629 --> 01:13:08.639 align:start position:0%
about you know the defense of the three-
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
tier system so having said that every
 
01:13:15.870 --> 01:13:15.880 align:start position:0%
time we have these new Industries New
 
01:13:18.070 --> 01:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you know trying to come in and
 
01:13:20.390 --> 01:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
we are a mother mayi right so everything
 
01:13:24.189 --> 01:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
is illegal until we make it legal and so
 
01:13:27.990 --> 01:13:28.000 align:start position:0%
each time we struggle with how do
 
01:13:31.229 --> 01:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
we how do we take care of this problem
 
01:13:33.430 --> 01:13:33.440 align:start position:0%
how do we you know give this business
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
this opportunity without totally
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
throwing the three tier or whatever in
 
01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:41.400 align:start position:0%
the trash can and the problem I would
 
01:13:43.510 --> 01:13:43.520 align:start position:0%
say when you have this mother mayi
 
01:13:47.590 --> 01:13:47.600 align:start position:0%
system is that every time you do pass
 
01:13:50.350 --> 01:13:50.360 align:start position:0%
something like a brew every time you do
 
01:13:54.030 --> 01:13:54.040 align:start position:0%
this now you created uh a whole industry
 
01:13:58.790 --> 01:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
invested in perpetuating that
 
01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:02.080 align:start position:0%
exemption and so you know the example I
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
give people is that if you go I went to
 
01:14:06.110 --> 01:14:06.120 align:start position:0%
Montana and I wanted to get a a
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
margarita at a at a restaurant and they
 
01:14:10.870 --> 01:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
said well we don't have that license we
 
01:14:12.990 --> 01:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
only in Montana they limit to how many
 
01:14:16.470 --> 01:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
liquor licenses they have per town okay
 
01:14:18.590 --> 01:14:18.600 align:start position:0%
and why haven't they fix that problem
 
01:14:19.990 --> 01:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
because everyone who had to pay that
 
01:14:22.270 --> 01:14:22.280 align:start position:0%
250,000 or whatever to buy that license
 
01:14:24.149 --> 01:14:24.159 align:start position:0%
to open the restaurant well make damn
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
sure they don't want that law to be
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
repealed and so we have that same
 
01:14:30.470 --> 01:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
problem that each one of these things
 
01:14:32.270 --> 01:14:32.280 align:start position:0%
and this is a classic case that we have
 
01:14:34.629 --> 01:14:34.639 align:start position:0%
to restaurant lodging is is involved in
 
01:14:36.390 --> 01:14:36.400 align:start position:0%
negotiation the Distributors are
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
involved in negoti everybody is going to
 
01:14:41.390 --> 01:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
you know because we're somewhat fussing
 
01:14:44.149 --> 01:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
around with three tier here and and so
 
01:14:46.110 --> 01:14:46.120 align:start position:0%
each one has to say okay are we willing
 
01:14:49.990 --> 01:14:50.000 align:start position:0%
to live with this little chipping away
 
01:14:52.870 --> 01:14:52.880 align:start position:0%
of the law and so yes and and and and
 
01:14:55.390 --> 01:14:55.400 align:start position:0%
you take in totality it looks like we
 
01:14:57.870 --> 01:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
have this crazy bizarre
 
01:15:02.189 --> 01:15:02.199 align:start position:0%
Byzantine you know system but it's I
 
01:15:04.189 --> 01:15:04.199 align:start position:0%
guess and all I can say is that I'm I've
 
01:15:06.030 --> 01:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
been doing this long enough that I I can
 
01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:08.679 align:start position:0%
fortunately tell you the story and why
 
01:15:11.629 --> 01:15:11.639 align:start position:0%
each one happened and what was the the
 
01:15:13.270 --> 01:15:13.280 align:start position:0%
negotiate what was the process how we
 
01:15:15.030 --> 01:15:15.040 align:start position:0%
got there and that's what you call
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
institutional knowledge and I hope
 
01:15:19.870 --> 01:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
someday I can impart on all of you so
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
you all can have the same institutional
 
01:15:22.920 --> 01:15:24.229 align:start position:0%
you all can have the same institutional
knowledge

01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:15:26.270 --> 01:15:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I fully understand
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
it now I appreciate
 
01:15:31.070 --> 01:15:31.080 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
01:15:34.510 --> 01:15:34.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um as a
 
01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
latecomer to this whole system uh may I
 
01:15:39.629 --> 01:15:39.639 align:start position:0%
ask you a couple of questions just to be
 
01:15:43.430 --> 01:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
sure I understand sure thank you uh okay
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
the three- tier system do I understand
 
01:15:48.550 --> 01:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
correctly tier one is manufacturing
 
01:15:51.629 --> 01:15:51.639 align:start position:0%
corre tier two is retail sales no tier
 
01:15:54.910 --> 01:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
two is distribution wholesale industry
 
01:15:56.189 --> 01:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
other words the
 
01:15:58.470 --> 01:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer you the whole idea that
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
that that the original tide house that
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
which is what we were trying to get rid
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
of was that um anheiser Bush would make
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
the beer they'd stick it on their their
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
truck and their on have their
 
01:16:16.149 --> 01:16:16.159 align:start position:0%
horses clop down the street and they
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
would take it to a establishment that
 
01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:20.950 align:start position:0%
would take it to a establishment that
they

01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:16:23.669 --> 01:16:23.679 align:start position:0%
owned okay and then so we did want
 
01:16:25.790 --> 01:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
ownership of all three tiers that we
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
wanted separate ownership that the whole
 
01:16:30.430 --> 01:16:30.440 align:start position:0%
idea was you could if you own one you
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
can't own any of the other two and then
 
01:16:35.470 --> 01:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
tier three is both retail sales and bars
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
and restaurants correct and that's what
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
we call on premise and off-
 
01:16:42.590 --> 01:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
premise okay so tier two has essentially
 
01:16:46.470 --> 01:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
part A off premise and Part B on premise
 
01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:47.350 align:start position:0%
part A off premise and Part B on premise
tier

01:16:47.350 --> 01:16:47.360 align:start position:0%
tier
 
01:16:51.950 --> 01:16:51.960 align:start position:0%
two is is just distributed tier three is
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
yes both on and all the all these
 
01:16:56.149 --> 01:16:56.159 align:start position:0%
licenses we're talking about in terms of
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
can you who sells it is the tier three
 
01:17:00.470 --> 01:17:00.480 align:start position:0%
okay I have I have another question this
 
01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
is both broader and maybe a very stupid
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
question I don't know but why don't we
 
01:17:10.070 --> 01:17:10.080 align:start position:0%
let the free market operate let Commerce
 
01:17:12.310 --> 01:17:12.320 align:start position:0%
operate and then if we see a problem
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
make it illegal rather than making
 
01:17:17.590 --> 01:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
everything illegal until we come up with
 
01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
this bantine system very good question
 
01:17:23.030 --> 01:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
and that goes back to and I it turns my
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
tell in the story that goes back to the
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
end of the prob
 
01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
bition so when the when the prob bition
 
01:17:32.870 --> 01:17:32.880 align:start position:0%
ended what they ended up doing they
 
01:17:35.430 --> 01:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
really actually allowed any state to be
 
01:17:38.870 --> 01:17:38.880 align:start position:0%
continued to be a dry State somebody any
 
01:17:40.189 --> 01:17:40.199 align:start position:0%
state could have said no we're not going
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
to do anything but they said when inste
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
was okay now now instead of being
 
01:17:48.189 --> 01:17:48.199 align:start position:0%
everything's legal and then and then you
 
01:17:50.189 --> 01:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
just make uh make things illegal based
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
what you don't like which is what you
 
01:17:53.550 --> 01:17:53.560 align:start position:0%
were saying in the free market
 
01:17:56.669 --> 01:17:56.679 align:start position:0%
it was absolutely the complete opposite
 
01:18:00.590 --> 01:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
everything is illegal until the state
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
decides that it's legal and that's why I
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
say this is mother mayi and I thought
 
01:18:07.070 --> 01:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
this was the only mother mayi
 
01:18:09.750 --> 01:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislation that occurs until I got into
 
01:18:12.189 --> 01:18:12.199 align:start position:0%
a zoning issue and learning that zoning
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
is also the same situation so if you
 
01:18:16.830 --> 01:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
want to make a correlation in your mind
 
01:18:18.830 --> 01:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
about what we do here it's the same
 
01:18:20.870 --> 01:18:20.880 align:start position:0%
thing as zoning and that is you can't do
 
01:18:23.070 --> 01:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
something in a Zone unless it's
 
01:18:25.790 --> 01:18:25.800 align:start position:0%
specifically stated that I was
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
allowed thank you representative grassy
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
welcome to Commerce well thank you uh Mr
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
chairman I and I guess all our questions
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
are aimed at you now so in instead of
 
01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:38.280 align:start position:0%
the speaker I was the sponsor he can
 
01:18:40.669 --> 01:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
leave so but uh yeah I I certainly
 
01:18:41.870 --> 01:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
understand the three-tier system the
 
01:18:43.750 --> 01:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
thing I concern that I have is that you
 
01:18:45.590 --> 01:18:45.600 align:start position:0%
know as we know I mean UNH actually has
 
01:18:48.030 --> 01:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
a program in craft brewing now and the
 
01:18:50.470 --> 01:18:50.480 align:start position:0%
thing is is is as has gone on in the
 
01:18:52.030 --> 01:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
Northwest is happening here in the
 
01:18:54.669 --> 01:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
Northeast and that craft brew Brewing is
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
becoming a really big thing correct and
 
01:18:59.430 --> 01:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's if there's
 
01:19:01.110 --> 01:19:01.120 align:start position:0%
something more we need to do but I hate
 
01:19:02.229 --> 01:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
to see us
 
01:19:06.110 --> 01:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
restrict craft brewing and brew pubs uh
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
the way we seem to be doing it here um I
 
01:19:10.229 --> 01:19:10.239 align:start position:0%
don't know I know we have some very
 
01:19:12.750 --> 01:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
powerful Distributors here in the State
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh so they're that number two in that
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
tier but we need to encourage more this
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
craft brewing in the state of New
 
01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:21.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because it's becoming very
 
01:19:23.189 --> 01:19:23.199 align:start position:0%
lucrative and as we all know from
 
01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday's testimony we have some of
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
the highest alcohol consumption in the
 
01:19:29.310 --> 01:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
nation so uh but uh and having gone to
 
01:19:32.110 --> 01:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
UNH I know that a l beer our beer tax
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
has been flat it's been literally flat
 
01:19:36.149 --> 01:19:36.159 align:start position:0%
and that is that even all these
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
Sparkling Waters and all these other
 
01:19:40.189 --> 01:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
products you know come in the market
 
01:19:42.750 --> 01:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
they they and and and terms of even the
 
01:19:45.629 --> 01:19:45.639 align:start position:0%
custom Brewers will tell you that they
 
01:19:46.950 --> 01:19:46.960 align:start position:0%
have to keep coming out with new
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
products because if you you they're like
 
01:19:51.030 --> 01:19:51.040 align:start position:0%
their original products like you know
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
they people they get bored of it they
 
01:19:54.750 --> 01:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to they want all these new
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
varieties I would say is that yes over
 
01:19:58.629 --> 01:19:58.639 align:start position:0%
the history of this committee and
 
01:20:02.229 --> 01:20:02.239 align:start position:0%
certainly while on my watch we have done
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
amazing things to facilitate that for
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
instance we created a nano license okay
 
01:20:12.030 --> 01:20:12.040 align:start position:0%
we which was allowed them to be small we
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
allow them to have tastings we allow
 
01:20:18.229 --> 01:20:18.239 align:start position:0%
them to charge for those tastings we've
 
01:20:20.390 --> 01:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
done so over the years we have done
 
01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
amazing amount of things for the cust
 
01:20:26.189 --> 01:20:26.199 align:start position:0%
Brewer I would say the number one block
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty is and this is when you go
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
back to the Distributors is for a
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
distributor to make money on a on a any
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
product youve got there's got they got
 
01:20:37.870 --> 01:20:37.880 align:start position:0%
to sell enough volume of it okay and
 
01:20:39.990 --> 01:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
there was is a problem when you have so
 
01:20:43.189 --> 01:20:43.199 align:start position:0%
many guys in this business it's hard to
 
01:20:45.870 --> 01:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
to make to sell a volume now the other
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
issue we're going to get and I believe
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
we had the bill is is
 
01:20:51.430 --> 01:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
Growlers right and it's not just beer
 
01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
but it's also cider that we're seeing
 
01:20:56.229 --> 01:20:56.239 align:start position:0%
come up I'm intimately cider because I
 
01:20:59.310 --> 01:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
have a son-in-law who has a North North
 
01:21:01.870 --> 01:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
Country cider yes is my
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
son-in-law is part of that so yes I'm
 
01:21:05.990 --> 01:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
intimately aware of that and I told him
 
01:21:07.270 --> 01:21:07.280 align:start position:0%
right from the get-go that they were
 
01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
never going to be able to compete
 
01:21:09.830 --> 01:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
against beer because they don't water
 
01:21:12.790 --> 01:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
the product down we went to we went to
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
marac and and anheiser Bush was very
 
01:21:16.270 --> 01:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
proud to tell us that yeah they do
 
01:21:18.990 --> 01:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
everything they brew it at at at 10% and
 
01:21:22.229 --> 01:21:22.239 align:start position:0%
then they water it down to five yeah so
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
in anyway
 
01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
as you will see that we have everything
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
we've done here is we are trying to
 
01:21:29.070 --> 01:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate those custom Brewers I mean
 
01:21:30.270 --> 01:21:30.280 align:start position:0%
it's strange seeing somebody on the
 
01:21:31.830 --> 01:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
Democratic site coming out saying you
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
know we're certainly supporting the free
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
market in this type of thing but I think
 
01:21:37.110 --> 01:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
that's we we
 
01:21:39.950 --> 01:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
have that we have to do proponed that on
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
on the house
 
01:21:43.149 --> 01:21:43.159 align:start position:0%
floor Market that I think this is
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
something because these are home Brewers
 
01:21:46.790 --> 01:21:46.800 align:start position:0%
and many of them start out ABS they go
 
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
on to uh whether they come out of the
 
01:21:50.189 --> 01:21:50.199 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire or they they
 
01:21:51.550 --> 01:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
they make a good product that their
 
01:21:53.750 --> 01:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
neighbors like they start a uh they
 
01:21:56.030 --> 01:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
start just maybe selling it locally
 
01:21:57.910 --> 01:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
getting a a nano license and then they
 
01:21:59.669 --> 01:21:59.679 align:start position:0%
move up from there I think we need to
 
01:22:01.790 --> 01:22:01.800 align:start position:0%
encourage that type of type of activity
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
in state everybody in this committee
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
agrees with open this up so that we can
 
01:22:07.550 --> 01:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
have more of those activities occur it's
 
01:22:09.910 --> 01:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
a greater Economic Opportunity that's
 
01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
right I'd like it okay I think
 
01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative Herbert had his hand up
 
01:22:15.750 --> 01:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
and then you yes um it's pretty
 
01:22:19.310 --> 01:22:19.320 align:start position:0%
straightforward put the mic close close
 
01:22:22.110 --> 01:22:22.120 align:start position:0%
it's a a revenue question so every time
 
01:22:24.629 --> 01:22:24.639 align:start position:0%
we do something different I would assume
 
01:22:28.270 --> 01:22:28.280 align:start position:0%
it has an impact positive or negative on
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
the uh State's revenue and I'm wondering
 
01:22:34.270 --> 01:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
if if you have any idea what the impact
 
01:22:37.350 --> 01:22:37.360 align:start position:0%
would be uh going forward if we if we
 
01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:39.229 align:start position:0%
would be uh going forward if we if we
did

01:22:39.229 --> 01:22:39.239 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:22:41.070 --> 01:22:41.080 align:start position:0%
this thank you for your question
 
01:22:42.830 --> 01:22:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative yeah mat you
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
got thank you for your question
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
representative The Brew Pub license is
 
01:22:49.629 --> 01:22:49.639 align:start position:0%
uh currently a $1,200 license we
 
01:22:53.189 --> 01:22:53.199 align:start position:0%
anticipate there to be more brew pubs
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
um applications applied for uh
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
generating that Revenue type um the the
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
only way that uh this licensing scheme
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
can happen into representative um uh uh
 
01:23:12.229 --> 01:23:12.239 align:start position:0%
grass's Point uh with the um nano
 
01:23:14.669 --> 01:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
brewery license which was specifically
 
01:23:18.550 --> 01:23:18.560 align:start position:0%
designed for the craft Brewers right
 
01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:21.639 align:start position:0%
that that is a manufacturing license but
 
01:23:23.110 --> 01:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
was not included
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
in the prohibited interest Statute in
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
17911 so they you can be issued that
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
manufacturing license and still obtain
 
01:23:35.149 --> 01:23:35.159 align:start position:0%
additional restaurant licenses by
 
01:23:37.790 --> 01:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
Statute one further further question you
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
may inquire so um so the income to the
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
state is limited to whatever the license
 
01:23:50.270 --> 01:23:50.280 align:start position:0%
licensing ownership the licensing fees
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
and the the um the the production fees
 
01:23:55.950 --> 01:23:55.960 align:start position:0%
on on the taxation at 30 cents a gallon
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
okay so there is a revenue from the
 
01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:00.520 align:start position:0%
production of absolutely well that's not
 
01:24:02.310 --> 01:24:02.320 align:start position:0%
the real Revenue pardon me the real
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
revenue is the rooms and meals tax right
 
01:24:07.550 --> 01:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's the real reeven I mean the fees
 
01:24:09.470 --> 01:24:09.480 align:start position:0%
the fees are you know theoretically it's
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
just paying for the department they
 
01:24:13.990 --> 01:24:14.000 align:start position:0%
should not be if Avis Nichols was still
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
around and she was the goddess of of
 
01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
fees and ways and means but is that that
 
01:24:21.510 --> 01:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh the the fees is supposed to only
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
facilitate the running the operation now
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
what is interesting about the brew pubs
 
01:24:28.870 --> 01:24:28.880 align:start position:0%
was that they went right to the 1200
 
01:24:31.350 --> 01:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
which is our highest liquor license and
 
01:24:33.070 --> 01:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
that and that they will also sell
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
distilled you know uh cocktails whereas
 
01:24:39.350 --> 01:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
you could get a license as low as uh
 
01:24:42.430 --> 01:24:42.440 align:start position:0%
$480 and just be a beer and wine license
 
01:24:44.590 --> 01:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
so we you know there're and again the
 
01:24:46.669 --> 01:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
Nano one's even cheaper so all these
 
01:24:48.430 --> 01:24:48.440 align:start position:0%
license are very inexpensive that's not
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
where the revenue is to the state the
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
revenue to in the end of the day
 
01:24:55.790 --> 01:24:55.800 align:start position:0%
uh the beer tax uh we have we the lowest
 
01:24:58.990 --> 01:24:59.000 align:start position:0%
beer tax in around and if we pass a
 
01:25:00.590 --> 01:25:00.600 align:start position:0%
bottle bill that beer tax is going to be
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
less Revenue so that's why we don't want
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
to pass that bottle Bild but but not
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
withstanding the the U the rooms and
 
01:25:10.590 --> 01:25:10.600 align:start position:0%
meals is really been the big Revenue
 
01:25:12.830 --> 01:25:12.840 align:start position:0%
generator because when all these things
 
01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
we've done along the way when we allow
 
01:25:18.109 --> 01:25:18.119 align:start position:0%
them to start selling the
 
01:25:21.590 --> 01:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
beer then we we're getting our 8 and 1
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
half% tax
 
01:25:25.149 --> 01:25:25.159 align:start position:0%
so it's the eight and a half it's the 8
 
01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
and a half% uh is the revenue to the
 
01:25:32.510 --> 01:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
state and presumably if these Pro uh
 
01:25:36.430 --> 01:25:36.440 align:start position:0%
prolifer rate uh around
 
01:25:39.390 --> 01:25:39.400 align:start position:0%
um that's that's the additional revenue
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
and no nobody knows what that might be
 
01:25:44.709 --> 01:25:44.719 align:start position:0%
well it's not their job they don't you
 
01:25:47.870 --> 01:25:47.880 align:start position:0%
know that's Dr whose job Dr do we are we
 
01:25:52.550 --> 01:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
going to get an FN on on this or I there
 
01:25:55.070 --> 01:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
the FN is nothing and we're not you know
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
we're this in this case we're moving the
 
01:26:00.550 --> 01:26:00.560 align:start position:0%
deck chairs around on the
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
Titanic because theoretically you're
 
01:26:04.590 --> 01:26:04.600 align:start position:0%
you're affecting somebody else who would
 
01:26:07.229 --> 01:26:07.239 align:start position:0%
have gotten that that sale that's the
 
01:26:09.390 --> 01:26:09.400 align:start position:0%
issue so in this Cas and this is just
 
01:26:11.709 --> 01:26:11.719 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing man I don't the man
 
01:26:13.390 --> 01:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the manufacturing is you know we
 
01:26:17.390 --> 01:26:17.400 align:start position:0%
are the the federal tax is pretty low on
 
01:26:20.870 --> 01:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
manufacturing so State the state is we
 
01:26:22.470 --> 01:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
just get the 30 cents a gallon and
 
01:26:24.590 --> 01:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's gallon 30 cents a gallon I mean
 
01:26:27.270 --> 01:26:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's a very low tax
 
01:26:30.310 --> 01:26:30.320 align:start position:0%
rate okay I mean I'm confused yes
 
01:26:30.320 --> 01:26:31.430 align:start position:0%
rate okay I mean I'm confused yes
representative

01:26:31.430 --> 01:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:26:34.070 --> 01:26:34.080 align:start position:0%
Willam thank you uh for taking my
 
01:26:37.030 --> 01:26:37.040 align:start position:0%
question um are there other New
 
01:26:38.990 --> 01:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission does it
 
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
operate the same as as other liquor
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
Commissions in other states or are you
 
01:26:47.629 --> 01:26:47.639 align:start position:0%
unique or how do you differ how do we
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
differ uh from other states the
 
01:26:51.199 --> 01:26:55.109 align:start position:0%
differ uh from other states the
commission

01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:56.830 --> 01:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your question we're
 
01:26:59.910 --> 01:26:59.920 align:start position:0%
considered a a controlled alcohol State
 
01:27:02.870 --> 01:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
um and there's SE 18 I was going to say
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
17 was it Maine Maine was in and out and
 
01:27:08.149 --> 01:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
Main was 18 other controlled alcohol
 
01:27:10.990 --> 01:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
States um in the country in the nation
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
that have similar um structures to
 
01:27:18.390 --> 01:27:18.400 align:start position:0%
ours um and but they invite us to come
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
show them how to do it I was going to
 
01:27:21.830 --> 01:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
say that but I didn't know how far to
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
reach there but yes you're right let me
 
01:27:27.310 --> 01:27:27.320 align:start position:0%
be let me be the one that says it and
 
01:27:28.709 --> 01:27:28.719 align:start position:0%
from my state my whole state of
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
Pennsylvania is uh as when when I I
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
remember as a kid when you went into the
 
01:27:37.510 --> 01:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
state store the state store would have a
 
01:27:39.790 --> 01:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
bot one bottle of everything on the wall
 
01:27:41.590 --> 01:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
and they have all these state employees
 
01:27:43.070 --> 01:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
whose job was you say okay this is what
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
I want and they would go in the back
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
back room and come out with that bottle
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
for you so there wasn't even self-served
 
01:27:53.149 --> 01:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
back in the state liquor stores but
 
01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:55.480 align:start position:0%
then and that was in New Hampshire also
 
01:27:58.550 --> 01:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so but times have
 
01:28:00.870 --> 01:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
changed but we we obviously take
 
01:28:04.870 --> 01:28:04.880 align:start position:0%
advantage of have leveraged it well um
 
01:28:06.669 --> 01:28:06.679 align:start position:0%
with our Bonded Warehouse system and
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
being the the distributor um and uh and
 
01:28:11.910 --> 01:28:11.920 align:start position:0%
there was some question when we allow
 
01:28:15.990 --> 01:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
wine into to uh um to on and off premise
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
the lenses that where well they on-
 
01:28:20.910 --> 01:28:20.920 align:start position:0%
premise licenses would have gone through
 
01:28:23.310 --> 01:28:23.320 align:start position:0%
the commission but the you know that U
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
that that would be a problem but
 
01:28:27.550 --> 01:28:27.560 align:start position:0%
obviously it's you know wine is just I
 
01:28:29.950 --> 01:28:29.960 align:start position:0%
would say is wine is where we're least
 
01:28:32.830 --> 01:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
competitive against other states and
 
01:28:37.709 --> 01:28:37.719 align:start position:0%
probably um because we we allowed the uh
 
01:28:39.629 --> 01:28:39.639 align:start position:0%
the distribution to change on that one
 
01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:42.440 align:start position:0%
so but that's a good
 
01:28:46.350 --> 01:28:46.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:48.629 --> 01:28:48.639 align:start position:0%
unique thank you very much gentlemen
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you chairman okay well
 
01:28:52.030 --> 01:28:52.040 align:start position:0%
this was actually pretty good I think I
 
01:28:53.790 --> 01:28:53.800 align:start position:0%
think we covered a lot of material here
 
01:28:57.830 --> 01:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
and and uh question yes so I have a

great Stakes Mike's Italian Kitchen
 
01:31:29.470 --> 01:31:29.480 align:start position:0%
Buckley's Bakery Cafe they're all
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
located in the uh southern part of the
 
01:31:34.870 --> 01:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
state marac Nashua one in Portsmith and
 
01:31:36.990 --> 01:31:37.000 align:start position:0%
we actually have one location in
 
01:31:40.910 --> 01:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
Northern Massachusetts as well um so our
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
our company employs just under 500
 
01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
people um and I'll tell you the just the
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
quick version of the the story as to how
 
01:31:50.830 --> 01:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
I came to be here with this with this
 
01:31:53.470 --> 01:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
bill uh about 2 years ago we purchased a
 
01:31:56.030 --> 01:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
building in nashwa with the hopes of
 
01:31:59.790 --> 01:31:59.800 align:start position:0%
opening a brew pub there uh it's large
 
01:32:02.109 --> 01:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
building about 17,000 square ft uh we're
 
01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
hoping to do about a 300 seat restaurant
 
01:32:07.229 --> 01:32:07.239 align:start position:0%
as well as the the brewery side of
 
01:32:09.430 --> 01:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
things a 7 barrel system so that we
 
01:32:12.390 --> 01:32:12.400 align:start position:0%
could Brew our own beer uh and sell it
 
01:32:16.350 --> 01:32:16.360 align:start position:0%
on premise to our guests um so we bought
 
01:32:19.550 --> 01:32:19.560 align:start position:0%
the building went to Liquor Commission
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
uh and realized that under the you know
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
the current uh rules we were not allowed
 
01:32:27.990 --> 01:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
to open a brew pub because we hold the
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
restaurant like the on- premise
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
restaurant licenses at our five other
 
01:32:34.030 --> 01:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
locations so we sat with Liquor
 
01:32:37.669 --> 01:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
Commission we were told that we would be
 
01:32:39.550 --> 01:32:39.560 align:start position:0%
um able
 
01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
to carry out our project by receiving a
 
01:32:46.510 --> 01:32:46.520 align:start position:0%
nano breweries license as well as an on
 
01:32:48.629 --> 01:32:48.639 align:start position:0%
premise restaurant license holding two
 
01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
licenses um that would accomplish the
 
01:32:53.390 --> 01:32:53.400 align:start position:0%
same thing uh in essence as having a
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
brew pub license uh I actually just this
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
morning on my way way here was told that
 
01:33:00.910 --> 01:33:00.920 align:start position:0%
there is a bill that's being put forth
 
01:33:04.109 --> 01:33:04.119 align:start position:0%
to eliminate the Nano Brewing license um
 
01:33:05.950 --> 01:33:05.960 align:start position:0%
which would on the Senate side yeah yeah
 
01:33:07.910 --> 01:33:07.920 align:start position:0%
which would in essence stop us dead in
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
our tracks because currently we're still
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
not allowed to apply for the Brew Pub
 
01:33:14.629 --> 01:33:14.639 align:start position:0%
license which is hopefully what you
 
01:33:16.229 --> 01:33:16.239 align:start position:0%
folks are going to be able to to work
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
with us on um we are well under
 
01:33:20.830 --> 01:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
construction on that building at this
 
01:33:22.830 --> 01:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
point like I said we it two years ago
 
01:33:24.590 --> 01:33:24.600 align:start position:0%
we're about 3/4 of the way through our
 
01:33:27.030 --> 01:33:27.040 align:start position:0%
construction we spent about $12 million
 
01:33:29.189 --> 01:33:29.199 align:start position:0%
turning what was Southern New Hampshire
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
University Building in in Nashua into a
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
Restaurant and Brewery so we're in hopes
 
01:33:38.590 --> 01:33:38.600 align:start position:0%
of being completed on the construction
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
phase within the next two to three
 
01:33:41.950 --> 01:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
months and then at that point we would
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
be you know we were planning on applying
 
01:33:48.550 --> 01:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
for uh a nano brewery and on premise
 
01:33:51.149 --> 01:33:51.159 align:start position:0%
license if that is still an option for
 
01:33:53.790 --> 01:33:53.800 align:start position:0%
us at that that point um but it would be
 
01:33:57.430 --> 01:33:57.440 align:start position:0%
even more convenient uh for us as a
 
01:33:59.709 --> 01:33:59.719 align:start position:0%
company for the inner workings of of how
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
it all comes together to just be able to
 
01:34:06.310 --> 01:34:06.320 align:start position:0%
apply for that that Brew Pub license um
 
01:34:10.070 --> 01:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
so uh that that's kind of uh where we
 
01:34:13.270 --> 01:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
stand with that project I mean this this
 
01:34:15.510 --> 01:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
building you know we're hoping to employ
 
01:34:17.350 --> 01:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
close to 100 people at that location
 
01:34:19.470 --> 01:34:19.480 align:start position:0%
alone uh you know we're thinking it's
 
01:34:21.270 --> 01:34:21.280 align:start position:0%
probably going to be between a a 5 and a
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
half $6.5 million a year building which
 
01:34:28.990 --> 01:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
you know again um the state receives
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
that 8 and a half% rooms and meals tax
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
on on that six to6 and a half million
 
01:34:37.149 --> 01:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
dollars um and without help on one side
 
01:34:39.149 --> 01:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
of this the other like I said we're kind
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
of uh dead in our tracks here after
 
01:34:44.510 --> 01:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
we've found a path forward spent the
 
01:34:47.229 --> 01:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
money and uh really invested the last
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
two years of of our
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
company's time energy and money into
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
doing something that I think is going to
 
01:34:55.990 --> 01:34:56.000 align:start position:0%
be I'm hoping is going to be a really
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
special project in that area we
 
01:35:00.270 --> 01:35:00.280 align:start position:0%
something we're very excited about um
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
and like I said kind of you know took
 
01:35:05.310 --> 01:35:05.320 align:start position:0%
the next step as a company by by
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
investing in this project so that's
 
01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:09.280 align:start position:0%
that's where we stand uh don't know if
 
01:35:10.510 --> 01:35:10.520 align:start position:0%
there's any questions but I just wanted
 
01:35:12.669 --> 01:35:12.679 align:start position:0%

01:36:20.870 --> 01:36:20.880 align:start position:0%
rid of Nano breweries because one reason
 
01:36:24.070 --> 01:36:24.080 align:start position:0%
would be you will lose a lot of money
 
01:36:25.750 --> 01:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
and you make a lot of money for the
 
01:36:28.390 --> 01:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
state so I'm determined to you know
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
Assist in that way and then this bill
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
should pass uh it's it's an easy one to
 
01:36:37.709 --> 01:36:37.719 align:start position:0%
pass so you know you should be on your
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
way to opening up your restaurant when
 
01:36:42.790 --> 01:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
you need to thank you I appreciate
 
01:36:47.510 --> 01:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
that yeah so uh just a wrap the um I'm
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
I'm going to look up the intent what I
 
01:36:52.030 --> 01:36:52.040 align:start position:0%
was told of the Nano bill is to try to
 
01:36:56.830 --> 01:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
streamline our Byzantine system but that
 
01:36:58.910 --> 01:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
obviously um remember the other thing I
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
said to you is that once we create
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
something it's very hard to get rid of
 
01:37:05.470 --> 01:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
it because you have invested interests
 
01:37:07.750 --> 01:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
so yes you would I I would I would be
 
01:37:10.149 --> 01:37:10.159 align:start position:0%
very surprised if that Nano Bill uh gets
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
out of committee um because there'll be
 
01:37:15.910 --> 01:37:15.920 align:start position:0%
a lot of Nano lies who would like to
 
01:37:18.990 --> 01:37:19.000 align:start position:0%
keep their very special Li and for a Maj
 
01:37:20.390 --> 01:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
as I understand it for a majority of
 
01:37:22.030 --> 01:37:22.040 align:start position:0%
those Nano LIC
 
01:37:23.629 --> 01:37:23.639 align:start position:0%
they would still have the ability to
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
just move into another license type that
 
01:37:27.990 --> 01:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
was the idea on the manufacturing side
 
01:37:29.189 --> 01:37:29.199 align:start position:0%
because we've done that we've done that
 
01:37:31.350 --> 01:37:31.360 align:start position:0%
with everybody else now we with wine and
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
distilled we have tears but I don't have
 
01:37:36.470 --> 01:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
that ability because of the separate on
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
premise licenses correct so eliminating
 
01:37:41.149 --> 01:37:41.159 align:start position:0%
the Nano Brewery on that side would in
 
01:37:43.270 --> 01:37:43.280 align:start position:0%
essence completely shut down my ability
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
to complete this project we we want to
 
01:37:49.109 --> 01:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
make sure you're able to go forward yeah
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:59.629 --> 01:37:59.639 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know what it looks like
 
01:38:03.189 --> 01:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
okay all right stay tuned to Nano after
 
01:38:06.030 --> 01:38:06.040 align:start position:0%
crossover all right uh I guess we're all
 
01:38:10.310 --> 01:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
set we're going to close the hearing on
 
01:38:12.910 --> 01:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
1380 did you say that bill already
 
01:38:17.470 --> 01:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
passed that's what he said Senate to to
 
01:38:19.109 --> 01:38:19.119 align:start position:0%
get rid
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:43.870 --> 01:38:43.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah because he's they're
 
01:38:50.109 --> 01:38:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:50.119 --> 03:10:50.469 align:start position:0%
 
Nano

03:10:50.469 --> 03:10:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.750 --> 03:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:11.760 --> 03:15:41.389 align:start position:0%
 
coming

03:15:41.389 --> 03:15:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:41.399 --> 03:17:41.429 align:start position:0%
 
for

03:17:41.429 --> 03:17:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:46.790 --> 03:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:49.830 --> 03:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
so we're going to call the the next
 
03:17:51.189 --> 03:17:51.199 align:start position:0%
public hearing to
 
03:17:54.590 --> 03:17:54.600 align:start position:0%
order and this will be House Bill
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
11:35 relative to the definition of
 
03:17:59.670 --> 03:17:59.680 align:start position:0%
specialty beer and I see the sponsor
 
03:17:59.680 --> 03:18:00.830 align:start position:0%
specialty beer and I see the sponsor
representative

03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:04.990 --> 03:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
Grill uh would you come to the the
 
03:18:10.630 --> 03:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:13.070 --> 03:18:13.080 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you m chairman and thank you
 
03:18:14.389 --> 03:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
to The Honorable members of the
 
03:18:16.670 --> 03:18:16.680 align:start position:0%
committee um nice to be back here for a
 
03:18:19.389 --> 03:18:19.399 align:start position:0%
second day in a row um so essentially
 
03:18:21.630 --> 03:18:21.640 align:start position:0%
this bill um came out of a discussion
 
03:18:23.790 --> 03:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
with um some friends in the bar and
 
03:18:25.710 --> 03:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
restaurant industry who um described
 
03:18:27.309 --> 03:18:27.319 align:start position:0%
some issues their vendors were having
 
03:18:29.429 --> 03:18:29.439 align:start position:0%
with um just the confusion between the
 
03:18:31.750 --> 03:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
categories of different beer products um
 
03:18:33.349 --> 03:18:33.359 align:start position:0%
beer specialty beer and Specialty
 
03:18:35.790 --> 03:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
beverage um so the aim of this bill um
 
03:18:37.349 --> 03:18:37.359 align:start position:0%
initially was to sort of simplify that
 
03:18:39.510 --> 03:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
definition of specialty beer um
 
03:18:42.309 --> 03:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
currently the RSA defines a specialty
 
03:18:45.070 --> 03:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
beer as a beverage that has between 6
 
03:18:48.189 --> 03:18:48.199 align:start position:0%
and 12% ABV um as well as other um
 
03:18:50.269 --> 03:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
differentiating features such as added
 
03:18:53.590 --> 03:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
flavorings herbs spices you name it um
 
03:18:55.269 --> 03:18:55.279 align:start position:0%
so the goal of this bill was to um
 
03:18:57.070 --> 03:18:57.080 align:start position:0%
streamline that definition by reducing
 
03:18:59.870 --> 03:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
the lower bound ABV percentage to half a
 
03:19:01.590 --> 03:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
percent um while keeping the other
 
03:19:04.229 --> 03:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
requirements in place um that being said
 
03:19:05.710 --> 03:19:05.720 align:start position:0%
um since filing this bill I've since had
 
03:19:07.870 --> 03:19:07.880 align:start position:0%
additional conversations with experts
 
03:19:10.309 --> 03:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
from the beer distributors Association
 
03:19:12.389 --> 03:19:12.399 align:start position:0%
um as well as more recently the Liquor
 
03:19:14.910 --> 03:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
Commission as well as um members of this
 
03:19:19.070 --> 03:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
committee um and it seems that um this
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
change that I originally requested would
 
03:19:23.990 --> 03:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
um create an overlap between um some of
 
03:19:25.510 --> 03:19:25.520 align:start position:0%
these existing categories which
 
03:19:27.110 --> 03:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
obviously would have unintended
 
03:19:29.429 --> 03:19:29.439 align:start position:0%
consequences that would go against the
 
03:19:31.630 --> 03:19:31.640 align:start position:0%
purpose of simplification um so with
 
03:19:34.389 --> 03:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
that in mind while I do agree that um
 
03:19:36.950 --> 03:19:36.960 align:start position:0%
there are some confusing elements um
 
03:19:38.590 --> 03:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
within the current statute I think that
 
03:19:41.510 --> 03:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
there is a lot of um perceived gray area
 
03:19:43.870 --> 03:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
among vendors and Distributors um that
 
03:19:45.750 --> 03:19:45.760 align:start position:0%
should um either be cleaned up or
 
03:19:48.269 --> 03:19:48.279 align:start position:0%
addressed in um on the rule side of
 
03:19:51.110 --> 03:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
things um I think at this point I would
 
03:19:54.189 --> 03:19:54.199 align:start position:0%
recommend in the work session um you
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
know we would look into putting in
 
03:20:01.269 --> 03:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
either an amendment to um avoid overlap
 
03:20:03.750 --> 03:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
between those categories or um if we
 
03:20:05.550 --> 03:20:05.560 align:start position:0%
learn through additional research that
 
03:20:09.269 --> 03:20:09.279 align:start position:0%
um this would be more of a executive um
 
03:20:12.309 --> 03:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
change needed versus legislative um
 
03:20:14.269 --> 03:20:14.279 align:start position:0%
recommend not moving forward with this
 
03:20:18.349 --> 03:20:18.359 align:start position:0%
bill so um in in conclusion um
 
03:20:20.389 --> 03:20:20.399 align:start position:0%
definitely my co-sponsors and I had
 
03:20:22.189 --> 03:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
great intentions but at this time I
 
03:20:23.590 --> 03:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
think it's probably not ready for prime
 
03:20:26.309 --> 03:20:26.319 align:start position:0%
time and we'll need um to amend it or
 
03:20:29.309 --> 03:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
otherwise you know fix it somehow so
 
03:20:31.469 --> 03:20:31.479 align:start position:0%
with that mind I'll take some
 
03:20:33.830 --> 03:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
questions any questions uh
 
03:20:33.840 --> 03:20:35.349 align:start position:0%
questions any questions uh
representative

03:20:35.349 --> 03:20:35.359 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:20:39.189 --> 03:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
meckler thank you um I haven't ever seen
 
03:20:42.630 --> 03:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
a beer in New Hampshire at 12% is is
 
03:20:45.349 --> 03:20:45.359 align:start position:0%
there such a thing
 
03:20:48.750 --> 03:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
now I um have never purchased a beer
 
03:20:51.670 --> 03:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
like that myself um I can't I'm sure
 
03:20:53.750 --> 03:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are brands that exist that do
 
03:20:55.590 --> 03:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
produce beers and beverages with that
 
03:20:58.469 --> 03:20:58.479 align:start position:0%
high in ABV percentage but um I don't
 
03:21:00.150 --> 03:21:00.160 align:start position:0%
see too many of them in stores and I
 
03:21:04.469 --> 03:21:04.479 align:start position:0%
think as far as the um the market goes
 
03:21:07.309 --> 03:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
um they're probably are fewer of those
 
03:21:09.830 --> 03:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
than you know what you would expect from
 
03:21:12.830 --> 03:21:12.840 align:start position:0%
a PBR or Budweiser
 
03:21:16.150 --> 03:21:16.160 align:start position:0%
um Miller Light type of beer so I sounds
 
03:21:17.950 --> 03:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
pretty uncommon from my understanding
 
03:21:20.070 --> 03:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I I I actually didn't think they
 
03:21:23.269 --> 03:21:23.279 align:start position:0%
made beer at that percentage but thank
 
03:21:26.429 --> 03:21:26.439 align:start position:0%
you and just clarification the bill
 
03:21:29.710 --> 03:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
before us has just one change in in
 
03:21:32.349 --> 03:21:32.359 align:start position:0%
language and that's to change greater
 
03:21:35.150 --> 03:21:35.160 align:start position:0%
than 6% to greater than
 
03:21:37.389 --> 03:21:37.399 align:start position:0%
05% and so any other language is
 
03:21:39.710 --> 03:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
existing statute correct so it would
 
03:21:44.469 --> 03:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
look to um reduce the um I guess lower
 
03:21:46.189 --> 03:21:46.199 align:start position:0%
amount of alcohol so you could have a um
 
03:21:48.910 --> 03:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
beverage that say 5.4% fall under this
 
03:21:48.920 --> 03:21:51.150 align:start position:0%
beverage that say 5.4% fall under this
category

03:21:51.150 --> 03:21:51.160 align:start position:0%
category
 
03:21:54.389 --> 03:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
um yes right I saw some hands over here
 
03:21:56.429 --> 03:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
first representative
 
03:21:58.710 --> 03:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
Bros thanks for taking my questions is
 
03:22:00.229 --> 03:22:00.239 align:start position:0%
one of the problems that you see with
 
03:22:03.269 --> 03:22:03.279 align:start position:0%
the bill um uh the language that it says
 
03:22:05.150 --> 03:22:05.160 align:start position:0%
the beer shall possess the character and
 
03:22:07.750 --> 03:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
flavor of a beer and then you have items
 
03:22:10.229 --> 03:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
that aren't normally identified with a
 
03:22:13.189 --> 03:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
beer like chocolate fruits nuts but that
 
03:22:15.910 --> 03:22:15.920 align:start position:0%
it's not okay to have a caffeinated beer
 
03:22:18.110 --> 03:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
is that one of the the problems that you
 
03:22:20.910 --> 03:22:20.920 align:start position:0%
see um that wasn't my original Focus my
 
03:22:23.110 --> 03:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
original Focus was more um some of the
 
03:22:25.070 --> 03:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
confusion that I'd seen in the um in the
 
03:22:28.389 --> 03:22:28.399 align:start position:0%
marketplace with the um amount of
 
03:22:29.870 --> 03:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol required to fall into this
 
03:22:32.110 --> 03:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
category versus the other categories um
 
03:22:33.910 --> 03:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
so it was more meant to sort of
 
03:22:36.510 --> 03:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
streamline that definition for um for
 
03:22:38.389 --> 03:22:38.399 align:start position:0%
vendors and Distributors um however I
 
03:22:40.269 --> 03:22:40.279 align:start position:0%
think that would be an interesting um
 
03:22:43.070 --> 03:22:43.080 align:start position:0%
topic to address in future
 
03:22:46.830 --> 03:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
legislation all right uh representative
 
03:22:49.870 --> 03:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
U thank you Mr chairman um
 
03:22:52.030 --> 03:22:52.040 align:start position:0%
representative Grill
 
03:22:55.550 --> 03:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
um you use the example of
 
03:22:58.030 --> 03:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
5.4% this lowers it from six all the way
 
03:23:02.790 --> 03:23:02.800 align:start position:0%
down to 0. five not 05 but 0.5 and I
 
03:23:04.349 --> 03:23:04.359 align:start position:0%
think that's if I read this correctly
 
03:23:06.429 --> 03:23:06.439 align:start position:0%
that's the only change to existing law
 
03:23:07.990 --> 03:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
that the bill as written is currently
 
03:23:11.030 --> 03:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
suggesting is that right just that yes
 
03:23:13.150 --> 03:23:13.160 align:start position:0%
just that change all the other
 
03:23:14.269 --> 03:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
everything else all the other
 
03:23:15.910 --> 03:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
requirements would say the same
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
caffeinated non- caffinated whatever is
 
03:23:19.150 --> 03:23:19.160 align:start position:0%
already in there that's already correct
 
03:23:22.030 --> 03:23:22.040 align:start position:0%
that's right representative oh followup
 
03:23:24.349 --> 03:23:24.359 align:start position:0%
followup then
 
03:23:27.830 --> 03:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
um who plans to sell beer with so little
 
03:23:30.870 --> 03:23:30.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol content I I guess I don't quite
 
03:23:32.469 --> 03:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
understand why they want to call it
 
03:23:34.790 --> 03:23:34.800 align:start position:0%
Specialty Beer like any alcohol equals
 
03:23:38.790 --> 03:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
specialty beer is that it um I think
 
03:23:40.269 --> 03:23:40.279 align:start position:0%
these questions are highlighting some of
 
03:23:42.870 --> 03:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
the um challenges that I look to address
 
03:23:45.110 --> 03:23:45.120 align:start position:0%
with this bill along with uh my
 
03:23:47.910 --> 03:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
co-sponsors um there are some other
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
categories that are very similar and
 
03:23:53.750 --> 03:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
from my discussions um with the um beer
 
03:23:56.189 --> 03:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
distributors Association um from my
 
03:23:58.670 --> 03:23:58.680 align:start position:0%
understanding a beverage that met all
 
03:24:00.189 --> 03:24:00.199 align:start position:0%
the other requirements of a specialty
 
03:24:02.710 --> 03:24:02.720 align:start position:0%
beer but was under 6% would either be
 
03:24:06.309 --> 03:24:06.319 align:start position:0%
classified as a beverage or just a beer
 
03:24:09.510 --> 03:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
um so there is uh similar elements
 
03:24:12.030 --> 03:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
between those categories um my intention
 
03:24:15.229 --> 03:24:15.239 align:start position:0%
was to I guess streamline the
 
03:24:17.389 --> 03:24:17.399 align:start position:0%
categorization rather than having more
 
03:24:19.429 --> 03:24:19.439 align:start position:0%
of these discret categories um however
 
03:24:23.429 --> 03:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
knowing that um there are currently you
 
03:24:25.150 --> 03:24:25.160 align:start position:0%
know several categories of beer and
 
03:24:29.349 --> 03:24:29.359 align:start position:0%
liquor in place um I want to avoid you
 
03:24:30.630 --> 03:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
know as far as future amendments and
 
03:24:33.070 --> 03:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
future work goes um I want to avoid you
 
03:24:35.349 --> 03:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
know creating an overlap which would
 
03:24:36.990 --> 03:24:37.000 align:start position:0%
just muddy the waters
 
03:24:38.870 --> 03:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
further thank you representative Gibbs
 
03:24:41.670 --> 03:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
you have a question uh yes thank you uh
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
just for clarity the language um in the
 
03:24:48.870 --> 03:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
bill uh about specialty beer has to have
 
03:24:51.510 --> 03:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
the character and flavor of a beer but
 
03:24:53.630 --> 03:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
may have other flavoring such as fruits
 
03:24:55.710 --> 03:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
chocolate and so forth that's already in
 
03:24:58.750 --> 03:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
the statute that isn't new um yes that
 
03:25:01.150 --> 03:25:01.160 align:start position:0%
is existing um existing language thank
 
03:25:04.550 --> 03:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
you all right great any further
 
03:25:07.790 --> 03:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
questions all right and uh oh you have
 
03:25:10.269 --> 03:25:10.279 align:start position:0%
one more representative
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
post um
 
03:25:14.469 --> 03:25:14.479 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
03:25:17.990 --> 03:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
that um the beer that comes out of
 
03:25:22.630 --> 03:25:22.640 align:start position:0%
Belgium which is very famous um does use
 
03:25:22.640 --> 03:25:25.150 align:start position:0%
Belgium which is very famous um does use
12%

03:25:25.150 --> 03:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
12%
 
03:25:25.160 --> 03:25:26.670 align:start position:0%
12%
alcohol

03:25:26.670 --> 03:25:26.680 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
03:25:31.309 --> 03:25:31.319 align:start position:0%
um I am not a beer expert however I
 
03:25:34.790 --> 03:25:34.800 align:start position:0%
um believe that there are producers of
 
03:25:37.790 --> 03:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
beer who are selling beer with that high
 
03:25:39.950 --> 03:25:39.960 align:start position:0%
elor content and
 
03:25:43.469 --> 03:25:43.479 align:start position:0%
um possibly many of them are Belgium I
 
03:25:46.429 --> 03:25:46.439 align:start position:0%
know that's a big uh big market for for
 
03:25:49.910 --> 03:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
that uh for beer and related products so
 
03:25:51.550 --> 03:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
if I read current law says you can have
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
up to
 
03:25:55.110 --> 03:25:55.120 align:start position:0%
12% and uh you can get approval from the
 
03:25:58.830 --> 03:25:58.840 align:start position:0%
commission for greater than 12%
 
03:26:01.750 --> 03:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
so all right so thank you for your
 
03:26:05.070 --> 03:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you and ju just one more
 
03:26:06.670 --> 03:26:06.680 align:start position:0%
thing if you have an idea for an
 
03:26:09.429 --> 03:26:09.439 align:start position:0%
amendment could you potentially work on
 
03:26:12.030 --> 03:26:12.040 align:start position:0%
that for our subcommittee uh it sounds
 
03:26:13.510 --> 03:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
like if there is no amendment that we
 
03:26:16.070 --> 03:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
should vote I on the bill so yes that's
 
03:26:17.630 --> 03:26:17.640 align:start position:0%
what I'm thinking and uh representative
 
03:26:20.030 --> 03:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
Sven and I are um working together on on
 
03:26:22.269 --> 03:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
some thoughts we have for um ways to to
 
03:26:24.630 --> 03:26:24.640 align:start position:0%
clean this up so um we'll do more
 
03:26:28.349 --> 03:26:28.359 align:start position:0%
research and um make more calls and get
 
03:26:29.710 --> 03:26:29.720 align:start position:0%
back to you with some recommended uh
 
03:26:32.150 --> 03:26:32.160 align:start position:0%
next steps great thank you thank
 
03:26:37.269 --> 03:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
1135 yep one
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:41.990 align:start position:0%
1135 yep one
more

03:26:41.990 --> 03:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
more
 
03:26:43.150 --> 03:26:43.160 align:start position:0%
call Matthew
 
03:26:46.189 --> 03:26:46.199 align:start position:0%
Culver from The Liquor
 
03:26:48.349 --> 03:26:48.359 align:start position:0%
Commission Matthew Culver from The
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission please thank you last
 
03:26:58.389 --> 03:26:58.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:00.710 --> 03:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
Adrian thank you representative
 
03:27:04.309 --> 03:27:04.319 align:start position:0%
committee members um I'd be happy to
 
03:27:06.070 --> 03:27:06.080 align:start position:0%
discuss any questions that you might
 
03:27:07.990 --> 03:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
have and provide clarification on
 
03:27:10.309 --> 03:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
anything in the bill
 
03:27:13.670 --> 03:27:13.680 align:start position:0%
that so I have a question uh certainly
 
03:27:15.229 --> 03:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
the previous speaker mentioned that it
 
03:27:16.910 --> 03:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
causes confusion in the categories could
 
03:27:18.750 --> 03:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
you just elaborate on what kind of
 
03:27:20.349 --> 03:27:20.359 align:start position:0%
confusion it causes certainly there's
 
03:27:23.830 --> 03:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
three main definitions in RSA
 
03:27:27.349 --> 03:27:27.359 align:start position:0%
1751 uh pertaining to beverages that we
 
03:27:30.990 --> 03:27:31.000 align:start position:0%
typically approve there's uh
 
03:27:33.070 --> 03:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
beverage um which is an alcohol
 
03:27:35.830 --> 03:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
concentration of z uh six to 8%
 
03:27:38.670 --> 03:27:38.680 align:start position:0%
generally speaking specialty
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
beverage um and Specialty Beer specialty
 
03:27:45.150 --> 03:27:45.160 align:start position:0%
beer is what is in question now to
 
03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:46.720 align:start position:0%
reduce that to
 
03:27:49.750 --> 03:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
0.5% if that were to pass proposed
 
03:27:52.510 --> 03:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
legislation you just made a specialty
 
03:27:54.469 --> 03:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
beer a
 
03:27:57.030 --> 03:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
beverage there would be no reason to
 
03:27:59.229 --> 03:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
have the
 
03:28:03.510 --> 03:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
Specialty Beer it it's overlapping um
 
03:28:05.910 --> 03:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
definitions so you're changing one and
 
03:28:08.349 --> 03:28:08.359 align:start position:0%
affecting the other and that is what was
 
03:28:10.670 --> 03:28:10.680 align:start position:0%
trying to be explained um these are
 
03:28:13.590 --> 03:28:13.600 align:start position:0%
three main categories of of definitions
 
03:28:16.189 --> 03:28:16.199 align:start position:0%
that's how we approve products on on
 
03:28:17.670 --> 03:28:17.680 align:start position:0%
those definitions
 
03:28:20.590 --> 03:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
alone so specialty beverage can have up
 
03:28:23.670 --> 03:28:23.680 align:start position:0%
to 6% alcohol is that correct specialty
 
03:28:26.550 --> 03:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
beverage is 6 to 8% but specialty
 
03:28:32.830 --> 03:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:35.510 --> 03:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
Beer did you have something Adrian oh
 
03:28:37.710 --> 03:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
excuse me sir uh just has something to
 
03:28:40.189 --> 03:28:40.199 align:start position:0%
do with the process of manufacturing the
 
03:28:43.309 --> 03:28:43.319 align:start position:0%
specialty beverage are often times some
 
03:28:44.910 --> 03:28:44.920 align:start position:0%
of the products that were coming to
 
03:28:49.150 --> 03:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
Market um you know the selers the the
 
03:28:52.150 --> 03:28:52.160 align:start position:0%
products that um had uh different
 
03:28:55.710 --> 03:28:55.720 align:start position:0%
flavorings Etc so a few years ago in the
 
03:28:57.309 --> 03:28:57.319 align:start position:0%
Senate uh the bill was brought forward
 
03:28:58.950 --> 03:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
to create a category of specialty
 
03:29:02.469 --> 03:29:02.479 align:start position:0%
beverage which um as as the lieutenant
 
03:29:05.269 --> 03:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
has said categorizes the product so when
 
03:29:06.790 --> 03:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
the product comes in to the commission
 
03:29:09.590 --> 03:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
for approval it's reviewed what's the
 
03:29:11.990 --> 03:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
alcohol content and then it's dropped
 
03:29:15.110 --> 03:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
into the category for the particular
 
03:29:19.229 --> 03:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
product um type um so that it can be
 
03:29:22.790 --> 03:29:22.800 align:start position:0%
categorized and then moved forward
 
03:29:24.910 --> 03:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
okay you have a question representative
 
03:29:27.150 --> 03:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
Walsh thank you Mr
 
03:29:29.550 --> 03:29:29.560 align:start position:0%
chairman can you just Define again
 
03:29:31.269 --> 03:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
because you would originally said
 
03:29:33.510 --> 03:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
beverage was 6 to8 and then you just
 
03:29:36.389 --> 03:29:36.399 align:start position:0%
said specialty beverage was 6 to8 so
 
03:29:37.910 --> 03:29:37.920 align:start position:0%
then what's the difference between a
 
03:29:39.710 --> 03:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
beverage and a specialty beverage if
 
03:29:41.990 --> 03:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's not the alcohol content a a
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
beverage is 0.5% half of 1% to
 
03:29:54.349 --> 03:29:54.359 align:start position:0%
6% okay a specialty beer is 6% to
 
03:29:58.349 --> 03:29:58.359 align:start position:0%
12% and a specialty beverage is 6 to 8%
 
03:30:01.590 --> 03:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
with further restrictions a single serve
 
03:30:03.990 --> 03:30:04.000 align:start position:0%
container not to exceed 16 ounces it has
 
03:30:05.990 --> 03:30:06.000 align:start position:0%
to be liquor or wine based so on and so
 
03:30:07.830 --> 03:30:07.840 align:start position:0%
forth so these are all specific
 
03:30:11.790 --> 03:30:11.800 align:start position:0%
definitions that live in in RSA 17
 
03:30:17.429 --> 03:30:17.439 align:start position:0%
51 follow thank you so this bill is
 
03:30:21.349 --> 03:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
literally to change it to
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
1.1% because you said it's currently 6
 
03:30:27.750 --> 03:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
to 12 and it's going to go from right
 
03:30:30.030 --> 03:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's going to lower the specialty
 
03:30:33.269 --> 03:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
beer yeah Special definition definition
 
03:30:36.790 --> 03:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
from 6% down to a half a
 
03:30:40.150 --> 03:30:40.160 align:start position:0%
one% okay okay got you thank you
 
03:30:42.630 --> 03:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative Sol
 
03:30:44.990 --> 03:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you so maybe you could just help
 
03:30:48.550 --> 03:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
like educate me as a co-sponsor who was
 
03:30:49.830 --> 03:30:49.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to make things a little bit
 
03:30:53.030 --> 03:30:53.040 align:start position:0%
simpler to and the rest of the committee
 
03:30:54.510 --> 03:30:54.520 align:start position:0%
what is the logic behind all these
 
03:30:56.309 --> 03:30:56.319 align:start position:0%
different Cate categories like there
 
03:30:57.429 --> 03:30:57.439 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a reason why we've
 
03:30:57.439 --> 03:30:58.389 align:start position:0%
there's got to be a reason why we've
created

03:30:58.389 --> 03:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
them but the creation of them definitely
 
03:31:02.750 --> 03:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
at some levels created confusion the
 
03:31:05.389 --> 03:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
fact that people here don't understand
 
03:31:06.349 --> 03:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
why we have the different different
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
categories maybe you can help us
 
03:31:09.790 --> 03:31:09.800 align:start position:0%
understand that a little
 
03:31:12.429 --> 03:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
bit it's thank you representative I I
 
03:31:14.910 --> 03:31:14.920 align:start position:0%
will certainly try to do that I I'm
 
03:31:16.550 --> 03:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
happy to maybe meet with you separately
 
03:31:18.429 --> 03:31:18.439 align:start position:0%
maybe now it's not the best venue but
 
03:31:20.910 --> 03:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
well very simply very simply put let
 
03:31:22.590 --> 03:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
let's take the specialty beverage which
 
03:31:26.189 --> 03:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
is the last um type of beverage that we
 
03:31:28.550 --> 03:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
saw in the market it's the rtds right
 
03:31:31.590 --> 03:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
the ready to drink Cocktails so as the
 
03:31:35.670 --> 03:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
industry changes so do the requirements
 
03:31:38.070 --> 03:31:38.080 align:start position:0%
for these definitions they're a little
 
03:31:39.670 --> 03:31:39.680 align:start position:0%
bit different than what the existing
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
definitions already are
 
03:31:46.710 --> 03:31:46.720 align:start position:0%
so new definitions are made in order for
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
um these products to be approved and and
 
03:31:51.710 --> 03:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
and brought into the state for for a
 
03:31:55.950 --> 03:31:55.960 align:start position:0%
retail sale um so I think that's the
 
03:31:58.550 --> 03:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
best explanation that I can give on that
 
03:32:01.030 --> 03:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
um you know as as the industry changes
 
03:32:04.110 --> 03:32:04.120 align:start position:0%
as these products change um the statutes
 
03:32:06.349 --> 03:32:06.359 align:start position:0%
are changing the definitions are
 
03:32:11.070 --> 03:32:11.080 align:start position:0%
changing follow up follow so I guess my
 
03:32:13.110 --> 03:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
my knee-jerk reaction or gut instinct
 
03:32:16.110 --> 03:32:16.120 align:start position:0%
tells me that there's some I mean is the
 
03:32:16.120 --> 03:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
tells me that there's some I mean is the
OB

03:32:17.750 --> 03:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
OB
 
03:32:19.710 --> 03:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
objective at some level is to cor
 
03:32:21.070 --> 03:32:21.080 align:start position:0%
collect revenue and you have to figure
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
out where to bucket that Revenue because
 
03:32:24.189 --> 03:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
I know beer is treated differently than
 
03:32:28.630 --> 03:32:28.640 align:start position:0%
say a spirit right so would it make
 
03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
sense or can you see a world where we
 
03:32:32.670 --> 03:32:32.680 align:start position:0%
would have just sort of one category
 
03:32:36.830 --> 03:32:36.840 align:start position:0%
based on alcohol volume and and that's
 
03:32:38.269 --> 03:32:38.279 align:start position:0%
and I understand that beer is treated
 
03:32:40.550 --> 03:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
differently now it's it's it's so like
 
03:32:41.630 --> 03:32:41.640 align:start position:0%
but like I wonder if there maybe could
 
03:32:44.189 --> 03:32:44.199 align:start position:0%
be two categories something that isn't
 
03:32:46.550 --> 03:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
considered a spirit and then we could
 
03:32:49.630 --> 03:32:49.640 align:start position:0%
just have like one one or two categories
 
03:32:52.269 --> 03:32:52.279 align:start position:0%
that are just based on alcohol volume
 
03:32:53.830 --> 03:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
because it seems to me like yeah there's
 
03:32:54.910 --> 03:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
going to be all sorts of innovation that
 
03:32:56.670 --> 03:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
comes across from the market whether
 
03:33:00.110 --> 03:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
it's premixed seltzers or premixed uh
 
03:33:02.269 --> 03:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
you know Margaritas or whatever but also
 
03:33:03.510 --> 03:33:03.520 align:start position:0%
different types of beers that come up
 
03:33:04.910 --> 03:33:04.920 align:start position:0%
that have like in this thing there's
 
03:33:07.070 --> 03:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
like flavors of coffee and all those
 
03:33:09.710 --> 03:33:09.720 align:start position:0%
sorts it just seems like there's an
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
infinite potential number of categories
 
03:33:15.030 --> 03:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
we could have and and that's I think is
 
03:33:17.189 --> 03:33:17.199 align:start position:0%
what we were trying to get at and we
 
03:33:18.710 --> 03:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
didn't realize the can worms were
 
03:33:20.710 --> 03:33:20.720 align:start position:0%
opening but uh I don't know if you have
 
03:33:22.510 --> 03:33:22.520 align:start position:0%
any insight or or perhaps you and I
 
03:33:24.150 --> 03:33:24.160 align:start position:0%
could meet sometime to discuss this
 
03:33:25.150 --> 03:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
because this is something I do care
 
03:33:26.590 --> 03:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
about and I realize that this isn't
 
03:33:28.630 --> 03:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
really ready for what we're trying to do
 
03:33:30.750 --> 03:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
but certainly and and thank you for that
 
03:33:34.349 --> 03:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
representative I I think um you you were
 
03:33:37.070 --> 03:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
right in in saying that it it does open
 
03:33:40.389 --> 03:33:40.399 align:start position:0%
up a can of worms U um title 13 is very
 
03:33:43.990 --> 03:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
much so interwoven in in changing one
 
03:33:46.670 --> 03:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
aspect of any statute or definition
 
03:33:49.389 --> 03:33:49.399 align:start position:0%
directly affects several others um but
 
03:33:51.389 --> 03:33:51.399 align:start position:0%
if you would like to meet offline I I
 
03:33:55.750 --> 03:33:55.760 align:start position:0%
would certainly um entertain in in and
 
03:33:58.750 --> 03:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
and offer my feedback on on uh
 
03:34:01.150 --> 03:34:01.160 align:start position:0%
simplifying this that certainly been our
 
03:34:04.710 --> 03:34:04.720 align:start position:0%
intentions as well in the in the last um
 
03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
several years
 
03:34:09.429 --> 03:34:09.439 align:start position:0%
cool all right representative
 
03:34:12.750 --> 03:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thanks than you Mr chair um I'm
 
03:34:16.309 --> 03:34:16.319 align:start position:0%
afraid I'm more confused now than I was
 
03:34:20.030 --> 03:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
um before you started um uh you
 
03:34:23.150 --> 03:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned three categories um the first
 
03:34:28.269 --> 03:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
one having uh alcohol half a per to 6%
 
03:34:31.790 --> 03:34:31.800 align:start position:0%
the second one 6% to 8% and the third
 
03:34:34.750 --> 03:34:34.760 align:start position:0%
one 6% to 12% did I have that right
 
03:34:39.670 --> 03:34:39.680 align:start position:0%
that's correct um but there are a lot of
 
03:34:41.990 --> 03:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
alcoholic beverag es uh that we would
 
03:34:44.710 --> 03:34:44.720 align:start position:0%
consider liquor or spirits that have
 
03:34:47.229 --> 03:34:47.239 align:start position:0%
alcohol percentages substantially higher
 
03:34:51.990 --> 03:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
than 12% so are these categories um only
 
03:34:54.670 --> 03:34:54.680 align:start position:0%
beer type Beverages and are those liquor
 
03:34:57.750 --> 03:34:57.760 align:start position:0%
or or Spirit beverages in a totally
 
03:35:00.150 --> 03:35:00.160 align:start position:0%
different set of
 
03:35:02.910 --> 03:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
categories thank you for your question
 
03:35:05.590 --> 03:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
representative um my name is Aiden Moore
 
03:35:07.030 --> 03:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
I'm the legal coordinator for the State
 
03:35:10.750 --> 03:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission um and I first want to
 
03:35:12.630 --> 03:35:12.640 align:start position:0%
commend Matt for doing an excellent job
 
03:35:14.030 --> 03:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
of explaining a lot of the legislation
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
that's come before today he's really
 
03:35:20.790 --> 03:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
done a fabulous job um alcohol is gets
 
03:35:23.630 --> 03:35:23.640 align:start position:0%
into the marketplace based upon how it
 
03:35:26.309 --> 03:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
is categorized so some of the
 
03:35:28.750 --> 03:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
definitions that are part of this you
 
03:35:32.990 --> 03:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
can well imagine um many many years
 
03:35:35.790 --> 03:35:35.800 align:start position:0%
ago what what do you what is a beer well
 
03:35:37.550 --> 03:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's beer it's not you know it's
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
how it's manufactured what's the
 
03:35:41.870 --> 03:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
ingredients and as the marketplace
 
03:35:44.910 --> 03:35:44.920 align:start position:0%
started to started to change some of the
 
03:35:46.990 --> 03:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
formulations have changed and you've
 
03:35:48.710 --> 03:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
seen in this definition for example the
 
03:35:51.269 --> 03:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
reference to herbs and fruits and nuts
 
03:35:54.189 --> 03:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
and things like that which usually that
 
03:35:56.630 --> 03:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
was not many years ago how beer was made
 
03:35:58.990 --> 03:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
it was made with hops and it's kind of a
 
03:36:01.950 --> 03:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
traditional recipe of sorts so depending
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
upon how the product is classified as as
 
03:36:07.189 --> 03:36:07.199 align:start position:0%
the lieutenant has stated product comes
 
03:36:09.030 --> 03:36:09.040 align:start position:0%
into the commission they want it
 
03:36:12.110 --> 03:36:12.120 align:start position:0%
approved for for sale in the state and
 
03:36:15.309 --> 03:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
as a part of that there's a some type of
 
03:36:17.630 --> 03:36:17.640 align:start position:0%
a lab analysis that comes in and says
 
03:36:20.750 --> 03:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
this is what the alcohol content is
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
based upon that it is dropped into the
 
03:36:27.630 --> 03:36:27.640 align:start position:0%
category is it a beverage or a beer of
 
03:36:29.349 --> 03:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
one half of 1% to
 
03:36:33.990 --> 03:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
six is it still a beer but the alcoholic
 
03:36:35.429 --> 03:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
content is
 
03:36:38.790 --> 03:36:38.800 align:start position:0%
higher and as a result it becomes uh the
 
03:36:41.790 --> 03:36:41.800 align:start position:0%
request for a specialty beer
 
03:36:44.469 --> 03:36:44.479 align:start position:0%
and then you have this other category
 
03:36:46.590 --> 03:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
which was established a few years ago
 
03:36:49.910 --> 03:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
which was a specialty beverage and the
 
03:36:51.110 --> 03:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
beverage has to do with the
 
03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:52.990 align:start position:0%
beverage has to do with the
manufacturing

03:36:52.990 --> 03:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
manufacturing
 
03:36:55.229 --> 03:36:55.239 align:start position:0%
ingredients and and that has a lot to
 
03:36:56.910 --> 03:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
drive so for example if you go to the
 
03:36:59.870 --> 03:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
next level Beyond just beverage you can
 
03:37:02.469 --> 03:37:02.479 align:start position:0%
look at wine you can look at table wine
 
03:37:04.550 --> 03:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
table wine goes up to
 
03:37:07.990 --> 03:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
15.5% then you have fortified wine but a
 
03:37:10.630 --> 03:37:10.640 align:start position:0%
lot of this has to do with where the
 
03:37:14.389 --> 03:37:14.399 align:start position:0%
product moves into the marketplace so Mr
 
03:37:19.870 --> 03:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
sh who uh members are wholesalers would
 
03:37:24.389 --> 03:37:24.399 align:start position:0%
distribute beer or anything under 6%
 
03:37:26.870 --> 03:37:26.880 align:start position:0%
alcohol by volume a specialty beer
 
03:37:29.110 --> 03:37:29.120 align:start position:0%
because of what it is they would also
 
03:37:29.120 --> 03:37:30.469 align:start position:0%
because of what it is they would also
distribute

03:37:30.469 --> 03:37:30.479 align:start position:0%
distribute
 
03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
that specialty
 
03:37:35.870 --> 03:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
beverages now has the ability to be
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
distributed by the wholesalers but also
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
sold by The Liquor Commission
 
03:37:42.510 --> 03:37:42.520 align:start position:0%
and the Liquor Commission of course is
 
03:37:47.870 --> 03:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler of wine in the state to
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
other retailers and the exclusive agent
 
03:37:51.279 --> 03:37:52.469 align:start position:0%
other retailers and the exclusive agent
for

03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:37:55.790 --> 03:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
Spirits so uh further question further
 
03:37:58.510 --> 03:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh but what what is
 
03:38:02.550 --> 03:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
the category for wine that is 15%
 
03:38:04.630 --> 03:38:04.640 align:start position:0%
alcohol and what is the category for
 
03:38:08.510 --> 03:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
spirits that are say 20%
 
03:38:11.790 --> 03:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
alcohol 15% Al alcohol wine would be a
 
03:38:14.070 --> 03:38:14.080 align:start position:0%
table wine that's that's how it would be
 
03:38:16.070 --> 03:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
categoried in the statute the statute
 
03:38:18.469 --> 03:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
speaks to a definition in
 
03:38:22.950 --> 03:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
1751 uh defines uh table wines the
 
03:38:25.150 --> 03:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
product that is
 
03:38:28.590 --> 03:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
20% would be be by virtue of its alcohol
 
03:38:31.030 --> 03:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
content would become something that the
 
03:38:34.990 --> 03:38:35.000 align:start position:0%
commission would distribute it would be
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
classified as wine or a spirit and then
 
03:38:41.590 --> 03:38:41.600 align:start position:0%
moved into into the marketplace through
 
03:38:44.870 --> 03:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
the commission's distribution
 
03:38:46.830 --> 03:38:46.840 align:start position:0%
Network thank
 
03:38:52.070 --> 03:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:54.790 --> 03:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
questions just just one question about
 
03:38:58.389 --> 03:38:58.399 align:start position:0%
any beers that are over 12% are they
 
03:39:00.630 --> 03:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
distributed strictly by The Liquor
 
03:39:02.349 --> 03:39:02.359 align:start position:0%
Commission instead of through
 
03:39:03.910 --> 03:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
Distributors because I know there are
 
03:39:05.469 --> 03:39:05.479 align:start position:0%
some beers that are over 12% you can't
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:12.510 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

03:39:12.510 --> 03:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:14.790 --> 03:39:14.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative thank you I'm not
 
03:39:17.229 --> 03:39:17.239 align:start position:0%
aware that the commission is selling
 
03:39:19.150 --> 03:39:19.160 align:start position:0%
some of those products but if there was
 
03:39:20.870 --> 03:39:20.880 align:start position:0%
a product that was to come into the
 
03:39:23.790 --> 03:39:23.800 align:start position:0%
marketplace and have the characteristics
 
03:39:27.630 --> 03:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
of a beverage beer in the way it's
 
03:39:31.229 --> 03:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
produced um and its content was over 12%
 
03:39:33.630 --> 03:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
and not able to be identified as a
 
03:39:36.389 --> 03:39:36.399 align:start position:0%
specialty beer then the distribution
 
03:39:38.229 --> 03:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
would come through the Liquor Commission
 
03:39:40.990 --> 03:39:41.000 align:start position:0%
Sam Adams has one that's 28%
 
03:39:42.269 --> 03:39:42.279 align:start position:0%
then then that would be sold in the
 
03:39:45.189 --> 03:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
stores all right thank you
 
03:39:49.309 --> 03:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative grassy and uh I
 
03:39:51.189 --> 03:39:51.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate the spirit of this bill which
 
03:39:54.630 --> 03:39:54.640 align:start position:0%
is to simplify potentially simplify the
 
03:39:56.510 --> 03:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
statutes because they're easier to
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
enforce and for the public to understand
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
so so maybe there's something we can uh
 
03:40:05.510 --> 03:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
move forward on find out all right thank
 
03:40:07.710 --> 03:40:07.720 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony anyone else would
 
03:40:11.870 --> 03:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
like to testify on this legislation
 
03:40:16.950 --> 03:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.120 --> 03:45:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
1:45

03:45:24.950 --> 03:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:27.910 --> 03:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 39 which is Manchester's WS
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
689 or as I like to call the fight in
 
03:45:34.149 --> 03:45:34.159 align:start position:0%
South End um I'm here to introduce uh
 
03:45:36.309 --> 03:45:36.319 align:start position:0%
hb32 3 sorry
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
1321 um which pertains to the stickers
 
03:45:42.990 --> 03:45:43.000 align:start position:0%
we we currently require be put onto kegs
 
03:45:45.670 --> 03:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
so party on um going to try to get these
 
03:45:48.229 --> 03:45:48.239 align:start position:0%
stickers off um basically what happens
 
03:45:51.189 --> 03:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
is when you buy a um a keg over seven
 
03:45:54.550 --> 03:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
gallons uh in order to sell those the
 
03:45:57.429 --> 03:45:57.439 align:start position:0%
seller has to go to a liquor store the
 
03:45:58.990 --> 03:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
actual Brewer has to go to a liquor
 
03:46:02.950 --> 03:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
store uh get the stickers the tags if
 
03:46:07.189 --> 03:46:07.199 align:start position:0%
you will from The Liquor Commission then
 
03:46:08.870 --> 03:46:08.880 align:start position:0%
they have to go and they have to put the
 
03:46:10.830 --> 03:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
customers personal identifying
 
03:46:14.269 --> 03:46:14.279 align:start position:0%
information on that tag um place it onto
 
03:46:18.910 --> 03:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
the keg and then log it into the um
 
03:46:21.990 --> 03:46:22.000 align:start position:0%
liquor commissions system keep
 
03:46:25.189 --> 03:46:25.199 align:start position:0%
everything in triplicate copy all in the
 
03:46:28.349 --> 03:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
all of for the purpose of preventing the
 
03:46:31.510 --> 03:46:31.520 align:start position:0%
sale and possession of alcohol to miners
 
03:46:33.670 --> 03:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
so in the 20 years that this system has
 
03:46:35.469 --> 03:46:35.479 align:start position:0%
been in placed there has been a grand
 
03:46:38.950 --> 03:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
total of zero times uh that they have
 
03:46:40.870 --> 03:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
actually stopped St a minor from from
 
03:46:43.389 --> 03:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
doing from doing this um The Liquor
 
03:46:44.870 --> 03:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
Commission here I believe is they will
 
03:46:47.550 --> 03:46:47.560 align:start position:0%
testify that it's time to kind of just
 
03:46:48.950 --> 03:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
move on and this is one of those easy
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
things that we can do um they can damage
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
the kegs in the long term they're hard
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
to come off um the term that uh is given
 
03:46:57.309 --> 03:46:57.319 align:start position:0%
by my constituents is it's like super
 
03:46:58.870 --> 03:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
glue trying to get it off so they have
 
03:47:01.670 --> 03:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
to like power wash it it's wild um but
 
03:47:04.269 --> 03:47:04.279 align:start position:0%
this is not um my area of expertise uh
 
03:47:05.550 --> 03:47:05.560 align:start position:0%
so I won't be taking questions I'm going
 
03:47:06.910 --> 03:47:06.920 align:start position:0%
to do what I hate when people do an I'm
 
03:47:07.950 --> 03:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm going to totally not
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
answer your questions but there are
 
03:47:10.670 --> 03:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
plenty of people behind me um that will
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer your questions so
 
03:47:14.469 --> 03:47:14.479 align:start position:0%
thank you guys so
 
03:47:17.309 --> 03:47:17.319 align:start position:0%
much any questions that I won't be
 
03:47:19.870 --> 03:47:19.880 align:start position:0%
taking that I won't be taking thank you
 
03:47:21.349 --> 03:47:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative oh I'm sorry I should say
 
03:47:23.269 --> 03:47:23.279 align:start position:0%
I have an amendment that actually tries
 
03:47:24.790 --> 03:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
I I apologize I do have an amendment in
 
03:47:29.189 --> 03:47:29.199 align:start position:0%
front of you guys uh H uh 2024 0123 H
 
03:47:31.550 --> 03:47:31.560 align:start position:0%
I'm lucky to get that number um that
 
03:47:32.910 --> 03:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
actually kind of fixes what we were
 
03:47:34.790 --> 03:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
trying to do originally but uh didn't
 
03:47:36.790 --> 03:47:36.800 align:start position:0%
quite make it out of OLS in time so
 
03:47:38.189 --> 03:47:38.199 align:start position:0%
while I can't speak to the amendment
 
03:47:39.269 --> 03:47:39.279 align:start position:0%
because that would be inappropriate I do
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
hope the committee will uh look at the
 
03:47:42.469 --> 03:47:42.479 align:start position:0%
amendment because that's what we were
 
03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
trying to do um and maybe save you some
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
time if you decide this is uh worth your
 
03:47:47.870 --> 03:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
efference so thanks guys so much thank

name is Aiden Moore legal coordinator
 
03:48:29.590 --> 03:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
for the Liquor Commission um we just
 
03:48:31.990 --> 03:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to speak briefly to a little bit
 
03:48:35.710 --> 03:48:35.720 align:start position:0%
of the uh history of The Keg label
 
03:48:37.149 --> 03:48:37.159 align:start position:0%
process in case you were interested
 
03:48:39.149 --> 03:48:39.159 align:start position:0%
before you make a decision to repeal it
 
03:48:42.070 --> 03:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
we can tell you why it was put in place
 
03:48:45.309 --> 03:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
um I happen to be uh the chief of
 
03:48:49.510 --> 03:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
enforcement when I wrote this bill so um
 
03:48:51.309 --> 03:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm it's good that I'm here when
 
03:48:54.149 --> 03:48:54.159 align:start position:0%
it might be repealed very useful very
 
03:48:54.159 --> 03:48:55.670 align:start position:0%
it might be repealed very useful very
helps

03:48:55.670 --> 03:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
helps
 
03:48:58.830 --> 03:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
um as you know underage drinking and
 
03:49:00.870 --> 03:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
Public Safety are an extremely important
 
03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
part of the commission's function
 
03:49:06.229 --> 03:49:06.239 align:start position:0%
especially with the division uh of
 
03:49:09.990 --> 03:49:10.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement the intent was looking at
 
03:49:12.830 --> 03:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
some of the best practices that existed
 
03:49:15.710 --> 03:49:15.720 align:start position:0%
around the country back when the bill
 
03:49:19.429 --> 03:49:19.439 align:start position:0%
was brought back in the 9s that keg
 
03:49:22.030 --> 03:49:22.040 align:start position:0%
registration was a
 
03:49:25.269 --> 03:49:25.279 align:start position:0%
promising enforcement process and
 
03:49:28.429 --> 03:49:28.439 align:start position:0%
deterrent for those people who would go
 
03:49:31.950 --> 03:49:31.960 align:start position:0%
and buy keg beer and provide it to
 
03:49:35.830 --> 03:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
miners so you may may or not may or may
 
03:49:37.389 --> 03:49:37.399 align:start position:0%
not have had in your community a case
 
03:49:39.670 --> 03:49:39.680 align:start position:0%
where there's a house party and and the
 
03:49:40.950 --> 03:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
police come and there are a number of
 
03:49:43.630 --> 03:49:43.640 align:start position:0%
young people there and it may have been
 
03:49:46.070 --> 03:49:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the only thing that was Remnant
 
03:49:48.870 --> 03:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
left there was the keg and the question
 
03:49:51.670 --> 03:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
always was who owns The Keg where did
 
03:49:54.590 --> 03:49:54.600 align:start position:0%
The Keg come from who bought it because
 
03:49:57.149 --> 03:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
if you buy alcohol for a minor that's a
 
03:50:00.110 --> 03:50:00.120 align:start position:0%
crime and as a result law enforcement
 
03:50:01.510 --> 03:50:01.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be able to have tools to
 
03:50:04.750 --> 03:50:04.760 align:start position:0%
investigate and Trace back the process
 
03:50:10.030 --> 03:50:10.040 align:start position:0%
to where this product came from um we
 
03:50:13.110 --> 03:50:13.120 align:start position:0%
worked with the industry to try to I'm
 
03:50:15.149 --> 03:50:15.159 align:start position:0%
not sure when you know I I hear the
 
03:50:17.630 --> 03:50:17.640 align:start position:0%
story about glue because the glue was a
 
03:50:20.790 --> 03:50:20.800 align:start position:0%
big issue when we passed this law and uh
 
03:50:23.469 --> 03:50:23.479 align:start position:0%
we went to the industry itself and said
 
03:50:25.389 --> 03:50:25.399 align:start position:0%
you know you put you're the beverage
 
03:50:28.149 --> 03:50:28.159 align:start position:0%
manufacturers you put tags on on your
 
03:50:29.950 --> 03:50:29.960 align:start position:0%
kegs right you you scrub them off when
 
03:50:31.910 --> 03:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
they come in they go yeah what do you
 
03:50:34.750 --> 03:50:34.760 align:start position:0%
put that on with well with glue well
 
03:50:37.389 --> 03:50:37.399 align:start position:0%
we'll use the same glue you use because
 
03:50:38.630 --> 03:50:38.640 align:start position:0%
that way we'll all come off everything
 
03:50:41.229 --> 03:50:41.239 align:start position:0%
will come off same time so that's been
 
03:50:43.590 --> 03:50:43.600 align:start position:0%
the practice is to use the same glue
 
03:50:46.070 --> 03:50:46.080 align:start position:0%
that the industry uses to uh adhere the
 
03:50:48.910 --> 03:50:48.920 align:start position:0%
tags and to remove the tags um I think
 
03:50:51.550 --> 03:50:51.560 align:start position:0%
Lieutenant culber can speak to the cost
 
03:50:56.510 --> 03:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the program and um what it may do if
 
03:50:59.670 --> 03:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
this is repealed to remove some of the
 
03:51:01.429 --> 03:51:01.439 align:start position:0%
responsibilities from the commission and
 
03:51:05.110 --> 03:51:05.120 align:start position:0%
save a little time um but we still are
 
03:51:07.149 --> 03:51:07.159 align:start position:0%
obviously concerned to make sure that
 
03:51:10.550 --> 03:51:10.560 align:start position:0%
law enforcement has the ability to have
 
03:51:12.189 --> 03:51:12.199 align:start position:0%
all the tools necessary to try to
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
enforce this very important function of
 
03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
Public Safety and trying to keep miners
 
03:51:18.950 --> 03:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
from consuming alcohol and the
 
03:51:20.790 --> 03:51:20.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunate tragedies that often occur
 
03:51:23.550 --> 03:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
after that would you like to say
 
03:51:23.560 --> 03:51:26.950 align:start position:0%
after that would you like to say
anything

03:51:26.950 --> 03:51:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:30.710 --> 03:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
M thank you committee members um and
 
03:51:33.429 --> 03:51:33.439 align:start position:0%
certainly uh Mr Moore is absolutely
 
03:51:35.149 --> 03:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
correct the division of enforcement
 
03:51:37.710 --> 03:51:37.720 align:start position:0%
takes underage drinking very seriously
 
03:51:39.630 --> 03:51:39.640 align:start position:0%
um and and wouldn't be recommending
 
03:51:41.309 --> 03:51:41.319 align:start position:0%
anything that would would jeopardize
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
that that uh aspect of the laws um to
 
03:51:47.670 --> 03:51:47.680 align:start position:0%
provide some clarity uh on uh the
 
03:51:49.670 --> 03:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided by the bill
 
03:51:49.680 --> 03:51:51.910 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided by the bill
sponsor

03:51:51.910 --> 03:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
03:51:57.229 --> 03:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
um it is true that um we've had very
 
03:52:00.070 --> 03:52:00.080 align:start position:0%
little reports of any incidents being
 
03:52:05.630 --> 03:52:05.640 align:start position:0%
solved by these keg tags um a few if any
 
03:52:06.830 --> 03:52:06.840 align:start position:0%
um in the time that I've been with the
 
03:52:08.309 --> 03:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission or as a law
 
03:52:09.910 --> 03:52:09.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer
 
03:52:11.550 --> 03:52:11.560 align:start position:0%
um one of the first things that
 
03:52:12.950 --> 03:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
typically is done when a cake is
 
03:52:15.189 --> 03:52:15.199 align:start position:0%
purchased is what you put it in a barrel
 
03:52:19.870 --> 03:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
of ice correct and The Keg tag is
 
03:52:22.870 --> 03:52:22.880 align:start position:0%
usually not very well preserved after
 
03:52:25.790 --> 03:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
spending hours in a bucket of ice um
 
03:52:29.030 --> 03:52:29.040 align:start position:0%
they are very expensive um The Keg tags
 
03:52:29.040 --> 03:52:30.070 align:start position:0%
they are very expensive um The Keg tags
our

03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:52:32.790 --> 03:52:32.800 align:start position:0%
last our last order of the keg tags is
 
03:52:36.670 --> 03:52:36.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere around $88,700 um for a th000
 
03:52:41.309 --> 03:52:41.319 align:start position:0%
cases um of of keg tags so um I'd be
 
03:52:43.030 --> 03:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that you
 
03:52:45.389 --> 03:52:45.399 align:start position:0%
have uh we do have ad administrative
 
03:52:48.469 --> 03:52:48.479 align:start position:0%
rule in existence on on this it's uh uh
 
03:52:50.189 --> 03:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
liquor rule
 
03:52:52.149 --> 03:52:52.159 align:start position:0%
506 um
 
03:52:55.990 --> 03:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
06 uh and that's pursuant to the uh
 
03:52:57.990 --> 03:52:58.000 align:start position:0%
current statute that authorizes the
 
03:53:00.670 --> 03:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
administrative rule to be
 
03:53:02.670 --> 03:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
there thank
 
03:53:02.680 --> 03:53:04.389 align:start position:0%
there thank
you

03:53:04.389 --> 03:53:04.399 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:53:07.110 --> 03:53:07.120 align:start position:0%
representative so what what is your
 
03:53:08.630 --> 03:53:08.640 align:start position:0%
position like do you think that this is
 
03:53:10.229 --> 03:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
something that we should try to keep or
 
03:53:11.550 --> 03:53:11.560 align:start position:0%
is this something that you're like yeah
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's move on it wasn't clear from
 
03:53:16.309 --> 03:53:16.319 align:start position:0%
what you just I appreciate that
 
03:53:18.309 --> 03:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative um I believe the
 
03:53:19.990 --> 03:53:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission as a whole will will remain
 
03:53:23.990 --> 03:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
neutral on this bill um however I I do
 
03:53:28.269 --> 03:53:28.279 align:start position:0%
believe that um the intent of this bill
 
03:53:28.279 --> 03:53:29.990 align:start position:0%
believe that um the intent of this bill
uh

03:53:29.990 --> 03:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:53:33.510 --> 03:53:33.520 align:start position:0%
the practices that we've seen with the
 
03:53:36.550 --> 03:53:36.560 align:start position:0%
intended um the intent of this
 
03:53:41.550 --> 03:53:41.560 align:start position:0%
protecting has moved beyond that um uh
 
03:53:44.189 --> 03:53:44.199 align:start position:0%
in that it's not effective right now
 
03:53:45.550 --> 03:53:45.560 align:start position:0%
basically right it's not effective
 
03:53:47.750 --> 03:53:47.760 align:start position:0%
anymore thank you
 
03:53:50.309 --> 03:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
thanks than you representative
 
03:53:53.510 --> 03:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair I'm just trying
 
03:53:56.070 --> 03:53:56.080 align:start position:0%
to figure out the difference between the
 
03:53:58.950 --> 03:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
original bill and the amendment and the
 
03:54:01.229 --> 03:54:01.239 align:start position:0%
only things that I can see are the
 
03:54:03.790 --> 03:54:03.800 align:start position:0%
amendment adds the words uh the
 
03:54:06.990 --> 03:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
differences are in the definition of K
 
03:54:09.870 --> 03:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
and the amendment has the words refill
 
03:54:11.830 --> 03:54:11.840 align:start position:0%
um which makes perfect sense no no
 
03:54:15.990 --> 03:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
question about that um and then changes
 
03:54:19.510 --> 03:54:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh just at the end um uh the end of the
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
definition s gallons to 64 fluid ounces
 
03:54:26.389 --> 03:54:26.399 align:start position:0%
which is half a
 
03:54:29.550 --> 03:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
gallon and is that intentional change
 
03:54:32.550 --> 03:54:32.560 align:start position:0%
from seven gallons to half a
 
03:54:34.990 --> 03:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
gallon thank you representative I I
 
03:54:37.229 --> 03:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
don't have a copy of the current
 
03:54:39.469 --> 03:54:39.479 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe that was just
 
03:54:41.189 --> 03:54:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh well the the sponsor didn't want to
 
03:54:47.830 --> 03:54:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:55.550 --> 03:54:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:58.990 --> 03:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
o okay looking at line nine of the
 
03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:37.790 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

03:55:37.790 --> 03:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:37.800 --> 03:55:46.670 align:start position:0%
 
than

03:55:46.670 --> 03:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:49.349 --> 03:55:49.359 align:start position:0%
um I believe representative I I think
 
03:55:52.269 --> 03:55:52.279 align:start position:0%
the this bill sponsor May best be able
 
03:55:54.590 --> 03:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
to answer this um the way I see this is
 
03:55:59.229 --> 03:55:59.239 align:start position:0%
that the the uh change in this is
 
03:56:02.469 --> 03:56:02.479 align:start position:0%
refillable and changing s gallons to 64
 
03:56:04.149 --> 03:56:04.159 align:start position:0%
fluid ounces and I I don't know why that
 
03:56:08.110 --> 03:56:08.120 align:start position:0%
was done if well is the sponsor sorry is
 
03:56:11.149 --> 03:56:11.159 align:start position:0%
the sponsor willing to take the
 
03:56:14.670 --> 03:56:14.680 align:start position:0%
question all right um Let me let me get
 
03:56:17.429 --> 03:56:17.439 align:start position:0%
my point in here I think technically the
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
bill as introduced is what we can talk
 
03:56:21.510 --> 03:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
about today the amendment will be
 
03:56:28.030 --> 03:56:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:31.349 --> 03:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:33.870 --> 03:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
representative any more
 
03:56:36.229 --> 03:56:36.239 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you gentlemen I
 
03:56:41.389 --> 03:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
appreciate it uh I think Kristen
 
03:56:45.309 --> 03:56:45.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:51.070 --> 03:56:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:53.070 --> 03:56:53.080 align:start position:0%
there up
 
03:57:00.389 --> 03:57:00.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:04.189 --> 03:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
Car hi so I'm Kristen NBS I'm co-founder
 
03:57:05.790 --> 03:57:05.800 align:start position:0%
and owner of Tuckerman Brewing Company
 
03:57:06.990 --> 03:57:07.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm also president of the New
 
03:57:09.149 --> 03:57:09.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Brewers Association and I can
 
03:57:11.429 --> 03:57:11.439 align:start position:0%
speak to the scrap metal piece of this
 
03:57:14.830 --> 03:57:14.840 align:start position:0%
uh the amendment as well when uh when we
 
03:57:18.110 --> 03:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
proposed the bill to get rid of the RSA
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
involving the keg registration tags it
 
03:57:24.030 --> 03:57:24.040 align:start position:0%
was linked to the scrap metal RSA and
 
03:57:26.710 --> 03:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
when we looked at that um it had the
 
03:57:28.750 --> 03:57:28.760 align:start position:0%
definition of a keg as over seven
 
03:57:30.910 --> 03:57:30.920 align:start position:0%
gallons uh but a lot of Us sell five
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
gallon kegs too so seeing as it was
 
03:57:34.469 --> 03:57:34.479 align:start position:0%
already being looked at we asked it it
 
03:57:37.590 --> 03:57:37.600 align:start position:0%
be changed to a smaller
 
03:57:37.600 --> 03:57:39.590 align:start position:0%
be changed to a smaller
volume

03:57:39.590 --> 03:57:39.600 align:start position:0%
volume
 
03:57:43.229 --> 03:57:43.239 align:start position:0%
thank you okay uh but yes but my name is
 
03:57:45.389 --> 03:57:45.399 align:start position:0%
Carson nevs and I'm here in support of
 
03:57:48.030 --> 03:57:48.040 align:start position:0%
this bill um we've been selling kegs for
 
03:57:49.429 --> 03:57:49.439 align:start position:0%
many years at our Brewery since we
 
03:57:51.429 --> 03:57:51.439 align:start position:0%
opened in '98 and we've had to fill out
 
03:57:54.070 --> 03:57:54.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of these keg tags over the years
 
03:57:56.229 --> 03:57:56.239 align:start position:0%
um and it seems like whenever anybody
 
03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
wants to purchase a keg it's at our
 
03:57:59.950 --> 03:57:59.960 align:start position:0%
busiest times on a Saturday afternoon
 
03:58:02.389 --> 03:58:02.399 align:start position:0%
and it takes a fair amount of time uh
 
03:58:04.550 --> 03:58:04.560 align:start position:0%
for the customer to fill out the
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
information um and then also another
 
03:58:09.309 --> 03:58:09.319 align:start position:0%
part of the problem for us is that we
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
have to get the keg books at the liquor
 
03:58:14.710 --> 03:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
store and when we go to the liquor store
 
03:58:16.429 --> 03:58:16.439 align:start position:0%
um they don't do a lot of The Keg
 
03:58:19.189 --> 03:58:19.199 align:start position:0%
registration tags for for retailers like
 
03:58:21.070 --> 03:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
us so there's a lot of confusion as to
 
03:58:23.269 --> 03:58:23.279 align:start position:0%
how to issue them to us and it's kind of
 
03:58:25.550 --> 03:58:25.560 align:start position:0%
a lengthy process of checking them out
 
03:58:27.750 --> 03:58:27.760 align:start position:0%
and registering the books uh so it takes
 
03:58:30.269 --> 03:58:30.279 align:start position:0%
some time and in fact our manager was at
 
03:58:32.670 --> 03:58:32.680 align:start position:0%
the liquor store in Conway yesterday and
 
03:58:34.229 --> 03:58:34.239 align:start position:0%
got turned away after spending about a
 
03:58:35.790 --> 03:58:35.800 align:start position:0%
half hour there as people tried to
 
03:58:37.670 --> 03:58:37.680 align:start position:0%
figure out how to issue the The Keg Tag
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
books to us so that takes a fair amount
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
of time and also uh The Liquor
 
03:58:44.870 --> 03:58:44.880 align:start position:0%
Commission uh comes to the brewery
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
multiple times a year to do audits of
 
03:58:48.710 --> 03:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
our records and when they do that they
 
03:58:50.070 --> 03:58:50.080 align:start position:0%
have to go through the registration
 
03:58:52.750 --> 03:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
books uh Page by Page make sure that
 
03:58:54.590 --> 03:58:54.600 align:start position:0%
they were filled out correctly so that
 
03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
takes a lot of extra time for both us
 
03:58:58.950 --> 03:58:58.960 align:start position:0%
and the Auditors to go through uh and
 
03:59:00.710 --> 03:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
then as as people have mentioned before
 
03:59:03.110 --> 03:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
about the glue uh you know the Liquor
 
03:59:04.990 --> 03:59:05.000 align:start position:0%
Commission should be applauded for this
 
03:59:07.149 --> 03:59:07.159 align:start position:0%
for finding the supplier on these things
 
03:59:09.229 --> 03:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
because they the glue on them is super
 
03:59:11.790 --> 03:59:11.800 align:start position:0%
strength and you cannot get it off um so
 
03:59:13.950 --> 03:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
we spend like many many hours trying to
 
03:59:15.550 --> 03:59:15.560 align:start position:0%
soak them and scrub them and scrape them
 
03:59:17.830 --> 03:59:17.840 align:start position:0%
off of the Kegs and uh it's really hard
 
03:59:20.349 --> 03:59:20.359 align:start position:0%
to get them off and it has a lot of the
 
03:59:22.349 --> 03:59:22.359 align:start position:0%
customers personal information on there
 
03:59:25.870 --> 03:59:25.880 align:start position:0%
so it seems like a a security kind of
 
03:59:27.229 --> 03:59:27.239 align:start position:0%
breach to the people's personal
 
03:59:29.269 --> 03:59:29.279 align:start position:0%
information to have them on
 
03:59:31.550 --> 03:59:31.560 align:start position:0%
there uh but yeah I'm happy to answer
 
03:59:33.870 --> 03:59:33.880 align:start position:0%
any questions as
 
03:59:36.630 --> 03:59:36.640 align:start position:0%
well thank you
 
03:59:39.189 --> 03:59:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative thank you very much um do
 
03:59:42.710 --> 03:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
you did you submit your testimony um to
 
03:59:45.590 --> 03:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
the committee uh no I did not would you
 
03:59:48.110 --> 03:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
be able to do that sure thank
 
03:59:52.950 --> 03:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
questions raise your hand well I just
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
tapped you okay represent representative
 
04:00:03.229 --> 04:00:03.239 align:start position:0%
Heber my my question is uh I'm pretty
 
04:00:06.429 --> 04:00:06.439 align:start position:0%
naive about this but we went from seven
 
04:00:08.870 --> 04:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
gallons to a half a gallon
 
04:00:11.510 --> 04:00:11.520 align:start position:0%
oh four gallons four gallons what was
 
04:00:15.550 --> 04:00:15.560 align:start position:0%
the size uh 64 ounces I think 163 yeah
 
04:00:17.349 --> 04:00:17.359 align:start position:0%
four gallons half a gallon four gallons
 
04:00:19.990 --> 04:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
so so you've got a smaller
 
04:00:23.429 --> 04:00:23.439 align:start position:0%
ceg uh and and if and if this U
 
04:00:26.630 --> 04:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
legislation was were to be passed you
 
04:00:31.070 --> 04:00:31.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have uh I'm just
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
curious I'm just need to know that
 
04:00:37.910 --> 04:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh there do you need to have uh some
 
04:00:41.750 --> 04:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
sort of record of this I mean so the
 
04:00:44.389 --> 04:00:44.399 align:start position:0%
change the change of the volume was was
 
04:00:48.189 --> 04:00:48.199 align:start position:0%
related to this um scrap metal RSA which
 
04:00:51.389 --> 04:00:51.399 align:start position:0%
asks like a scrap metal uh company if
 
04:00:53.510 --> 04:00:53.520 align:start position:0%
they find a brewery's keg not to just
 
04:00:56.469 --> 04:00:56.479 align:start position:0%
scrap it for the metal value because the
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
kegs are very expensive for the
 
04:01:00.710 --> 04:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
breweries uh they're $150 for a
 
04:01:03.189 --> 04:01:03.199 align:start position:0%
full-size keg and even a five gallon keg
 
04:01:06.990 --> 04:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
costs over $100 so uh there was an RSA
 
04:01:09.590 --> 04:01:09.600 align:start position:0%
that was added uh many years ago to try
 
04:01:11.189 --> 04:01:11.199 align:start position:0%
to get the scrap metal suppliers to
 
04:01:13.830 --> 04:01:13.840 align:start position:0%
contact the breweries if they got any in
 
04:01:16.710 --> 04:01:16.720 align:start position:0%
um so unfortunately in order to get rid
 
04:01:19.630 --> 04:01:19.640 align:start position:0%
of The Keg registration tags it's tied
 
04:01:22.710 --> 04:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
legislatively to the scrap metal RSA so
 
04:01:25.110 --> 04:01:25.120 align:start position:0%
that's why this amendment is coming up
 
04:01:27.550 --> 04:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
if if the amendment passes and all this
 
04:01:31.110 --> 04:01:31.120 align:start position:0%
you're going to have more sales of kegs
 
04:01:33.750 --> 04:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
probably because they're smaller um no
 
04:01:35.910 --> 04:01:35.920 align:start position:0%
we already sell the K the smaller kegs
 
04:01:37.710 --> 04:01:37.720 align:start position:0%
now in fact the majority of the kegs
 
04:01:41.750 --> 04:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
that we sell are uh 5.17 gallons but for
 
04:01:44.149 --> 04:01:44.159 align:start position:0%
some reason the keg reg registration
 
04:01:45.990 --> 04:01:46.000 align:start position:0%
tags are only required for the fulls
 
04:01:50.830 --> 04:01:50.840 align:start position:0%
size keg which is uh 15.5 gallons so
 
04:01:52.349 --> 04:01:52.359 align:start position:0%
that's you know that's another thing
 
04:01:53.950 --> 04:01:53.960 align:start position:0%
with the keg registration tags that
 
04:01:56.110 --> 04:01:56.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't makes sense is that the volume
 
04:01:57.630 --> 04:01:57.640 align:start position:0%
that people actually want which is a
 
04:01:59.469 --> 04:01:59.479 align:start position:0%
smaller size keg they don't even require
 
04:02:02.550 --> 04:02:02.560 align:start position:0%
a tag for so and and I should have
 
04:02:04.189 --> 04:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier you know the first
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
thing that we do when we sell beer of
 
04:02:09.309 --> 04:02:09.319 align:start position:0%
any package size is is ID somebody and
 
04:02:11.750 --> 04:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
make sure they're of age so The Keg
 
04:02:13.670 --> 04:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
registration tags are are sort of
 
04:02:15.910 --> 04:02:15.920 align:start position:0%
redundant and also just a lot of time
 
04:02:19.349 --> 04:02:19.359 align:start position:0%
and energy for everybody so um further
 
04:02:22.670 --> 04:02:22.680 align:start position:0%
question is is uh so you have a system
 
04:02:22.680 --> 04:02:23.670 align:start position:0%
question is is uh so you have a system
of

04:02:23.670 --> 04:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:02:26.030 --> 04:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
recording how many of these kegs you
 
04:02:27.910 --> 04:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
sold and to
 
04:02:31.750 --> 04:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
whom so right now uh through the the for
 
04:02:33.750 --> 04:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
The Keg registration tags we have to
 
04:02:36.670 --> 04:02:36.680 align:start position:0%
record a person's name and address no
 
04:02:38.510 --> 04:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
forget the tag I'm just I'm just
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have but in general if
 
04:02:41.670 --> 04:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
we didn't have the tags we wouldn't
 
04:02:44.070 --> 04:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily have a record of who we sold
 
04:02:46.790 --> 04:02:46.800 align:start position:0%
beer to other than the information on
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
the POS system if they paid with a
 
04:02:49.429 --> 04:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
credit card we would have that
 
04:02:53.149 --> 04:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
information but not with cash but 95% of
 
04:02:54.950 --> 04:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
our customers pay with credit cards now
 
04:02:57.550 --> 04:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
so we do have some record there but but
 
04:02:59.070 --> 04:02:59.080 align:start position:0%
you check how old they are I mean you
 
04:03:02.189 --> 04:03:02.199 align:start position:0%
know yeah yep okay absolutely all right
 
04:03:02.199 --> 04:03:04.790 align:start position:0%
know yeah yep okay absolutely all right
thank

04:03:04.790 --> 04:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:07.469 --> 04:03:07.479 align:start position:0%
you uh any question uh representative
 
04:03:07.479 --> 04:03:09.510 align:start position:0%
you uh any question uh representative
Gibb

04:03:09.510 --> 04:03:09.520 align:start position:0%
Gibb
 
04:03:12.309 --> 04:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just to be sure we're
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
all on the same page and everything
 
04:03:14.080 --> 04:03:15.429 align:start position:0%
all on the same page and everything
makes

04:03:15.429 --> 04:03:15.439 align:start position:0%
makes
 
04:03:20.469 --> 04:03:20.479 align:start position:0%
sense 64 fluid ounces is half a
 
04:03:23.429 --> 04:03:23.439 align:start position:0%
gallon was that intentional half a
 
04:03:26.269 --> 04:03:26.279 align:start position:0%
gallon uh yeah the intent was just to to
 
04:03:29.950 --> 04:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:32.229 --> 04:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
size that that's not an actual I mean
 
04:03:33.990 --> 04:03:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's not really a keg size that
 
04:03:36.030 --> 04:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
anybody uses but I think the the
 
04:03:37.550 --> 04:03:37.560 align:start position:0%
intention was just to reduce it to
 
04:03:39.309 --> 04:03:39.319 align:start position:0%
something really small just so that we
 
04:03:41.110 --> 04:03:41.120 align:start position:0%
would be contacted if any refillable
 
04:03:42.750 --> 04:03:42.760 align:start position:0%
container showed up at a scrapyard in
 
04:03:45.670 --> 04:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
the state thank
 
04:03:49.389 --> 04:03:49.399 align:start position:0%
you I I have a question so for the
 
04:03:53.510 --> 04:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
fullsize kegs you do have to have the
 
04:03:57.070 --> 04:03:57.080 align:start position:0%
records for the mini kegs you don't
 
04:03:59.269 --> 04:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
that's correct so if I walked in instead
 
04:04:02.070 --> 04:04:02.080 align:start position:0%
of getting one of these jamong us guys I
 
04:04:05.910 --> 04:04:05.920 align:start position:0%
I picked up four small kegs which was
 
04:04:10.429 --> 04:04:10.439 align:start position:0%
more than this as long as I show 21 I
 
04:04:12.910 --> 04:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
can take them away yep that's correct
 
04:04:15.510 --> 04:04:15.520 align:start position:0%
yeah you
 
04:04:19.469 --> 04:04:19.479 align:start position:0%
don't well I'm inviting you
 
04:04:23.990 --> 04:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
too and also uh second second
 
04:04:28.750 --> 04:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
question can you not get these tags that
 
04:04:33.189 --> 04:04:33.199 align:start position:0%
for the big guys in advance from the
 
04:04:35.510 --> 04:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
Conway state store instead of having to
 
04:04:37.950 --> 04:04:37.960 align:start position:0%
go down oh I need two tags today I need
 
04:04:40.429 --> 04:04:40.439 align:start position:0%
need three tags to can't you get a a
 
04:04:43.670 --> 04:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
stack of like 20 uh they don't usually
 
04:04:46.229 --> 04:04:46.239 align:start position:0%
have 20 on hand but we do usually go and
 
04:04:48.349 --> 04:04:48.359 align:start position:0%
try to get at least um at least four or
 
04:04:50.429 --> 04:04:50.439 align:start position:0%
five booklets at a time so we don't have
 
04:04:52.149 --> 04:04:52.159 align:start position:0%
to run to the the liquor store every
 
04:04:54.750 --> 04:04:54.760 align:start position:0%
single time we sell a keg uh but we have
 
04:04:56.950 --> 04:04:56.960 align:start position:0%
to fill out the tag and the information
 
04:04:58.389 --> 04:04:58.399 align:start position:0%
I also brought one with me if you guys
 
04:05:00.510 --> 04:05:00.520 align:start position:0%
want to see it so this is a state
 
04:05:03.790 --> 04:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
Logistics problem that they don't have a
 
04:05:07.149 --> 04:05:07.159 align:start position:0%
quantity of these in our high Recreation
 
04:05:09.710 --> 04:05:09.720 align:start position:0%
areas where you will typically find
 
04:05:13.990 --> 04:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
spirits well yeah unfortunately they
 
04:05:18.189 --> 04:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
just I don't think they really serve a
 
04:05:20.229 --> 04:05:20.239 align:start position:0%
purpose because we're carding everybody
 
04:05:22.630 --> 04:05:22.640 align:start position:0%
for any package size anyway and the
 
04:05:24.830 --> 04:05:24.840 align:start position:0%
smaller kegs like you said you can buy
 
04:05:27.910 --> 04:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
three what we call a log uh because it's
 
04:05:30.389 --> 04:05:30.399 align:start position:0%
tall and narrow um so you can buy three
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
logs it's the same volume as one half
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
barrel keg it's easier to move around
 
04:05:35.710 --> 04:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
you can get a variety of different beers
 
04:05:38.790 --> 04:05:38.800 align:start position:0%
so most people go that route um um a lot
 
04:05:40.750 --> 04:05:40.760 align:start position:0%
of the consumers that purchase kegs from
 
04:05:42.870 --> 04:05:42.880 align:start position:0%
us are regulars that have kegerators in
 
04:05:44.269 --> 04:05:44.279 align:start position:0%
their house and a lot of them like to
 
04:05:47.030 --> 04:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a variety of beers so many of them
 
04:05:48.750 --> 04:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
purchase the smaller kegs and there
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
there is not the requirement for the
 
04:05:53.149 --> 04:05:53.159 align:start position:0%
registration tag uh but but when we do
 
04:05:54.550 --> 04:05:54.560 align:start position:0%
have somebody that wants one then we
 
04:05:55.950 --> 04:05:55.960 align:start position:0%
have to go through those extra efforts
 
04:05:57.830 --> 04:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
and it just is pretty timec
 
04:06:00.750 --> 04:06:00.760 align:start position:0%

sponsor on HB 1330 four which is
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the sale of beer and

refillable
 
04:15:44.389 --> 04:15:44.399 align:start position:0%
containers um I'm going to really it's a
 
04:15:46.550 --> 04:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
very quick easy short bill so I'm going
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
to read uh the one new paragraph and it
 
04:15:52.710 --> 04:15:52.720 align:start position:0%
says where a liy is authorized the
 
04:15:55.750 --> 04:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
retail sale of beer in a refillable
 
04:15:59.750 --> 04:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
container such lensey at his discretion
 
04:16:02.429 --> 04:16:02.439 align:start position:0%
may fill such refillable container with
 
04:16:05.189 --> 04:16:05.199 align:start position:0%
his product regardless of The Branding
 
04:16:08.870 --> 04:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the refillable container I'll note
 
04:16:12.950 --> 04:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
that um one important word in here is
 
04:16:15.670 --> 04:16:15.680 align:start position:0%
the sale of beer this is only uh
 
04:16:17.830 --> 04:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
regarding beer it's not any beverages
 
04:16:20.189 --> 04:16:20.199 align:start position:0%
when I first brought the my wording to
 
04:16:24.070 --> 04:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
the OS they they made it similar to a
 
04:16:25.469 --> 04:16:25.479 align:start position:0%
previous bill that I'm going to talk
 
04:16:28.030 --> 04:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
about which was any beverage this is
 
04:16:30.309 --> 04:16:30.319 align:start position:0%
specifically for
 
04:16:34.790 --> 04:16:34.800 align:start position:0%
beer so the reason for this today is
 
04:16:38.830 --> 04:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
really to clarify um as I said back in
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
2001 for anybody who was on this
 
04:16:43.389 --> 04:16:43.399 align:start position:0%
committee a representative PR Prime
 
04:16:46.309 --> 04:16:46.319 align:start position:0%
sponsor had introduced HB
 
04:16:49.070 --> 04:16:49.080 align:start position:0%
403 during that testimony which I went
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
back and
 
04:16:53.590 --> 04:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
reviewed uh an attorney from The Liquor
 
04:16:56.030 --> 04:16:56.040 align:start position:0%
Commission uh when he
 
04:17:01.070 --> 04:17:01.080 align:start position:0%
testified said that bill was not needed
 
04:17:04.149 --> 04:17:04.159 align:start position:0%
because it was already permitted
 
04:17:05.910 --> 04:17:05.920 align:start position:0%
although it didn't specifically say
 
04:17:08.590 --> 04:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
within the RSA that was permitted he
 
04:17:12.149 --> 04:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
said there's nothing that prevented a um
 
04:17:15.870 --> 04:17:15.880 align:start position:0%
a brewer from actually refilling a
 
04:17:15.880 --> 04:17:17.670 align:start position:0%
a brewer from actually refilling a
growler

04:17:17.670 --> 04:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
growler
 
04:17:20.149 --> 04:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
um with his beer even though it said
 
04:17:21.990 --> 04:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
something different on it and for those
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
of you who do not know what a growler is
 
04:17:28.710 --> 04:17:28.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not allowed to show props here but
 
04:17:32.550 --> 04:17:32.560 align:start position:0%
after the no there are no Growlers on
 
04:17:36.309 --> 04:17:36.319 align:start position:0%
there but I do have a couple from my
 
04:17:37.870 --> 04:17:37.880 align:start position:0%
vast colle ction with me that I'd be
 
04:17:41.790 --> 04:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
happy to show you after the after the
 
04:17:44.269 --> 04:17:44.279 align:start position:0%
hearing um so anyway as I was saying
 
04:17:46.550 --> 04:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
back on that bill um the liquor
 
04:17:48.510 --> 04:17:48.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh the attorney from the
 
04:17:51.030 --> 04:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
liquor commissioner said that there was
 
04:17:53.910 --> 04:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
no prohi uh prohibition against it so
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative Prout at the end of the
 
04:17:56.750 --> 04:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
hearing said well I guess we don't
 
04:17:58.630 --> 04:17:58.640 align:start position:0%
really need to do this and they dropped
 
04:18:03.550 --> 04:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
it well the problem with that was
 
04:18:08.550 --> 04:18:08.560 align:start position:0%
um we had contradictions going forward
 
04:18:11.349 --> 04:18:11.359 align:start position:0%
contradictions and uh lacks of
 
04:18:13.030 --> 04:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
clarification I'm going to give you two
 
04:18:15.030 --> 04:18:15.040 align:start position:0%
examples of that and then you will hear
 
04:18:18.910 --> 04:18:18.920 align:start position:0%
actually from one U micr Brewer um he'll
 
04:18:20.790 --> 04:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
be testifying here shortly to the second
 
04:18:23.590 --> 04:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
one I'll I'll mention briefly the first
 
04:18:26.630 --> 04:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
one is my local Brewer as an example and
 
04:18:28.429 --> 04:18:28.439 align:start position:0%
I've asked others as I've traveled
 
04:18:31.309 --> 04:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
around they just simply don't think
 
04:18:33.149 --> 04:18:33.159 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to do it you know I
 
04:18:35.349 --> 04:18:35.359 align:start position:0%
brought in uh a growler one time to my
 
04:18:37.109 --> 04:18:37.119 align:start position:0%
local Brewer top water brewing in
 
04:18:39.429 --> 04:18:39.439 align:start position:0%
barington I said hey um can I do you
 
04:18:41.070 --> 04:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
have any Growlers I'd like to buy one no
 
04:18:42.309 --> 04:18:42.319 align:start position:0%
we're out of them I said can you fill
 
04:18:45.070 --> 04:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
one of my my Growlers oh no we can't do
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
that I said there's nothing prevents
 
04:18:48.550 --> 04:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
that he goes yeah I know we'd like to
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing that says we can
 
04:18:54.269 --> 04:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
okay the second issue was although we
 
04:18:57.309 --> 04:18:57.319 align:start position:0%
had on tape from HB
 
04:18:59.389 --> 04:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
403 the attorney from The Liquor
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
Commission saying there is no
 
04:19:03.309 --> 04:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
prohibition and you'll hear from our
 
04:19:05.429 --> 04:19:05.439 align:start position:0%
Brewer who's going to testify here
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
shortly that in fact the liquor
 
04:19:11.950 --> 04:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
inspector told him no you can't do that
 
04:19:13.510 --> 04:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
so we're having
 
04:19:13.520 --> 04:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
so we're having
conflicting

04:19:15.510 --> 04:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
conflicting
 
04:19:18.910 --> 04:19:18.920 align:start position:0%
um counsel from uh different individuals
 
04:19:20.550 --> 04:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
within the Liquor Commission so this
 
04:19:22.990 --> 04:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
bill here is
 
04:19:26.429 --> 04:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
simply meant to clarify and delineate
 
04:19:28.950 --> 04:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
once and for all there's no proh uh
 
04:19:32.830 --> 04:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:37.349 --> 04:19:37.359 align:start position:0%
it now what I passed out in front of you
 
04:19:41.870 --> 04:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
is as I Was preparing this bill in my
 
04:19:44.590 --> 04:19:44.600 align:start position:0%
travels I uh my past time favorite
 
04:19:46.910 --> 04:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
pasttime is visiting micro
 
04:19:46.920 --> 04:19:49.790 align:start position:0%
pasttime is visiting micro
breweries

04:19:49.790 --> 04:19:49.800 align:start position:0%
breweries
 
04:19:53.910 --> 04:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
and what you have in front of you is
 
04:19:55.750 --> 04:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
what I would
 
04:19:55.760 --> 04:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
what I would
consider

04:19:57.590 --> 04:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
consider
 
04:19:59.630 --> 04:19:59.640 align:start position:0%
misbranding I'm not opposed to it
 
04:20:01.389 --> 04:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
because I don't think it really matters
 
04:20:03.990 --> 04:20:04.000 align:start position:0%
but it's a great example of what I would
 
04:20:05.429 --> 04:20:05.439 align:start position:0%
consider Miss branding and if you look
 
04:20:08.389 --> 04:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
in the first picture
 
04:20:10.950 --> 04:20:10.960 align:start position:0%
that was a beer I got at Peppers Landing
 
04:20:14.750 --> 04:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
in Rochester and I ordered a stoneface
 
04:20:16.630 --> 04:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
brewing IPA which is made down in
 
04:20:19.550 --> 04:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
Portsmouth New Hampshire so the Stone
 
04:20:23.229 --> 04:20:23.239 align:start position:0%
Face came in a pint glass that didn't
 
04:20:26.630 --> 04:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
say stoneface Brewing on it again
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
happens all the time not opposed to it
 
04:20:31.910 --> 04:20:31.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter to me the second one
 
04:20:35.070 --> 04:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see is a Shipyard Brewing glass
 
04:20:37.189 --> 04:20:37.199 align:start position:0%
from Portland Maine
 
04:20:39.469 --> 04:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
and they make okay beers to be honest
 
04:20:41.910 --> 04:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
but what I have in there is a
 
04:20:45.109 --> 04:20:45.119 align:start position:0%
litherman's brewing misguided Angel IPA
 
04:20:47.550 --> 04:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
litherman's is down in the south side of
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
conquer here so we have a litherman's
 
04:20:53.389 --> 04:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
brewing IPA being served in a shipyard
 
04:20:57.070 --> 04:20:57.080 align:start position:0%
glass at tandies across the street again
 
04:20:58.710 --> 04:20:58.720 align:start position:0%
who cares
 
04:21:02.550 --> 04:21:02.560 align:start position:0%
right the last one I have it's my
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
favorite I have an escape Brewing
 
04:21:07.030 --> 04:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
Company this was actually taken down I
 
04:21:09.630 --> 04:21:09.640 align:start position:0%
took this picture in Florida uh I have
 
04:21:11.990 --> 04:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
what they call an other coast west other
 
04:21:14.750 --> 04:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
West Coast IPA served in of all things a
 
04:21:18.349 --> 04:21:18.359 align:start position:0%
Bud Light Glass and again doesn't matter
 
04:21:19.790 --> 04:21:19.800 align:start position:0%
to me I don't care what I'm drinking out
 
04:21:21.590 --> 04:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
of just like I don't care when I take
 
04:21:23.710 --> 04:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
one of my Growlers and go to top water
 
04:21:28.030 --> 04:21:28.040 align:start position:0%
Brewing if it says um Alcatraz Brewing
 
04:21:31.149 --> 04:21:31.159 align:start position:0%
on it I don't care what it says on the
 
04:21:32.990 --> 04:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
bottle what I care is what comes out of
 
04:21:37.349 --> 04:21:37.359 align:start position:0%
it and I would contend that in fact
 
04:21:40.269 --> 04:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
um a brewer using a growler at a micr
 
04:21:44.469 --> 04:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:47.790 --> 04:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
um frame on it name on
 
04:21:52.469 --> 04:21:52.479 align:start position:0%
it is you're getting a much better idea
 
04:21:54.109 --> 04:21:54.119 align:start position:0%
of what what's actually going in because
 
04:21:56.030 --> 04:21:56.040 align:start position:0%
for anybody who who who's not familiar
 
04:21:57.469 --> 04:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
with it you take your Growler you go up
 
04:22:00.109 --> 04:22:00.119 align:start position:0%
to the micr he fills it in front of you
 
04:22:02.429 --> 04:22:02.439 align:start position:0%
you see what's going in normally they'll
 
04:22:04.790 --> 04:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
throw a tag on it telling you what it is
 
04:22:06.870 --> 04:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
and you go home when you order a a beer
 
04:22:07.750 --> 04:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
in a
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
restaurant you're s most of the time
 
04:22:12.349 --> 04:22:12.359 align:start position:0%
you're not even close to where you're
 
04:22:15.670 --> 04:22:15.680 align:start position:0%
sitting uh where they pour the beer so
 
04:22:19.910 --> 04:22:19.920 align:start position:0%
in actuality when I order stoneface IPA
 
04:22:21.950 --> 04:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
um at Pepper's Landing I don't know if
 
04:22:24.389 --> 04:22:24.399 align:start position:0%
I'm really get in a stone face IPA
 
04:22:26.870 --> 04:22:26.880 align:start position:0%
whereas with a growler in fact that's
 
04:22:34.030 --> 04:22:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:36.870 --> 04:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
for um the last point
 
04:22:39.750 --> 04:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
uh before I close up here was kind of
 
04:22:41.550 --> 04:22:41.560 align:start position:0%
along the lines what I was just saying
 
04:22:43.429 --> 04:22:43.439 align:start position:0%
there and that is the purchaser when you
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
use a growler the purchaser knows what
 
04:22:47.750 --> 04:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
he's getting because he can see it and
 
04:22:50.030 --> 04:22:50.040 align:start position:0%
the seller knows what he's putting in
 
04:22:53.550 --> 04:22:53.560 align:start position:0%
there so as I said this is meant to
 
04:22:57.750 --> 04:22:57.760 align:start position:0%
clarify um what the attorney for House
 
04:23:01.389 --> 04:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
Bill 403 in 2021 said that there is no
 
04:23:03.070 --> 04:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
prohibition against it so we're just
 
04:23:06.389 --> 04:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
putting that into the RSA so there is no
 
04:23:09.070 --> 04:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
um uh interpretation issues for the
 
04:23:10.830 --> 04:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
Brewers out
 
04:23:10.840 --> 04:23:13.510 align:start position:0%
Brewers out
there

04:23:13.510 --> 04:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:23:16.269 --> 04:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
um we think it makes sense it's very
 
04:23:19.630 --> 04:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
simple and again um when we're done this
 
04:23:21.309 --> 04:23:21.319 align:start position:0%
hearing anybody who doesn't know what a
 
04:23:23.389 --> 04:23:23.399 align:start position:0%
growler is I'd be happy to show you what
 
04:23:26.189 --> 04:23:26.199 align:start position:0%
it is so I'll take any questions anybody
 
04:23:29.469 --> 04:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:31.510 --> 04:23:31.520 align:start position:0%
point representative post I all your
 
04:23:34.229 --> 04:23:34.239 align:start position:0%
head first would you ask your question
 
04:23:37.070 --> 04:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um so here it says
 
04:23:39.830 --> 04:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
may fill such a refillable container
 
04:23:43.469 --> 04:23:43.479 align:start position:0%
that gives them the discretion to not um
 
04:23:46.070 --> 04:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
pour you into a separate container
 
04:23:47.750 --> 04:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
because perhaps they want to sell it to
 
04:23:50.030 --> 04:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
you is that a situation that's exactly
 
04:23:53.229 --> 04:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
right it the it's a key line at their
 
04:23:57.389 --> 04:23:57.399 align:start position:0%
soul his sole discretion so if I take my
 
04:23:59.670 --> 04:23:59.680 align:start position:0%
alcatra Brewing Growler into my top
 
04:24:03.510 --> 04:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
water brewing and I go hey um give me
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
one of your ipas and I show him the
 
04:24:07.389 --> 04:24:07.399 align:start position:0%
alcatra he goes no I don't want to fill
 
04:24:09.750 --> 04:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
that this bill says that's his option
 
04:24:11.710 --> 04:24:11.720 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that forces him to do it
 
04:24:14.389 --> 04:24:14.399 align:start position:0%
but allows him to it and I can guarant
 
04:24:16.070 --> 04:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
almost guarantee with
 
04:24:18.389 --> 04:24:18.399 align:start position:0%
100% uh
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
certainty that the micr Brewer is going
 
04:24:22.790 --> 04:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
to be more than happy to fill whatever
 
04:24:25.389 --> 04:24:25.399 align:start position:0%
Growler you bring in with his
 
04:24:28.910 --> 04:24:28.920 align:start position:0%
product representative
 
04:24:31.950 --> 04:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
spear thank you I I don't know anything
 
04:24:34.149 --> 04:24:34.159 align:start position:0%
about this I've never drunk beer so I
 
04:24:36.429 --> 04:24:36.439 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about it but would
 
04:24:38.990 --> 04:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
it ever be a case where Bud Light or
 
04:24:42.109 --> 04:24:42.119 align:start position:0%
aneisa bush would not want you to put
 
04:24:44.349 --> 04:24:44.359 align:start position:0%
someone else's beer in a glass that they
 
04:24:46.349 --> 04:24:46.359 align:start position:0%
sold assuming that it was going to be
 
04:24:49.469 --> 04:24:49.479 align:start position:0%
for uh a Bud Light I
 
04:24:51.590 --> 04:24:51.600 align:start position:0%
guess I can't answer that question
 
04:24:54.109 --> 04:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
because I don't know what anheiser Bush
 
04:24:55.950 --> 04:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
thinks about doing with their glasses
 
04:24:59.429 --> 04:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
you know in restaurants and bars I would
 
04:25:01.469 --> 04:25:01.479 align:start position:0%
imagine they probably don't care either
 
04:25:03.670 --> 04:25:03.680 align:start position:0%
because they're getting the advertising
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
on their glass I know for fact that I I
 
04:25:08.750 --> 04:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
travel a country in the world I've got
 
04:25:12.229 --> 04:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
glasses and uh all from all over the
 
04:25:14.870 --> 04:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
place and
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
uh these are just a small sample of what
 
04:25:22.870 --> 04:25:22.880 align:start position:0%
I've seen you know I've had ipas of one
 
04:25:26.030 --> 04:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
company in an IPA glass of another
 
04:25:28.670 --> 04:25:28.680 align:start position:0%
company I mean it just it really who
 
04:25:30.830 --> 04:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
cares just just it's just an advertising
 
04:25:33.189 --> 04:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
thing for them yeah I I would say okay I
 
04:25:34.870 --> 04:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
don't know but I would say yeah so just
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
to clarification this spill isn't about
 
04:25:39.990 --> 04:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
glasses it's about Growlers refillable
 
04:25:42.349 --> 04:25:42.359 align:start position:0%
containers Growlers again which I will
 
04:25:44.670 --> 04:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
be glad to hold up when I'm not sitting
 
04:25:46.510 --> 04:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
at this so the the glasses were was just
 
04:25:48.750 --> 04:25:48.760 align:start position:0%
an example of the different beers being
 
04:25:50.349 --> 04:25:50.359 align:start position:0%
put and we have to take your word for it
 
04:25:51.910 --> 04:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
that the beer in the glass is actually
 
04:25:53.469 --> 04:25:53.479 align:start position:0%
what you you would have to take my word
 
04:25:55.349 --> 04:25:55.359 align:start position:0%
for that but I I can guarantee you there
 
04:25:57.109 --> 04:25:57.119 align:start position:0%
would be in any of those pictures there
 
04:25:58.990 --> 04:25:59.000 align:start position:0%
would be nothing other than an IPA in
 
04:26:00.870 --> 04:26:00.880 align:start position:0%
those glasses that I can guarantee you I
 
04:26:02.590 --> 04:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
do understand that but Growlers also
 
04:26:05.429 --> 04:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
have advertising on them so so do does
 
04:26:07.630 --> 04:26:07.640 align:start position:0%
bud lighter one and AER Bush do they
 
04:26:10.429 --> 04:26:10.439 align:start position:0%
have grow Growlers with uh that's a good
 
04:26:12.389 --> 04:26:12.399 align:start position:0%
question I don't I've never seen one
 
04:26:14.790 --> 04:26:14.800 align:start position:0%
only because they they're sort of more
 
04:26:16.910 --> 04:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
of the mass producers you know cans and
 
04:26:18.950 --> 04:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
bottles is where they put out their
 
04:26:20.510 --> 04:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
their stuff I don't I've never seen a
 
04:26:22.790 --> 04:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
growler uh somebody who's going to
 
04:26:24.710 --> 04:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
testify might be able to clarify that
 
04:26:26.990 --> 04:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
but I've never seen one it's usually the
 
04:26:29.429 --> 04:26:29.439 align:start position:0%
the small micro breweries that have the
 
04:26:33.189 --> 04:26:33.199 align:start position:0%
The Growlers any followup good all right
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
any other questions representative meu
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks for bringing this up um
 
04:26:41.389 --> 04:26:41.399 align:start position:0%
just a quick question do we do we have a
 
04:26:43.710 --> 04:26:43.720 align:start position:0%
definition of a refillable container I
 
04:26:45.750 --> 04:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
was just trying to find it in statute
 
04:26:48.269 --> 04:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
and and the part B of that is does it is
 
04:26:49.870 --> 04:26:49.880 align:start position:0%
it supposed to have a a method of
 
04:26:54.950 --> 04:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
closure cap cork lid some kind I this
 
04:26:56.630 --> 04:26:56.640 align:start position:0%
the bill that
 
04:27:00.469 --> 04:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
I'm put forth is basically for Growlers
 
04:27:02.870 --> 04:27:02.880 align:start position:0%
is there a cap yes and again once I
 
04:27:06.030 --> 04:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
leave here I will be gladly holding up
 
04:27:07.630 --> 04:27:07.640 align:start position:0%
examples of Growlers and you will see
 
04:27:11.349 --> 04:27:11.359 align:start position:0%
that they have caps on them um there are
 
04:27:14.550 --> 04:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
other containers micr breweries use but
 
04:27:17.189 --> 04:27:17.199 align:start position:0%
they're um like a the other one is
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
called a crowler and that is a smaller
 
04:27:23.070 --> 04:27:23.080 align:start position:0%
unit but it's actually uh a unit that
 
04:27:26.469 --> 04:27:26.479 align:start position:0%
they can write at their own place
 
04:27:29.349 --> 04:27:29.359 align:start position:0%
refillable this a growler is a an
 
04:27:32.149 --> 04:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
example of a refillable container I'm
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
sure they have smaller variations but in
 
04:27:37.710 --> 04:27:37.720 align:start position:0%
general it's definitely capped yes
 
04:27:41.030 --> 04:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
follow thanks my followup is I I guess
 
04:27:42.590 --> 04:27:42.600 align:start position:0%
as I read it as written without a
 
04:27:44.469 --> 04:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
specific definition that says a method
 
04:27:44.479 --> 04:27:45.189 align:start position:0%
specific definition that says a method
of

04:27:45.189 --> 04:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:27:47.790 --> 04:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
closure then all of these glasses do
 
04:27:49.750 --> 04:27:49.760 align:start position:0%
apply the glasses that the Distributors
 
04:27:53.590 --> 04:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
provide for free to the lienes so that
 
04:27:55.750 --> 04:27:55.760 align:start position:0%
they'll use them for advertising no I
 
04:27:58.710 --> 04:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
don't think so just because of the uh I
 
04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
think I have it here the section that
 
04:28:06.309 --> 04:28:06.319 align:start position:0%
it's talking about um I printed out
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
everything and left it on my wife's
 
04:28:10.790 --> 04:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
printer um I don't I do not believe
 
04:28:13.349 --> 04:28:13.359 align:start position:0%
that's the case it could be interpreted
 
04:28:15.109 --> 04:28:15.119 align:start position:0%
that way maybe but I'd have to get back
 
04:28:17.710 --> 04:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
into the RSA again I I left that on my
 
04:28:17.720 --> 04:28:20.030 align:start position:0%
into the RSA again I I left that on my
wife's

04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
wife's
 
04:28:22.149 --> 04:28:22.159 align:start position:0%
printer representative
 
04:28:25.670 --> 04:28:25.680 align:start position:0%
post would you believe that Budweiser
 
04:28:28.429 --> 04:28:28.439 align:start position:0%
has a beer garden Growler in several
 
04:28:31.269 --> 04:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
sizes would I
 
04:28:34.710 --> 04:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
believe possibly I I do know that uh the
 
04:28:38.510 --> 04:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
big beer companies have uh bought up a
 
04:28:42.269 --> 04:28:42.279 align:start position:0%
lot of uh not micro micr breweries but
 
04:28:43.870 --> 04:28:43.880 align:start position:0%
bigger micr breweries I've been to
 
04:28:45.389 --> 04:28:45.399 align:start position:0%
several down
 
04:28:50.630 --> 04:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
Virginia um so maybe indirectly but I
 
04:28:50.640 --> 04:28:52.389 align:start position:0%
Virginia um so maybe indirectly but I
don't

04:28:52.389 --> 04:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:28:55.269 --> 04:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
know and uh just to follow up on
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
representative post question uh who who
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
owns The Growler once it's in someone's
 
04:29:03.550 --> 04:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
Possession It The Growler is um normally
 
04:29:06.030 --> 04:29:06.040 align:start position:0%
provided initially from the micro Brewer
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
the seller um the per the person who
 
04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
buys the beer in The Growler purchases
 
04:29:12.910 --> 04:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
The Growler and then The Growler belongs
 
04:29:14.710 --> 04:29:14.720 align:start position:0%
to that individual from then on that's
 
04:29:19.469 --> 04:29:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:21.550 --> 04:29:21.560 align:start position:0%
them any other
 
04:29:23.309 --> 04:29:23.319 align:start position:0%
questions all right seeing none thank
 
04:29:26.229 --> 04:29:26.239 align:start position:0%

okay uh my wife Katherine and I own and
 
04:30:28.389 --> 04:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
operate Frost heave Brewery in
 
04:30:30.950 --> 04:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
Brookfield we have held a New Hampshire
 
04:30:33.269 --> 04:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission nano brewery license
 
04:30:36.389 --> 04:30:36.399 align:start position:0%
since since November 2021
 
04:30:38.590 --> 04:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
Frost heave is a small Brewery our
 
04:30:41.790 --> 04:30:41.800 align:start position:0%
entire facility is 850 squ ft which
 
04:30:44.510 --> 04:30:44.520 align:start position:0%
houses our Tasting Room restroom storage
 
04:30:46.429 --> 04:30:46.439 align:start position:0%
and beer production we produce
 
04:30:50.030 --> 04:30:50.040 align:start position:0%
approximately 50 barrels of beer in
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
2023 all beer that we produce is poured
 
04:30:54.590 --> 04:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
in The Tasting Room we do not package
 
04:30:56.750 --> 04:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
any of our beers in cans or
 
04:30:59.269 --> 04:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
bottles refillable containers also known
 
04:31:01.030 --> 04:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
as Growers are important to our business
 
04:31:04.510 --> 04:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
model during December 2023 just last
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
month onethird of the beer we sold was
 
04:31:08.950 --> 04:31:08.960 align:start position:0%
delivered in Growlers Growlers provide a
 
04:31:10.790 --> 04:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
lowcost option for our customers to take
 
04:31:13.229 --> 04:31:13.239 align:start position:0%
home our take our beer home with them to
 
04:31:15.109 --> 04:31:15.119 align:start position:0%
consume at times when we are not
 
04:31:18.189 --> 04:31:18.199 align:start position:0%
open Growlers are much lower cost than
 
04:31:22.630 --> 04:31:22.640 align:start position:0%
cans which require a can lid label labor
 
04:31:25.790 --> 04:31:25.800 align:start position:0%
to fill seal and label the can and
 
04:31:28.750 --> 04:31:28.760 align:start position:0%
storage for both empty and filled cans
 
04:31:30.550 --> 04:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
canning literally does not fit in our
 
04:31:33.070 --> 04:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
building nor our business
 
04:31:35.550 --> 04:31:35.560 align:start position:0%
model many of our customers already have
 
04:31:37.710 --> 04:31:37.720 align:start position:0%
several branded growlers from other
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
local breweries and they would like us
 
04:31:42.469 --> 04:31:42.479 align:start position:0%
to fill them with frost heave beer I was
 
04:31:44.030 --> 04:31:44.040 align:start position:0%
explicitly told by the New Hampshire
 
04:31:45.670 --> 04:31:45.680 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that we are not
 
04:31:48.469 --> 04:31:48.479 align:start position:0%
permitted to do so James barbouti on
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
March 4th 2022 in an email said quote it
 
04:31:54.790 --> 04:31:54.800 align:start position:0%
is misbranding by putting your beer into
 
04:31:57.229 --> 04:31:57.239 align:start position:0%
someone else's Growler end quote and he
 
04:32:00.590 --> 04:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
referenced uh New Hampshire RSA 175
 
04:32:03.990 --> 04:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
colon 2 adulteration and or
 
04:32:05.910 --> 04:32:05.920 align:start position:0%
misbranding I will note that we are
 
04:32:07.950 --> 04:32:07.960 align:start position:0%
required to fix an approved label with
 
04:32:10.790 --> 04:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
our Brewery name to any unbranded growl
 
04:32:12.590 --> 04:32:12.600 align:start position:0%
that we fill and presumably would
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
likewise likewise be required to do so
 
04:32:17.710 --> 04:32:17.720 align:start position:0%
for any other branded Growler if we were
 
04:32:20.189 --> 04:32:20.199 align:start position:0%
allowed to me the concern that a
 
04:32:21.990 --> 04:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
consumer is likely to be confused about
 
04:32:24.149 --> 04:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
what beer is in their Growler seems
 
04:32:27.109 --> 04:32:27.119 align:start position:0%
overblown at best the consumer owns The
 
04:32:29.469 --> 04:32:29.479 align:start position:0%
Growler they wash The Growler they
 
04:32:31.149 --> 04:32:31.159 align:start position:0%
brought it to Frosty Brewery to be
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
filled they watched me fill it I
 
04:32:35.910 --> 04:32:35.920 align:start position:0%
attached a label that says the beer is
 
04:32:37.990 --> 04:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
from froste Brewery and they take The
 
04:32:40.870 --> 04:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
Growler home I can't imagine that there
 
04:32:42.910 --> 04:32:42.920 align:start position:0%
that there is any cause for confusion
 
04:32:44.510 --> 04:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
this definitely does not seem like an
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
example of
 
04:32:48.269 --> 04:32:48.279 align:start position:0%
misbranding in any restaurant in New
 
04:32:49.950 --> 04:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire licensed by the same Liquor
 
04:32:51.990 --> 04:32:52.000 align:start position:0%
Commission you can order a pint of Bud
 
04:32:53.429 --> 04:32:53.439 align:start position:0%
and wind up with it delivered in a
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
Miller branded glass nobody's confused
 
04:32:57.550 --> 04:32:57.560 align:start position:0%
about what beer is in the glass there's
 
04:33:02.269 --> 04:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:04.750 --> 04:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
be the federal regulator specifically
 
04:33:06.029 --> 04:33:06.039 align:start position:0%
the ttb
 
04:33:08.230 --> 04:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
have a couple dozen pages of regulations
 
04:33:10.830 --> 04:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
around every aspect of what must be or
 
04:33:13.230 --> 04:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
may be on a beer label along with an
 
04:33:15.629 --> 04:33:15.639 align:start position:0%
exhaustive process of for label
 
04:33:18.029 --> 04:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
approvals how many pages of regulations
 
04:33:19.990 --> 04:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
does the ttb have on
 
04:33:23.029 --> 04:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
Growlers zero they treat it as if it was
 
04:33:24.949 --> 04:33:24.959 align:start position:0%
a big serving glass and they have no
 
04:33:27.310 --> 04:33:27.320 align:start position:0%
regulations about that at all they're
 
04:33:29.150 --> 04:33:29.160 align:start position:0%
extremely concerned about consumer
 
04:33:31.750 --> 04:33:31.760 align:start position:0%
customer confusion on can or bottle
 
04:33:34.629 --> 04:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
labels but have no concerns about it
 
04:33:36.150 --> 04:33:36.160 align:start position:0%
about a container that is filled on
 
04:33:37.470 --> 04:33:37.480 align:start position:0%
demand for the
 
04:33:39.670 --> 04:33:39.680 align:start position:0%
consumer allowing breweries to fill the
 
04:33:41.109 --> 04:33:41.119 align:start position:0%
customer's Growler regardless of
 
04:33:43.070 --> 04:33:43.080 align:start position:0%
branding is good for the breweries good
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
for the customers and good for our state
 
04:33:47.269 --> 04:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
by removing barriers to customers
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing our beer you will help
 
04:33:50.709 --> 04:33:50.719 align:start position:0%
increase beer sales and increase the
 
04:33:53.310 --> 04:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
state's collection of the associated
 
04:33:56.510 --> 04:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
excise tax of 30 cents a gallon in
 
04:33:58.830 --> 04:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
addition enabling additional reuse of of
 
04:34:00.789 --> 04:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
existing Growlers is good for the
 
04:34:02.349 --> 04:34:02.359 align:start position:0%
environment and saves the customer from
 
04:34:04.269 --> 04:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
having to purchase and store yet another
 
04:34:06.629 --> 04:34:06.639 align:start position:0%
growler I urge you to support this
 
04:34:08.670 --> 04:34:08.680 align:start position:0%
Common Sense measure it is a small but
 
04:34:09.830 --> 04:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
meaningful way to support New
 
04:34:12.070 --> 04:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's thriving craft beer economy
 
04:34:13.990 --> 04:34:14.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration I'd be
 
04:34:15.750 --> 04:34:15.760 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions you might
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr Collins for your
 
04:34:22.629 --> 04:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
committee I have one for you if you
 
04:34:28.869 --> 04:34:28.879 align:start position:0%
don't mind um what uh when a customer
 
04:34:31.949 --> 04:34:31.959 align:start position:0%
hands you a growler that they brought in
 
04:34:34.349 --> 04:34:34.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of check do you do on that
 
04:34:35.949 --> 04:34:35.959 align:start position:0%
container to make sure it doesn't have
 
04:34:39.949 --> 04:34:39.959 align:start position:0%
other liquid in it or it's dirty or so I
 
04:34:42.551 --> 04:34:42.561 align:start position:0%
I open I remove the lid usually comes in
 
04:34:45.670 --> 04:34:45.680 align:start position:0%
with a lid screw it on I unscrew the lid
 
04:34:48.189 --> 04:34:48.199 align:start position:0%
I will look in it if there's any liquid
 
04:34:50.070 --> 04:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
in there which is there often is because
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
they probably just washed it I'll I'll
 
04:34:53.949 --> 04:34:53.959 align:start position:0%
pour out any excess liquid if it looks
 
04:34:55.910 --> 04:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
dirty I'm going to call it I'm going to
 
04:34:59.109 --> 04:34:59.119 align:start position:0%
call it to their attention and you
 
04:34:59.119 --> 04:35:01.029 align:start position:0%
call it to their attention and you
know

04:35:01.029 --> 04:35:01.039 align:start position:0%
know
 
04:35:03.670 --> 04:35:03.680 align:start position:0%
usually it happens occasionally that
 
04:35:05.269 --> 04:35:05.279 align:start position:0%
somebody will bring in a dirty growler
 
04:35:07.390 --> 04:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
and I call it to their attention and we
 
04:35:10.551 --> 04:35:10.561 align:start position:0%
generally don't fill it because it's you
 
04:35:12.869 --> 04:35:12.879 align:start position:0%
know who wants who wants boldy beer
 
04:35:14.949 --> 04:35:14.959 align:start position:0%
right that would be but it's there it's
 
04:35:17.510 --> 04:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
their and and it would be my discretion
 
04:35:19.510 --> 04:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
I mean I'm I'm not going to pour my beer
 
04:35:22.230 --> 04:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
into a moldy container right right it's
 
04:35:24.230 --> 04:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
just why would I do that to my beer
 
04:35:26.990 --> 04:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
right um if it's if it's quiet I'll wash
 
04:35:29.349 --> 04:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
it if it's busy I
 
04:35:32.029 --> 04:35:32.039 align:start position:0%

Commission thank you Mr chairman
 
04:36:01.269 --> 04:36:01.279 align:start position:0%
honorable committee members again for
 
04:36:03.470 --> 04:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
the record uh Mark armaganian chief of
 
04:36:05.551 --> 04:36:05.561 align:start position:0%
enforcement for the liquor Comm Mission
 
04:36:07.629 --> 04:36:07.639 align:start position:0%
with me today as you have heard several
 
04:36:10.949 --> 04:36:10.959 align:start position:0%
times uh Lieutenant Matt Culver uh who's
 
04:36:12.709 --> 04:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
our commander of
 
04:36:16.150 --> 04:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
administration auditing direct shipping
 
04:36:18.551 --> 04:36:18.561 align:start position:0%
licensing uh and where's about six other
 
04:36:20.910 --> 04:36:20.920 align:start position:0%
heads too that will add to it at some
 
04:36:24.269 --> 04:36:24.279 align:start position:0%
point um I I think from informal
 
04:36:26.750 --> 04:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
conversations that we have had here uh
 
04:36:29.150 --> 04:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
conversations that I have had uh with
 
04:36:31.949 --> 04:36:31.959 align:start position:0%
the representative uh I I won't disagree
 
04:36:36.230 --> 04:36:36.240 align:start position:0%
with anything there uh other than um um
 
04:36:37.830 --> 04:36:37.840 align:start position:0%
there was probably some misinformation
 
04:36:41.910 --> 04:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
that was put out uh back in the day uh
 
04:36:45.949 --> 04:36:45.959 align:start position:0%
Mr bar beauty isn't with us um for a
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
couple years now uh Matt can speak more
 
04:36:52.269 --> 04:36:52.279 align:start position:0%
toward the auditing side I think over
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
covid HHS had um a standard they put out
 
04:37:00.109 --> 04:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
about not refilling uh bottles but what
 
04:37:03.910 --> 04:37:03.920 align:start position:0%
one thing we don't want to see is this
 
04:37:06.109 --> 04:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
as as Mr chairman as you and I have
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
spoken about is this interrupting the
 
04:37:12.269 --> 04:37:12.279 align:start position:0%
spirit side of the house um so the
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
placement of where this is would would
 
04:37:17.029 --> 04:37:17.039 align:start position:0%
be critical and and we can talk about
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
where where this does sit uh in the
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
statute the word Growler isn't defined
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh refillable containers is uh so as you
 
04:37:30.750 --> 04:37:30.760 align:start position:0%
all know we're we're in a uh committee
 
04:37:32.830 --> 04:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
that everything is defined and if it
 
04:37:35.670 --> 04:37:35.680 align:start position:0%
isn't it didn't it doesn't exist so
 
04:37:38.109 --> 04:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
um so that would be our only standing in
 
04:37:41.709 --> 04:37:41.719 align:start position:0%
this is is how this is placed in the
 
04:37:43.869 --> 04:37:43.879 align:start position:0%
statute um and I'll leave the rest for
 
04:37:45.349 --> 04:37:45.359 align:start position:0%
Matt to talk
 
04:37:47.789 --> 04:37:47.799 align:start position:0%
about thank you
 
04:37:51.310 --> 04:37:51.320 align:start position:0%
Chief chairman and committee members uh
 
04:37:53.029 --> 04:37:53.039 align:start position:0%
this is an amendment to
 
04:37:56.470 --> 04:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
17940 paragraph it is inserting a new
 
04:37:59.109 --> 04:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
paragraph paragraph three and Par the
 
04:38:03.109 --> 04:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
existing 17940 paragraph 2 States no
 
04:38:05.310 --> 04:38:05.320 align:start position:0%
licensees shall refill any bot of
 
04:38:07.551 --> 04:38:07.561 align:start position:0%
Legally purch purchased beverage or
 
04:38:11.510 --> 04:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
liquor and then paragraph three would be
 
04:38:15.310 --> 04:38:15.320 align:start position:0%
this change so our recommendation would
 
04:38:17.470 --> 04:38:17.480 align:start position:0%
to be in paragraph three to say
 
04:38:19.990 --> 04:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding paragraph two so you're
 
04:38:22.750 --> 04:38:22.760 align:start position:0%
not you're providing that delineation
 
04:38:24.869 --> 04:38:24.879 align:start position:0%
and not a contradiction to two
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
paragraphs paragraph two obviously is
 
04:38:31.109 --> 04:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
for uh the refilling of liquor bottles
 
04:38:35.510 --> 04:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
using uh the um leader bottles to the
 
04:38:38.269 --> 04:38:38.279 align:start position:0%
750 milliliter at the Wells and
 
04:38:41.949 --> 04:38:41.959 align:start position:0%
restaurants um the refilling of those
 
04:38:44.310 --> 04:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
Brands other than that I appreciate the
 
04:38:46.150 --> 04:38:46.160 align:start position:0%
presentation by the co-sponsor and in
 
04:38:48.470 --> 04:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
our lense e
 
04:38:52.310 --> 04:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
um so I hope this is good for them great
 
04:38:54.510 --> 04:38:54.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um I'm just trying to follow
 
04:38:55.789 --> 04:38:55.799 align:start position:0%
along with what your previous statement
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
was so I think sometimes an
 
04:39:03.029 --> 04:39:03.039 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous bar owner could refill a
 
04:39:05.189 --> 04:39:05.199 align:start position:0%
container um you know I the end of the
 
04:39:07.390 --> 04:39:07.400 align:start position:0%
night they could refill it with uh that
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
particular brand or some other brand is
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
that what the existing statutes partly
 
04:39:14.551 --> 04:39:14.561 align:start position:0%
why it's uh for liquor purposes yeah for
 
04:39:16.070 --> 04:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
liquor purposes yes that's that's
 
04:39:18.789 --> 04:39:18.799 align:start position:0%
exactly and and that's a common practice
 
04:39:21.709 --> 04:39:21.719 align:start position:0%
um amongst lenses is something that we
 
04:39:24.789 --> 04:39:24.799 align:start position:0%
do um um watch out for and try to
 
04:39:27.310 --> 04:39:27.320 align:start position:0%
educate our lenses on on that that
 
04:39:28.310 --> 04:39:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's not
 
04:39:31.670 --> 04:39:31.680 align:start position:0%
allowable um and like the testimony that
 
04:39:34.949 --> 04:39:34.959 align:start position:0%
was provided earlier there's also um the
 
04:39:37.788 --> 04:39:37.798 align:start position:0%
substitution of Brands right right so
 
04:39:42.070 --> 04:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
you are filling a um top shelf bottle
 
04:39:46.510 --> 04:39:46.520 align:start position:0%
with exactly bottom shelf B light
 
04:39:49.030 --> 04:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
yeah all right great y any questions
 
04:39:50.190 --> 04:39:50.200 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:39:53.390 --> 04:39:53.400 align:start position:0%
committee represent M thank you Mr
 
04:39:56.230 --> 04:39:56.240 align:start position:0%
chairman chief do either of you guys
 
04:39:58.868 --> 04:39:58.878 align:start position:0%
know what that definition of refillable
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
container is I still couldn't find it I
 
04:40:03.430 --> 04:40:03.440 align:start position:0%
was just browsing through
 
04:40:06.830 --> 04:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
179 is that a cap I I believe it's
 
04:40:10.830 --> 04:40:10.840 align:start position:0%
actually mentioned as suitable container
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
um uh and I the statute is escaping me I
 
04:40:17.390 --> 04:40:17.400 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it in 179 we can research
 
04:40:21.030 --> 04:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
that for you so you're the the
 
04:40:24.030 --> 04:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
security uh cap on top or the the
 
04:40:26.510 --> 04:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
closure cap you're you're speaking of
 
04:40:29.590 --> 04:40:29.600 align:start position:0%
Representative or uh fur further
 
04:40:31.948 --> 04:40:31.958 align:start position:0%
question if you don't mind further
 
04:40:34.708 --> 04:40:34.718 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm just wondering if we
 
04:40:37.430 --> 04:40:37.440 align:start position:0%
need to make it include that so people
 
04:40:39.110 --> 04:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
don't want to just bring in their own
 
04:40:41.270 --> 04:40:41.280 align:start position:0%
glasses which maybe we don't object to
 
04:40:45.270 --> 04:40:45.280 align:start position:0%
that it's fine with me I I sure owners
 
04:40:46.990 --> 04:40:47.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative I believe it it
 
04:40:50.270 --> 04:40:50.280 align:start position:0%
might be worth um discussing the
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
possibility of creating a definition for
 
04:40:57.030 --> 04:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
a growler we can do SUB committee right
 
04:40:58.510 --> 04:40:58.520 align:start position:0%
you said it was already there so I just
 
04:40:59.750 --> 04:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to read
 
04:41:02.310 --> 04:41:02.320 align:start position:0%
it all right I I just did a quick search
 
04:41:05.350 --> 04:41:05.360 align:start position:0%
on refillable container in RSA I don't I
 
04:41:08.190 --> 04:41:08.200 align:start position:0%
got zeros also maybe yeah it's suitable
 
04:41:11.070 --> 04:41:11.080 align:start position:0%
container I suitable suitable should be
 
04:41:11.080 --> 04:41:11.948 align:start position:0%
container I suitable suitable should be
there

04:41:11.948 --> 04:41:11.958 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:41:13.910 --> 04:41:13.920 align:start position:0%
somewhere and if I can't find it now
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:19.110 --> 04:41:19.120 align:start position:0%
later all right
 
04:41:23.070 --> 04:41:23.080 align:start position:0%
uh that had nine hits so in in different
 
04:41:24.628 --> 04:41:24.638 align:start position:0%
beverage licenses there's a suitable
 
04:41:26.430 --> 04:41:26.440 align:start position:0%
container definition
 
04:41:29.310 --> 04:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
yeah all right any other
 
04:41:32.110 --> 04:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
questions and so just to recap it sounds
 
04:41:34.628 --> 04:41:34.638 align:start position:0%
like it's a workable bill it may need an
 
04:41:37.788 --> 04:41:37.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment or two uh one Amendment with
 
04:41:41.310 --> 04:41:41.320 align:start position:0%
one or two changes um absolutely and it
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
it'll it'll fit in that statute but it
 
04:41:45.150 --> 04:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to contradict it correct
 
04:41:48.230 --> 04:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
right all right excellent any anyone
 
04:41:50.990 --> 04:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
else would like to testify on this
 
04:41:53.590 --> 04:41:53.600 align:start position:0%
bill and if not seeing none we'll close
