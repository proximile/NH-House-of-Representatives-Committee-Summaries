Administration I'll open
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing on House Bill 1343 and
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
welcome the prime
 
00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:01.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Ross Barry thank
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman my name is
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative Ross Berry I represent
 
00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro 39 Manchester's South End WS
 
00:06:11.909 --> 00:06:11.919 align:start position:0%
68 and N about 30,000 workingclass
 
00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
people um I am the chair of the house
 
00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
election law committee which is where I
 
00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
thought this bill would have been headed
 
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 align:start position:0%
dealing that it deals with election law
 
00:06:21.189 --> 00:06:21.199 align:start position:0%
but you sometimes they don't always end
 
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120 align:start position:0%
up where you think they're going to end
 
00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
up um so House Bill 13343 what it does
 
00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
is it establishes an extra procedure for
 
00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 align:start position:0%
the use of um government uh
 
00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 align:start position:0%
gubernatorial emergency orders
 
00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000 align:start position:0%
concerning election laws so let's
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
explain why I believe this is necessary
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
everything that we
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
do with the state involve the core of it
 
00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:46.680 align:start position:0%
right is our election process right we
 
00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 align:start position:0%
elect people every two years it's a
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
Cornerstone of the New Hampshire system
 
00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:53.599 align:start position:0%
um our current executive orders allow
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
for we know a wide latitude U we've
 
00:06:58.710 --> 00:06:58.720 align:start position:0%
recently made some curtails but they
 
00:07:00.189 --> 00:07:00.199 align:start position:0%
happened even though those curtails
 
00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:02.039 align:start position:0%
still have about a 28 day window before
 
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.160 align:start position:0%
the legislature could seek redress the
 
00:07:06.790 --> 00:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
problem is in 28 uh 28 days in election
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
is a lifetime um so if we're going to
 
00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
have a system where our corner office
 
00:07:17.909 --> 00:07:17.919 align:start position:0%
can change our laws at will for 28 days
 
00:07:20.589 --> 00:07:20.599 align:start position:0%
um or more we can't allow them to
 
00:07:24.029 --> 00:07:24.039 align:start position:0%
unilaterally touch election laws um and
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
I'll give you some examples of both
 
00:07:29.070 --> 00:07:29.080 align:start position:0%
sides could abuse this power so imagine
 
00:07:32.230 --> 00:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
imag imag if you will Governor Barry
 
00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
decides that voter fraud is an emergency
 
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:38.280 align:start position:0%
declares that
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
absentee number one source of voter
 
00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
fraud which was actually true by the way
 
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:44.000 align:start position:0%
um absentee ballots are the number one
 
00:07:46.510 --> 00:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
source of prosecution by the AG for
 
00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
cases of wrongful voting declares voter
 
00:07:51.029 --> 00:07:51.039 align:start position:0%
fraud a state of emergency says no
 
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots can be sent out or sent
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
in uh for the general election and the
 
00:07:56.589 --> 00:07:56.599 align:start position:0%
legislature for 28 days can do nothing
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
about it that changes the outcome of an
 
00:07:59.039 --> 00:08:00.270 align:start position:0%
about it that changes the outcome of an
election

00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:00.280 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:08:01.869 --> 00:08:01.879 align:start position:0%
right conversely let's say one of my
 
00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:02.960 align:start position:0%
friends on the other side of theis
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
happens to be governed and declares
 
00:08:06.830 --> 00:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
climate change a state of emergency and
 
00:08:09.149 --> 00:08:09.159 align:start position:0%
says that everybody driving to the polls
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
creates a lot of carbon
 
00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
emissions that's bad for the environment
 
00:08:14.869 --> 00:08:14.879 align:start position:0%
that's an emergency we're doing nothing
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
but absentee ballots we're going to send
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
absentee ballots to everyone on the
 
00:08:20.469 --> 00:08:20.479 align:start position:0%
voter list and they can send it back to
 
00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:22.520 align:start position:0%
avoid carbon emissions these are two
 
00:08:23.909 --> 00:08:23.919 align:start position:0%
things that are obviously patently
 
00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:25.720 align:start position:0%
ridiculous right we believe that they
 
00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:27.759 align:start position:0%
would never happen but under our
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
existing law they actually could um a
 
00:08:33.949 --> 00:08:33.959 align:start position:0%
probably a more let's say realistic
 
00:08:35.670 --> 00:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
abuse of power would be a seated
 
00:08:37.909 --> 00:08:37.919 align:start position:0%
Governor looks at their poll numbers
 
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:39.680 align:start position:0%
decides they don't really like the way
 
00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
the election's headed and tries to
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
postpone the election for 14 days to
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
give them two more weeks of campaigning
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
right every election law we have in the
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
book is written in a statute every
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
election law can be changed by executive
 
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
order we can't allow election laws to be
 
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
changed willy-nilly with by the whim of
 
00:08:59.470 --> 00:08:59.480 align:start position:0%
one person so what this does is it keeps
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
in place uh a weather emergency because
 
00:09:03.470 --> 00:09:03.480 align:start position:0%
we do have an exception for Town
 
00:09:05.670 --> 00:09:05.680 align:start position:0%
elections uh we use the gray weather
 
00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:08.320 align:start position:0%
station if there's a snow emergency uh
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
then we can postpone elections so that
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
stays the same that's very important
 
00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
that stays the same um but otherwise
 
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
changes to election laws will require
 
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:17.480 align:start position:0%
the consent of the majority leader the
 
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:19.360 align:start position:0%
minority leader of both the house and
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
the Senate right um so that way both
 
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
parties have a say doesn't matter who's
 
00:09:25.790 --> 00:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
in the corner office if the governor
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
tries to do something both parties have
 
00:09:29.829 --> 00:09:29.839 align:start position:0%
to consent otherwise they can go through
 
00:09:32.190 --> 00:09:32.200 align:start position:0%
the normal legislative process now I've
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
talked very briefly with the Secretary
 
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:36.640 align:start position:0%
of State about this U the secretary of
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
state says well I I probably just
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't enforce an emergency order
 
00:09:43.069 --> 00:09:43.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately we have examples in the
 
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:44.360 align:start position:0%
last three years of emergency orders
 
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
being enforced by the Secretary of State
 
00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
um and I don't think anybody here would
 
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
be really upset about those I don't I'm
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
not saying they were nefarious they were
 
00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
bad I'm just saying that this is a
 
00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200 align:start position:0%
massive power that can be directly
 
00:09:59.230 --> 00:09:59.240 align:start position:0%
targeted towards the foundation of how
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
we operate our government um and it
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
needs to be put in with some protections
 
00:10:05.389 --> 00:10:05.399 align:start position:0%
um there are very limited instances
 
00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
where I believe legitimately emergency
 
00:10:10.990 --> 00:10:11.000 align:start position:0%
order should be used uh for um changing
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
election laws at whim um but I think
 
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
with leaving those in place we still
 
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:18.640 align:start position:0%
kind of maintain the flexibility um but
 
00:10:21.069 --> 00:10:21.079 align:start position:0%
you still have the protection of it and
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
they don't have to the the majority
 
00:10:24.389 --> 00:10:24.399 align:start position:0%
majority of minority leaders don't have
 
00:10:25.710 --> 00:10:25.720 align:start position:0%
to sign anything they can send it
 
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:27.640 align:start position:0%
electronically it could be by phone call
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
it could be however they want to
 
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:31.200 align:start position:0%
communicate their consent to it um to
 
00:10:33.389 --> 00:10:33.399 align:start position:0%
allow that flexibility to still exist
 
00:10:35.389 --> 00:10:35.399 align:start position:0%
but we need to need to need to make sure
 
00:10:37.629 --> 00:10:37.639 align:start position:0%
that this power is curtailed um
 
00:10:39.949 --> 00:10:39.959 align:start position:0%
specifically about our election laws um
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
so I'm happy to answer any questions
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
about it um I I will remind the
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
committee you can vote to refer to my
 
00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.120 align:start position:0%
committee if you'd like um and I'm happy
 
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:48.800 align:start position:0%
to hear it there too um but I'm happy to
 
00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:50.800 align:start position:0%
answer any questions about why why I did
 
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:53.240 align:start position:0%
what I did um and why why I do believe
 
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:55.240 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely fundamentally necessary
 
00:10:56.829 --> 00:10:56.839 align:start position:0%
and I do hope it would be bipartisan
 
00:10:59.190 --> 00:10:59.200 align:start position:0%
because this this could go either way um
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
both parties should be aware this could
 
00:11:02.670 --> 00:11:02.680 align:start position:0%
go either
 
00:11:05.069 --> 00:11:05.079 align:start position:0%
way thank you I think the committee is a
 
00:11:07.230 --> 00:11:07.240 align:start position:0%
little stunned by the idea of Governor
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
Barry up the start so uh so is my wife
 
00:11:13.230 --> 00:11:13.240 align:start position:0%
it may be that there's a a momentary
 
00:11:15.829 --> 00:11:15.839 align:start position:0%
silence here for a little bit
 
00:11:19.269 --> 00:11:19.279 align:start position:0%
um are there any questions for represent
 
00:11:21.389 --> 00:11:21.399 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you Mr chairman uh just
 
00:11:23.470 --> 00:11:23.480 align:start position:0%
for the record and for those on YouTube
 
00:11:25.389 --> 00:11:25.399 align:start position:0%
and and the
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
like on you know line
 
00:11:27.959 --> 00:11:29.829 align:start position:0%
like on you know line
22

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:29.839 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
electronic consent now you're talking
 
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:34.440 align:start position:0%
about four folks right two in the house
 
00:11:36.389 --> 00:11:36.399 align:start position:0%
two in the Senate y this is a four Zer
 
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:38.800 align:start position:0%
vote there's no 3-1 vote there's not a
 
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
tie it's a four Zer vote and a four Zer
 
00:11:43.150 --> 00:11:43.160 align:start position:0%
vote only it's a four Zer vote only both
 
00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:45.519 align:start position:0%
parties both houses need to consent um
 
00:11:46.870 --> 00:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
those are the leaders of the two parties
 
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the two bodies right um and at that
 
00:11:51.790 --> 00:11:51.800 align:start position:0%
the reason I have it like that is
 
00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:53.399 align:start position:0%
effectively right and obviously every
 
00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:55.240 align:start position:0%
member gets an equal vote in the every
 
00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
gets equal but if both Party leaders
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
from both houses are say saying yes this
 
00:12:01.069 --> 00:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
is okay the likelihood that they could
 
00:12:02.990 --> 00:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
pass legislation for whatever that
 
00:12:05.389 --> 00:12:05.399 align:start position:0%
emergency change is is high right um
 
00:12:06.990 --> 00:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a guarantee we've obviously
 
00:12:09.389 --> 00:12:09.399 align:start position:0%
seen things go sideways before um but
 
00:12:11.870 --> 00:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's high so that's how you that's how I
 
00:12:14.069 --> 00:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
keep both um in there I originally
 
00:12:15.269 --> 00:12:15.279 align:start position:0%
thought about doing the Secretary of
 
00:12:17.389 --> 00:12:17.399 align:start position:0%
State actually having to be a 5 um but
 
00:12:19.069 --> 00:12:19.079 align:start position:0%
the reality is if you have the majority
 
00:12:21.069 --> 00:12:21.079 align:start position:0%
leader the minority leader the M of both
 
00:12:23.710 --> 00:12:23.720 align:start position:0%
sides those are the people that elect um
 
00:12:25.069 --> 00:12:25.079 align:start position:0%
that the Secretary of State and at that
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
point you probably have do have the
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
consent of the Secretary of State as
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
well probably obviously they may
 
00:12:32.310 --> 00:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
disagree with that but I would assume
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
rationally that would be the
 
00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.629 align:start position:0%
rationally that would be the
case

00:12:37.629 --> 00:12:37.639 align:start position:0%
case
 
00:12:40.230 --> 00:12:40.240 align:start position:0%
that uh representative
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
Shen thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question um what about um same
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
day emergencies like
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
911 I mean that happened on the second
 
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:55.720 align:start position:0%
Tuesday of September it wasn't a primary
 
00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.000 align:start position:0%
year but what if s like a same day of
 
00:13:02.150 --> 00:13:02.160 align:start position:0%
like a outof the blue emergency happened
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
um would it still require the governor
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
to try to call for people together to
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
agree on so that's why it says
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
electronic means they don't have to
 
00:13:13.710 --> 00:13:13.720 align:start position:0%
physically meet right um they don't have
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
to physically meet so that that that
 
00:13:17.430 --> 00:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
that was specifically put in there to
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
you representative sers thank you Mr
 
00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.430 align:start position:0%
you representative sers thank you Mr
chair

00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:29.440 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:13:31.030 --> 00:13:31.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question so it
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
it actually brings up a couple questions
 
00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
but I'll ask one at a time so uh first
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
one is notification what you just said
 
00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:39.800 align:start position:0%
there so at this point if there's an
 
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:40.870 align:start position:0%
there so at this point if there's an
emergency

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
00:13:43.910 --> 00:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
order who is being notified just those
 
00:13:46.829 --> 00:13:46.839 align:start position:0%
four five six people or does the entire
 
00:13:49.189 --> 00:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
legislator legislation get notified no
 
00:13:50.829 --> 00:13:50.839 align:start position:0%
so it's just those it's just those four
 
00:13:52.509 --> 00:13:52.519 align:start position:0%
people right in in the sense of an
 
00:13:54.189 --> 00:13:54.199 align:start position:0%
emergency you need to act quickly right
 
00:13:56.590 --> 00:13:56.600 align:start position:0%
to the example that representative shean
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
just said um you need to be able to move
 
00:13:59.710 --> 00:13:59.720 align:start position:0%
quickly and certain situations I
 
00:14:01.509 --> 00:14:01.519 align:start position:0%
recognize that I'm not trying to stop
 
00:14:04.269 --> 00:14:04.279 align:start position:0%
that um conversely I do believe you need
 
00:14:05.710 --> 00:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
the cons I do believe you need the
 
00:14:07.269 --> 00:14:07.279 align:start position:0%
consent of some people from the
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislator before you start changing
 
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:10.120 align:start position:0%
things that directly affect the
 
00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.230 align:start position:0%
things that directly affect the
legislator

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:12.240 align:start position:0%
legislator
 
00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.870 align:start position:0%
legislator
um

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:13.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:17.269 --> 00:14:17.279 align:start position:0%
followup yes please thank you so that's
 
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
concerning to me because as a legislator
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
now I'm feeling out of the loop there's
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
an emergency going on and I feel like
 
00:14:24.990 --> 00:14:25.000 align:start position:0%
I'm out of loop maybe I'm not making the
 
00:14:29.030 --> 00:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
decision but a decision is being made by
 
00:14:31.269 --> 00:14:31.279 align:start position:0%
my majority or minority
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
leader and I don't even know the
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
situation is going on maybe and it I'm
 
00:14:39.389 --> 00:14:39.399 align:start position:0%
just trying to figure out how do we
 
00:14:41.350 --> 00:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
resolve that because now I'm getting to
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
the point of saying they're making
 
00:14:45.269 --> 00:14:45.279 align:start position:0%
decisions and I have no idea well
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
currently you have no say um so it's
 
00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
that would be my Counterpoint currently
 
00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
you have no say so if you'd like to
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
reform the EO to a broader sense I'd be
 
00:14:55.230 --> 00:14:55.240 align:start position:0%
happy to support that but currently you
 
00:14:57.550 --> 00:14:57.560 align:start position:0%
have no say um and the legislator does
 
00:14:59.069 --> 00:14:59.079 align:start position:0%
get notified for emergency or all the
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
other standard rules about emergency
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
orders apply it's just for things
 
00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:04.320 align:start position:0%
involving election law there's an added
 
00:15:06.470 --> 00:15:06.480 align:start position:0%
check before it can go into place um but
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
yes so currently I share your
 
00:15:09.230 --> 00:15:09.240 align:start position:0%
frustration as a legislature but
 
00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:12.560 align:start position:0%
currently you have no say
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
so any further
 
00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:18.199 align:start position:0%
questions I have one oh representative
 
00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:20.600 align:start position:0%
Pearson go ahead okay uh just just for
 
00:15:23.430 --> 00:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
clarity too with the group of four the
 
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
group of four does not include the
 
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:26.040 align:start position:0%
speaker of the house it does not include
 
00:15:27.910 --> 00:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
the president of the Senate no no it
 
00:15:29.749 --> 00:15:29.759 align:start position:0%
does not so uh elections are elections
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
are partisan by Nature right so I
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
included the partisan leaders um if you
 
00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:36.079 align:start position:0%
have the speaker right and the you you
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
have the speaker and the Senate
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
President you likely also have the
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
consent of the majority leaders of both
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
sides right um now that's not always the
 
00:15:44.710 --> 00:15:44.720 align:start position:0%
case right there's in there have been
 
00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399 align:start position:0%
instance where the speaker is elected by
 
00:15:49.110 --> 00:15:49.120 align:start position:0%
a minority by the minority and then a
 
00:15:51.590 --> 00:15:51.600 align:start position:0%
then a coalition of the majority right
 
00:15:53.949 --> 00:15:53.959 align:start position:0%
um but elections are partisan by Nature
 
00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:55.240 align:start position:0%
I know people don't really like to
 
00:15:57.309 --> 00:15:57.319 align:start position:0%
accept that but it is a fact um so I
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
included the partisan leaders of the
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate yes it was a
 
00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:04.829 align:start position:0%
house and the Senate yes it was a
conscious

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:04.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
decision so my question is uh and this
 
00:16:12.629 --> 00:16:12.639 align:start position:0%
relates to um rep Pearson's first uh
 
00:16:12.639 --> 00:16:14.269 align:start position:0%
relates to um rep Pearson's first uh
inquiry

00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
inquiry
 
00:16:17.629 --> 00:16:17.639 align:start position:0%
um one one of them decides no they don't
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
like this cor three to one doesn't carry
 
00:16:23.790 --> 00:16:23.800 align:start position:0%
it needs to be four that's it and then
 
00:16:25.829 --> 00:16:25.839 align:start position:0%
what happens it says so it says by the
 
00:16:27.509 --> 00:16:27.519 align:start position:0%
consent of all of the following just so
 
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:30.120 align:start position:0%
we're all there y doesn't go into place
 
00:16:32.470 --> 00:16:32.480 align:start position:0%
they don't have the ability to do it
 
00:16:34.509 --> 00:16:34.519 align:start position:0%
okay and so the governor doesn't have
 
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:36.720 align:start position:0%
that power then to declare no an
 
00:16:42.509 --> 00:16:42.519 align:start position:0%
emergency no um what happens then um is
 
00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:46.600 align:start position:0%
there any other um happen stance that
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
would occur does the governor have any
 
00:16:53.269 --> 00:16:53.279 align:start position:0%
other Avenue um under any
 
00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
other emergency order no no so this is
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
our elections are sacred they must be
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
protected at all costs changing them
 
00:17:04.350 --> 00:17:04.360 align:start position:0%
should require a very high threshold
 
00:17:07.029 --> 00:17:07.039 align:start position:0%
okay and I that's I I believe that to my
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
core um I believe you believe that um is
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
uh you list on line nine uh natural
 
00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:20.559 align:start position:0%
technological man-made disaster major
 
00:17:24.029 --> 00:17:24.039 align:start position:0%
proportions um is any of that defined
 
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:25.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere I believe that's the existing
 
00:17:27.829 --> 00:17:27.839 align:start position:0%
statute I think it is but is that
 
00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:29.919 align:start position:0%
defined uh that would be a question for
 
00:17:33.070 --> 00:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
you that would I couldn't tell you uh I
 
00:17:35.270 --> 00:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
I do have let's just say that I'm asking
 
00:17:39.110 --> 00:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
it now so fair enough uh I I do have in
 
00:17:41.710 --> 00:17:41.720 align:start position:0%
there about weather specifically there
 
00:17:44.310 --> 00:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
is language in election law um about
 
00:17:46.950 --> 00:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
weather um that I left in they actually
 
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
left in the exclusion um for there which
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
is underneath uh should be the gray it's
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
not going to list it's going to list the
 
00:17:57.830 --> 00:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
RSA um which is underneath the 669 I
 
00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.190 align:start position:0%
RSA um which is underneath the 669 I
believe

00:17:59.190 --> 00:17:59.200 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
so the point of my question was um just
 
00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
to use one of the examples you came up
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
with was climate change um is it
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
possible for the governor to find that
 
00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
uh climate change is a I don't know
 
00:18:17.390 --> 00:18:17.400 align:start position:0%
natural technological or man-made
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
disaster uh the my understanding you
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
guys know more about EOS than I would
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is it's very
 
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
subjective to what one person
 
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:27.280 align:start position:0%
believes okay but since this is your
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
bill um you had the ability to change
 
00:18:34.270 --> 00:18:34.280 align:start position:0%
anything you want on this legislation um
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
do you you you have not determin that
 
00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
there's a need to change anything in
 
00:18:41.190 --> 00:18:41.200 align:start position:0%
that in light of your question on or
 
00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:44.200 align:start position:0%
your point onate change my intention is
 
00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.960 align:start position:0%
not to try to is try to be as minimally
 
00:18:49.549 --> 00:18:49.559 align:start position:0%
invasive to the existing EO law as
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
possible I just mer I merely want the
 
00:18:55.190 --> 00:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
exemption for election law specifically
 
00:18:58.909 --> 00:18:58.919 align:start position:0%
under 669 added um that's what I want I
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to get involved into
 
00:19:02.390 --> 00:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we have beaten that subject to
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
death right um and we've gotten to a
 
00:19:06.549 --> 00:19:06.559 align:start position:0%
place where I think most people are
 
00:19:07.950 --> 00:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
somewhat happy which means you've
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
probably gotten to the right spot um I
 
00:19:12.430 --> 00:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to touch that I just want to
 
00:19:15.149 --> 00:19:15.159 align:start position:0%
get the protections for our elections
 
00:19:19.270 --> 00:19:19.280 align:start position:0%
put into there great no further
 
00:19:21.750 --> 00:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
questions question um thank you very
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
testimony uh only other pin card I have
 
00:19:34.669 --> 00:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:39.350 --> 00:19:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
Administration thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm representative Tim mchu
 
00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of the bill I represent the
 
00:19:48.789 --> 00:19:48.799 align:start position:0%
town of marac Hillsboro County District
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
12 so I won't go over my written
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
testimony I submitted it to the clerk uh
 
00:19:54.789 --> 00:19:54.799 align:start position:0%
I'll Echo a couple of things that
 
00:19:56.430 --> 00:19:56.440 align:start position:0%
representative Barry said without being
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
too duplicative um obviously it's a
 
00:20:03.149 --> 00:20:03.159 align:start position:0%
pretty simple Bill narrow in scope uh to
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
address an isolated change to
 
00:20:07.789 --> 00:20:07.799 align:start position:0%
implementation of executive orders
 
00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:09.320 align:start position:0%
specifically related to election
 
00:20:12.630 --> 00:20:12.640 align:start position:0%
procedure my most obvious example is if
 
00:20:14.830 --> 00:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
another pandemic occurs or when another
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic occurs right I'm sure that was
 
00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:20.200 align:start position:0%
all in our minds um either party in the
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
corner office could just decide that we
 
00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
will conduct that election during what
 
00:20:29.310 --> 00:20:29.320 align:start position:0%
is potentially a pandemic period by mail
 
00:20:31.630 --> 00:20:31.640 align:start position:0%
and the other party May disagree with
 
00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
that again it could go either way so
 
00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:36.280 align:start position:0%
this really should be a bipartisan
 
00:20:37.789 --> 00:20:37.799 align:start position:0%
effort and should have bipartisan
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
support across the house and I believe
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
across the Senate as well so this is
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
finally a chance to not be reactionary
 
00:20:49.510 --> 00:20:49.520 align:start position:0%
but be proactive and protect that is
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
what is most important to our democracy
 
00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:53.960 align:start position:0%
which is the conduct of our
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
elections that's how I look at it it's
 
00:20:57.230 --> 00:20:57.240 align:start position:0%
pretty simple that's why son is a
 
00:20:57.240 --> 00:20:58.950 align:start position:0%
pretty simple that's why son is a
co-sponsor

00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor
 
00:21:00.990 --> 00:21:01.000 align:start position:0%
um I hope you look favorably on it I
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
think representative Barry answered most
 
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:04.360 align:start position:0%
of the technical questions on the EOS
 
00:21:06.270 --> 00:21:06.280 align:start position:0%
but I'm happy to to try to answer
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
anything that you may have remaining
 
00:21:10.909 --> 00:21:10.919 align:start position:0%
thank you um other
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um since you're not
 
00:21:17.870 --> 00:21:17.880 align:start position:0%
one of those four that are listed there
 
00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
um and this kind of goes to rep seller's
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
earlier question um it would seem to me
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
that most all and I think I'm correct in
 
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
saying all of our our um emergency
 
00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.350 align:start position:0%
saying all of our our um emergency
Powers

00:21:32.350 --> 00:21:32.360 align:start position:0%
Powers
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
um incorporates the entire legislature
 
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
um and this does not does that does that
 
00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
worry you or does that bother you or
 
00:21:45.630 --> 00:21:45.640 align:start position:0%
does that you think that that should be
 
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
something different so I have a fair
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
amount of confidence in the leadership
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
of both the majority and the minority
 
00:21:55.590 --> 00:21:55.600 align:start position:0%
offices the the two partisan offices and
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
their ability to quickly communicate
 
00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
um and and perhaps quickly solicit input
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh before they give give or withhold
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
consent for this type of thing so
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
practically speaking if consent is asked
 
00:22:13.789 --> 00:22:13.799 align:start position:0%
for for a potential emergency order to
 
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:15.400 align:start position:0%
delay or alter the conduct of an
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
election I would expect both offices
 
00:22:19.630 --> 00:22:19.640 align:start position:0%
would send an email out to their members
 
00:22:21.110 --> 00:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
to see what they thought I I would I
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
would expect a quick caucus what happen
 
00:22:26.669 --> 00:22:26.679 align:start position:0%
I mean in the in the horribly unlikely
 
00:22:29.549 --> 00:22:29.559 align:start position:0%
event and uh let's never happens of
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
another uh Massive Attack on our country
 
00:22:33.909 --> 00:22:33.919 align:start position:0%
that happens on the day of an election
 
00:22:35.830 --> 00:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
such as 911 which potentially could have
 
00:22:37.830 --> 00:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
been just by you know year off by a year
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
or so um I think that might be the one
 
00:22:44.750 --> 00:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
case where if something happens at 8:45
 
00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:46.720 align:start position:0%
and something else happens at
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
9:30 uh that that could be the situation
 
00:22:53.950 --> 00:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
where widespread input from the entire
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
caucus of either side of either party
 
00:22:58.789 --> 00:22:58.799 align:start position:0%
might be difficult
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
thank you um it would also seem possible
 
00:23:03.350 --> 00:23:03.360 align:start position:0%
these days
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
um that that one of those four may be
 
00:23:14.470 --> 00:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
um unable to be um reached you know
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
there are sailboats in the Caribbean
 
00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:18.080 align:start position:0%
that people are on that uh that
 
00:23:21.669 --> 00:23:21.679 align:start position:0%
occasionally can't uh or have their
 
00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:25.320 align:start position:0%
power turned off um so it it's it's
 
00:23:27.350 --> 00:23:27.360 align:start position:0%
possible um the question I guess is
 
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:31.720 align:start position:0%
whether those four are a safe enough
 
00:23:34.750 --> 00:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
um group of people that would always be
 
00:23:37.950 --> 00:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
able to be reached for purposes of an
 
00:23:40.310 --> 00:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
emergency yeah that's a that's a great
 
00:23:41.669 --> 00:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
question Mr chairman thanks for bringing
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
that up I mean perhaps or design those
 
00:23:48.549 --> 00:23:48.559 align:start position:0%
two words could be added
 
00:23:51.470 --> 00:23:51.480 align:start position:0%
um not sure if that's the exact right
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
wording or designate uh could be you
 
00:23:53.799 --> 00:23:55.149 align:start position:0%
wording or designate uh could be you
know

00:23:55.149 --> 00:23:55.159 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:23:58.549 --> 00:23:58.559 align:start position:0%
or assistant Majority Leader or I'm not
 
00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:00.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure exactly what the righted
 
00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:01.320 align:start position:0%
language would be but could be just or
 
00:24:03.070 --> 00:24:03.080 align:start position:0%
designate thank you I'm sorry I put you
 
00:24:04.789 --> 00:24:04.799 align:start position:0%
in that position it should have been a
 
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:07.200 align:start position:0%
question I think for the for the prime
 
00:24:09.110 --> 00:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
and I think he's indicating he would
 
00:24:12.789 --> 00:24:12.799 align:start position:0%
like to uh chime in oh could he's still
 
00:24:16.029 --> 00:24:16.039 align:start position:0%
here okay oh all right uh thank you the
 
00:24:18.870 --> 00:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
prime spor one further question rep yeah
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you um and I
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
know you're the co-sponsor but I'm
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
wondering now it's like we selected four
 
00:24:29.950 --> 00:24:29.960 align:start position:0%
PE po legislators to be on this but why
 
00:24:32.870 --> 00:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
not the the um speaker of the house and
 
00:24:34.990 --> 00:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
the Senate President yeah that I mean
 
00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a great question I think
 
00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative Barry addressed it
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
previously because by Nature uh the
 
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:42.320 align:start position:0%
those are
 
00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan offices or bipartisan
 
00:24:46.669 --> 00:24:46.679 align:start position:0%
offices right the speaker is elected by
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
the whole house and his his staff or and
 
00:24:52.510 --> 00:24:52.520 align:start position:0%
elections are partisan conducted by
 
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
majority minority parties so it's their
 
00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.750 align:start position:0%
majority minority parties so it's their
leadership

00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
leadership
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.110 align:start position:0%
leadership
specifically

00:24:59.110 --> 00:24:59.120 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
00:25:02.070 --> 00:25:02.080 align:start position:0%
okay thanks very much seeing no other
 
00:25:04.909 --> 00:25:04.919 align:start position:0%
pin cards but I would uh offer the prime
 
00:25:04.919 --> 00:25:05.909 align:start position:0%
pin cards but I would uh offer the prime
sponsor

00:25:05.909 --> 00:25:05.919 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:25:10.389 --> 00:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
to come to the witness table again yeah
 
00:25:11.870 --> 00:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
uh so to the point of are they going to
 
00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:13.320 align:start position:0%
be unreachable I remind you we're
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
talking about elections and we're
 
00:25:16.510 --> 00:25:16.520 align:start position:0%
talking about the majority and minority
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
leaders do you think they're going to be
 
00:25:22.029 --> 00:25:22.039 align:start position:0%
on a cruise on Election Day do you think
 
00:25:23.149 --> 00:25:23.159 align:start position:0%
they're going to be unreachable on
 
00:25:25.909 --> 00:25:25.919 align:start position:0%
Election Day my guess is those four
 
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:27.240 align:start position:0%
individuals will actually be very
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
reachable on Election Day um so that
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
would be my that would be my my counter
 
00:25:32.510 --> 00:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
punch to that is we are dealing with
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
elections and we are dealing with
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
partisan leaders um who are in charge of
 
00:25:38.269 --> 00:25:38.279 align:start position:0%
getting their caucuses expanded uh and I
 
00:25:40.029 --> 00:25:40.039 align:start position:0%
highly doubt uh that they will be
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
unreachable um or on a cruise and if
 
00:25:43.789 --> 00:25:43.799 align:start position:0%
they are they probably won't be the
 
00:25:46.070 --> 00:25:46.080 align:start position:0%
majority of minority leader much longer
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay so hold on
 
00:25:52.669 --> 00:25:52.679 align:start position:0%
um uh two questions one is um it is
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
possible that um medical emergencies
 
00:25:58.029 --> 00:25:58.039 align:start position:0%
come up but secondly um where where is
 
00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:00.360 align:start position:0%
this for strictly the day of the
 
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:02.600 align:start position:0%
election it's well it's for all it's for
 
00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
all of them right so I mean if if it's
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
an if it's emergency like that right if
 
00:26:08.029 --> 00:26:08.039 align:start position:0%
we're talking about we're talking about
 
00:26:11.389 --> 00:26:11.399 align:start position:0%
the 911 situation right um talk about
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
any situation it doesn't I don't see
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
that this is dealing strictly with the
 
00:26:20.789 --> 00:26:20.799 align:start position:0%
the day of the election well correct but
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
you're the the the question you proposed
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
right is an immediacy issue right so an
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
immediacy issue would be on the day of
 
00:26:30.870 --> 00:26:30.880 align:start position:0%
the election right what I I deal with
 
00:26:32.870 --> 00:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
election laws right they're very focused
 
00:26:35.630 --> 00:26:35.640 align:start position:0%
on one day um so if you're dealing with
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
something that's farther than 28 days
 
00:26:39.669 --> 00:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
out the legislator actually gets to aine
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
in that um they do it's not like you
 
00:26:44.870 --> 00:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
still need the consent on this bill to
 
00:26:46.389 --> 00:26:46.399 align:start position:0%
change but the legislator because of the
 
00:26:48.510 --> 00:26:48.520 align:start position:0%
existing EO laws actually gets to aine
 
00:26:50.269 --> 00:26:50.279 align:start position:0%
in that so we are dealing with a very
 
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
narrow window in practicality whether
 
00:26:54.789 --> 00:26:54.799 align:start position:0%
it's spelled out explicitly or not you
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
are dealing with by the way the EO law
 
00:26:59.710 --> 00:26:59.720 align:start position:0%
is currently written a narrow window and
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
I highly doubt that they will be
 
00:27:01.909 --> 00:27:01.919 align:start position:0%
unreachable if you want to put in some
 
00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:04.720 align:start position:0%
sort of Safeguard I'd be open to it um
 
00:27:05.549 --> 00:27:05.559 align:start position:0%
you know if they're medically
 
00:27:08.950 --> 00:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
incapacitated or something um but you
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
know right now my my counter point would
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
be is what if the governor's medically
 
00:27:14.070 --> 00:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
incapacitated I guess then goes
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
lieutenant governor I don't
 
00:27:18.750 --> 00:27:18.760 align:start position:0%
know uh thanks that's most thanks for
 
00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
your for your input um we're good I
 
00:27:26.190 --> 00:27:26.200 align:start position:0%
think no other further questions thank
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
you having no other pink cards um and no
 
00:27:32.110 --> 00:27:32.120 align:start position:0%
one in the audience that would like to
 
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:36.760 --> 00:27:56.509 align:start position:0%
 
1343

00:27:56.509 --> 00:27:56.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:56.519 --> 00:28:35.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
we were supposed to be calling uh House
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%

00:29:51.269 --> 00:29:51.279 align:start position:0%
of the heavy
 
00:29:53.710 --> 00:29:53.720 align:start position:0%

of us um
 
00:30:10.470 --> 00:30:10.480 align:start position:0%
were new to our roles um several months
 
00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:14.360 align:start position:0%
ago and in trying to um organize
 
00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:17.200 align:start position:0%
ourselves in the group we referred to
 
00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:21.320 align:start position:0%
the RSA quite frequently and um realized
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
that we would like to try to
 
00:30:28.190 --> 00:30:28.200 align:start position:0%
um change a little a little it for two
 
00:30:30.750 --> 00:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
reasons to provide a little bit more
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
structure and reference for the current
 
00:30:39.269 --> 00:30:39.279 align:start position:0%
Council but also um for uh ease in um
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
transferring or handing the torch to new
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
folks who will be coming after us and so
 
00:30:47.070 --> 00:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
on and so forth and so uh literally the
 
00:30:49.470 --> 00:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
title of the Bill of the analysis of of
 
00:30:51.669 --> 00:30:51.679 align:start position:0%
the bill is really what Our intention
 
00:30:53.950 --> 00:30:53.960 align:start position:0%
was refining existing practices and
 
00:30:56.110 --> 00:30:56.120 align:start position:0%
procedures of the legislative youth
 
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
advisory Council
 
00:30:58.120 --> 00:30:58.830 align:start position:0%
advisory Council
and

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
you you will stick around for questions
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
all all right yeah thank you hello Mr
 
00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
00:31:10.230 --> 00:31:10.240 align:start position:0%
name is James TBO and as um
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson said I'm the Youth
 
00:31:13.830 --> 00:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
co-chair of the council so we've been
 
00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760 align:start position:0%
serving with each other since around
 
00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
April um I wasn't officially made chair
 
00:31:20.509 --> 00:31:20.519 align:start position:0%
until July but I was serving as Vice
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
chair at the time when the um previous
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
chairman um abdicated his duties we'll
 
00:31:27.789 --> 00:31:27.799 align:start position:0%
say um
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
so basically I I'm the author of this
 
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
bill um um representative Nelson was
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
kind enough to introduce it for me but
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
um this is something I've been working
 
00:31:39.470 --> 00:31:39.480 align:start position:0%
on since August and it's um like she
 
00:31:40.950 --> 00:31:40.960 align:start position:0%
said it's refining the practices and
 
00:31:43.310 --> 00:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
procedures of our Council the um the
 
00:31:44.950 --> 00:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
council provides a great outlet for
 
00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
youth to get involved in state um
 
00:31:48.750 --> 00:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
government and state politics um a great
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
way to um get connected with people I
 
00:31:54.070 --> 00:31:54.080 align:start position:0%
mean I know that I knew nothing about
 
00:31:55.509 --> 00:31:55.519 align:start position:0%
this world when I got started here as a
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
sophomore and now I've t testified so
 
00:32:00.669 --> 00:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
many times before the legislature so
 
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:03.200 align:start position:0%
this is to really just clarify it so we
 
00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480 align:start position:0%
can get started each Council year more
 
00:32:07.750 --> 00:32:07.760 align:start position:0%
quickly and to open it up to more
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
members so um the first change to it
 
00:32:13.830 --> 00:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
would allow members um to apply age 14
 
00:32:15.789 --> 00:32:15.799 align:start position:0%
rather than age 15 to introdu some of
 
00:32:18.870 --> 00:32:18.880 align:start position:0%
the younger members more readily um but
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
the biggest change is that um it's
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
adding an application process right now
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
there's no clear application process
 
00:32:27.430 --> 00:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
which makes it very hard to get the
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
appointments done because in theory the
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
governor the Speaker of the House the
 
00:32:32.990 --> 00:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
president of the Senate and the
 
00:32:35.389 --> 00:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State can appoint whomever
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
they want age 15 to 22 to the council
 
00:32:39.870 --> 00:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
and the difficulty with that is they
 
00:32:42.549 --> 00:32:42.559 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily have to um meet our
 
00:32:44.389 --> 00:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
recommendation or meet our applications
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
that we have because we have an informal
 
00:32:48.190 --> 00:32:48.200 align:start position:0%
application and that makes it
 
00:32:51.230 --> 00:32:51.240 align:start position:0%
problematic because um and okay I'll use
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
an example from this year we have the
 
00:32:55.190 --> 00:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office who said
 
00:32:57.830 --> 00:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
that they won't um appoint anyone that
 
00:32:59.950 --> 00:32:59.960 align:start position:0%
we send them an application for and
 
00:33:01.389 --> 00:33:01.399 align:start position:0%
they're going to make the appointments
 
00:33:03.149 --> 00:33:03.159 align:start position:0%
completely on their own well that would
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
be well and good but they don't have
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
anyone going to the Secretary of State's
 
00:33:09.789 --> 00:33:09.799 align:start position:0%
office pursuing those vacancies so the
 
00:33:11.789 --> 00:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
seats just remain vacant and they won't
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
work with us to get those seats filled
 
00:33:16.149 --> 00:33:16.159 align:start position:0%
so we just have like three vacancies on
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
the council at this point because they
 
00:33:19.990 --> 00:33:20.000 align:start position:0%
won't fill them um so this provides a
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
clear application process that they must
 
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:23.480 align:start position:0%
follow all applications must be
 
00:33:26.310 --> 00:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
submitted to all the offices um there's
 
00:33:27.629 --> 00:33:27.639 align:start position:0%
what I like to call an anti-nepotism
 
00:33:30.870 --> 00:33:30.880 align:start position:0%
Clause um that prevents any student who
 
00:33:33.310 --> 00:33:33.320 align:start position:0%
knows one of the officers personally
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
from being appointed by that officer um
 
00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:38.080 align:start position:0%
just to prevent that sort of favoritism
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
from occurring um and really it just um
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
ensures that there's a clear timeline
 
00:33:46.789 --> 00:33:46.799 align:start position:0%
for these appointments to happen so we
 
00:33:49.870 --> 00:33:49.880 align:start position:0%
can get started on time so we can best
 
00:33:51.830 --> 00:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
engage with the legislative process as
 
00:33:53.629 --> 00:33:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's happening rather than after the
 
00:33:55.389 --> 00:33:55.399 align:start position:0%
fact which has been one of the issues in
 
00:33:57.149 --> 00:33:57.159 align:start position:0%
previous years we submit a lot of
 
00:33:59.750 --> 00:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
testimony but typically it's after the
 
00:34:01.230 --> 00:34:01.240 align:start position:0%
bills have already been V voted on and
 
00:34:02.190 --> 00:34:02.200 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're trying to
 
00:34:03.750 --> 00:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
correct this year and I've been working
 
00:34:06.389 --> 00:34:06.399 align:start position:0%
very diligently to ensure that happens
 
00:34:10.069 --> 00:34:10.079 align:start position:0%
um it's also adds a lot more language in
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
regards to collaboration with other
 
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:14.760 align:start position:0%
councils so it's adding a non- voting
 
00:34:15.909 --> 00:34:15.919 align:start position:0%
member from the governor's youth
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
advisory Council um um as a member of
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
lak and so that will allow us to
 
00:34:24.990 --> 00:34:25.000 align:start position:0%
coordinate with them better um on term
 
00:34:27.149 --> 00:34:27.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of drug policy which is very
 
00:34:28.510 --> 00:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
important for both of us and allow them
 
00:34:29.909 --> 00:34:29.919 align:start position:0%
to work with us when it comes to
 
00:34:31.430 --> 00:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
legislative policy which they are less
 
00:34:35.790 --> 00:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
experienced in um it also adds um a
 
00:34:37.550 --> 00:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
mandate for us to work with other states
 
00:34:39.550 --> 00:34:39.560 align:start position:0%
youth advisory councils because that's
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
again something I've been trying to um
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
work with because across all of these
 
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
states all of our councils we have a
 
00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
common goal of trying to increase youth
 
00:34:50.349 --> 00:34:50.359 align:start position:0%
Civic engagement so we've been trying to
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
work together and by adding that
 
00:34:54.109 --> 00:34:54.119 align:start position:0%
language we can have a clear mandate to
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
continue that into the future even after
 
00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
I'm gone
 
00:35:01.030 --> 00:35:01.040 align:start position:0%
um and it also adds language in regards
 
00:35:04.910 --> 00:35:04.920 align:start position:0%
to um remote participation meetings so
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
if a member can't make it they can join
 
00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:10.200 align:start position:0%
a meeting remotely and that is very
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
important because some of our members
 
00:35:13.589 --> 00:35:13.599 align:start position:0%
they can't drive and they might be all
 
00:35:15.670 --> 00:35:15.680 align:start position:0%
the way up in like the very North Point
 
00:35:17.710 --> 00:35:17.720 align:start position:0%
of Coos County they can't necessarily
 
00:35:19.990 --> 00:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
make it to conquered especially if it's
 
00:35:21.270 --> 00:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
like in the middle of a blizzard or
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
something and maybe we'd reschedule but
 
00:35:24.750 --> 00:35:24.760 align:start position:0%
we could it would also give us the
 
00:35:27.030 --> 00:35:27.040 align:start position:0%
ability to have them participate
 
00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
remotely if that if we choose to proceed
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
with an inperson meeting um it also adds
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
more clarity about what our annual
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
seminar would be it the statute as it's
 
00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:41.440 align:start position:0%
currently written mandates that we have
 
00:35:45.510 --> 00:35:45.520 align:start position:0%
an annual seminar um every August well
 
00:35:47.109 --> 00:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't get started in August
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
because of the appointment process now
 
00:35:51.309 --> 00:35:51.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully that won't happen but now it
 
00:35:53.589 --> 00:35:53.599 align:start position:0%
says instead of August within 30 days of
 
00:35:54.990 --> 00:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
receiving the final appointments of that
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
Council year um and it also clarifies
 
00:36:01.390 --> 00:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
what that um seminar will include which
 
00:36:03.910 --> 00:36:03.920 align:start position:0%
is an in an instruction on parliamentary
 
00:36:06.230 --> 00:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
procedure a tour of the state house and
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
other such things as would prove
 
00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:11.720 align:start position:0%
beneficial to the council um it would
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
also um include that um several mandates
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
regarding um how we coordinate with
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
other councils and committees including
 
00:36:23.589 --> 00:36:23.599 align:start position:0%
House and Senate committees um it says
 
00:36:24.829 --> 00:36:24.839 align:start position:0%
that the legislative members will not
 
00:36:26.270 --> 00:36:26.280 align:start position:0%
hold a vote which is how we typically
 
00:36:28.390 --> 00:36:28.400 align:start position:0%
operate at this point except for the
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
member from the House of Representatives
 
00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
who will be able to break any ties that
 
00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:37.839 align:start position:0%
um come up um and it um makes statutory
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
um the rule that we already have in the
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
council regarding um subcommittees so um
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
instead of just being something that we
 
00:36:48.190 --> 00:36:48.200 align:start position:0%
do as a like just a common practice of
 
00:36:49.790 --> 00:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
the council now it's statutory that we
 
00:36:51.910 --> 00:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
will divide into subcommittees based on
 
00:36:55.390 --> 00:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
different issues of interest to um our
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
members um
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
and um most importantly to me is that it
 
00:37:05.470 --> 00:37:05.480 align:start position:0%
adds language allowing two members of
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
lak to join the um New Hampshire State
 
00:37:11.470 --> 00:37:11.480 align:start position:0%
Board of Education as non- voting
 
00:37:14.309 --> 00:37:14.319 align:start position:0%
members several other states um have
 
00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
non- voting members on their state
 
00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:18.079 align:start position:0%
boards of education and we have it um
 
00:37:21.150 --> 00:37:21.160 align:start position:0%
now as a statutory requirement that um
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
youth members are on all of our local
 
00:37:25.430 --> 00:37:25.440 align:start position:0%
school boards so this would be extending
 
00:37:29.309 --> 00:37:29.319 align:start position:0%
that almost exact same language um to
 
00:37:31.069 --> 00:37:31.079 align:start position:0%
the State Board of Education so that our
 
00:37:33.510 --> 00:37:33.520 align:start position:0%
students have input at the state level
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
but by doing it through liak it allows
 
00:37:37.390 --> 00:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
us to better coordinate that with an
 
00:37:39.470 --> 00:37:39.480 align:start position:0%
existing body that works with youth
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
policy and to make that appointment
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
process more streamlined rather than
 
00:37:46.069 --> 00:37:46.079 align:start position:0%
trying to pick two students from across
 
00:37:49.270 --> 00:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
the state through a different statute
 
00:37:55.670 --> 00:37:55.680 align:start position:0%
and finally it um changes the May in um
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
the office of the speaker of the house
 
00:37:58.870 --> 00:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
or the president of the Senate um May
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
provide reasonable staff assistance to
 
00:38:03.470 --> 00:38:03.480 align:start position:0%
shall if requested by the co-chairs
 
00:38:05.309 --> 00:38:05.319 align:start position:0%
which allows for us to get some support
 
00:38:07.030 --> 00:38:07.040 align:start position:0%
from them and provides examples of what
 
00:38:09.150 --> 00:38:09.160 align:start position:0%
that may include such as scheduling
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
rooms reserving um them for us to be
 
00:38:15.470 --> 00:38:15.480 align:start position:0%
able to um meet here in the lob or
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
scheduling meetings and putting them in
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate calendars for
 
00:38:20.670 --> 00:38:20.680 align:start position:0%
announcement um or um setting up video
 
00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:22.640 align:start position:0%
conferencing as well or anything else
 
00:38:24.870 --> 00:38:24.880 align:start position:0%
that we may need assistance with so it
 
00:38:28.430 --> 00:38:28.440 align:start position:0%
just so the Bill generally just provides
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
lak with more support from the
 
00:38:31.829 --> 00:38:31.839 align:start position:0%
legislature which I believe is would be
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
really beneficial to us and be able to
 
00:38:36.630 --> 00:38:36.640 align:start position:0%
help support the youth in our state far
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
better than as the statute is currently
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
written and um representative Nelson and
 
00:38:42.829 --> 00:38:42.839 align:start position:0%
I have talked and we'd be open to
 
00:38:44.309 --> 00:38:44.319 align:start position:0%
amendments to the bill if there's
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
something that we see wrong if there
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
seen wrong with it but we really think
 
00:38:49.829 --> 00:38:49.839 align:start position:0%
that the bill as it currently stands
 
00:38:53.430 --> 00:38:53.440 align:start position:0%
will be able to drastically improve the
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
council and the way we are able to
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
function so with that that being said um
 
00:38:59.069 --> 00:38:59.079 align:start position:0%
I think both of us will be happy to
 
00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:02.040 align:start position:0%
answer any questions you might
 
00:39:05.990 --> 00:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
have thank you Mr chairman um you're an
 
00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
impressive young man thank you uh this
 
00:39:12.670 --> 00:39:12.680 align:start position:0%
uh do I understand that this is a
 
00:39:16.109 --> 00:39:16.119 align:start position:0%
complete rewrite of the existing statute
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
as it currently exists no so so it is a
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
repeal and reenact that is a choice by
 
00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:27.760 align:start position:0%
the by OS as it um but it is really just
 
00:39:30.670 --> 00:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
additive so most of the language in here
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
that is not um new is what already exist
 
00:39:37.630 --> 00:39:37.640 align:start position:0%
in statute uh the um copy of the bill I
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
handed out highlights every single
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment to the bill so it's not a
 
00:39:43.230 --> 00:39:43.240 align:start position:0%
complete rewrite but it's significant
 
00:39:46.550 --> 00:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
additions to the bill I see um what
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
we're used to is uh is to have
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
italicized or bold language put in when
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
it's new Y and they chose to repeal and
 
00:39:59.109 --> 00:39:59.119 align:start position:0%
reenact I don't know why
 
00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
okay that'll make it a little more
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
difficult um are you willing to take
 
00:40:05.470 --> 00:40:05.480 align:start position:0%
questions absolutely I've already asked
 
00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:08.040 align:start position:0%
you some so it's kind of immaterial um
 
00:40:09.589 --> 00:40:09.599 align:start position:0%
are there questions
 
00:40:12.309 --> 00:40:12.319 align:start position:0%
for either the prime sponsor or the
 
00:40:16.270 --> 00:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
coach uh yep
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
represent uh thank you Mr chair and
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions um I
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
am very impressed with the amount of
 
00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
work and knowledge and uh how you can
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
speak to this I I hope hope to be able
 
00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
to do that one day
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
myself U my question I have two
 
00:40:34.030 --> 00:40:34.040 align:start position:0%
questions uh first one is how many uh
 
00:40:36.589 --> 00:40:36.599 align:start position:0%
members on the legislative youth
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
advisory Council right now so the
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
statutory limit is 21 one member from
 
00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:44.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate one member from the House of
 
00:40:47.150 --> 00:40:47.160 align:start position:0%
Representatives seven postsecondary
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
youth which is defined as anyone who
 
00:40:52.030 --> 00:40:52.040 align:start position:0%
currently attends a New Hampshire
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
college or university um or someone
 
00:40:55.870 --> 00:40:55.880 align:start position:0%
who's part of the New Hampshire
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
Workforce and then 12 secondary students
 
00:41:03.069 --> 00:41:03.079 align:start position:0%
right now I believe we have 15 youth
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
members there are that we have I believe
 
00:41:09.190 --> 00:41:09.200 align:start position:0%
four vacancies one being a secondary
 
00:41:12.670 --> 00:41:12.680 align:start position:0%
student and three being post-secondary
 
00:41:14.349 --> 00:41:14.359 align:start position:0%
so that is something that we do have an
 
00:41:17.309 --> 00:41:17.319 align:start position:0%
issue with in terms we um we have a lot
 
00:41:18.870 --> 00:41:18.880 align:start position:0%
of issues recruiting postsecondary
 
00:41:21.430 --> 00:41:21.440 align:start position:0%
members we think that they provide a
 
00:41:25.470 --> 00:41:25.480 align:start position:0%
great deal of insight into the council
 
00:41:27.630 --> 00:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
um from a different perspective so we
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
think that um they do serve an important
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
role but they are certainly harder to
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
recruit for and the other issue is that
 
00:41:38.550 --> 00:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
there's um with some of our former
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
members there's an issue with
 
00:41:42.990 --> 00:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
communication so um some of them have
 
00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
graduated and they've moved out of state
 
00:41:48.150 --> 00:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
um but we never got a formal um notice
 
00:41:50.069 --> 00:41:50.079 align:start position:0%
of that and for that reason it makes it
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
harder to coordinate with the appointing
 
00:41:53.990 --> 00:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
officers to get them replaced because
 
00:41:55.550 --> 00:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
there was no formal letter of
 
00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.829 align:start position:0%
there was no formal letter of
resignation

00:41:56.829 --> 00:41:56.839 align:start position:0%
resignation
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
and so they have to like go through all
 
00:42:00.230 --> 00:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
their processes to make sure you know
 
00:42:03.589 --> 00:42:03.599 align:start position:0%
they can't reach this kid and um but so
 
00:42:04.510 --> 00:42:04.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that we're currently
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
dealing with as well trying to get those
 
00:42:08.349 --> 00:42:08.359 align:start position:0%
old members officially removed so that
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
we can um reappoint them of course
 
00:42:14.510 --> 00:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up so my second
 
00:42:17.349 --> 00:42:17.359 align:start position:0%
question is um I I'm wondering where in
 
00:42:21.230 --> 00:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
the process any of your members uh study
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution or the US
 
00:42:26.470 --> 00:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
Constitution as you know or may not know
 
00:42:28.910 --> 00:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
that uh we take this oath to uphold the
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
Constitution so uh many of us look at
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
legislation that we pass and ask
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
ourselves is it constitutional is that
 
00:42:40.430 --> 00:42:40.440 align:start position:0%
something that your group follows in the
 
00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
or thank you for taking our question
 
00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative we have actually
 
00:42:55.190 --> 00:42:55.200 align:start position:0%
discussed that and we um with uh we're
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
we're organized ing um speakers to come
 
00:43:01.470 --> 00:43:01.480 align:start position:0%
uh and you actually were somebody that
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
we thought would be somebody who would
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
be great to talk to us about that very
 
00:43:09.390 --> 00:43:09.400 align:start position:0%
subject um so yes I think that's
 
00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:11.240 align:start position:0%
important to
 
00:43:14.549 --> 00:43:14.559 align:start position:0%
us yeah and speaking personally I I am
 
00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
very passionate about um both the US and
 
00:43:19.349 --> 00:43:19.359 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire constitutions um so I
 
00:43:20.950 --> 00:43:20.960 align:start position:0%
I would agree that we should absolutely
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
study it more maybe that's something
 
00:43:24.790 --> 00:43:24.800 align:start position:0%
that we can work into the annual seminar
 
00:43:27.430 --> 00:43:27.440 align:start position:0%
and one of the areas of so two of the
 
00:43:28.950 --> 00:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
areas of focus that we really wanted to
 
00:43:30.910 --> 00:43:30.920 align:start position:0%
have this year were in regards to civic
 
00:43:33.710 --> 00:43:33.720 align:start position:0%
education and mental health so we were
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
looking into having um public forums um
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
on those issues and how we can try to
 
00:43:40.349 --> 00:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
address them and work with the
 
00:43:42.069 --> 00:43:42.079 align:start position:0%
legislature to address them from a youth
 
00:43:45.670 --> 00:43:45.680 align:start position:0%
perspective so um we wanted so that
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
those public forums as we've had them in
 
00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:49.480 align:start position:0%
the past include bringing in state
 
00:43:52.030 --> 00:43:52.040 align:start position:0%
Commissioners and legislators and other
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
people involved with that process to try
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
to speak to those points so we would
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
probably bring in like School
 
00:44:00.309 --> 00:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
administrators and the like for those
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
and that is something that we definitely
 
00:44:04.390 --> 00:44:04.400 align:start position:0%
want to pursue because um we believe
 
00:44:06.190 --> 00:44:06.200 align:start position:0%
that the civic education in the state is
 
00:44:10.670 --> 00:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:13.750 --> 00:44:13.760 align:start position:0%
Improvement yes rep sers thank you Mr
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
chair as uh as uh chairman Hill stated
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
before we're not used to getting
 
00:44:21.549 --> 00:44:21.559 align:start position:0%
documents like this so I my question is
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
what's the key is what does blue mean
 
00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
what's pink mean what key on the first
 
00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
page huh keys on the first PL first page
 
00:44:31.430 --> 00:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
a up top I missed that thank you of
 
00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:33.640 align:start position:0%
course when you take us out of our
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
comfort zone it's a little I totally
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
understand thank you Mr chair uh to
 
00:44:41.670 --> 00:44:41.680 align:start position:0%
bounce off a little bit of what
 
00:44:44.150 --> 00:44:44.160 align:start position:0%
repellers just said in three terms I've
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
never had uh legislative changes sent to
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
me multicolored that is um sorry about
 
00:44:52.069 --> 00:44:52.079 align:start position:0%
that no no no don't don't presume that
 
00:44:55.950 --> 00:44:55.960 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to it I just I it's just
 
00:44:57.470 --> 00:44:57.480 align:start position:0%
something I've I've read thousands of
 
00:44:59.589 --> 00:44:59.599 align:start position:0%
bills and and have never had this before
 
00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:03.480 align:start position:0%
so that's um I'm digesting it
 
00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:06.280 align:start position:0%
and I like it on its surface immediately
 
00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:08.640 align:start position:0%
but um what I'm getting my question to
 
00:45:14.349 --> 00:45:14.359 align:start position:0%
you here is the The Advisory
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
Council has had some rocky periods yes
 
00:45:22.190 --> 00:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:26.150 --> 00:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
past the current operation that that
 
00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:26.990 align:start position:0%
past the current operation that that
you're

00:45:26.990 --> 00:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
you're
 
00:45:30.549 --> 00:45:30.559 align:start position:0%
co-chairing do you feel that that is
 
00:45:32.349 --> 00:45:32.359 align:start position:0%
working right
 
00:45:34.950 --> 00:45:34.960 align:start position:0%
now and if it's
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
not the the areas to which you are
 
00:45:42.870 --> 00:45:42.880 align:start position:0%
currently having problems would are they
 
00:45:44.790 --> 00:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
would they be solved with what you've
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
handed us here I think so I think that
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
um as I've been running the council it's
 
00:45:52.030 --> 00:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
been very effective and I've been very
 
00:45:53.309 --> 00:45:53.319 align:start position:0%
happy to work with the people that we
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
have and I think that aot lot of our
 
00:45:57.870 --> 00:45:57.880 align:start position:0%
issues in the past have come down to the
 
00:46:01.270 --> 00:46:01.280 align:start position:0%
fact that there has been no real process
 
00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
for appointments to happen and um quite
 
00:46:08.710 --> 00:46:08.720 align:start position:0%
frankly um previous co-chairs um going
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
back quite a few years they took
 
00:46:14.030 --> 00:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
applications um and then only sent in
 
00:46:16.990 --> 00:46:17.000 align:start position:0%
the ones that they wanted appointed so
 
00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:20.920 align:start position:0%
they may have gotten like like 20 or 30
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
and they sent in the 19 that they
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
thought would be best fit with their
 
00:46:28.670 --> 00:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
part of an agenda and so by having a
 
00:46:31.069 --> 00:46:31.079 align:start position:0%
clear process in place um that would
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
allow for only the best candidates to be
 
00:46:34.109 --> 00:46:34.119 align:start position:0%
selected because all of the applications
 
00:46:35.990 --> 00:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
would be completely transparent to all
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
of the app pointers and that is
 
00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
something that as I've been personally
 
00:46:41.870 --> 00:46:41.880 align:start position:0%
working with all of their offices
 
00:46:44.549 --> 00:46:44.559 align:start position:0%
they've never seen from us before I and
 
00:46:45.349 --> 00:46:45.359 align:start position:0%
that's something I've been trying to
 
00:46:46.589 --> 00:46:46.599 align:start position:0%
change and they've been greatly
 
00:46:48.069 --> 00:46:48.079 align:start position:0%
appreciative of that fact the fact that
 
00:46:49.390 --> 00:46:49.400 align:start position:0%
they actually get a choice in who
 
00:46:50.910 --> 00:46:50.920 align:start position:0%
they're appointing because in the past
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
they never got that choice it was a
 
00:46:54.470 --> 00:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
false choice and that was certainly
 
00:46:56.349 --> 00:46:56.359 align:start position:0%
violative of Statute as a current as it
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
currently stands but now it would be
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
even clearer and would provide an actual
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
process for those applications to be
 
00:47:03.270 --> 00:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
submitted because in the past there was
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
never an actual application process so
 
00:47:07.630 --> 00:47:07.640 align:start position:0%
it would allow for the students who are
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
best fit and the ones who will actually
 
00:47:12.190 --> 00:47:12.200 align:start position:0%
best um represent the council and best
 
00:47:14.270 --> 00:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
do their best work on the council to be
 
00:47:18.150 --> 00:47:18.160 align:start position:0%
appointed rather than whoever the um
 
00:47:20.069 --> 00:47:20.079 align:start position:0%
legislative co-chair thinks will be best
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:26.270 --> 00:47:26.280 align:start position:0%
case so
 
00:47:29.870 --> 00:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
uh repes yeah thank you Mr chair so all
 
00:47:31.670 --> 00:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
right now I see the
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
key but I'm just trying to and maybe I'm
 
00:47:38.069 --> 00:47:38.079 align:start position:0%
just slow and I'm I'm new to this but
 
00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:40.400 align:start position:0%
you got pink is that application what
 
00:47:43.150 --> 00:47:43.160 align:start position:0%
what is that is that like a new section
 
00:47:46.750 --> 00:47:46.760 align:start position:0%
is or is that um strike through meaning
 
00:47:50.309 --> 00:47:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's deleted or I um anything
 
00:47:52.270 --> 00:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
highlighted is additions to the bill so
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
that is okay um so I wanted that to be
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
an entirely new section on its own but
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
they decided OS decided when they were
 
00:48:05.790 --> 00:48:05.800 align:start position:0%
drafting it to include it under 19k 2 um
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
but all of that is new language
 
00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:09.480 align:start position:0%
regarding the application process
 
00:48:10.829 --> 00:48:10.839 align:start position:0%
because app present on application
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
process doesn't
 
00:48:14.589 --> 00:48:14.599 align:start position:0%
exist so so everything that's
 
00:48:17.109 --> 00:48:17.119 align:start position:0%
highlighted is is addition yes is
 
00:48:20.829 --> 00:48:20.839 align:start position:0%
addition okay sure that helps yeah um
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
and I do apologize um you know as you
 
00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
know I see a lot of bills too and I
 
00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
under understand that it's difficult
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
because it's not uh the changes are not
 
00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:33.760 align:start position:0%
struck through or italicized um and it's
 
00:48:36.270 --> 00:48:36.280 align:start position:0%
the way that OS decided for us to
 
00:48:38.589 --> 00:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
present this bill it was a little bit
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
challenging and difficult for us as well
 
00:48:43.230 --> 00:48:43.240 align:start position:0%
when we were trying to make sure that um
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
our our requests for the changes or
 
00:48:47.790 --> 00:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
additions were in the bill so I do
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%
apologize for that and um thank you to
 
00:48:53.190 --> 00:48:53.200 align:start position:0%
James for trying to at least um help out
 
00:48:55.270 --> 00:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
but I do know that it is confusing and I
 
00:48:58.710 --> 00:48:58.720 align:start position:0%
apolog apologize for that no worries so
 
00:49:01.270 --> 00:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
here's my intention with this uh for the
 
00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.150 align:start position:0%
here's my intention with this uh for the
committee

00:49:03.150 --> 00:49:03.160 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:49:07.990 --> 00:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
um aside from that difficulty um I think
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
there's more here than meets the eye
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
with just uh the way this is drafted and
 
00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
some of the other ideas that have been
 
00:49:18.190 --> 00:49:18.200 align:start position:0%
brought up in the past so my intention
 
00:49:23.190 --> 00:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
is to form a subcommittee um and have
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
rep uh she and chair the subcommittee um
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
I think we have rep Hobson rep nutting
 
00:49:36.349 --> 00:49:36.359 align:start position:0%
Wong rep TIY um thus far um I put in the
 
00:49:39.309 --> 00:49:39.319 align:start position:0%
calendar for the
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
7th 15th so we are um our
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
next or a session day that we have
 
00:49:50.069 --> 00:49:50.079 align:start position:0%
coming up in
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
February um is the day the governor is
 
00:49:56.069 --> 00:49:56.079 align:start position:0%
giving his uh inauguration
 
00:49:58.870 --> 00:49:58.880 align:start position:0%
and that is going to start at
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
1:00 so uh the idea would be for the
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to meet in the morning of
 
00:50:08.309 --> 00:50:08.319 align:start position:0%
that day um since everyone's already
 
00:50:10.950 --> 00:50:10.960 align:start position:0%
planning on being here anyway for that
 
00:50:13.150 --> 00:50:13.160 align:start position:0%
that session day so the subcommittee
 
00:50:16.470 --> 00:50:16.480 align:start position:0%
would meet um I think it would be
 
00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
advantageous but the chairman of the
 
00:50:21.430 --> 00:50:21.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can do whatever she wants
 
00:50:22.789 --> 00:50:22.799 align:start position:0%
um I would think it would be
 
00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:25.799 align:start position:0%
advantageous to invite some of the
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
stakeholders obviously the legislative
 
00:50:32.750 --> 00:50:32.760 align:start position:0%
Council um and rep Nelson and um and
 
00:50:35.390 --> 00:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
begin the conversation at least from the
 
00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the existing bill I have
 
00:50:43.349 --> 00:50:43.359 align:start position:0%
seen um an amendment to that um come
 
00:50:46.390 --> 00:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
floated through and that may need to be
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
um added into the mix but uh for me
 
00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.230 align:start position:0%
um added into the mix but uh for me
there's

00:50:51.230 --> 00:50:51.240 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
primarily I'm going to say two areas
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
that should be of concentration ation
 
00:51:02.270 --> 00:51:02.280 align:start position:0%
one is um the idea of um
 
00:51:05.430 --> 00:51:05.440 align:start position:0%
diversification uh the original
 
00:51:08.349 --> 00:51:08.359 align:start position:0%
legislative youth advisory Council had a
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
mandate to for the council to be
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
Diversified both
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
geographically and um I guess interest
 
00:51:18.589 --> 00:51:18.599 align:start position:0%
it would it would supposed to contain
 
00:51:20.829 --> 00:51:20.839 align:start position:0%
may I speak to that well you will in a
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
second yep um it's supposed to contain
 
00:51:27.710 --> 00:51:27.720 align:start position:0%
um Geographic uh children from all parts
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire supposed to contain um
 
00:51:34.390 --> 00:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
public private H School charter school
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
whatever it's very difficult with four
 
00:51:41.349 --> 00:51:41.359 align:start position:0%
appointing offices that are um not in
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
communication to to come out with the
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
Diversified Council um it it I've seen
 
00:51:51.150 --> 00:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
it happen for all my time here um so
 
00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's one area that I think needs to be
 
00:51:57.910 --> 00:51:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh looked at so that bleeds over into
 
00:52:02.109 --> 00:52:02.119 align:start position:0%
the idea of um this application and pool
 
00:52:04.190 --> 00:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
I don't believe in the current well I
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
know in the in the original documents
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
there was no application that was done
 
00:52:12.069 --> 00:52:12.079 align:start position:0%
it was just an appointment by by the
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
speaker the Senate President the
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State and the governor no
 
00:52:19.589 --> 00:52:19.599 align:start position:0%
applications no names were given to them
 
00:52:22.190 --> 00:52:22.200 align:start position:0%
um that's somewhat evolved I think
 
00:52:25.030 --> 00:52:25.040 align:start position:0%
outside of the document um that enables
 
00:52:30.349 --> 00:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
the op the operation to exist but um I
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
think there's a number of things here
 
00:52:35.710 --> 00:52:35.720 align:start position:0%
that need to be addressed I'm hoping the
 
00:52:38.150 --> 00:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
study committee can identify those
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
things that need to be addressed um and
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
I think it wouldn't be bad um to come up
 
00:52:46.069 --> 00:52:46.079 align:start position:0%
with some recommendations for the entire
 
00:52:48.750 --> 00:52:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee um so let them meet on the
 
00:52:51.069 --> 00:52:51.079 align:start position:0%
15th and then come back we have this is
 
00:52:54.510 --> 00:52:54.520 align:start position:0%
not an early Bill we have until um Mid
 
00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:57.599 align:start position:0%
mid-march before we uh need to have this
 
00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
reported out so I think we have some
 
00:53:04.349 --> 00:53:04.359 align:start position:0%
time um that's my intention you you
 
00:53:06.549 --> 00:53:06.559 align:start position:0%
would like to make a comment sure so the
 
00:53:08.510 --> 00:53:08.520 align:start position:0%
original language of the statute says
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
Geographic and socioeconomic diversity
 
00:53:12.990 --> 00:53:13.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say anything about ideology
 
00:53:16.549 --> 00:53:16.559 align:start position:0%
or about um um different schooling um
 
00:53:18.309 --> 00:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
capacities although I would like to see
 
00:53:20.430 --> 00:53:20.440 align:start position:0%
that included and I do add the word
 
00:53:23.430 --> 00:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
ideological diversity to the um Statute
 
00:53:25.710 --> 00:53:25.720 align:start position:0%
in this bill um and I would agree that
 
00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
we need more diversity from
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
homeschooling and private schooling and
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
Charter schooling um that would be
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
excellent um and um in terms of the
 
00:53:38.670 --> 00:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
study committee um I I guess I don't
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
really because we we spoke on the phone
 
00:53:42.990 --> 00:53:43.000 align:start position:0%
previously and I drafted a lot of
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
amendments I thought addressed a lot of
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
the concerns so um I'm not sure why
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
there isn't more discussion on that
 
00:53:50.589 --> 00:53:50.599 align:start position:0%
rather than trying to prolong the
 
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:53.040 align:start position:0%
process through a study committee but um
 
00:53:54.470 --> 00:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm just not too familiar with the
 
00:53:56.390 --> 00:53:56.400 align:start position:0%
process as a it fully plays out
 
00:53:58.710 --> 00:53:58.720 align:start position:0%
understood so so this can be part of the
 
00:54:02.549 --> 00:54:02.559 align:start position:0%
learning curve okay so um in this room
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
um the vice chair and I are king and
 
00:54:09.470 --> 00:54:09.480 align:start position:0%
queen um so we are deciding that uh in
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
addition to you notice we didn't mention
 
00:54:14.829 --> 00:54:14.839 align:start position:0%
the the amendment didn't bring it in
 
00:54:18.710 --> 00:54:18.720 align:start position:0%
yeah um so what that I would believe
 
00:54:22.630 --> 00:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
that that document um and quite frankly
 
00:54:24.829 --> 00:54:24.839 align:start position:0%
it's up to the chair of the subcommittee
 
00:54:27.870 --> 00:54:27.880 align:start position:0%
but that document would be part of that
 
00:54:30.710 --> 00:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
study committee okay so
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
um she will have the ability to pick and
 
00:54:35.549 --> 00:54:35.559 align:start position:0%
choose what comes out of this bill
 
00:54:37.670 --> 00:54:37.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be recommended to the
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
committee she will have pick and choose
 
00:54:41.829 --> 00:54:41.839 align:start position:0%
what comes out of that Amendment she
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
will pick and choose whatever else comes
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
out of that committee so um we haven't
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
discounted the amendment sure it's just
 
00:54:54.430 --> 00:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
part of we're looking at it in terms um
 
00:54:56.549 --> 00:54:56.559 align:start position:0%
that we don't have the time as a full
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
committee to look at we're we're looking
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
at it individually and then have that
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee come back and recommend to
 
00:55:04.710 --> 00:55:04.720 align:start position:0%
us understood
 
00:55:07.510 --> 00:55:07.520 align:start position:0%
okay yes R thank you Mr chair just a
 
00:55:09.309 --> 00:55:09.319 align:start position:0%
point of clarification I think what
 
00:55:10.349 --> 00:55:10.359 align:start position:0%
we're talking about here is a
 
00:55:12.710 --> 00:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
subcommittee work session and we're not
 
00:55:14.789 --> 00:55:14.799 align:start position:0%
prolonging it as a study committee where
 
00:55:17.589 --> 00:55:17.599 align:start position:0%
study committees would push it no no is
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee work session where we
 
00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:22.160 align:start position:0%
could get into the without having to
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
vote on anything we could get into the
 
00:55:26.630 --> 00:55:26.640 align:start position:0%
very detailed of that Amendment make
 
00:55:29.309 --> 00:55:29.319 align:start position:0%
some minor changes and then when that's
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
ready we bring it to the to the body so
 
00:55:33.789 --> 00:55:33.799 align:start position:0%
so we're really not holding up the
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
process it's it's more it's just to
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%

00:55:58.069 --> 00:55:58.079 align:start position:0%

and members of the committee thank you
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to speak before you
 
00:56:39.029 --> 00:56:39.039 align:start position:0%
my name is Rebecca leak I am a member of
 
00:56:41.150 --> 00:56:41.160 align:start position:0%
the legislative youth advisory Council
 
00:56:43.870 --> 00:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
also know known as lak and I speaking
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
today to urge you to pass HB 1080 with
 
00:56:49.109 --> 00:56:49.119 align:start position:0%
the Amendments proposed by the
 
00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
council I live in Andover and I'm a
 
00:56:53.549 --> 00:56:53.559 align:start position:0%
full-time college student pursuing the
 
00:56:55.630 --> 00:56:55.640 align:start position:0%
paralal major with Liberty University
 
00:56:58.230 --> 00:56:58.240 align:start position:0%
online I became a member of lak this
 
00:57:00.069 --> 00:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
past November after hearing about it
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
from a friend I believe that lak is a
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
wonderful opportunity for young people
 
00:57:07.029 --> 00:57:07.039 align:start position:0%
it gives us an opportunity to voice our
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
beliefs and advise the legislature on
 
00:57:10.910 --> 00:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
how we believe the legislation being
 
00:57:13.069 --> 00:57:13.079 align:start position:0%
considered would affect the youth in the
 
00:57:15.789 --> 00:57:15.799 align:start position:0%
state it further gives us an opportunity
 
00:57:17.390 --> 00:57:17.400 align:start position:0%
to learn more about the passing of
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
legislation and about the current issues
 
00:57:21.910 --> 00:57:21.920 align:start position:0%
in our state it exposes us to the Views
 
00:57:23.829 --> 00:57:23.839 align:start position:0%
and opinions of other young people who
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
we would otherwise would have never met
 
00:57:27.870 --> 00:57:27.880 align:start position:0%
and gives us a forum to explore and
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
debate relevant issues it also gives us
 
00:57:32.589 --> 00:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to meet representatives
 
00:57:35.029 --> 00:57:35.039 align:start position:0%
and senators and learn from their
 
00:57:37.510 --> 00:57:37.520 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience it has given me
 
00:57:39.309 --> 00:57:39.319 align:start position:0%
in particular a reason to be so much
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
more informed on the legislation being
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
considered by the legislature I've
 
00:57:44.670 --> 00:57:44.680 align:start position:0%
already learned so much from the
 
00:57:47.270 --> 00:57:47.280 align:start position:0%
legislatures I've met my fellow lak
 
00:57:49.270 --> 00:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
members and from the research I've done
 
00:57:50.630 --> 00:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
as part of
 
00:57:53.349 --> 00:57:53.359 align:start position:0%
lak as one of five post-secondary youth
 
00:57:54.789 --> 00:57:54.799 align:start position:0%
currently on the council I believe
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
believe that both we and the council
 
00:57:58.829 --> 00:57:58.839 align:start position:0%
benefit from our membership all the
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
advantages and opportunities of being a
 
00:58:03.390 --> 00:58:03.400 align:start position:0%
member of lak that I listed before apply
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
to the older members just as much as to
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
the younger members furthermore we bring
 
00:58:09.470 --> 00:58:09.480 align:start position:0%
different knowledge and experience to
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
the council for example I have
 
00:58:13.309 --> 00:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
personally drawn on the paralal and
 
00:58:15.029 --> 00:58:15.039 align:start position:0%
government classes that I've taken in
 
00:58:17.430 --> 00:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
college in analyzing And discussing
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
various issues and bills lastly in
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
recommending hb180 to the council lak
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
recommends a few amendments to the
 
00:58:26.829 --> 00:58:26.839 align:start position:0%
current text one of which directly
 
00:58:29.230 --> 00:58:29.240 align:start position:0%
affects me the current law and Bill
 
00:58:30.870 --> 00:58:30.880 align:start position:0%
requires that postsecondary members
 
00:58:32.750 --> 00:58:32.760 align:start position:0%
attend a New Hampshire postsecondary
 
00:58:34.710 --> 00:58:34.720 align:start position:0%
school or other New Hampshire training
 
00:58:37.150 --> 00:58:37.160 align:start position:0%
or education program or be a member of
 
00:58:39.069 --> 00:58:39.079 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Workforce as a
 
00:58:40.910 --> 00:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
full-time college student who is taking
 
00:58:43.470 --> 00:58:43.480 align:start position:0%
online classes with Liberty University I
 
00:58:45.270 --> 00:58:45.280 align:start position:0%
technically do not meet those
 
00:58:47.510 --> 00:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
requirements we therefore recommend that
 
00:58:49.470 --> 00:58:49.480 align:start position:0%
requirements for postsecondary members
 
00:58:51.349 --> 00:58:51.359 align:start position:0%
be expanded to include those who are
 
00:58:53.430 --> 00:58:53.440 align:start position:0%
permanent residents of New Hampshire but
 
00:58:55.150 --> 00:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
who take online classes from an out
 
00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:57.680 align:start position:0%
ofate postsecondary school thank you
 
00:58:59.270 --> 00:58:59.280 align:start position:0%

00:59:06.390 --> 00:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
giggling and not giggling not smiling
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%

00:59:14.029 --> 00:59:14.039 align:start position:0%

00:59:17.109 --> 00:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
questions for uh rep
 
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
hubson thank you for taking my question
 
00:59:21.630 --> 00:59:21.640 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to know if you have a copy
 
00:59:24.270 --> 00:59:24.280 align:start position:0%
of your testimony I'd love to have that
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:32.109 --> 00:59:32.119 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair so you basically
 
00:59:34.710 --> 00:59:34.720 align:start position:0%
you're saying you're being left out
 
00:59:37.390 --> 00:59:37.400 align:start position:0%
because you're taking online courses I
 
00:59:39.670 --> 00:59:39.680 align:start position:0%
am currently a fully functioning member
 
00:59:42.990 --> 00:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
of lak but according to current standard
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
that is technically in violation of the
 
00:59:47.190 --> 00:59:47.200 align:start position:0%
current statute and the bill being
 
00:59:49.789 --> 00:59:49.799 align:start position:0%
proposed in front of you so I would
 
00:59:51.750 --> 00:59:51.760 align:start position:0%
recommend that being
 
00:59:54.150 --> 00:59:54.160 align:start position:0%
changed I think when we drafted this
 
00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.549 align:start position:0%
changed I think when we drafted this
original

00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
original
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't possible to take online
 
01:00:00.750 --> 01:00:00.760 align:start position:0%
courses to do it so it just needs to be
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
updated I think more than anything um
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else thank you very much for your
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it we would like
 
01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:11.150 align:start position:0%
testimony appreciate it we would like
that

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
copy um we have one more pink card uh
 
01:00:16.510 --> 01:00:16.520 align:start position:0%
for Owen
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
O'Brien also ask for two minutes to
 
01:00:23.549 --> 01:00:23.559 align:start position:0%
speak um also representing liak
 
01:00:25.630 --> 01:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for your time my name
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
is on O'Brien I'm from summersworth high
 
01:00:29.309 --> 01:00:29.319 align:start position:0%
school um and I'm attending dmouth
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
coming this fall um I want to just take
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
a brief moment to explain I think
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
something of lak that isn't mentioned as
 
01:00:37.910 --> 01:00:37.920 align:start position:0%
much um and that's like the local impact
 
01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
of lak so after I was appointed I took
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
it as my goal to kind of reach out to
 
01:00:45.109 --> 01:00:45.119 align:start position:0%
everybody in my city and surrounding
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
maybe friends in do Rochester Portsmith
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
so be it um of what they think of the
 
01:00:53.190 --> 01:00:53.200 align:start position:0%
things that we're discussing in lak
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's been something that's super
 
01:00:56.390 --> 01:00:56.400 align:start position:0%
important to me and it's also bringing a
 
01:00:58.910 --> 01:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
greater representation to lak so even
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
though it's not mentioned in the bill
 
01:01:01.829 --> 01:01:01.839 align:start position:0%
text I think that's what a lot of us are
 
01:01:04.589 --> 01:01:04.599 align:start position:0%
doing and it's not mentioned but it's
 
01:01:06.390 --> 01:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
super important and I just want to bring
 
01:01:08.589 --> 01:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
that to your guys attention that we are
 
01:01:10.549 --> 01:01:10.559 align:start position:0%
being diverse we're including a lot of
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
people and these discussions are not
 
01:01:15.069 --> 01:01:15.079 align:start position:0%
staying in the rooms of the L they're
 
01:01:16.829 --> 01:01:16.839 align:start position:0%
reaching far out and it's been really
 
01:01:19.990 --> 01:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
beneficial for the uh representation and
 
01:01:21.789 --> 01:01:21.799 align:start position:0%
for the impacts that it's brought in the
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
voices into lak so that's all I have to
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
say thank you
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
guys are you willing to take a question
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
or two yes sir so I have one um how is
 
01:01:36.870 --> 01:01:36.880 align:start position:0%
it that uh the the legislation that lak
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
considers uh how is that chosen so we
 
01:01:42.109 --> 01:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
have subcommittees um and what we do is
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
we find whatever requests that we find
 
01:01:47.710 --> 01:01:47.720 align:start position:0%
uh interesting and relative to youth
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
that's what we put in our subcommittees
 
01:01:50.750 --> 01:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
and then we discuss these subcommittees
 
01:01:53.670 --> 01:01:53.680 align:start position:0%
once to twice a month um over Zoom
 
01:01:55.230 --> 01:01:55.240 align:start position:0%
FaceTime Etc
 
01:01:57.190 --> 01:01:57.200 align:start position:0%
um which we write up statements and that
 
01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so that's how we discuss
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
things and choose what bills we want to
 
01:02:05.670 --> 01:02:05.680 align:start position:0%
uh speak on and you feel that that um
 
01:02:08.069 --> 01:02:08.079 align:start position:0%
you're getting a broad range of of
 
01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
issues from that um review of the of the
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
existing list of bills yeah um I think
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
that it's really important because
 
01:02:19.710 --> 01:02:19.720 align:start position:0%
specifically when we have a lot of
 
01:02:21.710 --> 01:02:21.720 align:start position:0%
people uh in the subcommittee so
 
01:02:23.630 --> 01:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
normally ranges from six to eight um
 
01:02:25.349 --> 01:02:25.359 align:start position:0%
some are a little smaller just depending
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
on interest but what I'm doing and what
 
01:02:29.710 --> 01:02:29.720 align:start position:0%
some other officers are doing is we're
 
01:02:31.309 --> 01:02:31.319 align:start position:0%
reaching out about these bills to other
 
01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:34.160 align:start position:0%
people in the communities so we can hear
 
01:02:36.589 --> 01:02:36.599 align:start position:0%
and talk about bills that maybe
 
01:02:38.269 --> 01:02:38.279 align:start position:0%
ourselves aren't interested in but if
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
other people in our communities are
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
interested in them those are what should
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
be brought to attention that's what
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
we're doing we're representing the youth
 
01:02:47.230 --> 01:02:47.240 align:start position:0%

Administration thanks for having me back

friends friends that are also colleagues
 
01:08:55.149 --> 01:08:55.159 align:start position:0%
um I have a question question first so I
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
see the non- derain amendment how does
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
does with that I haven't seen the text
 
01:09:05.269 --> 01:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
of it yet does that Wipe Out the
 
01:09:10.070 --> 01:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
contents of this and replace it with uh
 
01:09:12.630 --> 01:09:12.640 align:start position:0%
it does it says amend the title of
 
01:09:14.269 --> 01:09:14.279 align:start position:0%
resolution by replacing it with the
 
01:09:15.870 --> 01:09:15.880 align:start position:0%
following but that hearing will be at
 
01:09:19.189 --> 01:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
one o'clock gotcha I just want to make
 
01:09:21.669 --> 01:09:21.679 align:start position:0%
sure I understood the uh order of
 
01:09:25.470 --> 01:09:25.480 align:start position:0%
operations here well well this is a
 
01:09:28.269 --> 01:09:28.279 align:start position:0%
declaration of an economic Justice Bill
 
01:09:32.870 --> 01:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
of Rights it is based on um essentially
 
01:09:35.990 --> 01:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
the notion of common good that um
 
01:09:37.749 --> 01:09:37.759 align:start position:0%
supports our existing system of
 
01:09:41.829 --> 01:09:41.839 align:start position:0%
government of capitalism of uh you know
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
a robust democracy all of those things
 
01:09:48.269 --> 01:09:48.279 align:start position:0%
um but as income inequality has become a
 
01:09:51.630 --> 01:09:51.640 align:start position:0%
bigger issue and it has been harder for
 
01:09:55.070 --> 01:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
even the middle class to survive dve as
 
01:09:59.950 --> 01:09:59.960 align:start position:0%
labor rights have been eroded as pay is
 
01:10:02.709 --> 01:10:02.719 align:start position:0%
very uh disperate even among our New
 
01:10:05.149 --> 01:10:05.159 align:start position:0%
England neb neighbors where the minimum
 
01:10:08.110 --> 01:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
wage is more than double in some places
 
01:10:10.310 --> 01:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
what we have here when we default to the
 
01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:13.520 align:start position:0%
federal where access to Affordable and
 
01:10:18.030 --> 01:10:18.040 align:start position:0%
safe housing is a struggle uh where
 
01:10:20.310 --> 01:10:20.320 align:start position:0%
we despite the fact that we have
 
01:10:22.229 --> 01:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
enormously wonderful
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
resources uh of the mountains of the
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
ocean of so many lovely um places of
 
01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:32.400 align:start position:0%
Beauty in this state it's a struggle to
 
01:10:36.030 --> 01:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
in some places get unpolluted water uh
 
01:10:40.030 --> 01:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
for drinking you know that by and large
 
01:10:41.950 --> 01:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
what underg guards this is just the
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
common notion of really what the
 
01:10:48.270 --> 01:10:48.280 align:start position:0%
founding fathers Look to You know and um
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights and the Declaration
 
01:10:52.430 --> 01:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
of Independence all those things but as
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
our economy has become more more
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
complicated as the number of people in
 
01:10:59.470 --> 01:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
in the wealthiest country on Earth in
 
01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
one of the wealthiest States in that
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
country have become more and more
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
complicated um it has become clear that
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
we need to establish a baseline um not
 
01:11:16.830 --> 01:11:16.840 align:start position:0%
just the floor but a thriving uh Bill of
 
01:11:20.149 --> 01:11:20.159 align:start position:0%
Rights that would be uh enable so many
 
01:11:23.990 --> 01:11:24.000 align:start position:0%
more people to maybe open a business not
 
01:11:26.110 --> 01:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
worry so much about the basics so that
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
they can take care of the their children
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
in a reasonable way um I'd also like to
 
01:11:35.590 --> 01:11:35.600 align:start position:0%
say at least for me it's inspired by uh
 
01:11:37.149 --> 01:11:37.159 align:start position:0%
I know we don't typically talk about
 
01:11:38.830 --> 01:11:38.840 align:start position:0%
religion and I am a strong supporter of
 
01:11:41.790 --> 01:11:41.800 align:start position:0%
a separation of uh church and state but
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
for me personally um this represents the
 
01:11:49.149 --> 01:11:49.159 align:start position:0%
things I believe as a Christian that um
 
01:11:51.110 --> 01:11:51.120 align:start position:0%
those Among Us who are suffering who
 
01:11:52.870 --> 01:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
can't care for themselves that it is
 
01:11:55.750 --> 01:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
accumed upon the community to step up
 
01:11:58.310 --> 01:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
and take care of those who are suffering
 
01:12:01.790 --> 01:12:01.800 align:start position:0%
because they are sick uh
 
01:12:04.550 --> 01:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
disa uh young
 
01:12:06.590 --> 01:12:06.600 align:start position:0%
elderly um
 
01:12:08.990 --> 01:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
unemployed I hope I didn't miss any I
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably did miss miss a category there
 
01:12:13.270 --> 01:12:13.280 align:start position:0%
but by and large those would be the
 
01:12:16.070 --> 01:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
folks that need you know a little extra
 
01:12:17.910 --> 01:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
support from the community so that they
 
01:12:21.189 --> 01:12:21.199 align:start position:0%
can live their fullest life um really
 
01:12:23.790 --> 01:12:23.800 align:start position:0%
all of these philosophies underg any of
 
01:12:26.189 --> 01:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
the discussions we have here but I would
 
01:12:28.590 --> 01:12:28.600 align:start position:0%
like to think and I hope that they're
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
worded in a way that this isn't partisan
 
01:12:32.990 --> 01:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
that this is something we can all stand
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
for that the common good is a basic
 
01:12:38.790 --> 01:12:38.800 align:start position:0%
philosophy of of humanity you know
 
01:12:40.990 --> 01:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
whether you have a religion or not you
 
01:12:44.070 --> 01:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
know whe certainly that you don't need
 
01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:46.239 align:start position:0%
to have one to have these values that
 
01:12:48.149 --> 01:12:48.159 align:start position:0%
this is the way it's worded something
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
that we could all stand behind you know
 
01:12:54.270 --> 01:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
you personally may not understand for
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
example gender oppression but because we
 
01:13:01.709 --> 01:13:01.719 align:start position:0%
live in a free um country and in a state
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
that is so into Freedom that we have it
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
in our motto Live Free or Die that
 
01:13:09.149 --> 01:13:09.159 align:start position:0%
living and Let Live in a
 
01:13:13.110 --> 01:13:13.120 align:start position:0%
way uh that lifts up all of our citizens
 
01:13:15.510 --> 01:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
is the best way for us
 
01:13:18.310 --> 01:13:18.320 align:start position:0%
to um be good neighbors you know the
 
01:13:20.830 --> 01:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
even if it's the uh good fences make
 
01:13:22.629 --> 01:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
good neighbors sort of philosophy that
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
this is very new Hampshire of us so um
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
that's what the intent of this is uh
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
ideally I think this should be in our
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
constitution but that's not what this is
 
01:13:37.470 --> 01:13:37.480 align:start position:0%
this isn't a constitutional uh um you
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
know what is it C cacr it's not a
 
01:13:45.510 --> 01:13:45.520 align:start position:0%
cacr um so to put forth that we as a
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
House of Representatives do in a
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
bipartisan fashion look at these topics
 
01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:54.760 align:start position:0%
and believe that at a common good
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
philosophy that we can look at as a
 
01:14:00.550 --> 01:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
common ground that we can look at it as
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
a way to get Beyond partisan bickering
 
01:14:06.149 --> 01:14:06.159 align:start position:0%
in no way shape or form do I see this as
 
01:14:08.110 --> 01:14:08.120 align:start position:0%
something that is trying to
 
01:14:11.950 --> 01:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
assert uh my political party in any way
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
but to foster a healthy Dialogue on what
 
01:14:18.830 --> 01:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable economy here what is a
 
01:14:22.110 --> 01:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
reasonable way to address low wages what
 
01:14:23.790 --> 01:14:23.800 align:start position:0%
is a reasonable way
 
01:14:27.750 --> 01:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
to fix a lot a number of issues is it
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
right that is it just is it free to know
 
01:14:33.870 --> 01:14:33.880 align:start position:0%
that people are so crippled by for
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
example um medical debt that they can't
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
open a business that their decisions on
 
01:14:44.790 --> 01:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
where they work um are really tied to
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
where can I get the best benefits not
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
where are my talents most needed um that
 
01:14:53.430 --> 01:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
really also I would say the flip side of
 
01:14:55.870 --> 01:14:55.880 align:start position:0%
this because I you know as a student of
 
01:14:58.270 --> 01:14:58.280 align:start position:0%
political science from a young age now
 
01:15:00.990 --> 01:15:01.000 align:start position:0%
I'm 53 that's a lot there's and I'm sure
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
it's true for some of you as long as
 
01:15:05.149 --> 01:15:05.159 align:start position:0%
you've lived that have drawn to these
 
01:15:09.430 --> 01:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
conversations I think this also isn't a
 
01:15:11.430 --> 01:15:11.440 align:start position:0%
I see what you have and I want more of
 
01:15:14.030 --> 01:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
that and I want yours that is not the
 
01:15:18.270 --> 01:15:18.280 align:start position:0%
that is not what underlies this um I I
 
01:15:21.070 --> 01:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
think those of us
 
01:15:24.550 --> 01:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
who want that kind kind of a society and
 
01:15:26.709 --> 01:15:26.719 align:start position:0%
I think we've gotten close to it at
 
01:15:29.870 --> 01:15:29.880 align:start position:0%
times in our history um is definitely
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
not a let's just take all of the wealth
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
from this group and distribute it that's
 
01:15:36.750 --> 01:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
a whole other system that I strongly
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
oppose um I was among the most uh
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic when Le vessa was here um
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
and he was a key part in ending
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
communism in in Eastern Europe so really
 
01:15:55.229 --> 01:15:55.239 align:start position:0%
what is about is those of us and I think
 
01:15:59.189 --> 01:15:59.199 align:start position:0%
it's a majority The Lion Share of us who
 
01:16:02.149 --> 01:16:02.159 align:start position:0%
sure it'd be nice to be wealthy I maybe
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
will buy a Powerball ticket would be
 
01:16:07.229 --> 01:16:07.239 align:start position:0%
nice if a relative you know would share
 
01:16:08.990 --> 01:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
some wealth if they have it but that is
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
not my goal at all it was that I just
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
want to work hard if I'm able care for
 
01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:19.719 align:start position:0%
my family in a way that's reasonable and
 
01:16:22.910 --> 01:16:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know not in a way that is greedy in
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
a way that is fair in a way that is just
 
01:16:31.629 --> 01:16:31.639 align:start position:0%
um and then if I'm unable because I'm
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
Ill or I have a disability that
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
prohibits my ability to work if I happen
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
to be unemployed through no fault of my
 
01:16:44.030 --> 01:16:44.040 align:start position:0%
own uh if I'm a very young person or if
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm elderly and unable to work or
 
01:16:49.430 --> 01:16:49.440 align:start position:0%
certainly paid my dues so to speak in
 
01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
society uh that we as a community
 
01:16:54.950 --> 01:16:54.960 align:start position:0%
Community do what we can to be
 
01:16:57.189 --> 01:16:57.199 align:start position:0%
supportive of those in need so this in
 
01:16:59.910 --> 01:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
no way shape or form is anything other
 
01:17:02.189 --> 01:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
than looking at the American dream
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
looking at what would really create a
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
free and just New Hampshire and um
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
Foster those conversations on policies
 
01:17:14.910 --> 01:17:14.920 align:start position:0%
that can get there and I think that
 
01:17:16.750 --> 01:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
there are plenty of areas for common
 
01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:20.280 align:start position:0%
ground I do believe and I in my
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
conversations with people of any or no
 
01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:23.990 align:start position:0%
conversations with people of any or no
party

01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
party
 
01:17:26.229 --> 01:17:26.239 align:start position:0%
uh that this is the sort of philosophy
 
01:17:28.390 --> 01:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
that the average Granite stator would
 
01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:34.280 align:start position:0%
very much robustly Embrace so uh not
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
everybody likes to have these
 
01:17:37.470 --> 01:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
conversations in the sense that you know
 
01:17:39.270 --> 01:17:39.280 align:start position:0%
this could be a series of
 
01:17:41.669 --> 01:17:41.679 align:start position:0%
conversations uh getting to the details
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
of policy is probably something you
 
01:17:45.750 --> 01:17:45.760 align:start position:0%
would enjoy more as do I in many ways
 
01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
but I think having this kind of
 
01:17:50.470 --> 01:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
conversation is just healthy for the
 
01:17:54.510 --> 01:17:54.520 align:start position:0%
whole um for the whole whole house of uh
 
01:17:55.870 --> 01:17:55.880 align:start position:0%
for the whole General Court of New
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and um
 
01:18:01.870 --> 01:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
I've I guess raised an all of Branch or
 
01:18:03.350 --> 01:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
however you want to look at it multiple
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
times and now I'm eager to schedule
 
01:18:08.590 --> 01:18:08.600 align:start position:0%
rooms to say all right let's whoever
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
wants to talk about X Y or Z let's find
 
01:18:15.189 --> 01:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
a way to just have those conversations
 
01:18:17.990 --> 01:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
is what I'm hoping when this
 
01:18:21.510 --> 01:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
passes um I would be willing to uh take
 
01:18:24.030 --> 01:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
the lead in with others hopefully with a
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
republican as a co-chair of an economic
 
01:18:30.790 --> 01:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
Justice caucus that can host robust
 
01:18:33.990 --> 01:18:34.000 align:start position:0%
conversations bring in uh policy experts
 
01:18:37.470 --> 01:18:37.480 align:start position:0%
on these topics of uh multiple
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
philosophies of use of government I
 
01:18:43.709 --> 01:18:43.719 align:start position:0%
think that in doing so to finding that
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
Common Ground I think again like I said
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
um who benefits most is not me you know
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
I have these conversations all the time
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
I could do this on my own own I you know
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
I don't need the house quote unquote for
 
01:18:58.990 --> 01:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
me I really am being selfless in the
 
01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:00.560 align:start position:0%
sense that this is the kind kind of
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
conversation the granite state needs
 
01:19:06.270 --> 01:19:06.280 align:start position:0%
this is what the people of New Hampshire
 
01:19:09.709 --> 01:19:09.719 align:start position:0%
want this is what
 
01:19:13.189 --> 01:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
um when we Thrive the most this is the
 
01:19:17.709 --> 01:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
sort of uh philosophy or um framework
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
that would be best for the grand estate
 
01:19:24.030 --> 01:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
and that sort of conversation has been
 
01:19:25.950 --> 01:19:25.960 align:start position:0%
lacking on the whole it's been peace
 
01:19:29.510 --> 01:19:29.520 align:start position:0%
meal and I think having that kind of
 
01:19:31.750 --> 01:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
common ground and framework to to jump
 
01:19:34.350 --> 01:19:34.360 align:start position:0%
off from is a healthy
 
01:19:37.070 --> 01:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
thing and I could obviously speak for
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
many hours on each one of these I will
 
01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.590 align:start position:0%
many hours on each one of these I will
spare

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
spare
 
01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
you all set yeah okay um would you be
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions absolutely I I
 
01:19:50.350 --> 01:19:50.360 align:start position:0%
will do my best uh are there any
 
01:19:54.030 --> 01:19:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions for repal rep sellers
 
01:19:55.990 --> 01:19:56.000 align:start position:0%
I actually have a lot but I we'll start
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
with one let's start with one yeah um I
 
01:20:02.629 --> 01:20:02.639 align:start position:0%
I get the resolution I like the idea
 
01:20:04.070 --> 01:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for writing it and nice
 
01:20:05.910 --> 01:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
meeting you again yes it's good to see
 
01:20:08.270 --> 01:20:08.280 align:start position:0%
your rep sellers
 
01:20:10.669 --> 01:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
um I can you
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
explain Equitable and
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
affordable what what do you what is that
 
01:20:18.750 --> 01:20:18.760 align:start position:0%
Vision to you because if this is a
 
01:20:20.709 --> 01:20:20.719 align:start position:0%
resolution it's going to the whole state
 
01:20:22.149 --> 01:20:22.159 align:start position:0%
sure I want to give the state an idea
 
01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
what this means
 
01:20:29.750 --> 01:20:29.760 align:start position:0%
sure ideally we have a society that you
 
01:20:32.430 --> 01:20:32.440 align:start position:0%
know looks quite a bit like it is now
 
01:20:37.149 --> 01:20:37.159 align:start position:0%
but uh wages are better we have uh a
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
minimum wage on par with all of our New
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
England neighbors we by defaul into to
 
01:20:44.189 --> 01:20:44.199 align:start position:0%
the federal minimum wage are the
 
01:20:47.950 --> 01:20:47.960 align:start position:0%
wealthiest state to do so and it is
 
01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
harder unlike say a state like
 
01:20:52.110 --> 01:20:52.120 align:start position:0%
Mississippi where the cost of living is
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
quite a bit more
 
01:20:58.750 --> 01:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
affordable um it is a problem and we are
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
losing people uh we are losing workers
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
even if they stay here and live uh they
 
01:21:07.070 --> 01:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
take jobs in other states because
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
they're going to make more so really a
 
01:21:12.990 --> 01:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
strong New Hampshire would be on par
 
01:21:15.990 --> 01:21:16.000 align:start position:0%
wage wise at the basic level our minimum
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
wage should be at least as good as the
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
lowest minimum wage in the states around
 
01:21:23.990 --> 01:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
us which I think and so we have actually
 
01:21:26.790 --> 01:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
a few experts here I'm happy to see I
 
01:21:28.910 --> 01:21:28.920 align:start position:0%
think that would put us
 
01:21:32.550 --> 01:21:32.560 align:start position:0%
at close to 15 or on the path to1 15
 
01:21:34.870 --> 01:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
dollars an hour as a minimum wage um I
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
could continue on policy Point by policy
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
point but really at a basic level
 
01:21:42.550 --> 01:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
equality and affordability and
 
01:21:44.430 --> 01:21:44.440 align:start position:0%
accessibility really is just looking at
 
01:21:48.189 --> 01:21:48.199 align:start position:0%
the basics um but not just as a floor
 
01:21:51.149 --> 01:21:51.159 align:start position:0%
but as a what does it take to reasonably
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
raise a family what does it take to
 
01:21:57.750 --> 01:21:57.760 align:start position:0%
educate children what does it take to
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
care for an elderly person who has
 
01:22:03.629 --> 01:22:03.639 align:start position:0%
worked their whole lives until the point
 
01:22:05.110 --> 01:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
they need to go into a nursing home I
 
01:22:06.870 --> 01:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
mean I could keep going I mean these are
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
all people you and I know well and I
 
01:22:11.550 --> 01:22:11.560 align:start position:0%
will say just as a caveat because I love
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
these conversations I would love to grab
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
a cup of coffee with you and just go
 
01:22:18.030 --> 01:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
through all of your points and see where
 
01:22:19.629 --> 01:22:19.639 align:start position:0%
we can find Common Ground that's the
 
01:22:23.830 --> 01:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
sort of thing that I genuinely um um am
 
01:22:26.629 --> 01:22:26.639 align:start position:0%
going to strive for as I seek to start a
 
01:22:29.870 --> 01:22:29.880 align:start position:0%
economic Justice caucus again here but
 
01:22:33.189 --> 01:22:33.199 align:start position:0%
um with a new hopefully bipartisan way
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
of doing that um I know from our
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
previous conversations that we do agree
 
01:22:40.629 --> 01:22:40.639 align:start position:0%
on a few topics and that's okay I think
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
that's healthy I think having a
 
01:22:46.430 --> 01:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
diversity of ideas and uh multiple
 
01:22:49.070 --> 01:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
philosophies is healthy but where the
 
01:22:52.590 --> 01:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
rubber meets the road is what is a
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
reasonable life for someone that isn't
 
01:23:00.590 --> 01:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
um greedy I don't know for lack of a
 
01:23:03.390 --> 01:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
better word that really looks at what is
 
01:23:07.310 --> 01:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
a way for granite Staters to thrive in
 
01:23:10.070 --> 01:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
the fairest most
 
01:23:13.990 --> 01:23:14.000 align:start position:0%
just freest way that isn't extravagant
 
01:23:16.149 --> 01:23:16.159 align:start position:0%
necessary you know people can have
 
01:23:18.510 --> 01:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
extravagance you know they have it no
 
01:23:21.550 --> 01:23:21.560 align:start position:0%
judgment genuinely but does it make
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
sense to have a societ where we have
 
01:23:27.830 --> 01:23:27.840 align:start position:0%
such wealth in certain areas and again
 
01:23:30.750 --> 01:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not anti- wealth I you know I would
 
01:23:32.830 --> 01:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
like to have it someday it' be
 
01:23:36.629 --> 01:23:36.639 align:start position:0%
nice but does it make sense that a
 
01:23:40.270 --> 01:23:40.280 align:start position:0%
mother who is Raising her children and
 
01:23:42.629 --> 01:23:42.639 align:start position:0%
is a single mom through no fault of her
 
01:23:46.510 --> 01:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
own um has to spend most of her time
 
01:23:49.149 --> 01:23:49.159 align:start position:0%
working at two different jobs just to
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
keep a an apartment or a home to get the
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
basics of food and all and medical bills
 
01:23:58.910 --> 01:23:58.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever because in my district I
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
represent part of conquer a lot of
 
01:24:03.629 --> 01:24:03.639 align:start position:0%
apartment buildings a lot of senior
 
01:24:07.430 --> 01:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
housing um we also have public housing
 
01:24:12.550 --> 01:24:12.560 align:start position:0%
in my district um too many people are
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
not meeting their basic needs and I have
 
01:24:19.870 --> 01:24:19.880 align:start position:0%
a problem with that that we that we
 
01:24:21.629 --> 01:24:21.639 align:start position:0%
haven't figured out a way when we're
 
01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
pretty bril
 
01:24:28.229 --> 01:24:28.239 align:start position:0%
I think all of us together uh a way to
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that those who are working
 
01:24:32.550 --> 01:24:32.560 align:start position:0%
hard to be a part of our system and do
 
01:24:34.629 --> 01:24:34.639 align:start position:0%
all that we ask them to do when we
 
01:24:36.830 --> 01:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
emphasize things like personal
 
01:24:39.629 --> 01:24:39.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility but then they can't do
 
01:24:43.310 --> 01:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
the basics for their family you know
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
um I find
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
that and this isn't this is this isn't
 
01:24:51.430 --> 01:24:51.440 align:start position:0%
in this but this is my own I find that
 
01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
morally difficult
 
01:24:55.910 --> 01:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
I find that morally questionable and so
 
01:24:58.310 --> 01:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
to get to that I would never want it to
 
01:25:00.510 --> 01:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
be let's take all of that person's
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
wealth and distributed it would be H
 
01:25:05.830 --> 01:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
this person already is working maybe
 
01:25:08.430 --> 01:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
they should only have to work one job at
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
a decent Fair wage and we should respect
 
01:25:13.030 --> 01:25:13.040 align:start position:0%
that job we need to pump gas and we
 
01:25:15.310 --> 01:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
needed attendant at that gas station
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
where we get also maybe our cup of
 
01:25:19.430 --> 01:25:19.440 align:start position:0%
coffee maybe that person should have the
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
kind of dignity and respect that hard
 
01:25:24.750 --> 01:25:24.760 align:start position:0%
work work should give them and their
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
family so they can at least meet the
 
01:25:29.950 --> 01:25:29.960 align:start position:0%
basics um that is one answer that I
 
01:25:32.750 --> 01:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
would like to see but I would also in
 
01:25:34.629 --> 01:25:34.639 align:start position:0%
that conversation and with that cup of
 
01:25:36.990 --> 01:25:37.000 align:start position:0%
coffee um love to hear what you think
 
01:25:40.350 --> 01:25:40.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.149 --> 01:25:43.159 align:start position:0%
be any further
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
questions yeah re
 
01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
Hopson thank you m uh Mr chair and thank
 
01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um just these
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
are these are all great ideas I'm just
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
wondering how do you have you thought
 
01:25:59.669 --> 01:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
about how this would all be paid
 
01:26:03.350 --> 01:26:03.360 align:start position:0%
for how would that income or money be
 
01:26:06.790 --> 01:26:06.800 align:start position:0%
distributed to people in need well I
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
think that's the same thing to look at
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
the Bill of Rights or you know the
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness how do you pay for
 
01:26:16.590 --> 01:26:16.600 align:start position:0%
that as a philosophy and as a
 
01:26:19.270 --> 01:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
declaration of the common good there is
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
no need for a budget per se is incumbent
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
upon all of us to look at these
 
01:26:26.149 --> 01:26:26.159 align:start position:0%
questions and find the fairest way I
 
01:26:28.270 --> 01:26:28.280 align:start position:0%
don't think that government needs to be
 
01:26:30.669 --> 01:26:30.679 align:start position:0%
that involved is what I think you're
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
getting at I can't I mean we can have a
 
01:26:34.590 --> 01:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
back and forth over again a cup of
 
01:26:36.550 --> 01:26:36.560 align:start position:0%
coffee to get to what you mean by pay
 
01:26:40.790 --> 01:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
for it but really um not that much
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
different than how things are now but
 
01:26:48.350 --> 01:26:48.360 align:start position:0%
with better reasonable wages and with a
 
01:26:50.350 --> 01:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable accommodation for those who
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
can't care for themselves as a basic but
 
01:26:56.030 --> 01:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
there's no budget to this there's no
 
01:27:00.669 --> 01:27:00.679 align:start position:0%
expectation that uh we're paying for
 
01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
anything per
 
01:27:06.390 --> 01:27:06.400 align:start position:0%
se is um I have a couple of quick
 
01:27:09.590 --> 01:27:09.600 align:start position:0%
questions one is um why house resolution
 
01:27:12.270 --> 01:27:12.280 align:start position:0%
why not bring the Senate into it you
 
01:27:16.750 --> 01:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
know I'll do it differently next time um
 
01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:19.400 align:start position:0%
this is start of a very complicated
 
01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
albeit could be simple conversation
 
01:27:24.229 --> 01:27:24.239 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
uh we have a lot to talk about here in
 
01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
the house and that's good enough for now
 
01:27:32.910 --> 01:27:32.920 align:start position:0%
second part of that is
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
um if
 
01:27:38.709 --> 01:27:38.719 align:start position:0%
this were not to pass the house is there
 
01:27:42.750 --> 01:27:42.760 align:start position:0%
any reason why your idea or of the
 
01:27:45.910 --> 01:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
establishment of a caucus um wouldn't
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
still go
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
through of course the caucus can still
 
01:27:51.870 --> 01:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
go through but now we've had a little
 
01:27:54.109 --> 01:27:54.119 align:start position:0%
bit of of a conversation here I am
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
mindful this takes your time I don't
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
take that lightly as a fellow
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative um and I'm genuine in
 
01:28:04.310 --> 01:28:04.320 align:start position:0%
wanting this conversation but you're
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
right I could just start a caucus on my
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
own and just see who shows up but I
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
would like it to be more robust than
 
01:28:12.830 --> 01:28:12.840 align:start position:0%
that I'm I know what I think I'm kind of
 
01:28:16.070 --> 01:28:16.080 align:start position:0%
bored with what I think it needs to be a
 
01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:17.270 align:start position:0%
bored with what I think it needs to be a
shared

01:28:17.270 --> 01:28:17.280 align:start position:0%
shared
 
01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
conversation um with folks like you and
 
01:28:23.229 --> 01:28:23.239 align:start position:0%
me and all of us and each other and we
 
01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
don't often the way our house is
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
structured and the way we politely
 
01:28:30.550 --> 01:28:30.560 align:start position:0%
arrange how all these things work in the
 
01:28:32.790 --> 01:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
house there really isn't a lot of chance
 
01:28:36.750 --> 01:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
to before we actually vote for it have a
 
01:28:39.189 --> 01:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
conversation that is fair and reasonable
 
01:28:42.189 --> 01:28:42.199 align:start position:0%
that has to be outside of the of of the
 
01:28:44.870 --> 01:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
meeting rooms to some degree we don't
 
01:28:46.270 --> 01:28:46.280 align:start position:0%
have an opportunity to have these
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
conversations really usually we're ready
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
with our our policy points often from
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
our party's perspective and there really
 
01:28:59.070 --> 01:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
is a debate and a tactics on both sides
 
01:29:00.790 --> 01:29:00.800 align:start position:0%
but there's really not a conversation at
 
01:29:02.709 --> 01:29:02.719 align:start position:0%
any point you know we're polite to the
 
01:29:04.990 --> 01:29:05.000 align:start position:0%
people presenting we can't have a back
 
01:29:07.830 --> 01:29:07.840 align:start position:0%
and forth in this process so we do need
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
to have a caucus regardless but this at
 
01:29:11.990 --> 01:29:12.000 align:start position:0%
least starts the
 
01:29:14.189 --> 01:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
conversation fair enough I'm sorry for
 
01:29:16.030 --> 01:29:16.040 align:start position:0%
giving such long answers nope fair
 
01:29:20.430 --> 01:29:20.440 align:start position:0%
enough um any other questions I have one
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%

hr29 uh that guarantees the freedom to
 
01:30:53.590 --> 01:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
for my union uh access public education
 
01:30:56.149 --> 01:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
Child Care affordable housing quality
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
accessible healthare and all the things
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
that we all need to thrive in our state
 
01:31:02.950 --> 01:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
um this is not a new idea uh President
 
01:31:05.229 --> 01:31:05.239 align:start position:0%
Franklin Roosevelt gave this uh in his
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
State of Union speech in
 
01:31:09.109 --> 01:31:09.119 align:start position:0%
1944 um and they actually called it the
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
second Bill of Rights because um we
 
01:31:14.109 --> 01:31:14.119 align:start position:0%
really cannot achieve Freedom true
 
01:31:15.629 --> 01:31:15.639 align:start position:0%
Freedom unless people have Economic
 
01:31:17.709 --> 01:31:17.719 align:start position:0%
Security so this is what this is is
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
talking about in my view I believe this
 
01:31:23.310 --> 01:31:23.320 align:start position:0%
bill and we believe as well that this is
 
01:31:25.629 --> 01:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
making a statement about the values as
 
01:31:27.470 --> 01:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire as our state
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
what do we value really value people
 
01:31:32.629 --> 01:31:32.639 align:start position:0%
working and having a fair wage so they
 
01:31:34.510 --> 01:31:34.520 align:start position:0%
can afford basic needs do we value
 
01:31:37.270 --> 01:31:37.280 align:start position:0%
people living Brea breathing clean air
 
01:31:39.109 --> 01:31:39.119 align:start position:0%
and having clean water everywhere in the
 
01:31:41.709 --> 01:31:41.719 align:start position:0%
state do we value public education that
 
01:31:43.270 --> 01:31:43.280 align:start position:0%
really invests in our kids and our
 
01:31:45.669 --> 01:31:45.679 align:start position:0%
future this is really a statement of
 
01:31:48.709 --> 01:31:48.719 align:start position:0%
what we value as a state
 
01:31:51.750 --> 01:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know how many of you here
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to see the same basic
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
rights for people that you love your
 
01:31:57.669 --> 01:31:57.679 align:start position:0%
family your community your constituents
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
I I believe we all want the same things
 
01:32:00.590 --> 01:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
for the people that we love and we care
 
01:32:02.510 --> 01:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
about and not some not everyone in our
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
state has those basic rights right now
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
so this is basically saying we recognize
 
01:32:08.870 --> 01:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
that we are lacking in our state but
 
01:32:10.629 --> 01:32:10.639 align:start position:0%
let's take this first step and really
 
01:32:12.270 --> 01:32:12.280 align:start position:0%
recognize the things that we value and
 
01:32:13.629 --> 01:32:13.639 align:start position:0%
the people that we value and the people
 
01:32:15.870 --> 01:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
that we love by really passing this
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
resolution um and regardless of where
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
you come from regardless of your
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
geography your your gender your race
 
01:32:23.870 --> 01:32:23.880 align:start position:0%
everyone in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:32:25.790 --> 01:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
should have these as basic rights as
 
01:32:28.030 --> 01:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
basic human needs
 
01:32:30.629 --> 01:32:30.639 align:start position:0%
um and my other point that I wanted to
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
make here um was about the American
 
01:32:35.790 --> 01:32:35.800 align:start position:0%
dream you know we talk about the
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
American dream a lot how can you have an
 
01:32:40.030 --> 01:32:40.040 align:start position:0%
American dream when you don't have
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
affordable housing uh when you're
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
working three jobs when you have you dat
 
01:32:47.189 --> 01:32:47.199 align:start position:0%
in student Lawns when you have all these
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
other things that are really stopping
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
you from really life liberty and the
 
01:32:53.270 --> 01:32:53.280 align:start position:0%
pursuit of happiness you can do that and
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
in our state which is Live Free or Die
 
01:32:58.430 --> 01:32:58.440 align:start position:0%
really are we living or are we dying you
 
01:33:00.149 --> 01:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
know you cannot really live you not have
 
01:33:01.750 --> 01:33:01.760 align:start position:0%
affordable housing people are dying on
 
01:33:03.629 --> 01:33:03.639 align:start position:0%
the streets because of homelessness you
 
01:33:05.470 --> 01:33:05.480 align:start position:0%
cannot live if you don't have health
 
01:33:06.709 --> 01:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
care that's affordable and that's
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
accessible to you if you don't have
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
child care you're dying because you're
 
01:33:11.070 --> 01:33:11.080 align:start position:0%
probably not working you're staying at
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
home instead of contributing to the
 
01:33:13.709 --> 01:33:13.719 align:start position:0%
economy and you can't afford the cost of
 
01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:15.800 align:start position:0%
child care so really what what what are
 
01:33:17.390 --> 01:33:17.400 align:start position:0%
we trying to do as a state so I think
 
01:33:19.390 --> 01:33:19.400 align:start position:0%
this is really making that statement and
 
01:33:21.270 --> 01:33:21.280 align:start position:0%
we're already doing some things right
 
01:33:23.430 --> 01:33:23.440 align:start position:0%
but I I think just come out and publicly
 
01:33:25.990 --> 01:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
state that and say we value these things
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
we value our our residents we value the
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
people of newshire and we're just going
 
01:33:31.350 --> 01:33:31.360 align:start position:0%
to stand by this and that's the first
 
01:33:33.910 --> 01:33:33.920 align:start position:0%
step we have to recognize um this bill
 
01:33:35.550 --> 01:33:35.560 align:start position:0%
so I hope that you will support this
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
bill and vote all to pass and I'm happy
 
01:33:41.350 --> 01:33:41.360 align:start position:0%
to take any questions um if there any
 
01:33:44.990 --> 01:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you okay are there any
 
01:33:49.270 --> 01:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
questions I have one um this you refer
 
01:33:51.229 --> 01:33:51.239 align:start position:0%
to this as a bill and it is it is a
 
01:33:54.189 --> 01:33:54.199 align:start position:0%
resol olution rather than a bill um
 
01:33:56.070 --> 01:33:56.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for that correction no that's
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
I just um needed to say it um is there
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
um is anything going to change um with
 
01:34:10.590 --> 01:34:10.600 align:start position:0%
your organization or your life if this
 
01:34:12.709 --> 01:34:12.719 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
adopted I feel like the spoken words say
 
01:34:17.590 --> 01:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
a lot I feel this is a start of a
 
01:34:21.109 --> 01:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
conversation if this is passed and we
 
01:34:23.510 --> 01:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
can now start talking about okay we
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
value affordable housing or we value
 
01:34:29.310 --> 01:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
child care we think every New Hampshire
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
resident should have a right to that how
 
01:34:33.390 --> 01:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
do we make that possible maybe we'll
 
01:34:35.669 --> 01:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
have more we'll be more intentional in
 
01:34:37.510 --> 01:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
these programs and things that we are
 
01:34:39.430 --> 01:34:39.440 align:start position:0%
lacking but I think making that public
 
01:34:41.590 --> 01:34:41.600 align:start position:0%
statement makes me feel makes me feel
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
hopeful that the legislature is
 
01:34:45.590 --> 01:34:45.600 align:start position:0%
listening that they they know what's
 
01:34:46.830 --> 01:34:46.840 align:start position:0%
happening in the community and
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
something's going to be done about it
 
01:34:52.350 --> 01:34:52.360 align:start position:0%
so give me hope thank you
 
01:34:55.629 --> 01:34:55.639 align:start position:0%
um rep Sheen you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:34:58.629 --> 01:34:58.639 align:start position:0%
taking my question um you've brought up
 
01:35:00.750 --> 01:35:00.760 align:start position:0%
a couple times in your testimony about
 
01:35:04.030 --> 01:35:04.040 align:start position:0%
affordable housing affordable child care
 
01:35:05.669 --> 01:35:05.679 align:start position:0%
and you want to get the conversation
 
01:35:07.709 --> 01:35:07.719 align:start position:0%
started well the speaker of the house
 
01:35:12.030 --> 01:35:12.040 align:start position:0%
set up two special committees um This
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
this term to
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
study um child care and affordable
 
01:35:20.390 --> 01:35:20.400 align:start position:0%
housing these conversations are going on
 
01:35:23.870 --> 01:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
already and um you also mentioned that
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
it's a right for people to have
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
affordable housing it's a right for
 
01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
people to have a good wage it's a right
 
01:35:34.629 --> 01:35:34.639 align:start position:0%
but all of these things cost money like
 
01:35:38.310 --> 01:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
representative Hopson said and so um
 
01:35:40.470 --> 01:35:40.480 align:start position:0%
someone's going to be paying for this
 
01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
and so I just want to know what your
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
thoughts are who is going to be paying
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
for it is it going to be the state is it
 
01:35:46.750 --> 01:35:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
01:35:46.760 --> 01:35:49.070 align:start position:0%
going to be
taxpayers

01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
taxpayers
 
01:35:51.709 --> 01:35:51.719 align:start position:0%
um do you can you answer that thank you
 
01:35:54.669 --> 01:35:54.679 align:start position:0%
yeah no um so let me first start with
 
01:35:57.189 --> 01:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
the last piece that you talked about uh
 
01:35:58.510 --> 01:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
the conversations yes are already
 
01:36:00.790 --> 01:36:00.800 align:start position:0%
happening about child care and and
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and so many other
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
issues water quality that's we're
 
01:36:04.669 --> 01:36:04.679 align:start position:0%
already seeing that in different
 
01:36:06.790 --> 01:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
communities though there's no committee
 
01:36:09.669 --> 01:36:09.679 align:start position:0%
that I know of uh so I I I believe
 
01:36:11.950 --> 01:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
having these conversations and having
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
this resolution passed it's taking us
 
01:36:17.830 --> 01:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
farther to really get everyone in New
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire really engaged in the
 
01:36:20.590 --> 01:36:20.600 align:start position:0%
discussion because I don't know how many
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
people know about those committees I do
 
01:36:23.709 --> 01:36:23.719 align:start position:0%
know cuz I care I work about I work
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
around housing issues so I know about
 
01:36:27.390 --> 01:36:27.400 align:start position:0%
that committee I know about the child
 
01:36:30.229 --> 01:36:30.239 align:start position:0%
care committee cuz I have a child myself
 
01:36:32.910 --> 01:36:32.920 align:start position:0%
um and so I know that person but making
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
this statement it's it's more than just
 
01:36:37.790 --> 01:36:37.800 align:start position:0%
people that know about it and so it's
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
it's it's more people that will get
 
01:36:40.709 --> 01:36:40.719 align:start position:0%
engaged in the process but also people
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
that start thinking what can we do
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
creatively to make sure that we resolve
 
01:36:45.430 --> 01:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
these issues people that may not be
 
01:36:47.270 --> 01:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
engaged right now and to your point
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
about paying um I believe right now we
 
01:36:55.149 --> 01:36:55.159 align:start position:0%
have we most employers right can't find
 
01:36:56.750 --> 01:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
can't find people to work because they
 
01:36:58.790 --> 01:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
don't have child care the there already
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
things that are happening so that people
 
01:37:02.629 --> 01:37:02.639 align:start position:0%
are being creative about how those
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
issues can be resolved whether it's
 
01:37:07.229 --> 01:37:07.239 align:start position:0%
using a home care based system to take
 
01:37:09.629 --> 01:37:09.639 align:start position:0%
care of the kids whether it's employers
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
are trying to find ways they can
 
01:37:12.910 --> 01:37:12.920 align:start position:0%
accommodate schedules forward so things
 
01:37:14.709 --> 01:37:14.719 align:start position:0%
are already taking place they're they're
 
01:37:16.270 --> 01:37:16.280 align:start position:0%
finding creative ways to resolve that
 
01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:17.600 align:start position:0%
issues so it doesn't mean that it's
 
01:37:20.270 --> 01:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
coming from our tax dollars to pay for
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
those programs it's just making a
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
statement we recognize this should
 
01:37:27.430 --> 01:37:27.440 align:start position:0%
be a value or something that we value as
 
01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:29.320 align:start position:0%
a state let's find ways how we can
 
01:37:31.709 --> 01:37:31.719 align:start position:0%
resolve this as a community as a state
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
as I I think that I don't see this being
 
01:37:37.629 --> 01:37:37.639 align:start position:0%
a a a program that's going to put a
 
01:37:40.750 --> 01:37:40.760 align:start position:0%
burden on the taxpayer to be paid
 
01:37:40.760 --> 01:37:42.350 align:start position:0%
burden on the taxpayer to be paid
for

01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:37:46.070 --> 01:37:46.080 align:start position:0%
followup oh we're good uh repellers
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
chair would you um would you probably
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
I'm asking you would you agree that a
 
01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
lot of
 
01:37:57.149 --> 01:37:57.159 align:start position:0%
these items in the
 
01:38:00.589 --> 01:38:00.599 align:start position:0%
resolution would probably be resolved
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
with a better education especially in
 
01:38:06.070 --> 01:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire because we're not very
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
good at educating our kids where 40 50%
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
of them are
 
01:38:12.589 --> 01:38:12.599 align:start position:0%
failing I'm just thinking education
 
01:38:14.229 --> 01:38:14.239 align:start position:0%
because that leads to better wages that
 
01:38:16.149 --> 01:38:16.159 align:start position:0%
leads to better you know affordable
 
01:38:18.669 --> 01:38:18.679 align:start position:0%
housing Etc so I'm just wondering what
 
01:38:21.229 --> 01:38:21.239 align:start position:0%
your thought is on that so thank you yes
 
01:38:23.750 --> 01:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
we definitely need to do more investing
 
01:38:25.629 --> 01:38:25.639 align:start position:0%
in education in public education making
 
01:38:26.990 --> 01:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
sure education is Affordable it's
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
accessible it's quality CU not all
 
01:38:30.750 --> 01:38:30.760 align:start position:0%
schools are performing well because they
 
01:38:32.990 --> 01:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
don't have enough resources uh so
 
01:38:34.550 --> 01:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
definitely I agree with that but there
 
01:38:36.109 --> 01:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
are some issues like affordable housing
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's because of Education
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
it's because we have a shortage and
 
01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:41.599 align:start position:0%
we're not building as many houses as we
 
01:38:43.470 --> 01:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
need to do and then the houses are being
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
built are too expensive for people to
 
01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:48.679 align:start position:0%
afford yes people can get paid uh but we
 
01:38:50.390 --> 01:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
need housing that's going to Target
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
everyone there are people that are
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
disabled for instance that can't work
 
01:38:55.589 --> 01:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
they need housing that they can't afford
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
to live in we have uh seniors that are
 
01:39:00.229 --> 01:39:00.239 align:start position:0%
living on Social Security we need
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
housing that they can live in so not
 
01:39:03.870 --> 01:39:03.880 align:start position:0%
everyone is going to be making six
 
01:39:05.270 --> 01:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
figure salary we're going to have
 
01:39:06.510 --> 01:39:06.520 align:start position:0%
someone who's going to serve us coffee
 
01:39:08.229 --> 01:39:08.239 align:start position:0%
maybe they're making 50,000 as a
 
01:39:10.790 --> 01:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
full-time job and they can afford a
 
01:39:13.510 --> 01:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
house for 500,000 so we need to care for
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
everyone in our community the the least
 
01:39:17.310 --> 01:39:17.320 align:start position:0%
vulnerable people and people that are
 
01:39:19.990 --> 01:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
doing well I don't think we should get
 
01:39:23.310 --> 01:39:23.320 align:start position:0%
how the system is um is supporting
 
01:39:27.510 --> 01:39:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%

human beings in New Hampshire this
 
01:43:27.270 --> 01:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
right's shared by about half our workers
 
01:43:29.470 --> 01:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
we know from the MIT living wage
 
01:43:31.470 --> 01:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
calculator that the living wage for a
 
01:43:35.950 --> 01:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
single person in New Hampshire is almost
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
$336,000 for one working adult with one
 
01:43:41.669 --> 01:43:41.679 align:start position:0%
child renting a two-bedroom apartment is
 
01:43:41.679 --> 01:43:43.270 align:start position:0%
child renting a two-bedroom apartment is
almost

01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
almost
 
01:43:46.270 --> 01:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
$75,000 and for two working adults with
 
01:43:48.430 --> 01:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
one child renting a two-bedroom
 
01:43:51.790 --> 01:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
apartment is almost $83,000
 
01:43:54.629 --> 01:43:54.639 align:start position:0%
to earn these incomes hourly wages need
 
01:43:57.629 --> 01:43:57.639 align:start position:0%
to be over $17 an hour for a single
 
01:44:01.750 --> 01:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
person over $20 an hour for each of the
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
two adults or over $35 an hour for one
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
adult and one
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
child yesterday a senator quoted average
 
01:44:14.350 --> 01:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
wages of $18 to $23 an hour in various
 
01:44:17.189 --> 01:44:17.199 align:start position:0%
occupations from retail to health care
 
01:44:18.910 --> 01:44:18.920 align:start position:0%
and while I don't doubt the figures
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
averages are highly influenced by
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
outliers I know that my members of my
 
01:44:26.910 --> 01:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
family and among my friends people
 
01:44:28.709 --> 01:44:28.719 align:start position:0%
working in retail and healthc Care are
 
01:44:31.149 --> 01:44:31.159 align:start position:0%
earning less than 13 and I mean less
 
01:44:33.750 --> 01:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
than 14 and $15 an hour and they
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
certainly would appreciate an extra four
 
01:44:39.310 --> 01:44:39.320 align:start position:0%
to8 per hour added to their
 
01:44:41.709 --> 01:44:41.719 align:start position:0%
pay we also know from the New Hampshire
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy Institute that one in four
 
01:44:48.149 --> 01:44:48.159 align:start position:0%
households in New Hampshire have incomes
 
01:44:48.159 --> 01:44:49.350 align:start position:0%
households in New Hampshire have incomes
below

01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
below
 
01:44:54.070 --> 01:44:54.080 align:start position:0%
$50,000 in in 2022 and 177% of Granite
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
State households have incomes of less
 
01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.470 align:start position:0%
State households have incomes of less
than

01:44:58.470 --> 01:44:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.750 --> 01:45:02.760 align:start position:0%
$35,000 we know in 2023 the median cost
 
01:45:05.510 --> 01:45:05.520 align:start position:0%
of a two-bedroom apartment with
 
01:45:09.310 --> 01:45:09.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.030 --> 01:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
71764 per month or
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
$2,168 per
 
01:45:17.270 --> 01:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
year we know that paying more than a
 
01:45:19.589 --> 01:45:19.599 align:start position:0%
third of one's income on housing puts
 
01:45:21.709 --> 01:45:21.719 align:start position:0%
one in financial risks so we can
 
01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
conclude that many of those 25,000 25%
 
01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:27.400 align:start position:0%
of households with incomes of less than
 
01:45:30.149 --> 01:45:30.159 align:start position:0%
$50,000 are at Financial
 
01:45:32.830 --> 01:45:32.840 align:start position:0%
Risk we know that poverty and financial
 
01:45:35.030 --> 01:45:35.040 align:start position:0%
insecurity are very real in our state
 
01:45:37.510 --> 01:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
and while our state poverty rate is 7%
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
lower than most other states I question
 
01:45:42.189 --> 01:45:42.199 align:start position:0%
from a moral perspective if any poverty
 
01:45:44.870 --> 01:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
is acceptable the picture of poverty in
 
01:45:47.790 --> 01:45:47.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire varies by County with Coos
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
and Sullivan County having over 11%
 
01:45:52.510 --> 01:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
poverty and by groups with more women
 
01:45:55.390 --> 01:45:55.400 align:start position:0%
and children in poverty than men an
 
01:45:59.070 --> 01:45:59.080 align:start position:0%
anecdotal data from um food pantries and
 
01:46:01.470 --> 01:46:01.480 align:start position:0%
meal programs attest to a growing food
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
insecurity and poverty among the
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
elderly furthermore one and three
 
01:46:09.350 --> 01:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters said that they could not
 
01:46:11.470 --> 01:46:11.480 align:start position:0%
easily actually excuse me let me
 
01:46:13.430 --> 01:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
rephrase that one in three Granite
 
01:46:15.470 --> 01:46:15.480 align:start position:0%
Staters say that usual household
 
01:46:17.669 --> 01:46:17.679 align:start position:0%
expenses were difficult or very
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
difficult to meet last year in 2023 and
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
27% of New Hampshire households do not
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
have $2,000 in
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
savings we also know that there is an
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
affordable housing and affordable child
 
01:46:34.709 --> 01:46:34.719 align:start position:0%
care crisis in our state we've already
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
talked about that this morning and we
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
know that public education which
 
01:46:42.669 --> 01:46:42.679 align:start position:0%
educates 90% of the children in our
 
01:46:44.709 --> 01:46:44.719 align:start position:0%
state is under Financial strain because
 
01:46:47.109 --> 01:46:47.119 align:start position:0%
of low State funding High Reliance on
 
01:46:49.350 --> 01:46:49.360 align:start position:0%
property taxes and millions of tax
 
01:46:52.229 --> 01:46:52.239 align:start position:0%
dollars being being spent to fund a
 
01:46:54.270 --> 01:46:54.280 align:start position:0%
voucher program for private education
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
rather than supporting public education
 
01:46:59.149 --> 01:46:59.159 align:start position:0%
we know that our state is cutting taxes
 
01:47:01.109 --> 01:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
but not replacing lost Revenue with new
 
01:47:03.589 --> 01:47:03.599 align:start position:0%
sources of
 
01:47:06.830 --> 01:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
revenue we also have you know some
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
discouraging things happening like bills
 
01:47:10.030 --> 01:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
that are attacking workers rights and
 
01:47:12.109 --> 01:47:12.119 align:start position:0%
marginalized people in in our state
 
01:47:14.550 --> 01:47:14.560 align:start position:0%
particularly lgbtq community and there
 
01:47:17.430 --> 01:47:17.440 align:start position:0%
are bills that Ser further uh seek to
 
01:47:19.070 --> 01:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
undermine public education and its
 
01:47:21.550 --> 01:47:21.560 align:start position:0%
funding and now I find very discouraging
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
but I want to point out two encouraging
 
01:47:25.149 --> 01:47:25.159 align:start position:0%
signs and I'm sure there are a lot of
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
other ones um Claremont for example
 
01:47:30.550 --> 01:47:30.560 align:start position:0%
recognizes the threat of lead poisoning
 
01:47:32.350 --> 01:47:32.360 align:start position:0%
to the health and educational attainment
 
01:47:34.390 --> 01:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
of children and tests for lead exposure
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
before children begin School recognizing
 
01:47:39.310 --> 01:47:39.320 align:start position:0%
the intersectionality between good
 
01:47:41.669 --> 01:47:41.679 align:start position:0%
health being able to learn and becoming
 
01:47:44.390 --> 01:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
a productive member of society it saves
 
01:47:47.430 --> 01:47:47.440 align:start position:0%
money in the long run to do that it's
 
01:47:50.629 --> 01:47:50.639 align:start position:0%
not that it's cheap it's just that you
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's you know um what do I want to say a
 
01:47:56.589 --> 01:47:56.599 align:start position:0%
stitch and nine save Stitch and time
 
01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
saves nine that kind of thinking is
 
01:48:02.270 --> 01:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
makes sense um their bills to protect
 
01:48:03.910 --> 01:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
our environment a couple were being
 
01:48:07.709 --> 01:48:07.719 align:start position:0%
heard today um and that's good for the
 
01:48:10.990 --> 01:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
health of our state and the well-being
 
01:48:13.830 --> 01:48:13.840 align:start position:0%
of our economy because it will attract
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
citiz tourists and there are bills to
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage to increase
 
01:48:20.350 --> 01:48:20.360 align:start position:0%
Financial Security and there are many
 
01:48:23.070 --> 01:48:23.080 align:start position:0%
many more I believe that we need to keep
 
01:48:25.270 --> 01:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
working on all of these
 
01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
areas to be able and that are outlined
 
01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
in this Bill of Rights and to help all
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
granted saders be able to live
 
01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:34.840 align:start position:0%
productively and be able to pursue
 
01:48:38.229 --> 01:48:38.239 align:start position:0%
happiness the bill is aspirational and
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
inspirational helping us to remember
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
that we are all parts of our society and
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
that when the least of us is doing

amendment to
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
hr29 recognized the prime sponsor uh
 
03:08:42.469 --> 03:08:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative James Spain representing
 
03:08:45.469 --> 03:08:45.479 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 2 asking for 5 minutes
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%

too and uh I bring forward this
 
03:09:10.670 --> 03:09:10.680 align:start position:0%
amendment because I feel it's uh it's
 
03:09:12.389 --> 03:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
more valuable for the strength of our
 
03:09:14.030 --> 03:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative democracy and for the
 
03:09:16.510 --> 03:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
overall health of our Republic to
 
03:09:18.150 --> 03:09:18.160 align:start position:0%
educate the residents of New Hampshire
 
03:09:20.030 --> 03:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
the citizens of New Hampshire about
 
03:09:22.590 --> 03:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
their rights as outlined in the state
 
03:09:24.870 --> 03:09:24.880 align:start position:0%
constitution rather than to pass a
 
03:09:27.389 --> 03:09:27.399 align:start position:0%
resolution that enumerates a list of
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
so-called rights that exist nowhere in
 
03:09:29.439 --> 03:09:30.150 align:start position:0%
so-called rights that exist nowhere in
our

03:09:30.150 --> 03:09:30.160 align:start position:0%
our
 
03:09:32.389 --> 03:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
constitution my Amendment replaces the
 
03:09:35.229 --> 03:09:35.239 align:start position:0%
entire Bill and as a resolution it
 
03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
directs the future house to consider
 
03:09:40.190 --> 03:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
such education and access to the
 
03:09:42.750 --> 03:09:42.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh you all have a copy I
 
03:09:45.070 --> 03:09:45.080 align:start position:0%
can can answer any questions if you have
 
03:09:49.750 --> 03:09:49.760 align:start position:0%
any thank you uh rep Blain um I have a
 
03:09:53.389 --> 03:09:53.399 align:start position:0%
quick question procedurally I guess um
 
03:09:55.590 --> 03:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
there's two amendments that we have that
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:02.160 --> 03:10:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
20241

03:10:03.830 --> 03:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
20241
 
03:10:07.190 --> 03:10:07.200 align:start position:0%
18h and the other one that says
 
03:10:14.349 --> 03:10:14.359 align:start position:0%
026 H can you help us with minus 0026 h
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
okay so you have no idea what the one8 I
 
03:10:20.510 --> 03:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
have no idea what that one is all right
 
03:10:22.830 --> 03:10:22.840 align:start position:0%
I never got a copy of
 
03:10:26.670 --> 03:10:26.680 align:start position:0%
that it is the same it would appear
 
03:10:29.269 --> 03:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
That's one says unapproved and this one
 
03:10:32.630 --> 03:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
has nothing on it but that's oh um
 
03:10:35.790 --> 03:10:35.800 align:start position:0%
anyway okay I have
 
03:10:37.790 --> 03:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
the'll in front of me and it says
 
03:10:39.670 --> 03:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
unapproved on my copy but that's the way
 
03:10:44.030 --> 03:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
OS gave it to me okay all right great um
 
03:10:46.790 --> 03:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
thank you um bookkeeping out of the way
 
03:10:49.429 --> 03:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
uh does anyone have any questions for
 
03:10:53.550 --> 03:10:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:56.950 --> 03:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative
 
03:10:59.429 --> 03:10:59.439 align:start position:0%
sellers oh I'm
 
03:11:01.590 --> 03:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm
 
03:11:04.389 --> 03:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr
 
03:11:05.790 --> 03:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative for
 
03:11:08.309 --> 03:11:08.319 align:start position:0%
coming in today representative W um I'm
 
03:11:11.429 --> 03:11:11.439 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you are aware that these copies
 
03:11:13.510 --> 03:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
of the Constitution are available to
 
03:11:15.510 --> 03:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
everybody at the Secretary of State's
 
03:11:20.349 --> 03:11:20.359 align:start position:0%
office yes I am I felt that uh people
 
03:11:21.870 --> 03:11:21.880 align:start position:0%
don't know they can get them there and
 
03:11:24.150 --> 03:11:24.160 align:start position:0%
as an education effort I believe you can
 
03:11:25.990 --> 03:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
see here that I felt that it was uh
 
03:11:28.469 --> 03:11:28.479 align:start position:0%
actually uh beneficial to offer them a
 
03:11:30.590 --> 03:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
copy at certain times such as when they
 
03:11:32.670 --> 03:11:32.680 align:start position:0%
register their motor vehicle uh when
 
03:11:34.349 --> 03:11:34.359 align:start position:0%
they file for elected office I think
 
03:11:37.309 --> 03:11:37.319 align:start position:0%
that's very important um that when they
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
reach the fourth grade and come here to
 
03:11:40.110 --> 03:11:40.120 align:start position:0%
the state house for their tour they be
 
03:11:41.750 --> 03:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
given one and then a followup maybe in
 
03:11:43.190 --> 03:11:43.200 align:start position:0%
the eth grade and 12th grade which
 
03:11:45.670 --> 03:11:45.680 align:start position:0%
spaces it out evenly across their high
 
03:11:48.190 --> 03:11:48.200 align:start position:0%
school years and then of course uh when
 
03:11:49.870 --> 03:11:49.880 align:start position:0%
they register to vote because of course
 
03:11:51.630 --> 03:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
that's also important to voters to know
 
03:11:54.190 --> 03:11:54.200 align:start position:0%
what their constitutional rights are
 
03:11:56.870 --> 03:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
okay followup Mr chairman followup thank
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
you very much and again thank you for
 
03:12:00.710 --> 03:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
coming in today I understand how
 
03:12:03.150 --> 03:12:03.160 align:start position:0%
important this is um what I'm wondering
 
03:12:06.110 --> 03:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
is do you have any idea of what this
 
03:12:10.110 --> 03:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
would cost no I don't but uh the urge
 
03:12:12.349 --> 03:12:12.359 align:start position:0%
because this is a resolution it's just a
 
03:12:13.870 --> 03:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
resolu solution and and of course we
 
03:12:17.590 --> 03:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
can't bind a future house to uh do
 
03:12:20.590 --> 03:12:20.600 align:start position:0%
anything so what it's doing is is urging
 
03:12:23.110 --> 03:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
the house in the future to consider a
 
03:12:25.790 --> 03:12:25.800 align:start position:0%
fund and to initially fund it and then
 
03:12:27.790 --> 03:12:27.800 align:start position:0%
to allow donations to be taken from
 
03:12:29.710 --> 03:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to offer donations to
 
03:12:34.710 --> 03:12:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:37.429 --> 03:12:37.439 align:start position:0%
them anyone
 
03:12:41.469 --> 03:12:41.479 align:start position:0%
else so I have one question um there was
 
03:12:45.630 --> 03:12:45.640 align:start position:0%
a i I guess it's an were you aware um
 
03:12:48.870 --> 03:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
there was an individual I think I think
 
03:12:52.630 --> 03:12:52.640 align:start position:0%
it's now two terms ago um that had
 
03:12:56.710 --> 03:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
offered and had carried through with it
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
um providing fourth grade constit state
 
03:13:04.190 --> 03:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
constitutions to anyone um that asked
 
03:13:07.190 --> 03:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
for them and he said he would go into
 
03:13:09.990 --> 03:13:10.000 align:start position:0%
deeply into debt if he in order to
 
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
provide it are you aware of if what I I
 
03:13:15.590 --> 03:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
have a feeling he was near Deerfield as
 
03:13:17.150 --> 03:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact I don't remember who it
 
03:13:19.630 --> 03:13:19.640 align:start position:0%
was I don't know of this bill well I
 
03:13:21.630 --> 03:13:21.640 align:start position:0%
didn't know if it's still existed um you
 
03:13:24.429 --> 03:13:24.439 align:start position:0%
mentioned fourth grade and eighth grade
 
03:13:27.550 --> 03:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
um um is there any reason that you pick
 
03:13:30.229 --> 03:13:30.239 align:start position:0%
those ages uh I picked the fourth grade
 
03:13:31.229 --> 03:13:31.239 align:start position:0%
because that's when they come to the
 
03:13:34.830 --> 03:13:34.840 align:start position:0%
State House typically and I know a lot
 
03:13:36.910 --> 03:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
of the Reps such as myself if we meet
 
03:13:38.590 --> 03:13:38.600 align:start position:0%
our class we try to get a bundle of
 
03:13:39.830 --> 03:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
those from the Secretary of State's
 
03:13:41.229 --> 03:13:41.239 align:start position:0%
office so we can hand them out to all of
 
03:13:44.389 --> 03:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
our students who come um and so rather
 
03:13:46.790 --> 03:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
than have them every rep have to
 
03:13:49.030 --> 03:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
actually meet their class and hand them
 
03:13:52.309 --> 03:13:52.319 align:start position:0%
out um that having them available say in
 
03:13:53.630 --> 03:13:53.640 align:start position:0%
the gift shop when the class comes
 
03:13:56.670 --> 03:13:56.680 align:start position:0%
through would be a good time to offer it
 
03:13:58.870 --> 03:13:58.880 align:start position:0%
to them and then I figured uh if anybody
 
03:14:00.870 --> 03:14:00.880 align:start position:0%
missed that fourth grade then in the eth
 
03:14:02.110 --> 03:14:02.120 align:start position:0%
grade or 12th grade they could be
 
03:14:03.870 --> 03:14:03.880 align:start position:0%
offered the same thing it doesn't say
 
03:14:05.469 --> 03:14:05.479 align:start position:0%
they have to take one it's just being
 
03:14:07.630 --> 03:14:07.640 align:start position:0%
offered to them at those
 
03:14:10.710 --> 03:14:10.720 align:start position:0%
times uh thank you is there a reason
 
03:14:13.710 --> 03:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
that you're um
 
03:14:17.790 --> 03:14:17.800 align:start position:0%
putting forth this amendment um as a I
 
03:14:20.070 --> 03:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
guess as a replacement to
 
03:14:23.550 --> 03:14:23.560 align:start position:0%
hr29 well as I said in my my testimony
 
03:14:27.349 --> 03:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I feel that it's it's more valuable
 
03:14:29.710 --> 03:14:29.720 align:start position:0%
to actually strengthen our democracy and
 
03:14:34.190 --> 03:14:34.200 align:start position:0%
protect our um our Republic by educating
 
03:14:35.950 --> 03:14:35.960 align:start position:0%
everybody about what is actually
 
03:14:37.910 --> 03:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
enumerated in the Constitution as their
 
03:14:39.990 --> 03:14:40.000 align:start position:0%
rights um especially if they're going to
 
03:14:41.309 --> 03:14:41.319 align:start position:0%
be running for office or any of these
 
03:14:42.710 --> 03:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
other situations when when they're
 
03:14:44.870 --> 03:14:44.880 align:start position:0%
voting and whatnot but uh and when
 
03:14:45.990 --> 03:14:46.000 align:start position:0%
they're growing up and they're going
 
03:14:47.750 --> 03:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
through the school system to have an
 
03:14:49.429 --> 03:14:49.439 align:start position:0%
educated public that knows what their
 
03:14:51.670 --> 03:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
rights are and these are concrete rights
 
03:14:54.349 --> 03:14:54.359 align:start position:0%
these are not a a a wish list on a
 
03:14:57.110 --> 03:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
resolution for rights that are not
 
03:14:58.990 --> 03:14:59.000 align:start position:0%
enumerated somewhere these are actual
 
03:15:02.269 --> 03:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
rights that are enumerated um and and I
 
03:15:05.630 --> 03:15:05.640 align:start position:0%
felt that it was uh it was more
 
03:15:09.030 --> 03:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
important thank you further
 
03:15:11.229 --> 03:15:11.239 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
03:15:14.550 --> 03:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
much for your time thank you um I have
 
03:15:16.950 --> 03:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
one other pink card I think at this
 
03:15:20.990 --> 03:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
point um for this non gerain Amendment
 
03:15:24.590 --> 03:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
um and that is uh rep
 
03:15:27.150 --> 03:15:27.160 align:start position:0%
Schulz welcome back
 
03:15:30.150 --> 03:15:30.160 align:start position:0%
to legislative
 
03:15:32.110 --> 03:15:32.120 align:start position:0%
Administration there's a lot of things I
 
03:15:34.710 --> 03:15:34.720 align:start position:0%
could say about this one um I would
 
03:15:38.030 --> 03:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
first like to say why Target this
 
03:15:39.830 --> 03:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
resolution and not show up for the
 
03:15:42.950 --> 03:15:42.960 align:start position:0%
hearing for that resolution why
 
03:15:45.510 --> 03:15:45.520 align:start position:0%
this one when you could take a stand if
 
03:15:47.309 --> 03:15:47.319 align:start position:0%
you don't support it against the
 
03:15:49.469 --> 03:15:49.479 align:start position:0%
resolution you can get a copy of the
 
03:15:52.389 --> 03:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution right now for free uh from
 
03:15:54.269 --> 03:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office that's
 
03:15:55.870 --> 03:15:55.880 align:start position:0%
what I did when I first became a
 
03:15:58.229 --> 03:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
actually before I became a rep uh you
 
03:16:01.469 --> 03:16:01.479 align:start position:0%
also can go online and get it for free
 
03:16:04.309 --> 03:16:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh I think this
 
03:16:04.319 --> 03:16:05.990 align:start position:0%
uh I think this
is

03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:16:08.670 --> 03:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm editing out a lot of words I
 
03:16:11.790 --> 03:16:11.800 align:start position:0%
think it's Shenanigans why why this bill
 
03:16:14.229 --> 03:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
uh get your own resolution and I say
 
03:16:16.309 --> 03:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
that with kindness there's no reason to
 
03:16:18.630 --> 03:16:18.640 align:start position:0%
Target this bill we should be able to
 
03:16:21.229 --> 03:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
vote on the house floor and have a
 
03:16:23.590 --> 03:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
conversation on every Bill instead of
 
03:16:26.269 --> 03:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
tabling everything or at worst uh
 
03:16:28.910 --> 03:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
co-acting it when I would consider this
 
03:16:33.670 --> 03:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
a hostile Amendment uh I would hope uh
 
03:16:36.590 --> 03:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
everyone would want to take a stand in
 
03:16:38.309 --> 03:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
one way or the other rather than
 
03:16:41.630 --> 03:16:41.640 align:start position:0%
avoiding the vote that's my testimony
 
03:16:45.229 --> 03:16:45.239 align:start position:0%
and that's me being kind thank you um or
 
03:16:47.469 --> 03:16:47.479 align:start position:0%
as kind as I can be are there any
 
03:16:50.429 --> 03:16:50.439 align:start position:0%
further questions or any questions for
 
03:16:54.469 --> 03:16:54.479 align:start position:0%
representative Schulz I have one um do
 
03:16:59.429 --> 03:16:59.439 align:start position:0%
you have comments about the body of the
 
03:17:01.950 --> 03:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
amendment well I when I said you can get
 
03:17:02.990 --> 03:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
it for free
 
03:17:05.750 --> 03:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
already uh that speaks for itself I
 
03:17:09.309 --> 03:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
would think there is no need to uh
 
03:17:11.189 --> 03:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
create something that already
 
03:17:15.750 --> 03:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
exists but moreover why why not then
 
03:17:18.429 --> 03:17:18.439 align:start position:0%
make it an addendum why not amend a
 
03:17:21.670 --> 03:17:21.680 align:start position:0%
relevant Bill why not uh do your own
 
03:17:24.229 --> 03:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
resolution I mean this makes no sense
 
03:17:25.990 --> 03:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay but then so then it begs my
 
03:17:27.590 --> 03:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
question to you Mr chair as a point of
 
03:17:30.630 --> 03:17:30.640 align:start position:0%
information who decides what can be
 
03:17:33.870 --> 03:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
introduced as a non- derine Amendment
 
03:17:35.950 --> 03:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
who makes the decision that it's allowed
 
03:17:39.189 --> 03:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
because I know uh in the recent past
 
03:17:42.349 --> 03:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
folks have attempted to introduce non-an
 
03:17:44.389 --> 03:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
amendments and those have been declared
 
03:17:45.990 --> 03:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
out of order who makes the decision
 
03:17:48.469 --> 03:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
ultimately to allow it is that you as
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
chair is it the speaker is it the clerk
 
03:17:54.990 --> 03:17:55.000 align:start position:0%
is it uh some mystical process that only
 
03:17:56.710 --> 03:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
leadership can have access to but I
 
03:17:57.990 --> 03:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
think we should be able to understand
 
03:17:59.990 --> 03:18:00.000 align:start position:0%
that process so we can all use that
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
process sure I'll do my best it's all of
 
03:18:06.229 --> 03:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
those um so someone um comes up with a
 
03:18:08.510 --> 03:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
non-gain and you can correct me if I'm
 
03:18:10.790 --> 03:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
wrong um someone comes up with a
 
03:18:15.189 --> 03:18:15.199 align:start position:0%
non-gain Amendment and um or an
 
03:18:17.750 --> 03:18:17.760 align:start position:0%
amendment forget the non gerain for my
 
03:18:20.790 --> 03:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
for a moment and if there is a if there
 
03:18:24.910 --> 03:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
is a different part of the um different
 
03:18:27.389 --> 03:18:27.399 align:start position:0%
section of the rsas that it speaks to or
 
03:18:30.309 --> 03:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
any of those kind of things um I need to
 
03:18:33.830 --> 03:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
get permission um from uh the speaker's
 
03:18:36.870 --> 03:18:36.880 align:start position:0%
office and I think the clerk has
 
03:18:41.189 --> 03:18:41.199 align:start position:0%
um a hand in some of that as well to um
 
03:18:42.990 --> 03:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
to determine whether whether it's
 
03:18:45.229 --> 03:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
germine or not Germain and then they
 
03:18:47.670 --> 03:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
come back to me and say it's a non-gain
 
03:18:49.870 --> 03:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then I need to schedule a
 
03:18:52.710 --> 03:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
hearing which is what we're having here
 
03:18:55.710 --> 03:18:55.720 align:start position:0%
um that's the process um so this was
 
03:18:57.630 --> 03:18:57.640 align:start position:0%
something you allowed to happen I'm
 
03:18:59.670 --> 03:18:59.680 align:start position:0%
sorry so this you were in on allowing it
 
03:19:01.750 --> 03:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
to come forth in your committee then
 
03:19:04.670 --> 03:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
it's a part of your duties as chair um I
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
wasn't allowed to um offer it as a and
 
03:19:09.990 --> 03:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
as an
 
03:19:12.590 --> 03:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
amendment or at least I went
 
03:19:16.550 --> 03:19:16.560 align:start position:0%
to the to the bother um bad choice of
 
03:19:18.550 --> 03:19:18.560 align:start position:0%
words but I went to the bother of
 
03:19:21.750 --> 03:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
scheduling a hearing for because I
 
03:19:24.790 --> 03:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
assumed this was a non-gain Amendment um
 
03:19:27.990 --> 03:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't deal with the same section um
 
03:19:32.830 --> 03:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
as as the original bill um so it's safer
 
03:19:36.229 --> 03:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
for me always to have a a public hearing
 
03:19:38.189 --> 03:19:38.199 align:start position:0%
that we're having now over that
 
03:19:40.950 --> 03:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment rather than just um bring it
 
03:19:44.110 --> 03:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
up in terms of of the exact session
 
03:19:48.349 --> 03:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
thank you yep but anyone can bring one
 
03:19:50.189 --> 03:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
any time
 
03:19:52.910 --> 03:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
and more often than not I think it is
 
03:19:54.790 --> 03:19:54.800 align:start position:0%
still up to the chair but more often
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
than not I don't think I've
 
03:20:00.550 --> 03:20:00.560 align:start position:0%
ever not accepted an amendment on any
 
03:20:04.670 --> 03:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
basis um so just so you're aware thank
 
03:20:06.150 --> 03:20:06.160 align:start position:0%
you and I know they can also just go
 
03:20:08.110 --> 03:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
straight to the house floor as
 
03:20:08.120 --> 03:20:10.710 align:start position:0%
straight to the house floor as
well

03:20:10.710 --> 03:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:20:14.550 --> 03:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
um I think that may be ruled on for Jus
 
03:20:17.070 --> 03:20:17.080 align:start position:0%
as well so I don't think you escape that
 
03:20:18.870 --> 03:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
with the the house
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:27.630 --> 03:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
you seeing no other pin cards I'm going
 
03:20:29.429 --> 03:20:29.439 align:start position:0%
to close do you need this for this part
 
03:20:32.070 --> 03:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
of this
 
03:20:35.269 --> 03:20:35.279 align:start position:0%
sure more like a statement is that okay
 
03:20:37.349 --> 03:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
I will listen to whatever you say we've
 
03:20:40.070 --> 03:20:40.080 align:start position:0%
got 10 minutes before our exact session
 
03:20:41.590 --> 03:20:41.600 align:start position:0%
in terms of it being a non-gain
 
03:20:44.269 --> 03:20:44.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment and having seen other bills be
 
03:20:46.550 --> 03:20:46.560 align:start position:0%
hijacked but in the executive session I
 
03:20:48.670 --> 03:20:48.680 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that you brought it to a
 
03:20:50.590 --> 03:20:50.600 align:start position:0%
public hearing first and didn't just
 
03:20:52.710 --> 03:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
bring this into the exec session where
 
03:20:54.950 --> 03:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
we weren't able to have the open
 
03:20:56.389 --> 03:20:56.399 align:start position:0%
conversation so I just want to say I
 
03:20:58.830 --> 03:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
03:21:01.110 --> 03:21:01.120 align:start position:0%
yeah you got to give me a signal when
 
03:21:03.469 --> 03:21:03.479 align:start position:0%
you're going to be paying a compliment
 
03:21:05.950 --> 03:21:05.960 align:start position:0%
because then then I'll recognize you he
 
03:21:08.830 --> 03:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
won't gamble you thanks very much uh
 
03:21:11.229 --> 03:21:11.239 align:start position:0%
with that I'm closing the hearing on uh
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.840 --> 03:36:57.309 align:start position:0%
 
hr29

03:36:57.309 --> 03:36:57.319 align:start position:0%

doneal with and then if you only need
 
03:37:43.950 --> 03:37:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:47.110 --> 03:37:47.120 align:start position:0%

03:37:48.710 --> 03:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
the cooking and you're still cooking at
 
03:37:50.110 --> 03:37:50.120 align:start position:0%
home it's just that you're putting the
 
03:37:52.590 --> 03:37:52.600 align:start position:0%
ingredients together you have the recipe
 
03:37:54.790 --> 03:37:54.800 align:start position:0%
and you're still making it but every
 
03:37:57.870 --> 03:37:57.880 align:start position:0%
week the subscribers have 10 to 12
 
03:38:00.309 --> 03:38:00.319 align:start position:0%
different we pull it all together and
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.319 --> 03:49:39.149 align:start position:0%
 
really

03:49:39.149 --> 03:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:41.950 --> 03:49:41.960 align:start position:0%
with we're opening the executive session
 
03:49:44.429 --> 03:49:44.439 align:start position:0%
uh for legislative Administration we're
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
going to um begin with House Bill
 
03:49:52.110 --> 03:49:52.120 align:start position:0%
1219 going a little bit of out of order
 
03:49:55.269 --> 03:49:55.279 align:start position:0%
to uh accommodate the prime sponsor
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
who's in the room and actually a
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor as well is in the room
 
03:50:04.670 --> 03:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
um so um I
 
03:50:04.680 --> 03:50:07.030 align:start position:0%
um so um I
will

03:50:07.030 --> 03:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
will
 
03:50:09.990 --> 03:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
recognize who's doing this you
 
03:50:12.110 --> 03:50:12.120 align:start position:0%
who's who's making the motion on uh
 
03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
representative sellers for a motion on
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:50:18.630 --> 03:50:18.640 align:start position:0%
1219 uh thank you Mr chair I'll make a
 
03:50:22.030 --> 03:50:22.040 align:start position:0%
motion on 1219 hb1 1219 to
 
03:50:25.830 --> 03:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
itl uh representative sers moves itl on
 
03:50:29.990 --> 03:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
second representative Pearson
 
03:50:32.640 --> 03:50:34.189 align:start position:0%
second representative Pearson
seconds

03:50:34.189 --> 03:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
seconds
 
03:50:37.070 --> 03:50:37.080 align:start position:0%
um would you like to offer any
 
03:50:40.550 --> 03:50:40.560 align:start position:0%
discussion on PO Bill 129 just that um
 
03:50:42.630 --> 03:50:42.640 align:start position:0%
from the testimony and all that we heard
 
03:50:46.750 --> 03:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
on it um it's I think it's a great idea
 
03:50:50.229 --> 03:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
and but I also believe that we're able
 
03:50:53.950 --> 03:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
to do this now on a Case by case a bill
 
03:50:56.710 --> 03:50:56.720 align:start position:0%
by Bill basis so I don't think it's
 
03:51:00.590 --> 03:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
necessary to actually put into a
 
03:51:03.189 --> 03:51:03.199 align:start position:0%
law to actually which would actually
 
03:51:07.750 --> 03:51:07.760 align:start position:0%
create maybe uh uh further employment
 
03:51:11.269 --> 03:51:11.279 align:start position:0%
employees and and and cost as far as to
 
03:51:14.830 --> 03:51:14.840 align:start position:0%
the state and to the people thank you um
 
03:51:17.269 --> 03:51:17.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take a quick second and
 
03:51:21.510 --> 03:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
a manner of personal privilege here to
 
03:51:25.469 --> 03:51:25.479 align:start position:0%
ex explain the the thinking um I think
 
03:51:28.910 --> 03:51:28.920 align:start position:0%
from um from the side of the
 
03:51:28.920 --> 03:51:31.110 align:start position:0%
from um from the side of the
itl

03:51:31.110 --> 03:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
itl
 
03:51:36.750 --> 03:51:36.760 align:start position:0%
so um I'm a huge fan and I and I want to
 
03:51:39.229 --> 03:51:39.239 align:start position:0%
make sure that everyone is clear I'm a
 
03:51:42.750 --> 03:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
huge fan of the idea of longitudinal
 
03:51:46.389 --> 03:51:46.399 align:start position:0%
studies um I do think and I buy in the
 
03:51:50.710 --> 03:51:50.720 align:start position:0%
testimony that we do our budgeting based
 
03:51:54.189 --> 03:51:54.199 align:start position:0%
on a snapshot of time um and I think
 
03:51:56.670 --> 03:51:56.680 align:start position:0%
that there are bills that come before us
 
03:52:01.910 --> 03:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
that demand a longer term view
 
03:52:05.870 --> 03:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
um having said that um I think the
 
03:52:10.469 --> 03:52:10.479 align:start position:0%
manner by which this bill
 
03:52:13.870 --> 03:52:13.880 align:start position:0%
um proceeds to get to those longitudinal
 
03:52:18.149 --> 03:52:18.159 align:start position:0%
studies isn't isn't advantageous to the
 
03:52:22.750 --> 03:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
state um or to any future legislation
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
that requires these longitudinal studies
 
03:52:31.830 --> 03:52:31.840 align:start position:0%
so my thinking is um or our thinking is
 
03:52:35.870 --> 03:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
that um if if we look at just the
 
03:52:40.389 --> 03:52:40.399 align:start position:0%
timeline of um assuming this bill were
 
03:52:44.870 --> 03:52:44.880 align:start position:0%
to pass and we did a study beginning or
 
03:52:46.830 --> 03:52:46.840 align:start position:0%
um we we passed the bill we went to the
 
03:52:49.110 --> 03:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
house then it goes to the Senate it goes
 
03:52:51.790 --> 03:52:51.800 align:start position:0%
through all of this process again for um
 
03:52:54.030 --> 03:52:54.040 align:start position:0%
hearings then it goes to exec session
 
03:52:55.950 --> 03:52:55.960 align:start position:0%
there then it goes to passage in the
 
03:52:58.429 --> 03:52:58.439 align:start position:0%
Senate all of that is probably going to
 
03:53:00.670 --> 03:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
take you until
 
03:53:03.950 --> 03:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
May then we have to hope that the bill
 
03:53:06.790 --> 03:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
passes at some point and then it goes
 
03:53:08.790 --> 03:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
into the enroll bills process and you
 
03:53:11.309 --> 03:53:11.319 align:start position:0%
heard a little bit about that um earlier
 
03:53:15.030 --> 03:53:15.040 align:start position:0%
from the other bill um the fact that it
 
03:53:19.149 --> 03:53:19.159 align:start position:0%
can take um an inordinate amount of time
 
03:53:20.870 --> 03:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
before the bill actually gets to the
 
03:53:23.510 --> 03:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
governor's desk for sign for signing
 
03:53:25.189 --> 03:53:25.199 align:start position:0%
could be July or
 
03:53:28.229 --> 03:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
August um then we get to the point of
 
03:53:30.429 --> 03:53:30.439 align:start position:0%
having those people from the bill
 
03:53:33.429 --> 03:53:33.439 align:start position:0%
actually appointed to this commission
 
03:53:33.439 --> 03:53:35.110 align:start position:0%
actually appointed to this commission
which

03:53:35.110 --> 03:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
03:53:38.550 --> 03:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
um can take some time um even though
 
03:53:42.189 --> 03:53:42.199 align:start position:0%
they are listed in here who who would be
 
03:53:44.149 --> 03:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
from what area those people would come
 
03:53:46.030 --> 03:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
from but there may be difficulty in
 
03:53:47.990 --> 03:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
getting those people to agree to being
 
03:53:49.830 --> 03:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
on the
 
03:53:52.510 --> 03:53:52.520 align:start position:0%
commission bottom line is you then end
 
03:53:54.950 --> 03:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
up with a report that has to come in by
 
03:53:58.269 --> 03:53:58.279 align:start position:0%
November so you're probably looking at a
 
03:54:01.349 --> 03:54:01.359 align:start position:0%
couple maybe three months of time for
 
03:54:06.830 --> 03:54:06.840 align:start position:0%
this that um I forget his name Mr what
 
03:54:09.030 --> 03:54:09.040 align:start position:0%
what was the ex representative that
 
03:54:13.149 --> 03:54:13.159 align:start position:0%
testified Dan Dougall
 
03:54:16.670 --> 03:54:16.680 align:start position:0%
um he he was saying there needs to be
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
extensive meetings and hearings on this
 
03:54:23.070 --> 03:54:23.080 align:start position:0%
bill um so I'm not sure you would
 
03:54:25.189 --> 03:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
actually even in that short time period
 
03:54:29.710 --> 03:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
come up with um cogent and
 
03:54:34.229 --> 03:54:34.239 align:start position:0%
recognizable um legislation that then
 
03:54:35.630 --> 03:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
there would be a window that they could
 
03:54:38.950 --> 03:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
enter that legislation in for next
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
session next year's session the
 
03:54:45.030 --> 03:54:45.040 align:start position:0%
alternative is if we don't do this
 
03:54:47.030 --> 03:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
commission now we don't vote for this
 
03:54:49.670 --> 03:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
commission now which is the itl motion
 
03:54:51.269 --> 03:54:51.279 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
03:54:55.910 --> 03:54:55.920 align:start position:0%
sellers um the sponsor is given the
 
03:54:58.710 --> 03:54:58.720 align:start position:0%
month of February March April May June
 
03:55:01.189 --> 03:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
July August September October and
 
03:55:07.229 --> 03:55:07.239 align:start position:0%
November almost 10 months to um
 
03:55:11.189 --> 03:55:11.199 align:start position:0%
do a a essentially a commission with the
 
03:55:14.110 --> 03:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
people that she's already announced that
 
03:55:16.110 --> 03:55:16.120 align:start position:0%
she would like to have in this
 
03:55:18.830 --> 03:55:18.840 align:start position:0%
commission have it done on an ad hoc
 
03:55:22.189 --> 03:55:22.199 align:start position:0%
basis get nine additional months of
 
03:55:25.950 --> 03:55:25.960 align:start position:0%
meeting time in there and have
 
03:55:28.990 --> 03:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
a recommendations that can then be
 
03:55:32.189 --> 03:55:32.199 align:start position:0%
drafted into into a bill that can go
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
directly to finance for the budget for
 
03:55:38.990 --> 03:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
next year the theory um and I've spoken
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
with the chair of Finance about it he
 
03:55:43.189 --> 03:55:43.199 align:start position:0%
probably doesn't appreciate me um
 
03:55:46.990 --> 03:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
telling everyone that but um but the
 
03:55:50.990 --> 03:55:51.000 align:start position:0%
idea of a of a longitudinal study um
 
03:55:52.389 --> 03:55:52.399 align:start position:0%
does have
 
03:55:55.550 --> 03:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
Merit one of the things that we could do
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
um would be to uh in that bill and I'd
 
03:56:01.149 --> 03:56:01.159 align:start position:0%
be happy to co-sponsor that bill
 
03:56:05.950 --> 03:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
actually um is to provide or um
 
03:56:08.910 --> 03:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
appropriate some amount of money that
 
03:56:13.630 --> 03:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
could be used for um hiring or sending
 
03:56:16.309 --> 03:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
out an RFP
 
03:56:19.070 --> 03:56:19.080 align:start position:0%
for um a type of firm like the two
 
03:56:21.030 --> 03:56:21.040 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that were here talking about
 
03:56:21.040 --> 03:56:23.030 align:start position:0%
gentlemen that were here talking about
longitudinal

03:56:23.030 --> 03:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
longitudinal
 
03:56:26.429 --> 03:56:26.439 align:start position:0%
studies um I specifically asked them if
 
03:56:29.990 --> 03:56:30.000 align:start position:0%
they do um subcontracting work and they
 
03:56:32.309 --> 03:56:32.319 align:start position:0%
said they do for some
 
03:56:34.670 --> 03:56:34.680 align:start position:0%
states there would be nothing wrong with
 
03:56:39.030 --> 03:56:39.040 align:start position:0%
us um hiring them for specific
 
03:56:41.110 --> 03:56:41.120 align:start position:0%
legislation that probably hasn't been
 
03:56:43.110 --> 03:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
entered yet or maybe it will be coming
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
back up um in the next term but hiring
 
03:56:49.269 --> 03:56:49.279 align:start position:0%
them to do those longitudinal studies
 
03:56:51.429 --> 03:56:51.439 align:start position:0%
with that allocated money from the
 
03:56:54.309 --> 03:56:54.319 align:start position:0%
budget so I think you almost can gain a
 
03:56:58.910 --> 03:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
year in that way shape or form you're
 
03:57:01.030 --> 03:57:01.040 align:start position:0%
you're getting to the
 
03:57:04.710 --> 03:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
end product of a longitudinal study but
 
03:57:10.030 --> 03:57:10.040 align:start position:0%
you're getting to it without all of the
 
03:57:13.950 --> 03:57:13.960 align:start position:0%
slowdown of the process of going through
 
03:57:17.590 --> 03:57:17.600 align:start position:0%
having a commission approved and a
 
03:57:21.030 --> 03:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
commission um filled with people and
 
03:57:23.630 --> 03:57:23.640 align:start position:0%
then coming out with the with this the
 
03:57:26.149 --> 03:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
recommendations of doing probably what I
 
03:57:28.710 --> 03:57:28.720 align:start position:0%
just said of out of um having an
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
appropriation of the money I think it's
 
03:57:34.830 --> 03:57:34.840 align:start position:0%
a much cleaner much faster way of
 
03:57:36.910 --> 03:57:36.920 align:start position:0%
getting if the idea is to have a
 
03:57:39.790 --> 03:57:39.800 align:start position:0%
longitudinal study done
 
03:57:41.870 --> 03:57:41.880 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the way to do it rather
 
03:57:43.910 --> 03:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
than go through the commission room so
 
03:57:48.349 --> 03:57:48.359 align:start position:0%
with that long-winded approach I will be
 
03:57:51.389 --> 03:57:51.399 align:start position:0%
voting itl but I will also be offering
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
to co-sponsor um the bill for November
 
03:57:58.469 --> 03:57:58.479 align:start position:0%
uh representative wall yes U Mr chairman
 
03:58:00.950 --> 03:58:00.960 align:start position:0%
before any votes taken before any vote
 
03:58:04.070 --> 03:58:04.080 align:start position:0%
is taken um I think it' be helpful to
 
03:58:07.510 --> 03:58:07.520 align:start position:0%
hear a response from the
 
03:58:07.520 --> 03:58:09.269 align:start position:0%
hear a response from the
sponsors

03:58:09.269 --> 03:58:09.279 align:start position:0%
sponsors
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:15.110 --> 03:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
could thank I appreciate that and this
 
03:58:19.950 --> 03:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
is this isn't really a a a an ongoing
 
03:58:22.590 --> 03:58:22.600 align:start position:0%
discussion or a hearing I understand but
 
03:58:25.229 --> 03:58:25.239 align:start position:0%
um thank you according to rules it's my
 
03:58:27.469 --> 03:58:27.479 align:start position:0%
understanding that um if the committee
 
03:58:30.389 --> 03:58:30.399 align:start position:0%
votes for being able to hear a response
 
03:58:33.149 --> 03:58:33.159 align:start position:0%
to that um we don't have to have a vote
 
03:58:35.590 --> 03:58:35.600 align:start position:0%
I I'm happy to do that I'm I'm merely
 
03:58:40.790 --> 03:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.870 --> 03:58:42.880 align:start position:0%
there is a motion on the floor it's been
 
03:58:45.670 --> 03:58:45.680 align:start position:0%
seconded um I'm happy if the if the
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor would like to take a
 
03:58:50.309 --> 03:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:57.910 --> 03:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:00.510 --> 03:59:00.520 align:start position:0%
minute you're not I don't think you've
 
03:59:03.750 --> 03:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
quite understood this is not to do a
 
03:59:07.469 --> 03:59:07.479 align:start position:0%
longitudinal study this is to create a
 
03:59:09.469 --> 03:59:09.479 align:start position:0%
unit which would would provide us
 
03:59:12.269 --> 03:59:12.279 align:start position:0%
longitudinal studies on the things that
 
03:59:17.950 --> 03:59:17.960 align:start position:0%
we decide are most important to our our
 
03:59:19.349 --> 03:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill making
 
03:59:19.359 --> 03:59:21.030 align:start position:0%
bill making
process

03:59:21.030 --> 03:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:59:23.389 --> 03:59:23.399 align:start position:0%
and on
 
03:59:28.990 --> 03:59:29.000 align:start position:0%
we on if we hired people on a part-time
 
03:59:32.550 --> 03:59:32.560 align:start position:0%
basis for each one that would take going
 
03:59:34.910 --> 03:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
through the legislature each time it's
 
03:59:37.229 --> 03:59:37.239 align:start position:0%
been done twice that I can remember in
 
03:59:39.429 --> 03:59:39.439 align:start position:0%
my 28 years
 
03:59:42.830 --> 03:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
um that they hired outside people and in
 
03:59:46.229 --> 03:59:46.239 align:start position:0%
those cases it was for a massive study
 
03:59:53.149 --> 03:59:53.159 align:start position:0%
that was done for a year two years by by
 
03:59:59.189 --> 03:59:59.199 align:start position:0%
um by 12 15 or more Specialists that
 
04:00:01.990 --> 04:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
were involved in the thing and then
 
04:00:03.870 --> 04:00:03.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we didn't use
 
04:00:10.070 --> 04:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
them but um but what this would be would
 
04:00:13.469 --> 04:00:13.479 align:start position:0%
be something that we could rely on to do
 
04:00:16.870 --> 04:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
the long toal studies as they came up
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
over time rather than um a
 
04:00:25.710 --> 04:00:25.720 align:start position:0%
oneoff the whole idea was to not do one
 
04:00:29.550 --> 04:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
offs and the and part of the problem um
 
04:00:32.830 --> 04:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
the group that you were listening to
 
04:00:35.910 --> 04:00:35.920 align:start position:0%
sits in States because without having
 
04:00:39.030 --> 04:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
someone sitting in the state that the
 
04:00:45.550 --> 04:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
people at DC can can uh talk with is
 
04:00:48.630 --> 04:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
that each state is quite different and
 
04:00:50.550 --> 04:00:50.560 align:start position:0%
the person who's sitting in the state
 
04:00:53.910 --> 04:00:53.920 align:start position:0%
knows how to fit these things into that
 
04:00:56.229 --> 04:00:56.239 align:start position:0%
state we all know New Hampshire is
 
04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
really different particularly on
 
04:01:05.269 --> 04:01:05.279 align:start position:0%
anything to do with money but so um that
 
04:01:09.510 --> 04:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's just um I'm not sure that I could
 
04:01:14.510 --> 04:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
take the time to to go talking with 11
 
04:01:21.349 --> 04:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
people all all of um this term but on
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
without having a way to organize it and
 
04:01:27.469 --> 04:01:27.479 align:start position:0%
we already had pretty much organized it
 
04:01:31.630 --> 04:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
but the idea was that we'd get Buy in
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
from the Committees that would be most
 
04:01:37.469 --> 04:01:37.479 align:start position:0%
using it which would be finance and
 
04:01:39.630 --> 04:01:39.640 align:start position:0%
maybe ways in May raising means
 
04:01:41.830 --> 04:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
definitely on the revenue estimate side
 
04:01:45.550 --> 04:01:45.560 align:start position:0%
we have no outside Revenue estimates
 
04:01:48.309 --> 04:01:48.319 align:start position:0%
except the dras
 
04:01:50.750 --> 04:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
um but
 
04:01:54.670 --> 04:01:54.680 align:start position:0%
um um it's up to the
 
04:01:57.469 --> 04:01:57.479 align:start position:0%
committee I appreciate your point of
 
04:02:01.149 --> 04:02:01.159 align:start position:0%
view and and and I do I did understand
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
that your goal was to have an
 
04:02:04.720 --> 04:02:06.870 align:start position:0%
that your goal was to have an
inhouse

04:02:06.870 --> 04:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
inhouse
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
Department um
 
04:02:13.870 --> 04:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
my feeling is and and I'm I'm open to
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
criticism here my feeling is it would be
 
04:02:18.510 --> 04:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
a much easier
 
04:02:18.520 --> 04:02:20.149 align:start position:0%
a much easier
cell

04:02:20.149 --> 04:02:20.159 align:start position:0%
cell
 
04:02:24.710 --> 04:02:24.720 align:start position:0%
to have that next step of an inhouse um
 
04:02:27.950 --> 04:02:27.960 align:start position:0%
Department if that's what's if if the
 
04:02:31.269 --> 04:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
number of bills that we have that are um
 
04:02:33.790 --> 04:02:33.800 align:start position:0%
would benefit from a longitudinal study
 
04:02:37.309 --> 04:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
warrant it but it would be much better
 
04:02:39.870 --> 04:02:39.880 align:start position:0%
much easier to get that
 
04:02:45.550 --> 04:02:45.560 align:start position:0%
sale pasted um well this committee and
 
04:02:47.790 --> 04:02:47.800 align:start position:0%
finance if we
 
04:02:47.800 --> 04:02:49.710 align:start position:0%
finance if we
had

04:02:49.710 --> 04:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
had
 
04:02:54.630 --> 04:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
a um actual example of here's here's
 
04:02:58.870 --> 04:02:58.880 align:start position:0%
what this um oneoff in your term oneoff
 
04:03:01.710 --> 04:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
study did and here's the information
 
04:03:04.870 --> 04:03:04.880 align:start position:0%
that it gave us so that we could make a
 
04:03:08.790 --> 04:03:08.800 align:start position:0%
better decision longer term um
 
04:03:11.389 --> 04:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
it it in my in my world I call that a
 
04:03:14.149 --> 04:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
pilot program um and so that there's
 
04:03:15.950 --> 04:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
something that you can actually point to
 
04:03:19.229 --> 04:03:19.239 align:start position:0%
rather than jumping in and building an
 
04:03:19.239 --> 04:03:20.670 align:start position:0%
rather than jumping in and building an
entire

04:03:20.670 --> 04:03:20.680 align:start position:0%
entire
 
04:03:20.680 --> 04:03:22.630 align:start position:0%
entire
department

04:03:22.630 --> 04:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
04:03:27.110 --> 04:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
um building a a small Department um with
 
04:03:29.269 --> 04:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
staff and with everything else in order
 
04:03:32.469 --> 04:03:32.479 align:start position:0%
to make that same point that that's
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
where I'm getting to U rep
 
04:03:38.269 --> 04:03:38.279 align:start position:0%
yes Mr chair can I ask you a question
 
04:03:41.269 --> 04:03:41.279 align:start position:0%
about that in my thinking just following
 
04:03:41.279 --> 04:03:42.030 align:start position:0%
about that in my thinking just following
your

04:03:42.030 --> 04:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
04:03:45.630 --> 04:03:45.640 align:start position:0%
line that's what we're here for um
 
04:03:49.550 --> 04:03:49.560 align:start position:0%
is when I think of some commissions and
 
04:03:53.750 --> 04:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
this may be my na T so that's why I'm
 
04:03:56.469 --> 04:03:56.479 align:start position:0%
looking to your expertise is that on
 
04:03:58.870 --> 04:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
that commission to study the feasibility
 
04:04:01.189 --> 04:04:01.199 align:start position:0%
isn't that in of itself the ability to
 
04:04:03.510 --> 04:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
do that pilot program like just what you
 
04:04:07.389 --> 04:04:07.399 align:start position:0%
asked for so wouldn't that make you like
 
04:04:07.399 --> 04:04:08.550 align:start position:0%
asked for so wouldn't that make you like
can

04:04:08.550 --> 04:04:08.560 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:04:11.349 --> 04:04:11.359 align:start position:0%
the commission is it's coming to do that
 
04:04:14.630 --> 04:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
feasibility they're doing that pilot are
 
04:04:16.750 --> 04:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
you are you following my line like when
 
04:04:19.349 --> 04:04:19.359 align:start position:0%
you use that language that's how my
 
04:04:22.110 --> 04:04:22.120 align:start position:0%
thinking goes that well then yes we
 
04:04:25.750 --> 04:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
would want the commission to study that
 
04:04:27.309 --> 04:04:27.319 align:start position:0%
in that opportunity because that's an
 
04:04:29.590 --> 04:04:29.600 align:start position:0%
organized fashion to do that I think I
 
04:04:31.070 --> 04:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
understand do I misunderstand how that
 
04:04:34.349 --> 04:04:34.359 align:start position:0%
works I I think I understand your your
 
04:04:38.790 --> 04:04:38.800 align:start position:0%
point and um that's not how it Works in
 
04:04:40.550 --> 04:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
my estimation from the language of the
 
04:04:46.149 --> 04:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
bill okay um from the language um or the
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
the point of view that I have it would
 
04:04:53.149 --> 04:04:53.159 align:start position:0%
be if we were doing this work on on a
 
04:04:56.429 --> 04:04:56.439 align:start position:0%
specific piece of uh Family Medical
 
04:05:00.269 --> 04:05:00.279 align:start position:0%
Leave Act um and we hired a group to do
 
04:05:03.429 --> 04:05:03.439 align:start position:0%
the longitudinal study on that that is a
 
04:05:05.830 --> 04:05:05.840 align:start position:0%
much different process than than what
 
04:05:07.590 --> 04:05:07.600 align:start position:0%
the commission would be doing would be
 
04:05:10.590 --> 04:05:10.600 align:start position:0%
still studying it and talking about it
 
04:05:14.590 --> 04:05:14.600 align:start position:0%
in the abstract not with not with that
 
04:05:18.990 --> 04:05:19.000 align:start position:0%
um a specific instance okay thank you
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
yep um something else occurred to me
 
04:05:26.070 --> 04:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
while we were talking about that um I I
 
04:05:29.349 --> 04:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
liken this too um and we just we just
 
04:05:32.590 --> 04:05:32.600 align:start position:0%
had a bill in the last session um and I
 
04:05:34.870 --> 04:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
think actually rip walner was involved
 
04:05:37.870 --> 04:05:37.880 align:start position:0%
with it the bill to appropriate money
 
04:05:41.309 --> 04:05:41.319 align:start position:0%
money for um recodification of the
 
04:05:45.269 --> 04:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
education statutes I think that's a
 
04:05:48.790 --> 04:05:48.800 align:start position:0%
similar type approach um there could
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
have been a commission to
 
04:05:53.590 --> 04:05:53.600 align:start position:0%
study how we would Rec codify our
 
04:05:56.429 --> 04:05:56.439 align:start position:0%
education statutes and that would be
 
04:05:59.110 --> 04:05:59.120 align:start position:0%
similar to what this bill was instead
 
04:06:01.830 --> 04:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
what happened was um a bill was
 
04:06:04.750 --> 04:06:04.760 align:start position:0%
submitted to finance for an
 
04:06:07.630 --> 04:06:07.640 align:start position:0%
appropriation of i n don't quote me on
 
04:06:09.790 --> 04:06:09.800 align:start position:0%
it either 880 or
 
04:06:15.910 --> 04:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
$100,000 to um for the doe to actually
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
um send out rfps and have somebody do it
 
04:06:24.469 --> 04:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
um which seems again to shorten that
 
04:06:27.990 --> 04:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
time span and again would help the state
 
04:06:30.269 --> 04:06:30.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire in that terms I
 
04:06:32.269 --> 04:06:32.279 align:start position:0%
appreciate that example and that
 
04:06:36.469 --> 04:06:36.479 align:start position:0%
explanation help me thank you further
 
04:06:42.189 --> 04:06:42.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:48.070 --> 04:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
me no I'm seeing none I will ask the
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
clerk to call the role um we're just to
 
04:06:55.830 --> 04:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
remind everyone we're um we're voting on
 
04:06:57.550 --> 04:06:57.560 align:start position:0%
an IO
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
motion for for the language in the bill

04:08:49.070 --> 04:08:49.080 align:start position:0%

nay uh vot is 8 to six itl motion passes
 
04:08:56.189 --> 04:08:56.199 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming there'll be
 
04:09:00.670 --> 04:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
a minority minority report is there
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:09.349 --> 04:09:09.359 align:start position:0%
Report okay
 
04:09:12.269 --> 04:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
um that it would be great if we had that
 
04:09:16.790 --> 04:09:16.800 align:start position:0%
by um tomorrow who wants to do
 
04:09:20.070 --> 04:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
it anyone I can put
 
04:09:23.950 --> 04:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
down I will say I will say two things
 
04:09:26.750 --> 04:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
one is
 
04:09:30.389 --> 04:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
um I've written I've written the
 
04:09:34.109 --> 04:09:34.119 align:start position:0%
committee report already and have said
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
virtually exactly what I've said before
 
04:09:39.070 --> 04:09:39.080 align:start position:0%
I am in no way shape or form against
 
04:09:43.510 --> 04:09:43.520 align:start position:0%
longitudinal studies um and I also um
 
04:09:45.670 --> 04:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
will reiterate in front of the whole
 
04:09:48.910 --> 04:09:48.920 align:start position:0%
world here that I'm happy to co-sponsor
 
04:09:54.349 --> 04:09:54.359 align:start position:0%
um that bill come come September um but
 
04:09:58.630 --> 04:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
um but other than that um I don't think
 
04:10:00.550 --> 04:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
this is the manner by which it was
 
04:10:03.109 --> 04:10:03.119 align:start position:0%
should be done so we're there
 
04:10:06.429 --> 04:10:06.439 align:start position:0%
itl um I'll happily
 
04:10:10.070 --> 04:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
help right um as quickly as we can get
 
04:10:11.469 --> 04:10:11.479 align:start position:0%
it in the quicker we can get it in the
 
04:10:12.870 --> 04:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
calendar and quicker we can have the
 
04:10:15.670 --> 04:10:15.680 align:start position:0%
discussion on the floor I guess um
 
04:10:17.710 --> 04:10:17.720 align:start position:0%
thanks very much closing the exec
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%

04:10:33.710 --> 04:10:33.720 align:start position:0%

program

04:10:38.349 --> 04:10:38.359 align:start position:0%

04:10:52.189 --> 04:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
seconded by rep
 
04:10:55.790 --> 04:10:55.800 align:start position:0%
mcarter would rep cable have any
 
04:10:59.149 --> 04:10:59.159 align:start position:0%
discussion uh yeah thank you
 
04:10:59.159 --> 04:11:00.870 align:start position:0%
discussion uh yeah thank you
um

04:11:00.870 --> 04:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:11:04.630 --> 04:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
the um this bill basically allows for
 
04:11:07.429 --> 04:11:07.439 align:start position:0%
the um members of the general court to
 
04:11:09.149 --> 04:11:09.159 align:start position:0%
participate in the employee assistance
 
04:11:11.269 --> 04:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
program um I would say the biggest
 
04:11:15.030 --> 04:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
hurdle for me on this one was the two
 
04:11:17.030 --> 04:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
reasons really one is that we're having
 
04:11:19.429 --> 04:11:19.439 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers pay for it which um I
 
04:11:22.830 --> 04:11:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't think has the um a high high
 
04:11:26.469 --> 04:11:26.479 align:start position:0%
enough burden where we should be uh
 
04:11:27.830 --> 04:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
putting that on the
 
04:11:31.229 --> 04:11:31.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and um the second part of that
 
04:11:34.830 --> 04:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
is that um in just a brief uh research
 
04:11:37.790 --> 04:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
it seems that most of us um are already
 
04:11:40.790 --> 04:11:40.800 align:start position:0%
covered in one way or another um and
 
04:11:43.389 --> 04:11:43.399 align:start position:0%
those of us that aren't covered through
 
04:11:47.030 --> 04:11:47.040 align:start position:0%
um our spouses uh insurance or our own
 
04:11:49.070 --> 04:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
insurance um is covered by
 
04:11:52.870 --> 04:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
211 um so with all that I think that
 
04:11:55.109 --> 04:11:55.119 align:start position:0%
this bill is um
 
04:11:57.910 --> 04:11:57.920 align:start position:0%
unnecessary um I'll just leave it
 
04:12:02.189 --> 04:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
there thank you r h um further
 
04:12:04.309 --> 04:12:04.319 align:start position:0%
discussion re
 
04:12:07.349 --> 04:12:07.359 align:start position:0%
n yeah um I actually think this is great
 
04:12:09.950 --> 04:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal policy um the fiscal note says
 
04:12:11.269 --> 04:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
that it is
 
04:12:14.750 --> 04:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
$117,000 to spend it's 17,000 one year
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
and then $1 18,000 the next year um as
 
04:12:19.550 --> 04:12:19.560 align:start position:0%
I've noticed in a lot of our bills a lot
 
04:12:21.389 --> 04:12:21.399 align:start position:0%
of them are like personal
 
04:12:25.510 --> 04:12:25.520 align:start position:0%
grievances um and I think that having uh
 
04:12:27.349 --> 04:12:27.359 align:start position:0%
services available to people might
 
04:12:30.550 --> 04:12:30.560 align:start position:0%
actually save us a session day um which
 
04:12:33.590 --> 04:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
is approximately $15,000 so if we get
 
04:12:36.349 --> 04:12:36.359 align:start position:0%
you know like one bill from like
 
04:12:36.359 --> 04:12:37.990 align:start position:0%
you know like one bill from like
everyone

04:12:37.990 --> 04:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
04:12:41.149 --> 04:12:41.159 align:start position:0%
or you know from some of like our um
 
04:12:43.149 --> 04:12:43.159 align:start position:0%
from we have a lot of people with like
 
04:12:44.590 --> 04:12:44.600 align:start position:0%
more than 30 bills which is what I
 
04:12:48.630 --> 04:12:48.640 align:start position:0%
figure is one session day worth of stuff
 
04:12:51.189 --> 04:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
and if you count all of our um committee
 
04:12:52.830 --> 04:12:52.840 align:start position:0%
meetings like I just think all that
 
04:12:56.309 --> 04:12:56.319 align:start position:0%
money kind of adds up when we're talking
 
04:12:57.830 --> 04:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
about personal
 
04:13:00.269 --> 04:13:00.279 align:start position:0%
grievances um so I think that having
 
04:13:02.990 --> 04:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
this uh money spent to help people I
 
04:13:05.269 --> 04:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
think would actually save us a lot of
 
04:13:08.269 --> 04:13:08.279 align:start position:0%
money um but yeah
 
04:13:11.149 --> 04:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um GRE
 
04:13:15.070 --> 04:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you Mr chair um with
 
04:13:17.910 --> 04:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
regards to that uh I have been the
 
04:13:21.349 --> 04:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
beneficiary of the services at 211 as
 
04:13:24.389 --> 04:13:24.399 align:start position:0%
recently as almost a year ago today um
 
04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
when I needed help with my alcoholism it
 
04:13:29.790 --> 04:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
was free and not on the backs of
 
04:13:31.870 --> 04:13:31.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers it's a service provided by the
 
04:13:34.070 --> 04:13:34.080 align:start position:0%
United Way a charitable
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
organization which that's their purpose
 
04:13:39.149 --> 04:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
is to to help people in crisis of any
 
04:13:42.189 --> 04:13:42.199 align:start position:0%
kind whether it's uh a depressive issue
 
04:13:45.109 --> 04:13:45.119 align:start position:0%
a substance abuse disorder or a
 
04:13:47.870 --> 04:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
financial concern or food
 
04:13:50.670 --> 04:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
insecurity they they
 
04:13:54.550 --> 04:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
um can handle that entire spectrum of
 
04:13:57.309 --> 04:13:57.319 align:start position:0%
issues that an employer uh an employee
 
04:13:59.870 --> 04:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
assistance program can also handle but
 
04:14:01.990 --> 04:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
it's all done with charitable donations
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
and dollars not taxpayer resources so
 
04:14:08.229 --> 04:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
for that reason um I would concur with
 
04:14:11.349 --> 04:14:11.359 align:start position:0%
rep costal that that this should be it
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
since there is a free resource available
 
04:14:16.030 --> 04:14:16.040 align:start position:0%
to everyone not just us as
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
legislators um everyone in the state of
 
04:14:23.309 --> 04:14:23.319 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has access to 211 so thank
 
04:14:26.990 --> 04:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
you thank you rep mcarter uh rep
 
04:14:30.269 --> 04:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
sers thank you Mr chair I again that the
 
04:14:34.550 --> 04:14:34.560 align:start position:0%
211 service which is already there and
 
04:14:38.389 --> 04:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
to put this in place uh just for us it
 
04:14:40.990 --> 04:14:41.000 align:start position:0%
it's redundant at this point since you
 
04:14:44.269 --> 04:14:44.279 align:start position:0%
can get this probably if not the exact
 
04:14:47.790 --> 04:14:47.800 align:start position:0%
very similar service so it's redundant
 
04:14:51.550 --> 04:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
and and why why take up the expenses and
 
04:14:55.070 --> 04:14:55.080 align:start position:0%
not only that the um they limited it to
 
04:14:58.189 --> 04:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
three times in 2011 you can call as many
 
04:15:00.269 --> 04:15:00.279 align:start position:0%
times as you want for any number of
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
problems so it just makes sense to to
 
04:15:05.990 --> 04:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
stay with the 211 system and and this is
 
04:15:06.000 --> 04:15:08.189 align:start position:0%
stay with the 211 system and and this is
unnecessary

04:15:08.189 --> 04:15:08.199 align:start position:0%
unnecessary
 
04:15:11.309 --> 04:15:11.319 align:start position:0%
thank you rep rep here I just wanted to
 
04:15:14.109 --> 04:15:14.119 align:start position:0%
ask a clarifying question um when this
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
says allowing members of the general
 
04:15:19.590 --> 04:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
court that's just referring to elected
 
04:15:22.750 --> 04:15:22.760 align:start position:0%
representatives and elected Senators not
 
04:15:24.670 --> 04:15:24.680 align:start position:0%
staff that's my understanding I think
 
04:15:27.189 --> 04:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
the staff already does that's what I
 
04:15:30.590 --> 04:15:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:33.710 --> 04:15:33.720 align:start position:0%
yep U just further discussion on I think
 
04:15:38.030 --> 04:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
that the 211 resources just so valuable
 
04:15:40.109 --> 04:15:40.119 align:start position:0%
and I love how many times we're saying
 
04:15:43.070 --> 04:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
it in this committee meeting um for
 
04:15:45.830 --> 04:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
folks to continue to get that uh word
 
04:15:48.590 --> 04:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
out for the usage of that but that's a
 
04:15:51.510 --> 04:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
problem in of of itself right that folks
 
04:15:54.469 --> 04:15:54.479 align:start position:0%
don't always know 211 as an access and
 
04:15:57.229 --> 04:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
sometimes you think through your
 
04:16:00.429 --> 04:16:00.439 align:start position:0%
problems and your process through what
 
04:16:04.030 --> 04:16:04.040 align:start position:0%
is available to you under that umbrella
 
04:16:08.990 --> 04:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
of the insurance or that of as an
 
04:16:12.109 --> 04:16:12.119 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program so I think
 
04:16:15.510 --> 04:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
that it is a very valuable for the
 
04:16:19.590 --> 04:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
general court to open this up um and
 
04:16:23.309 --> 04:16:23.319 align:start position:0%
have employee assistance for our members
 
04:16:26.750 --> 04:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
because it is just one additional
 
04:16:29.670 --> 04:16:29.680 align:start position:0%
resource not not redundant but many
 
04:16:31.910 --> 04:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
people have different paths for finding
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
their information and this is that type
 
04:16:37.510 --> 04:16:37.520 align:start position:0%
of path that could open up if we're
 
04:16:40.990 --> 04:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
already making the insurance and many of
 
04:16:44.309 --> 04:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
our members are availing themselves to
 
04:16:47.189 --> 04:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
that insurance this is within that same
 
04:16:48.790 --> 04:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
path and I think really important for
 
04:16:48.800 --> 04:16:49.830 align:start position:0%
path and I think really important for
our

04:16:49.830 --> 04:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
our
 
04:16:53.710 --> 04:16:53.720 align:start position:0%
members thank you R
 
04:16:57.149 --> 04:16:57.159 align:start position:0%
Paul uh thank you Mr chairman um just
 
04:16:58.710 --> 04:16:58.720 align:start position:0%
going along with what representative
 
04:17:02.349 --> 04:17:02.359 align:start position:0%
Richard said um so people understand it
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
was probably in the late 1980s early 90s
 
04:17:08.389 --> 04:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
when we got about our health
 
04:17:10.710 --> 04:17:10.720 align:start position:0%
insurance we pay for it of course
 
04:17:13.990 --> 04:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
through our own pockets as legislators
 
04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
we we are not state employees but we are
 
04:17:20.070 --> 04:17:20.080 align:start position:0%
able to buy into a program like state
 
04:17:23.429 --> 04:17:23.439 align:start position:0%
employees so this is where represent
 
04:17:25.990 --> 04:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
Richards is saying this would be like
 
04:17:29.229 --> 04:17:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:29.239 --> 04:17:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
correct

04:17:31.030 --> 04:17:31.040 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:17:31.040 --> 04:17:32.790 align:start position:0%
correct
it's

04:17:32.790 --> 04:17:32.800 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:17:37.830 --> 04:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
different thank you it's um it's
 
04:17:40.109 --> 04:17:40.119 align:start position:0%
the it's putting your employee
 
04:17:41.389 --> 04:17:41.399 align:start position:0%
assistance and mental health thinking of
 
04:17:43.790 --> 04:17:43.800 align:start position:0%
it as in general in healthare so using
 
04:17:46.149 --> 04:17:46.159 align:start position:0%
the words like that there are many
 
04:17:48.550 --> 04:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
aspects that are different so I can't
 
04:17:51.109 --> 04:17:51.119 align:start position:0%
necessarily totally agree with your
 
04:17:54.910 --> 04:17:54.920 align:start position:0%
statement on that more of it is
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
um thinking of Health in the in the most
 
04:18:00.229 --> 04:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
holistic way and including mental health
 
04:18:03.790 --> 04:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
in that holistic health approach um and
 
04:18:05.830 --> 04:18:05.840 align:start position:0%
making that available to the general
 
04:18:09.229 --> 04:18:09.239 align:start position:0%
court so that is where I would be in
 
04:18:11.469 --> 04:18:11.479 align:start position:0%
agreement with your
 
04:18:14.070 --> 04:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
statement um can I ask a clarifying
 
04:18:18.189 --> 04:18:18.199 align:start position:0%
question is um are you saying that the
 
04:18:22.469 --> 04:18:22.479 align:start position:0%
current voluntary medical plan that
 
04:18:24.469 --> 04:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
legislators can buy
 
04:18:29.269 --> 04:18:29.279 align:start position:0%
into um covers this program as
 
04:18:32.189 --> 04:18:32.199 align:start position:0%
a I don't think so I thought that's what
 
04:18:34.830 --> 04:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
you were just saying I don't think so
 
04:18:36.750 --> 04:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
I've never had to do that thank goodness
 
04:18:39.070 --> 04:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
goodness but
 
04:18:41.309 --> 04:18:41.319 align:start position:0%
um I just thought that's what you were
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
saying I I don't know if it's true or
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
not I just don't know I I don't think
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
it's this program specifically I know
 
04:18:51.550 --> 04:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
it's not this program
 
04:18:54.870 --> 04:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
specifically um I'm guessing again I'm
 
04:18:58.550 --> 04:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
not sure about the benefits in terms of
 
04:19:00.790 --> 04:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
going to a counselor for example or
 
04:19:02.550 --> 04:19:02.560 align:start position:0%
psychiatrist or
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
psychologist um I don't know if
 
04:19:06.429 --> 04:19:06.439 align:start position:0%
insurance covers that I I just don't
 
04:19:08.630 --> 04:19:08.640 align:start position:0%
know thank
 
04:19:08.640 --> 04:19:13.349 align:start position:0%
know thank
you

04:19:13.349 --> 04:19:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:15.630 --> 04:19:15.640 align:start position:0%
um I just want to go more into detail
 
04:19:17.030 --> 04:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
about what the employee assistance
 
04:19:19.269 --> 04:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
program like it's not just therapy three
 
04:19:21.870 --> 04:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
times um I know some of them will help
 
04:19:25.229 --> 04:19:25.239 align:start position:0%
you get um will help you acquire Child
 
04:19:27.630 --> 04:19:27.640 align:start position:0%
Care um and they're talking more about
 
04:19:30.229 --> 04:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
like referrals to therapy and um helping
 
04:19:33.149 --> 04:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
you uh with food assistance and um even
 
04:19:35.670 --> 04:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
referring you over to 211 um just wanted
 
04:19:39.990 --> 04:19:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:43.670 --> 04:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
stuff um there was an outstanding
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
question of um why would this
 
04:19:52.389 --> 04:19:52.399 align:start position:0%
plan not follow the same procedure and
 
04:19:55.870 --> 04:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
rules as um our
 
04:20:00.429 --> 04:20:00.439 align:start position:0%
current buy into the medical and dental
 
04:20:04.990 --> 04:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
that is a voluntary and paid for um by
 
04:20:09.630 --> 04:20:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:14.630 --> 04:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
legislator did the testimony answer that
 
04:20:18.389 --> 04:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
in at all I'm not sure it was asked um
 
04:20:20.870 --> 04:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
we can ask the clerk to review her notes
 
04:20:20.880 --> 04:20:22.229 align:start position:0%
we can ask the clerk to review her notes
but

04:20:22.229 --> 04:20:22.239 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
uh um rep
 
04:20:29.590 --> 04:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
wall has an answer do you want the cor
 
04:20:32.550 --> 04:20:32.560 align:start position:0%
answer the testimony question or no um
 
04:20:36.630 --> 04:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
okay um State reps who participate in
 
04:20:38.830 --> 04:20:38.840 align:start position:0%
the program and there are number who do
 
04:20:43.309 --> 04:20:43.319 align:start position:0%
pay for the insurance out of their own
 
04:20:46.990 --> 04:20:47.000 align:start position:0%
Pockets right and my question is why
 
04:20:48.429 --> 04:20:48.439 align:start position:0%
this plan
 
04:20:54.469 --> 04:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:59.750 --> 04:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
way Dian um if I recall the um Prime
 
04:21:02.590 --> 04:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor testimony she said it would be
 
04:21:05.429 --> 04:21:05.439 align:start position:0%
um a nice perk for
 
04:21:05.439 --> 04:21:08.670 align:start position:0%
um a nice perk for
legislators

04:21:08.670 --> 04:21:08.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
gra tny and that perk is one of the
 
04:21:15.750 --> 04:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
reasons that I have a problem with this
 
04:21:15.760 --> 04:21:17.309 align:start position:0%
reasons that I have a problem with this
um

04:21:17.309 --> 04:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:21:20.990 --> 04:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
211 if they refer you to somebody like
 
04:21:23.389 --> 04:21:23.399 align:start position:0%
United Way fine you don't have to pay
 
04:21:26.630 --> 04:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
for it but if they refer you to a
 
04:21:26.640 --> 04:21:28.229 align:start position:0%
for it but if they refer you to a
particular

04:21:28.229 --> 04:21:28.239 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:21:31.870 --> 04:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
psychologist uh psychiatrist whatever
 
04:21:34.710 --> 04:21:34.720 align:start position:0%
that's on your dime I know the first
 
04:21:37.030 --> 04:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
three referrals
 
04:21:39.590 --> 04:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
according to this bill are on the
 
04:21:43.030 --> 04:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
state's dime that's something that every
 
04:21:45.309 --> 04:21:45.319 align:start position:0%
other Tom Dick and Harry out there does
 
04:21:48.269 --> 04:21:48.279 align:start position:0%
not have the option to get it's a perk
 
04:21:52.429 --> 04:21:52.439 align:start position:0%
that we're receiving that no offense to
 
04:21:54.389 --> 04:21:54.399 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room but we really
 
04:21:54.399 --> 04:21:56.269 align:start position:0%
anybody in the room but we really
haven't

04:21:56.269 --> 04:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:21:58.309 --> 04:21:58.319 align:start position:0%
earned if we want to pay for it
 
04:22:00.950 --> 04:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
ourselves the same as the medical one
 
04:22:02.389 --> 04:22:02.399 align:start position:0%
then I really wouldn't have a problem
 
04:22:06.070 --> 04:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
with it but the way it is now uhuh I'm
 
04:22:06.080 --> 04:22:09.469 align:start position:0%
with it but the way it is now uhuh I'm
oppos

04:22:09.469 --> 04:22:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:13.790 --> 04:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
osed rep sers yeah thank you Mr chair it
 
04:22:15.870 --> 04:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
was my understanding unless I'm confused
 
04:22:18.389 --> 04:22:18.399 align:start position:0%
I they were really just referring the
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
state that it wasn't Services they were
 
04:22:25.189 --> 04:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
providing they there was only referral
 
04:22:27.550 --> 04:22:27.560 align:start position:0%
part of the program so we would refer
 
04:22:30.269 --> 04:22:30.279 align:start position:0%
you to X Y or
 
04:22:33.030 --> 04:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
Z respon
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
sir sure respon from rep he according to
 
04:22:41.950 --> 04:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
what the testimony said the first three
 
04:22:44.070 --> 04:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
they foot the bill
 
04:22:47.870 --> 04:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
for they are paying for that the state
 
04:22:54.790 --> 04:22:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:59.710 --> 04:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
that s i rep cable first sorry um just
 
04:23:02.550 --> 04:23:02.560 align:start position:0%
to add to that there was no resolution
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
after three um we had asked about what
 
04:23:07.550 --> 04:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
happens after three and there was there
 
04:23:10.349 --> 04:23:10.359 align:start position:0%
was no resolution to that it was well
 
04:23:11.790 --> 04:23:11.800 align:start position:0%
you know we're not going to charge
 
04:23:15.590 --> 04:23:15.600 align:start position:0%
people um but that to me was not a
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
resolution to that question
 
04:23:24.510 --> 04:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
um repr I just for clarification on my
 
04:23:27.790 --> 04:23:27.800 align:start position:0%
recollection of the the very good um
 
04:23:30.349 --> 04:23:30.359 align:start position:0%
long testimony that we had um the number
 
04:23:33.710 --> 04:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
three is being used a lot here um and
 
04:23:35.950 --> 04:23:35.960 align:start position:0%
that in the testimony because I asked
 
04:23:38.790 --> 04:23:38.800 align:start position:0%
the question question um that it is
 
04:23:41.710 --> 04:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes one for a person and it you
 
04:23:45.149 --> 04:23:45.159 align:start position:0%
know is sometimes to your point could be
 
04:23:48.750 --> 04:23:48.760 align:start position:0%
potentially more so um but as a reminder
 
04:23:51.309 --> 04:23:51.319 align:start position:0%
also in the testimony is that it is an
 
04:23:54.870 --> 04:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
existing staff and um the department own
 
04:23:59.469 --> 04:23:59.479 align:start position:0%
no additional staff needed to assist the
 
04:24:02.429 --> 04:24:02.439 align:start position:0%
general court they could do that within
 
04:24:08.309 --> 04:24:08.319 align:start position:0%
their existing volume so um just to um
 
04:24:10.070 --> 04:24:10.080 align:start position:0%
to clarify since the clerk doesn't have
 
04:24:13.269 --> 04:24:13.279 align:start position:0%
the notes um uh because I could I asked
 
04:24:14.870 --> 04:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
those questions I was just clarifying
 
04:24:18.309 --> 04:24:18.319 align:start position:0%
that point of the testimony as well so
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
um that it is not um an additional
 
04:24:26.109 --> 04:24:26.119 align:start position:0%
burden and potentially to rep n Wongs
 
04:24:28.790 --> 04:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
could be um something that will save us
 
04:24:31.189 --> 04:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
a little bit of time in the end as a
 
04:24:33.790 --> 04:24:33.800 align:start position:0%
general court in the most positive way
 
04:24:36.910 --> 04:24:36.920 align:start position:0%
of of uh an outcome of potentially
 
04:24:39.070 --> 04:24:39.080 align:start position:0%
making this available but I think Mo
 
04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
first and foremost this is something
 
04:24:44.469 --> 04:24:44.479 align:start position:0%
that you know we need to continue to be
 
04:24:48.510 --> 04:24:48.520 align:start position:0%
um availing uh our members to any mental
 
04:24:50.349 --> 04:24:50.359 align:start position:0%
health assistance and making sure that
 
04:24:53.670 --> 04:24:53.680 align:start position:0%
we think of mental health as
 
04:24:57.309 --> 04:24:57.319 align:start position:0%
health so before I recognize rep costal
 
04:24:59.710 --> 04:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
I think the three hours comes from the
 
04:25:02.710 --> 04:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
brochure here that says 3 hours of
 
04:25:04.950 --> 04:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
service per year is available to you
 
04:25:08.309 --> 04:25:08.319 align:start position:0%
during your workday without using leave
 
04:25:12.269 --> 04:25:12.279 align:start position:0%
time which we don't get at least I've
 
04:25:14.910 --> 04:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
never seen it um it does say what kind
 
04:25:18.590 --> 04:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
of help is available and it says the EAP
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
can link you with resources such as
 
04:25:24.349 --> 04:25:24.359 align:start position:0%
alcohol drug abuse career retirement
 
04:25:27.030 --> 04:25:27.040 align:start position:0%
counsil is clergy Community Mental heal
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah I don't see anywhere that
 
04:25:30.199 --> 04:25:31.229 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah I don't see anywhere that
it

04:25:31.229 --> 04:25:31.239 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
says they are
 
04:25:38.109 --> 04:25:38.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:40.950 --> 04:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
counseling um it it looks to me like
 
04:25:43.030 --> 04:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
it's saying that you can link to
 
04:25:46.030 --> 04:25:46.040 align:start position:0%
resources rep costable yeah thank you
 
04:25:49.590 --> 04:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
just to the point on um it not needing
 
04:25:51.550 --> 04:25:51.560 align:start position:0%
more staff and anything if that was
 
04:25:53.590 --> 04:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
truly the case then why is there a cost
 
04:25:56.910 --> 04:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
Associated it it would be a zero cost
 
04:25:58.550 --> 04:25:58.560 align:start position:0%
they would come here and say we can do
 
04:26:01.109 --> 04:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
this there's a few of you uh so where's
 
04:26:02.630 --> 04:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
the cost coming from and I was just to
 
04:26:04.389 --> 04:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
mention that is where the cost was
 
04:26:07.910 --> 04:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
coming from that this will cost money uh
 
04:26:11.109 --> 04:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
it is U so it's it's you're kind of
 
04:26:13.590 --> 04:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
having it both ways it's like it either
 
04:26:15.030 --> 04:26:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is going to cost more money which
 
04:26:17.030 --> 04:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
means time and energy from from the
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
Department or it's not going to and
 
04:26:20.149 --> 04:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
therefore there shouldn't be a cost
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.269 --> 04:26:27.279 align:start position:0%
it R
 
04:26:30.189 --> 04:26:30.199 align:start position:0%
mcarter thank you Mr chair again you
 
04:26:32.630 --> 04:26:32.640 align:start position:0%
just read it out loud that they they are
 
04:26:36.309 --> 04:26:36.319 align:start position:0%
not the provider of the resource that
 
04:26:39.189 --> 04:26:39.199 align:start position:0%
you're looking for if you call your EAP
 
04:26:41.269 --> 04:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
if you have it at work or through this
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
program here through this state you're
 
04:26:45.990 --> 04:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
not going to get a counselor on the
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
phone to talk you from crying for your
 
04:26:51.229 --> 04:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
dog or your cat if they're going to put
 
04:26:54.149 --> 04:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
you in touch with an agency that can
 
04:26:55.830 --> 04:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
help you with that so this is kind of
 
04:26:58.550 --> 04:26:58.560 align:start position:0%
just acting as an intermediary if it
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
works in a similar fashion to the way
 
04:27:03.910 --> 04:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
the one I I've worked with for decades
 
04:27:06.309 --> 04:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
they are just an intermediary I think
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
the confusion comes in and even in their
 
04:27:12.189 --> 04:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
brochure as I go on it says the primary
 
04:27:14.309 --> 04:27:14.319 align:start position:0%
goal of an EAP is to maintain an
 
04:27:16.510 --> 04:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
employes ability to be fully productive
 
04:27:19.189 --> 04:27:19.199 align:start position:0%
in the workplace getting to your point
 
04:27:23.189 --> 04:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
um the EAP counselor can help you
 
04:27:25.990 --> 04:27:26.000 align:start position:0%
identify problems and make referrals to
 
04:27:28.149 --> 04:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
resources that offer appropriate
 
04:27:31.790 --> 04:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
Services treatment or help that you need
 
04:27:34.469 --> 04:27:34.479 align:start position:0%
the counselor may continue communication
 
04:27:36.710 --> 04:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
with you as you take steps to alleviate
 
04:27:36.720 --> 04:27:39.469 align:start position:0%
with you as you take steps to alleviate
the

04:27:39.469 --> 04:27:39.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:42.269 --> 04:27:42.279 align:start position:0%
problem so
 
04:27:46.990 --> 04:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
rep exactly so it's it's this is like uh
 
04:27:48.790 --> 04:27:48.800 align:start position:0%
the person who answers the phone the day
 
04:27:51.149 --> 04:27:51.159 align:start position:0%
you call is now your assigned case
 
04:27:53.109 --> 04:27:53.119 align:start position:0%
worker and they're going to keep tabs on
 
04:27:54.510 --> 04:27:54.520 align:start position:0%
you throughout the process they're going
 
04:27:59.070 --> 04:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
to put you in touch with uh you know XYZ
 
04:28:01.830 --> 04:28:01.840 align:start position:0%
sober house or whatever it is and then
 
04:28:03.590 --> 04:28:03.600 align:start position:0%
they're going to check in on you
 
04:28:05.550 --> 04:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
periodically to ensure you're you're
 
04:28:07.750 --> 04:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
getting everything you need from this
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
service that we referred you to and if
 
04:28:12.030 --> 04:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
not maybe that's not a good fit okay
 
04:28:15.149 --> 04:28:15.159 align:start position:0%
let's try this one over here that person
 
04:28:16.990 --> 04:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
that you initially reached out to and
 
04:28:20.389 --> 04:28:20.399 align:start position:0%
got in touch with is not a mental health
 
04:28:23.429 --> 04:28:23.439 align:start position:0%
counselor they're like your liaison for
 
04:28:26.349 --> 04:28:26.359 align:start position:0%
the services they're not the person
 
04:28:29.189 --> 04:28:29.199 align:start position:0%
they're putting you in touch with the
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
person thank you thank you further
 
04:28:35.990 --> 04:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
discussion rep nutting one and uh back
 
04:28:39.269 --> 04:28:39.279 align:start position:0%
to the finances again um so 211 is
 
04:28:41.109 --> 04:28:41.119 align:start position:0%
funded by the taxpayers like it goes
 
04:28:42.830 --> 04:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
through the United Way but the United
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
Way is heavily funded by local
 
04:28:51.070 --> 04:28:51.080 align:start position:0%
governments um so to take up that
 
04:28:54.990 --> 04:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
capacity with us when we have a program
 
04:28:58.510 --> 04:28:58.520 align:start position:0%
that is being offered to us
 
04:29:02.189 --> 04:29:02.199 align:start position:0%
um it can go either way um I just wanted
 
04:29:04.950 --> 04:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
to point out that again um this is about
 
04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
the cost of one session
 
04:29:11.269 --> 04:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
day um so it's not millions of
 
04:29:11.279 --> 04:29:15.950 align:start position:0%
day um so it's not millions of
dollars

04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:19.269 --> 04:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
rep I wondered whether we beating this
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
horse to death um do we have to go uh no
 
04:29:27.910 --> 04:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
we don't um so we
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%

04:32:07.429 --> 04:32:07.439 align:start position:0%
um there there are a few things that
 
04:32:10.550 --> 04:32:10.560 align:start position:0%
stick out for me that um I'm not going
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
to be able to um get
 
04:32:14.279 --> 04:32:16.590 align:start position:0%
to be able to um get
over

04:32:16.590 --> 04:32:16.600 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:32:21.710 --> 04:32:21.720 align:start position:0%
um first is that um we are not employees
 
04:32:24.309 --> 04:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
of the state and
 
04:32:27.750 --> 04:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
the um the blurring of the lines is is
 
04:32:30.429 --> 04:32:30.439 align:start position:0%
can be intentional or it can be
 
04:32:33.670 --> 04:32:33.680 align:start position:0%
anecdotal but I don't we're not we're
 
04:32:35.149 --> 04:32:35.159 align:start position:0%
not employees and I think that needs to
 
04:32:37.790 --> 04:32:37.800 align:start position:0%
be made clear and the only way that this
 
04:32:40.830 --> 04:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
um program works is if you're um
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
employed by by a qualifying employer the
 
04:32:46.149 --> 04:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
second part of this is also something
 
04:32:47.990 --> 04:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get past which is we
 
04:32:50.030 --> 04:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
are a part-time legislature we're not
 
04:32:50.040 --> 04:32:51.229 align:start position:0%
are a part-time legislature we're not
full-time

04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
04:32:54.750 --> 04:32:54.760 align:start position:0%
legislature um again mandatory for the
 
04:32:56.830 --> 04:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
requirement the reason why this bill is
 
04:32:58.149 --> 04:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
here is because we don't fit the
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
requirements they you're you're asking
 
04:33:01.830 --> 04:33:01.840 align:start position:0%
me to bend the rules to fit the
 
04:33:03.910 --> 04:33:03.920 align:start position:0%
requirements for a federal program that
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
we otherwise don't fit into
 
04:33:09.230 --> 04:33:09.240 align:start position:0%
um and I can't get around that not only
 
04:33:12.429 --> 04:33:12.439 align:start position:0%
on top of that we are bending the rules
 
04:33:16.510 --> 04:33:16.520 align:start position:0%
for us as a personal benefit this is not
 
04:33:19.109 --> 04:33:19.119 align:start position:0%
um is not a benefit for the rest of the
 
04:33:21.429 --> 04:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
state and there's nothing in this bill
 
04:33:24.551 --> 04:33:24.561 align:start position:0%
that um it's actually specifically says
 
04:33:27.429 --> 04:33:27.439 align:start position:0%
current Representatives so so we have an
 
04:33:30.349 --> 04:33:30.359 align:start position:0%
issue here where we we're potentially
 
04:33:34.390 --> 04:33:34.400 align:start position:0%
voting on uh a personal benefit which is
 
04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
um contrary to our ethical
 
04:33:39.349 --> 04:33:39.359 align:start position:0%
guidelines uh so for those reasons
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's really nothing um that I
 
04:33:45.429 --> 04:33:45.439 align:start position:0%
can see to bring forward and and and
 
04:33:47.510 --> 04:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
amending that I can get behind so
 
04:33:50.269 --> 04:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm I view it as inexpedient
 
04:33:50.279 --> 04:33:51.230 align:start position:0%
therefore I'm I view it as inexpedient
to

04:33:51.230 --> 04:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:33:55.470 --> 04:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
legislate thank you rep cell for the
 
04:33:59.070 --> 04:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
discussion rep nutting Wong again me
 
04:34:01.869 --> 04:34:01.879 align:start position:0%
with money
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
um this bill um would just allow
 
04:34:08.269 --> 04:34:08.279 align:start position:0%
um us to you know check a box saying
 
04:34:10.789 --> 04:34:10.799 align:start position:0%
that we performed public service to
 
04:34:14.029 --> 04:34:14.039 align:start position:0%
cancel out student debt um and like I
 
04:34:16.349 --> 04:34:16.359 align:start position:0%
think that's a great idea because a we
 
04:34:18.189 --> 04:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
are performing a public service I think
 
04:34:19.670 --> 04:34:19.680 align:start position:0%
it will get more people to run for
 
04:34:23.230 --> 04:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
office it costs us no money um in fact
 
04:34:24.789 --> 04:34:24.799 align:start position:0%
would get us money back from the federal
 
04:34:26.269 --> 04:34:26.279 align:start position:0%
government even though technically they
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
just cancel it so didn't really
 
04:34:33.789 --> 04:34:33.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:36.429 --> 04:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's a great program that
 
04:34:38.470 --> 04:34:38.480 align:start position:0%
like we should be recognizing that we do
 
04:34:40.830 --> 04:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
provide a huge value to the state and um
 
04:34:43.629 --> 04:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
to the government um as state reps and
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
uh we should uh be able to recognize
 
04:34:51.830 --> 04:34:51.840 align:start position:0%
that and to provide that as a benefit um
 
04:34:56.510 --> 04:34:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.869 --> 04:34:59.879 align:start position:0%
reps thank you um I will point out it's
 
04:35:03.910 --> 04:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
not just checking a box um it's having
 
04:35:06.070 --> 04:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
someone certify
 
04:35:07.869 --> 04:35:07.879 align:start position:0%
that a
 
04:35:11.750 --> 04:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
legislator Works 30 hours a week and is
 
04:35:15.150 --> 04:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
and that the the employer is
 
04:35:17.789 --> 04:35:17.799 align:start position:0%
qualified um so it's more than just
 
04:35:20.189 --> 04:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
checking it's certification under
 
04:35:29.990 --> 04:35:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:34.789 --> 04:35:34.799 align:start position:0%
believe repres just as a followup um Mr
 
04:35:34.799 --> 04:35:35.830 align:start position:0%
believe repres just as a followup um Mr
chair

04:35:35.830 --> 04:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:35:35.840 --> 04:35:38.269 align:start position:0%
chair
Hill

04:35:38.269 --> 04:35:38.279 align:start position:0%
Hill
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
um we heard testimony from the
 
04:35:48.070 --> 04:35:48.080 align:start position:0%
clerk that his that office would do that
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
is that correct because now my memory is
 
04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
a little
 
04:35:56.109 --> 04:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
fuzzy do we need those notes again so
 
04:36:00.349 --> 04:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
there were two things that um our clerk
 
04:36:03.070 --> 04:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned one is that he is
 
04:36:06.949 --> 04:36:06.959 align:start position:0%
basically certifying that we were
 
04:36:09.750 --> 04:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
legislators during that time
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
period he is not certifying that we work
 
04:36:21.670 --> 04:36:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:24.510 --> 04:36:24.520 align:start position:0%
qualified um the in in the bill it's a
 
04:36:26.629 --> 04:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
commissioner and um he had just stated
 
04:36:29.390 --> 04:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
that he could do it but it's you could
 
04:36:31.789 --> 04:36:31.799 align:start position:0%
amend it that he could do it but it's
 
04:36:34.910 --> 04:36:34.920 align:start position:0%
under a commissioner not under him that
 
04:36:36.551 --> 04:36:36.561 align:start position:0%
was was the other the second part that
 
04:36:41.750 --> 04:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
he had said um yeah he didn't um other
 
04:36:44.750 --> 04:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
states apparently do everything um
 
04:36:47.029 --> 04:36:47.039 align:start position:0%
through the clerk because it is a clerk
 
04:36:51.070 --> 04:36:51.080 align:start position:0%
function rather than yep rep
 
04:36:53.869 --> 04:36:53.879 align:start position:0%
TIY when you when it's said that no
 
04:36:56.750 --> 04:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
money changes hands well that's not
 
04:37:00.269 --> 04:37:00.279 align:start position:0%
exactly true any student loans that get
 
04:37:03.551 --> 04:37:03.561 align:start position:0%
forgiven that money is considered income
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.070 --> 04:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
government rep M
 
04:37:13.869 --> 04:37:13.879 align:start position:0%
Carter also a a point of note that um a
 
04:37:16.869 --> 04:37:16.879 align:start position:0%
debt is never forgiven somebody pays a
 
04:37:19.109 --> 04:37:19.119 align:start position:0%
debt whether it's the dead or or the
 
04:37:21.510 --> 04:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
dead e that debt always gets paid by
 
04:37:23.990 --> 04:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
somebody it just might not be the person
 
04:37:28.470 --> 04:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:31.189 --> 04:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
it further
 
04:37:33.709 --> 04:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
discussion so there's also the
 
04:37:35.590 --> 04:37:35.600 align:start position:0%
additional question and
 
04:37:38.070 --> 04:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
this will really murky the waters I
 
04:37:38.080 --> 04:37:39.230 align:start position:0%
this will really murky the waters I
think

04:37:39.230 --> 04:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
think
 
04:37:41.590 --> 04:37:41.600 align:start position:0%
um so there's
 
04:37:45.750 --> 04:37:45.760 align:start position:0%
some train of thought that um that where
 
04:37:48.029 --> 04:37:48.039 align:start position:0%
this would be a benefit
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
that um wouldn't be
 
04:37:54.551 --> 04:37:54.561 align:start position:0%
broadly accepted by anyone else in the
 
04:37:58.070 --> 04:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
in the public this would not um there
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
may even be someone willing to submit a
 
04:38:05.670 --> 04:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
request to the Ethics Committee to find
 
04:38:10.750 --> 04:38:10.760 align:start position:0%
out whether this benefit would um fall
 
04:38:14.990 --> 04:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
under the category of um in excess of
 
04:38:17.990 --> 04:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
what our gifts and honorarium might be I
 
04:38:21.230 --> 04:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
don't know um but I do know that it may
 
04:38:24.830 --> 04:38:24.840 align:start position:0%
be a question that we would want to have
 
04:38:27.869 --> 04:38:27.879 align:start position:0%
um the Ethics Committee who we have a
 
04:38:30.910 --> 04:38:30.920 align:start position:0%
member of in the audience here at the
 
04:38:34.390 --> 04:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
moment um that it may be something that
 
04:38:36.070 --> 04:38:36.080 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee wants to look at I
 
04:38:36.080 --> 04:38:36.990 align:start position:0%
the ethics committee wants to look at I
don't

04:38:36.990 --> 04:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:38:40.429 --> 04:38:40.439 align:start position:0%
know chman um I I was looking through
 
04:38:43.150 --> 04:38:43.160 align:start position:0%
the ethics guidelines and that we all
 
04:38:46.349 --> 04:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
have those in the books and um it's not
 
04:38:48.709 --> 04:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
clear to me and the Ethics Committee
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
would need to meet and discuss this
 
04:38:56.189 --> 04:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
yeah all all I bring it up is it's an
 
04:38:59.670 --> 04:38:59.680 align:start position:0%
added unknown I guess at this point for
 
04:39:01.629 --> 04:39:01.639 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
but oh I was just going to add that um
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
the program is they have to be in
 
04:39:09.269 --> 04:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
service for 10 years um and it doesn't
 
04:39:11.349 --> 04:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
need to be 10 years at one place so it
 
04:39:13.189 --> 04:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
would also just be certifying maybe that
 
04:39:16.189 --> 04:39:16.199 align:start position:0%
like we were only here for a year or
 
04:39:18.029 --> 04:39:18.039 align:start position:0%
something like that which would be less
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
than so I I can see how it can be
 
04:39:24.109 --> 04:39:24.119 align:start position:0%
murkier as well oh I think it can be
 
04:39:27.429 --> 04:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
murky as you want it to be um but it but
 
04:39:29.230 --> 04:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
it's um it's
 
04:39:33.590 --> 04:39:33.600 align:start position:0%
definitely um not as cut and dried as
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
some would have some would say and and
 
04:39:40.470 --> 04:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
the um it does come down to two things I
 
04:39:43.510 --> 04:39:43.520 align:start position:0%
think one is that
 
04:39:48.150 --> 04:39:48.160 align:start position:0%
certification um of whether you would be
 
04:39:49.990 --> 04:39:50.000 align:start position:0%
able to prove or I would be able to
 
04:39:54.270 --> 04:39:54.280 align:start position:0%
prove if we had um work been in a state
 
04:39:57.270 --> 04:39:57.280 align:start position:0%
rep for a period of time that during
 
04:40:01.910 --> 04:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
that time we can certify and prove that
 
04:40:06.510 --> 04:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
we have worked 30 hours um per week
 
04:40:06.520 --> 04:40:08.110 align:start position:0%
we have worked 30 hours um per week
fulltime

04:40:08.110 --> 04:40:08.120 align:start position:0%
fulltime
 
04:40:10.868 --> 04:40:10.878 align:start position:0%
um I think is a high hurdle that any of
 
04:40:13.030 --> 04:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
us I don't I'm not sure I could prove
 
04:40:15.110 --> 04:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
that I work I'm sure I couldn't prove
 
04:40:17.708 --> 04:40:17.718 align:start position:0%
that I work 30 hours some weeks I work
 
04:40:19.910 --> 04:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
something different and some weeks I
 
04:40:22.830 --> 04:40:22.840 align:start position:0%
don't but it is I think it's a
 
04:40:26.628 --> 04:40:26.638 align:start position:0%
impossible thing to actually say with
 
04:40:29.350 --> 04:40:29.360 align:start position:0%
certainty that you work 30 hours or
 
04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
more but for some of us it'd be
 
04:40:33.718 --> 04:40:35.470 align:start position:0%
more but for some of us it'd be
easier

04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
easier
 
04:40:37.628 --> 04:40:37.638 align:start position:0%
um further
 
04:40:39.910 --> 04:40:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
04:40:42.310 --> 04:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
none I will ask the clerk to call the
 
04:40:42.320 --> 04:40:43.750 align:start position:0%
none I will ask the clerk to call the

04:43:22.550 --> 04:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
Bill no you're good thank you though um
 
04:43:26.430 --> 04:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
rep cell moves um itl uh is there a
 
04:43:30.788 --> 04:43:30.798 align:start position:0%
second hi second rep Richard
 
04:43:33.150 --> 04:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
seconds uh rep Cel would you like to
 
04:43:35.708 --> 04:43:35.718 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion uh yes Mr chair
 
04:43:38.110 --> 04:43:38.120 align:start position:0%
just briefly um that would be
 
04:43:43.470 --> 04:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
appreciated yeah um though you know
 
04:43:47.190 --> 04:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's members actually in this year uh
 
04:43:49.830 --> 04:43:49.840 align:start position:0%
I heard of both both parties uh being
 
04:43:52.830 --> 04:43:52.840 align:start position:0%
fired over their legislative activity so
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
this is not something that um you know
 
04:43:58.628 --> 04:43:58.638 align:start position:0%
we take lightly but U given that this to
 
04:44:01.110 --> 04:44:01.120 align:start position:0%
me this bill is unconstitutional uh
 
04:44:04.590 --> 04:44:04.600 align:start position:0%
first off I don't think this is the role
 
04:44:06.868 --> 04:44:06.878 align:start position:0%
uh proper role for for what the the
 
04:44:11.310 --> 04:44:11.320 align:start position:0%
state can can force an employer to do um
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
and even getting into the weeds of it
 
04:44:16.750 --> 04:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
there just seems to be so many more
 
04:44:18.948 --> 04:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
questions on the Nuance of it because it
 
04:44:23.150 --> 04:44:23.160 align:start position:0%
says um not discharged um for house
 
04:44:25.948 --> 04:44:25.958 align:start position:0%
session but um you know what if that
 
04:44:27.070 --> 04:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
wasn't the reason why you're getting
 
04:44:29.310 --> 04:44:29.320 align:start position:0%
fired but that's what you claim you know
 
04:44:30.550 --> 04:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
there there's going to be an issue where
 
04:44:34.708 --> 04:44:34.718 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't you know it'd be a um an
 
04:44:38.470 --> 04:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
argument over who said what um and for
 
04:44:41.190 --> 04:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
that and a few other reasons I I find
 
04:44:44.830 --> 04:44:44.840 align:start position:0%
this inexpedient to legislate Mr
 
04:44:49.670 --> 04:44:49.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh rep sorry yes hi I just wanted
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
to ask a clarifying question of rep
 
04:44:55.708 --> 04:44:55.718 align:start position:0%
Constable you you stated that it's
 
04:44:58.550 --> 04:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional can you explain exactly
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
how it's unconstitutional beat me to
 
04:45:05.910 --> 04:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
04:45:09.550 --> 04:45:09.560 align:start position:0%
the uh there's certain things that the
 
04:45:15.310 --> 04:45:15.320 align:start position:0%
legislature can can can do um there's
 
04:45:19.948 --> 04:45:19.958 align:start position:0%
also uh in terms of private um employers
 
04:45:22.550 --> 04:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
there's to me is to to be able to say
 
04:45:25.350 --> 04:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
that uh a select few people cannot be
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
discharged after an employment uh is
 
04:45:31.868 --> 04:45:31.878 align:start position:0%
beyond what we have the authority to do
 
04:45:33.948 --> 04:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
so I I would say where is where are we
 
04:45:35.788 --> 04:45:35.798 align:start position:0%
allowed to do it I would put it back
 
04:45:38.190 --> 04:45:38.200 align:start position:0%
where where where do you find the power
 
04:45:40.350 --> 04:45:40.360 align:start position:0%
to be able to prevent somebody from
 
04:45:43.470 --> 04:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
being fired from a private um
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
Enterprise um it seems like that is a
 
04:45:49.150 --> 04:45:49.160 align:start position:0%
direct we're getting directly involved
 
04:45:55.110 --> 04:45:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:58.470 --> 04:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
company she's biting her tongue I gotta
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
rep pay go ahead so I would I'm going to
 
04:46:04.628 --> 04:46:04.638 align:start position:0%
continue to challenge you on on your
 
04:46:06.190 --> 04:46:06.200 align:start position:0%
statement that it's unconstitutional
 
04:46:11.910 --> 04:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
because this this um bill is very
 
04:46:14.430 --> 04:46:14.440 align:start position:0%
similar to FMLA protection which is
 
04:46:17.628 --> 04:46:17.638 align:start position:0%
already on the books and is considered
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
lawful and with employers and whatnot so
 
04:46:23.230 --> 04:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
it's job protection it doesn't mean that
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
the employer has to pay you it just
 
04:46:27.590 --> 04:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
means that your job is protected if
 
04:46:29.948 --> 04:46:29.958 align:start position:0%
you're serving in the legislature so I I
 
04:46:32.830 --> 04:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
just challenge the verbage of constit
 
04:46:34.390 --> 04:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional that just does doesn't
 
04:46:35.628 --> 04:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
sit right with me so I just want him to
 
04:46:36.670 --> 04:46:36.680 align:start position:0%
put that in the
 
04:46:40.110 --> 04:46:40.120 align:start position:0%
notes um before you go back and forth
 
04:46:41.750 --> 04:46:41.760 align:start position:0%
this guy's been raising his hand three
 
04:46:45.190 --> 04:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
or four times um we'll go here repti it
 
04:46:46.230 --> 04:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
is not
 
04:46:48.548 --> 04:46:48.558 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional it is perfectly
 
04:46:51.670 --> 04:46:51.680 align:start position:0%
constitutional there is two entities
 
04:46:54.310 --> 04:46:54.320 align:start position:0%
already that we have the power to do
 
04:46:58.190 --> 04:46:58.200 align:start position:0%
this for and that is the National Guard
 
04:46:59.070 --> 04:46:59.080 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:47:01.510 --> 04:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
reserves they can be called up and they
 
04:47:04.708 --> 04:47:04.718 align:start position:0%
may not be fired from their job at all
 
04:47:07.670 --> 04:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
for no matter how long that uh per call
 
04:47:10.470 --> 04:47:10.480 align:start position:0%
up period is Right possible the other
 
04:47:12.430 --> 04:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
one so what you guys are missing here is
 
04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
that none of those people get to vote
 
04:47:16.868 --> 04:47:16.878 align:start position:0%
for themselves that benefit the
 
04:47:19.110 --> 04:47:19.120 align:start position:0%
difference here is that we are voting
 
04:47:22.548 --> 04:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
for that benefit for ourselves we do not
 
04:47:25.390 --> 04:47:25.400 align:start position:0%
have the authority to do that so that
 
04:47:33.070 --> 04:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:33.080 --> 04:47:35.310 align:start position:0%
 
here

04:47:35.310 --> 04:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
so I will um add to the mix here
 
04:47:44.470 --> 04:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
um it wasn't brought up although there
 
04:47:47.230 --> 04:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
were questions that were asked um about
 
04:47:47.240 --> 04:47:49.110 align:start position:0%
were questions that were asked um about
whether

04:47:49.110 --> 04:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
whether
 
04:47:53.390 --> 04:47:53.400 align:start position:0%
um it would be possible for the and it's
 
04:47:55.788 --> 04:47:55.798 align:start position:0%
not written in the language of the bill
 
04:47:58.110 --> 04:47:58.120 align:start position:0%
whether it would be possible for the
 
04:47:58.120 --> 04:47:59.670 align:start position:0%
whether it would be possible for the
employer

04:47:59.670 --> 04:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:48:01.628 --> 04:48:01.638 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
04:48:04.548 --> 04:48:04.558 align:start position:0%
reassign um or
 
04:48:07.750 --> 04:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
demote or do anything other than that
 
04:48:10.708 --> 04:48:10.718 align:start position:0%
it's that part's not written in and and
 
04:48:16.590 --> 04:48:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:19.230 --> 04:48:19.240 align:start position:0%
fmli I'm pretty sure that it was a lot
 
04:48:20.910 --> 04:48:20.920 align:start position:0%
thicker than the bill that we're looking
 
04:48:23.230 --> 04:48:23.240 align:start position:0%
at here as far as all of the places that
 
04:48:24.628 --> 04:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
you could the things that you could do
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
and the things you can't do um but
 
04:48:30.350 --> 04:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
having said that I'm not
 
04:48:30.360 --> 04:48:32.230 align:start position:0%
having said that I'm not
sure

04:48:32.230 --> 04:48:32.240 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:48:37.070 --> 04:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
the how feasible it would be um in a
 
04:48:40.190 --> 04:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
couple of different areas um we we tried
 
04:48:43.548 --> 04:48:43.558 align:start position:0%
to talk to if some I forget who asked
 
04:48:46.390 --> 04:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
the question but we tried to talk about
 
04:48:48.110 --> 04:48:48.120 align:start position:0%
um the number of employees if there was
 
04:48:49.868 --> 04:48:49.878 align:start position:0%
an employer that had a thousand
 
04:48:51.590 --> 04:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
employees it's a lot different than an
 
04:48:55.470 --> 04:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
employer that has three employees um
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
it's also a lot
 
04:48:59.910 --> 04:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
different with someone that is hired
 
04:49:02.070 --> 04:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
when they were in the National Guard um
 
04:49:04.230 --> 04:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
versus running for office I think think
 
04:49:07.628 --> 04:49:07.638 align:start position:0%
that's somewhat valid um it's also
 
04:49:10.150 --> 04:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
different than jury duty BEC because
 
04:49:12.708 --> 04:49:12.718 align:start position:0%
you're Cho you're picked for jury duty
 
04:49:17.910 --> 04:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
without um anyone's say so um there's a
 
04:49:20.510 --> 04:49:20.520 align:start position:0%
lot of things in here that fit in that
 
04:49:24.510 --> 04:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
gray area um there's even um employers
 
04:49:27.628 --> 04:49:27.638 align:start position:0%
that aren't New Hampshire based um and
 
04:49:30.548 --> 04:49:30.558 align:start position:0%
how they would uh handle something like
 
04:49:34.670 --> 04:49:34.680 align:start position:0%
this so I I
 
04:49:39.990 --> 04:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
I think while the intention may be good
 
04:49:43.270 --> 04:49:43.280 align:start position:0%
um I think it's more I think it's one of
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
those situations that's better left
 
04:49:49.350 --> 04:49:49.360 align:start position:0%
between the employer and the employee in
 
04:49:52.510 --> 04:49:52.520 align:start position:0%
negotiation um I would like to see it
 
04:49:56.150 --> 04:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
even prior to the employee running for
 
04:50:00.230 --> 04:50:00.240 align:start position:0%
office quite frankly um but um but for
 
04:50:02.230 --> 04:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
those reasons and others I will be
 
04:50:05.670 --> 04:50:05.680 align:start position:0%
supporting the itl motion
 
04:50:08.310 --> 04:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
is there any further
 
04:50:11.310 --> 04:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
discussion yes rep yes from what I
 
04:50:13.430 --> 04:50:13.440 align:start position:0%
understood you can also the policeman
 
04:50:14.670 --> 04:50:14.680 align:start position:0%
can come to your house and get the
 
04:50:17.230 --> 04:50:17.240 align:start position:0%
legislator and bring them right to the
 
04:50:17.240 --> 04:50:22.470 align:start position:0%
legislator and bring them right to the
voting

04:50:22.470 --> 04:50:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:24.910 --> 04:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
session can you can you elaborate on
 
04:50:27.430 --> 04:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:30.190 --> 04:50:30.200 align:start position:0%
me the police or the sheriff if if it
 
04:50:32.708 --> 04:50:32.718 align:start position:0%
needed to be done it could be gone to
 
04:50:36.708 --> 04:50:36.718 align:start position:0%
your house and escort you to voting
 
04:50:39.230 --> 04:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
oh I think I understand now you're
 
04:50:41.788 --> 04:50:41.798 align:start position:0%
saying that if you're a State Rep yes if
 
04:50:43.868 --> 04:50:43.878 align:start position:0%
you're State Rep and you've been elected
 
04:50:46.390 --> 04:50:46.400 align:start position:0%
you Vol you voluntarily signed up to be
 
04:50:51.430 --> 04:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
a state State Rep you won um the the
 
04:50:54.230 --> 04:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
speaker can um
 
04:50:57.150 --> 04:50:57.160 align:start position:0%
direct the police to go and bring you in
 
04:50:58.910 --> 04:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
if there's a quorum issue or something
 
04:51:02.590 --> 04:51:02.600 align:start position:0%
like that um true as far as I'm
 
04:51:08.110 --> 04:51:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:08.120 --> 04:51:09.670 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:51:09.670 --> 04:51:09.680 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:51:12.628 --> 04:51:12.638 align:start position:0%
I'm yeah I'm not sure where
 
04:51:15.948 --> 04:51:15.958 align:start position:0%
that fits as far as
 
04:51:20.430 --> 04:51:20.440 align:start position:0%
the um language of the bill though um
 
04:51:23.150 --> 04:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
you can't be fired from it but you're
 
04:51:27.390 --> 04:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
saying that you could um be forcibly
 
04:51:29.830 --> 04:51:29.840 align:start position:0%
removed from your
 
04:51:34.590 --> 04:51:34.600 align:start position:0%
business well but that's not um that's
 
04:51:37.990 --> 04:51:38.000 align:start position:0%
are you comparing that in terms of the
 
04:51:42.750 --> 04:51:42.760 align:start position:0%
um the situation for jury duty or what
 
04:51:45.750 --> 04:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
are you I guess I'm not sure where what
 
04:51:49.910 --> 04:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
you're saying that that piece of
 
04:51:51.910 --> 04:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
information that's just what I
 
04:51:54.350 --> 04:51:54.360 align:start position:0%
understood that it could be happened
 
04:51:56.948 --> 04:51:56.958 align:start position:0%
could be done to have a quum right I
 
04:51:59.110 --> 04:51:59.120 align:start position:0%
mean that's after you already been
 
04:52:02.150 --> 04:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
elected right and of course they
 
04:52:04.350 --> 04:52:04.360 align:start position:0%
probably I would hope they don't fire
 
04:52:06.110 --> 04:52:06.120 align:start position:0%
you for that cuz they took you away is
 
04:52:07.628 --> 04:52:07.638 align:start position:0%
that what you're thinking though that
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
this bill protects
 
04:52:14.510 --> 04:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
that no it would just make it so it
 
04:52:17.470 --> 04:52:17.480 align:start position:0%
could happen but I mean if you if you
 
04:52:19.390 --> 04:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
went to session and then it created a
 
04:52:21.868 --> 04:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
problem and you got fired this bill
 
04:52:24.628 --> 04:52:24.638 align:start position:0%
would help out somehow
 
04:52:26.830 --> 04:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
okay just kind of a statement rep wall
 
04:52:28.510 --> 04:52:28.520 align:start position:0%
do you know of any time when they've
 
04:52:31.788 --> 04:52:31.798 align:start position:0%
ever sent police to bring people back I
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
remember once that they were across the
 
04:52:37.230 --> 04:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
the street at a different loc oh were
 
04:52:42.590 --> 04:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
you he was one I remember that oh yes
 
04:52:46.708 --> 04:52:46.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:48.830 --> 04:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
notorious yeah they they've locked the
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
doors I mean that's happened multiple
 
04:52:52.590 --> 04:52:52.600 align:start position:0%
times right I I
 
04:52:55.470 --> 04:52:55.480 align:start position:0%
guess you I don't remember anybody the
 
04:52:59.350 --> 04:52:59.360 align:start position:0%
state police being sent to a house were
 
04:53:02.190 --> 04:53:02.200 align:start position:0%
is that they were to the best of my
 
04:53:03.788 --> 04:53:03.798 align:start position:0%
knowledge they've never gone to people
 
04:53:05.708 --> 04:53:05.718 align:start position:0%
homes but that's there were a couple
 
04:53:08.548 --> 04:53:08.558 align:start position:0%
times when they did go across the street
 
04:53:11.190 --> 04:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
they locked us in we were locked in
 
04:53:13.868 --> 04:53:13.878 align:start position:0%
right we need to get back to the bill
 
04:53:16.350 --> 04:53:16.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I I all of that this is really fun
 
04:53:18.230 --> 04:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
but it's not get back to the bill it's
 
04:53:19.868 --> 04:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
got nothing to do with the
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%

04:55:38.628 --> 04:55:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
all that without that um rep alers would
 
04:55:45.510 --> 04:55:45.520 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your motion uh
 
04:55:48.948 --> 04:55:48.958 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh just that um what
 
04:55:50.628 --> 04:55:50.638 align:start position:0%
have to do a flag for everybody that's
 
04:55:54.030 --> 04:55:54.040 align:start position:0%
the concern flag pools are only so tall
 
04:55:56.470 --> 04:55:56.480 align:start position:0%
so thinking about half Mass you know
 
04:55:58.270 --> 04:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
what happens when the lower flags that
 
04:56:00.310 --> 04:56:00.320 align:start position:0%
are lower are they hanging on the ground
 
04:56:04.788 --> 04:56:04.798 align:start position:0%
at that point and stuff and um
 
04:56:06.830 --> 04:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
you know we we just I don't like to see
 
04:56:09.270 --> 04:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
one-offs I mean if you do it for one one
 
04:56:10.750 --> 04:56:10.760 align:start position:0%
group you may have to do it or you
 
04:56:13.350 --> 04:56:13.360 align:start position:0%
should be doing it for every group so
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
that's what that's why I'm I I'm
 
04:56:18.190 --> 04:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
suggesting itl not suggesting voting
 
04:56:21.270 --> 04:56:21.280 align:start position:0%
itl thank you rep sers uh rep PA would
 
04:56:23.310 --> 04:56:23.320 align:start position:0%
you like to speak to your second thank
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um mental health is a
 
04:56:28.310 --> 04:56:28.320 align:start position:0%
very big issue right now it's a very
 
04:56:30.750 --> 04:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
important issue the flag is very
 
04:56:33.948 --> 04:56:33.958 align:start position:0%
important to me the flag represents that
 
04:56:35.788 --> 04:56:35.798 align:start position:0%
we're supporting getting mental health
 
04:56:38.470 --> 04:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
care for people I believe the flag would
 
04:56:40.670 --> 04:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
be best shown at places like the state
 
04:56:43.990 --> 04:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
hospital like places where people can re
 
04:56:46.070 --> 04:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
receive counseling psychiatric help
 
04:56:49.150 --> 04:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
psychological help hospitals in general
 
04:56:50.910 --> 04:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I think that's where it would be most
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
noticeable and be like advertising we're
 
04:56:56.270 --> 04:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
here to help you that's the way I look
 
04:56:59.910 --> 04:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
at this particular flag um I don't see
 
04:57:02.590 --> 04:57:02.600 align:start position:0%
where flying at the State House is going
 
04:57:05.510 --> 04:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
to draw enough attention to the issue to
 
04:57:07.350 --> 04:57:07.360 align:start position:0%
really help the people who need it I'd
 
04:57:09.390 --> 04:57:09.400 align:start position:0%
rather see it out there where as I said
 
04:57:12.350 --> 04:57:12.360 align:start position:0%
where people can go for help thank you
 
04:57:15.990 --> 04:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you um I would like to say in
 
04:57:19.110 --> 04:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
addition to the mental health hospital
 
04:57:21.548 --> 04:57:21.558 align:start position:0%
but I would think a perfect spot and it
 
04:57:23.470 --> 04:57:23.480 align:start position:0%
and it would be within your purview on
 
04:57:26.150 --> 04:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
the Historical Society historical
 
04:57:29.110 --> 04:57:29.120 align:start position:0%
committee um the two flag poles on
 
04:57:32.430 --> 04:57:32.440 align:start position:0%
either side of Governor wet statute out
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
there um actually Mr chairman I had
 
04:57:37.150 --> 04:57:37.160 align:start position:0%
wondered when that was going to happen
 
04:57:39.830 --> 04:57:39.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't got fly Poes there yet but I
 
04:57:41.070 --> 04:57:41.080 align:start position:0%
actually thought that would be an
 
04:57:43.110 --> 04:57:43.120 align:start position:0%
appropriate place to have it if we have
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
it on state property and we all know why
 
04:57:46.400 --> 04:57:47.390 align:start position:0%
it on state property and we all know why
I

04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:57:51.910 --> 04:57:51.920 align:start position:0%
presume yeah thank you yeah I agree I I
 
04:57:53.628 --> 04:57:53.638 align:start position:0%
think everyone should know the governor
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
wet story um all you have to do is speak
 
04:58:01.470 --> 04:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
to all all you have to do is uh speak to
 
04:58:03.510 --> 04:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
the person who gives the tour who came
 
04:58:06.150 --> 04:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
in for the testimony or go on one of her
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
one of her tours as well so um I think
 
04:58:11.948 --> 04:58:11.958 align:start position:0%
that that is a place we should encourage
 
04:58:14.230 --> 04:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
further discussion for this and
 
04:58:16.190 --> 04:58:16.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing that up Mr shair
 
04:58:20.948 --> 04:58:20.958 align:start position:0%
or um speaker of arus chlif will explain
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
the story to you anytime you'd like um
 
04:58:27.430 --> 04:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
there is also another point I think
 
04:58:33.150 --> 04:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
aside from aside from the flag um but
 
04:58:35.510 --> 04:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
the people that were here and spoke
 
04:58:38.910 --> 04:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
eloquently to it left buttons on the end
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
of the table um to me and maybe it's
 
04:58:46.670 --> 04:58:46.680 align:start position:0%
just my personal view um that would be a
 
04:58:49.190 --> 04:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
much more powerful way of
 
04:58:52.310 --> 04:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
getting the the recognition that they're
 
04:58:55.708 --> 04:58:55.718 align:start position:0%
seeking um to me than this and I do
 
04:58:58.190 --> 04:58:58.200 align:start position:0%
agree um with rep PA that this is an
 
04:59:00.190 --> 04:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
important issue and and does need the
 
04:59:02.430 --> 04:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
recognition I just don't think this is
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
it but um but if anyone has one of those
 
04:59:07.708 --> 04:59:07.718 align:start position:0%
buttons I think that's a great way to do
 
04:59:10.470 --> 04:59:10.480 align:start position:0%
it and I would encourage those to be uh
 
04:59:14.590 --> 04:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
handed out um further discussion or I'll
 
04:59:17.750 --> 04:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:17.760 --> 04:59:21.310 align:start position:0%

January 1st 2027 and I know that sounds
 
05:03:22.548 --> 05:03:22.558 align:start position:0%
far away but um it will give the
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office time to
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:31.680 --> 05:03:36.868 align:start position:0%
 
online

05:03:36.868 --> 05:03:36.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:38.470 --> 05:03:38.480 align:start position:0%
I'll add a couple of
 
05:03:43.548 --> 05:03:43.558 align:start position:0%
things um one is the Secretary of State
 
05:03:47.470 --> 05:03:47.480 align:start position:0%
um office didn't have and and has this
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
on their list of things to do um but the
 
05:03:53.948 --> 05:03:53.958 align:start position:0%
election getting a lot of the election
 
05:03:59.470 --> 05:03:59.480 align:start position:0%
law things online and and um realigned
 
05:04:01.310 --> 05:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
um to be done
 
05:04:04.230 --> 05:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
electronically uh took a higher priority
 
05:04:08.708 --> 05:04:08.718 align:start position:0%
so they came and asked us for um we we
 
05:04:13.030 --> 05:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
showed them the prime sponsors request
 
05:04:16.910 --> 05:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
um in total including the bill language
 
05:04:21.190 --> 05:04:21.200 align:start position:0%
um and they indicated without so many
 
05:04:24.708 --> 05:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
words that the um that some of that was
 
05:04:27.190 --> 05:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
language was was information that's
 
05:04:29.390 --> 05:04:29.400 align:start position:0%
already requested although they did
 
05:04:31.590 --> 05:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
admit that it may be difficult to weed
 
05:04:35.670 --> 05:04:35.680 align:start position:0%
through and to to dis um dissimilate and
 
05:04:40.070 --> 05:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
and reassemble because it is um in some
 
05:04:43.708 --> 05:04:43.718 align:start position:0%
cases handwritten and it is out of form
 
05:04:48.670 --> 05:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
um a uniform form so they took a look at
 
05:04:51.270 --> 05:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
what the prime sponsor gave us in an
 
05:04:56.310 --> 05:04:56.320 align:start position:0%
amendment to um to create this online or
 
05:05:00.110 --> 05:05:00.120 align:start position:0%
or put it online and in a uniform form
 
05:05:02.868 --> 05:05:02.878 align:start position:0%
and they added to that the fact fact
 
05:05:07.948 --> 05:05:07.958 align:start position:0%
that um um it would be necessary for for
 
05:05:11.548 --> 05:05:11.558 align:start position:0%
lobbyists to be able to file um
 
05:05:14.830 --> 05:05:14.840 align:start position:0%
electronically their their just plain
 
05:05:18.868 --> 05:05:18.878 align:start position:0%
registration to be a lobbyist so um with
 
05:05:21.868 --> 05:05:21.878 align:start position:0%
that they suggested that we do this in
 
05:05:25.750 --> 05:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
stages one is um I'll get there one is
 
05:05:29.070 --> 05:05:29.080 align:start position:0%
to um put this all online and then if
 
05:05:32.070 --> 05:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
there are other additional pieces of
 
05:05:35.510 --> 05:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
information that are being requested um
 
05:05:36.948 --> 05:05:36.958 align:start position:0%
do that in a separate piece of
 
05:05:41.230 --> 05:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
legislation so with that um rep wall
 
05:05:43.150 --> 05:05:43.160 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman just a
 
05:05:46.190 --> 05:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
reminder that people who checked in um
 
05:05:48.670 --> 05:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
online all supported this there were I
 
05:05:52.230 --> 05:05:52.240 align:start position:0%
think 6 one two three people who support
 
05:05:52.240 --> 05:05:52.990 align:start position:0%
think 6 one two three people who support
this

05:05:52.990 --> 05:05:53.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:05:56.310 --> 05:05:56.320 align:start position:0%
bill and it's a good thing uh I think
