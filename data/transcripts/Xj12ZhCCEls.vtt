the Department of Health and Human
 
00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 align:start position:0%
Services and I got the big chair I know
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
and I'm Chris santinello I'm also an
 
00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:19.759 align:start position:0%
associate commissioner so thank you for
 
00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 align:start position:0%
having us today yes you want to start
 
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 align:start position:0%
sure I'll get us started um I think John
 
00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
gave you a little PowerPoint such as
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
that we actually wanted to talk a little
 
00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 align:start position:0%
bit about a problem yes it is um about a
 
00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 align:start position:0%
problem um area for both of our
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
respective staff that Trish and I both
 
00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
have um and that would be the staff of
 
00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 align:start position:0%
the Bureau of Developmental Services
 
00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:49.759 align:start position:0%
DCF um primarily and um it was a problem
 
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.160 align:start position:0%
area for both of our staff teams and we
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
really want to talk a little bit about
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
how they work together um to solve it to
 
00:05:58.870 --> 00:05:58.880 align:start position:0%
improve quality for the customer
 
00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.189 align:start position:0%
improve quality for the customer
experience

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 align:start position:0%
um and transition to The Adult Services
 
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
System um from DCF shouldn't be a
 
00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
surprise right because it's based most
 
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
of the times on an age whether you're 22
 
00:06:17.309 --> 00:06:17.319 align:start position:0%
21 18 it doesn't just happen overnight
 
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:20.280 align:start position:0%
um but yet our teams were struggling
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
with that whole process and so um it
 
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 align:start position:0%
really wasn't viewed externally because
 
00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
they would scramble they would get it
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
done but it really wasn't done in the
 
00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
smoothest of ways um and it really
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't best practice or sustainable so
 
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
luckily Trisha and I work really well
 
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
together and when our teams came to us
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
and said this isn't working we want to
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
make it better um we sat down with them
 
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:47.440 align:start position:0%
and really talked about the problem and
 
00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
they were eager to work together but
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
neither team had the capacity to pull it
 
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
together and so um we sat down they
 
00:06:58.309 --> 00:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
actually identified that we also need to
 
00:07:00.469 --> 00:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
bring in the Bureau of assistants
 
00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
because they handle eligibility and so
 
00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:05.360 align:start position:0%
because we have a few big tables at the
 
00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:08.199 align:start position:0%
department everybody sat down together
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
and really what helped was bringing
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
everybody together into one room and
 
00:07:16.869 --> 00:07:16.879 align:start position:0%
using a Kaizen event um we're able to
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
identify currently what are we
 
00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:23.000 align:start position:0%
doing what do we what are our shared
 
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:25.280 align:start position:0%
roles what are our responsibilities
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
under statute process um that they work
 
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:30.520 align:start position:0%
under and what what are the barriers
 
00:07:32.869 --> 00:07:32.879 align:start position:0%
that we're facing um but then they also
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
set a vision for the future what should
 
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
this really be like for Children and
 
00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:40.639 align:start position:0%
Families sure so um we were able to do
 
00:07:42.469 --> 00:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
this internally which is another thing
 
00:07:44.029 --> 00:07:44.039 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to highlight we have a
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
number of Staff in our department who've
 
00:07:48.469 --> 00:07:48.479 align:start position:0%
been trained in our black belt lean
 
00:07:50.790 --> 00:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
partners and do these Kaizen events and
 
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
so we actually brought in folks from
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
public health I I called on my old
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
friends in public health and I said you
 
00:07:59.149 --> 00:07:59.159 align:start position:0%
know how to think about problems and we
 
00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
have two groups and even probably a
 
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:02.759 align:start position:0%
little bit more probably three groups of
 
00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
people that all mean really well but
 
00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:07.960 align:start position:0%
they all know their Lane of work so why
 
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:09.680 align:start position:0%
don't we bring in someone who has
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
complete fresh eyes um and to say let's
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
let's map this out so they came in with
 
00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
all of their sticky notes and all of the
 
00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:19.280 align:start position:0%
large paper and what you'll see right
 
00:08:20.830 --> 00:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
here that you can't really read and we
 
00:08:23.309 --> 00:08:23.319 align:start position:0%
just put in here for illustration is we
 
00:08:26.149 --> 00:08:26.159 align:start position:0%
mapped out this incredibly complex
 
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:28.840 align:start position:0%
system where you have um work with our
 
00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:30.800 align:start position:0%
area agent gencies in the community you
 
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
have work with DCF again these are youth
 
00:08:35.310 --> 00:08:35.320 align:start position:0%
that are um have significant
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities that are in the care and
 
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:40.320 align:start position:0%
custody of DCF and need to move into an
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
adult system and um we were working with
 
00:08:46.990 --> 00:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
our folks over at BFA Works working with
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
Folks at developmental Services again
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
getting them in the same room and
 
00:08:53.910 --> 00:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
literally mapping out the swim Lanes of
 
00:08:57.230 --> 00:08:57.240 align:start position:0%
who does what when so that it doesn't uh
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
we don't repeat what we had seen in the
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
past which which was really well-meaning
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
people calling each other on the phone L
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
sending an email and time would slip
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
away and so we got out the big paper we
 
00:09:10.509 --> 00:09:10.519 align:start position:0%
got them in the room we pulled this out
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
and we identified a couple of areas of
 
00:09:15.190 --> 00:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
bottlenecks of where decisions needed to
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
be made we clarified in the room who
 
00:09:20.389 --> 00:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
makes what decision when all of this is
 
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:22.600 align:start position:0%
also you know we're switching kiddos
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
into adult Medicaid as well so many
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
levers need to be pulled that we now
 
00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:30.720 align:start position:0%
actually have a Playbook on how to do it
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
when in the past it was just done on
 
00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:34.640 align:start position:0%
personal relationships there would be
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
someone who knew how to do this and you
 
00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
just depended on them so we went through
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
we mapped it all out and where we are
 
00:09:44.949 --> 00:09:44.959 align:start position:0%
now is that we have a consistent process
 
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
it's not complete yet we have a map we
 
00:09:50.910 --> 00:09:50.920 align:start position:0%
know what to do the work but what we've
 
00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480 align:start position:0%
embedded into this group of three
 
00:09:56.230 --> 00:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
different program areas is this idea
 
00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
around continuous quality improvement
 
00:09:59.910 --> 00:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
processes um that they're predictable
 
00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:04.480 align:start position:0%
that we should have some standardized
 
00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
work products and that we have the
 
00:10:09.590 --> 00:10:09.600 align:start position:0%
capacity to work through what sometimes
 
00:10:12.790 --> 00:10:12.800 align:start position:0%
seems like problems that are you know
 
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:15.760 align:start position:0%
unfixable intangible problems and yet it
 
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
was easy enough and I would I would also
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
put a highlight in here that one of the
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
ways that we could also do this is the
 
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:22.480 align:start position:0%
integration within the
 
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
department you all know and you tell us
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
every day how enormous the department is
 
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
and it's unwieldly and one of the things
 
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:32.560 align:start position:0%
that we had in this case was Chris and I
 
00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
sitting together and being able to say
 
00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:36.200 align:start position:0%
these are all our folks we can get them
 
00:10:38.269 --> 00:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
in a room we can speak each other's
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
language and quite frankly translate
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
each other's language because each one
 
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:44.440 align:start position:0%
of them had their own responsibilities
 
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
you know DCF had their responsibility
 
00:10:49.230 --> 00:10:49.240 align:start position:0%
for moving kids you have BFA who have
 
00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
responsibilities of doing the paperwork
 
00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:55.480 align:start position:0%
just right and um we were very pleased
 
00:10:58.710 --> 00:10:58.720 align:start position:0%
with the ability to get this done build
 
00:11:00.829 --> 00:11:00.839 align:start position:0%
out a place book for them and actually
 
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
set out work to do ahead of time so
 
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's our update today it's just a
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
little you know a little preview into
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
what goes on in Brown building and other
 
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:11.600 align:start position:0%
buildings around the state of the way in
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
which we try and work through these
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
problems so that our um public so that
 
00:11:18.509 --> 00:11:18.519 align:start position:0%
the the youth that we are responsible
 
00:11:20.829 --> 00:11:20.839 align:start position:0%
for and dcyf and others actually get the
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
care that they need so thank you we're
 
00:11:24.269 --> 00:11:24.279 align:start position:0%
happy to take some questions thank you
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
for introducing the term I've been doing
 
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
these for years and I just didn't know
 
00:11:30.430 --> 00:11:30.440 align:start position:0%
what it was called but a wise man also
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
known as the one who lives in my phone
 
00:11:35.509 --> 00:11:35.519 align:start position:0%
said a Kaizen event is a short-term
 
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
focused Workshop that aims to improve
 
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:39.680 align:start position:0%
processes through rapid changes with the
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
goal of eliminating waste reducing costs
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
and enhancing quality that's it wow yeah
 
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.790 align:start position:0%
and enhancing quality that's it wow yeah
representative

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you Mr chair I I I have to
 
00:11:51.629 --> 00:11:51.639 align:start position:0%
point out that the father of the kaizon
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
was actually an American Demming who
 
00:11:56.430 --> 00:11:56.440 align:start position:0%
went over in the Japanese stole all his
 
00:11:59.350 --> 00:11:59.360 align:start position:0%
ideas and repackaged them so so put
 
00:12:01.949 --> 00:12:01.959 align:start position:0%
America First that was that's a Deming
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
idea but uh the as I as I'm looking at
 
00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:09.360 align:start position:0%
this I I want to just say I really
 
00:12:11.710 --> 00:12:11.720 align:start position:0%
appreciate that you all are taking the
 
00:12:14.269 --> 00:12:14.279 align:start position:0%
initiative to use uh good business
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
practices to keep looking for ways to do
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
better and um and I'm just wondering uh
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
now that you've done this uh this
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
mapping um the extent to which uh our it
 
00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
systems are working in order to
 
00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:33.639 align:start position:0%
implement this workflow or are you going
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
to have to do this workflow in sort of
 
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:38.680 align:start position:0%
an extraordinary way and work against
 
00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:41.680 align:start position:0%
the it instead of having the it support
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
your workflow that's a a great question
 
00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:44.920 align:start position:0%
I don't know if Chris you want to take
 
00:12:46.509 --> 00:12:46.519 align:start position:0%
that and then I have one thing to add I
 
00:12:48.990 --> 00:12:49.000 align:start position:0%
think we
 
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
haven't we haven't looked so much at the
 
00:12:53.389 --> 00:12:53.399 align:start position:0%
it flow
 
00:12:58.590 --> 00:12:58.600 align:start position:0%
however all staff Ed within DCF BFA and
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
Bureau of developmental Services they do
 
00:13:03.389 --> 00:13:03.399 align:start position:0%
new use new heights for the eligibility
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
system um and so that I know is part of
 
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:09.880 align:start position:0%
their process and working I'm not 100%
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
sure um how much that really at this
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
point needs to be part of it I think
 
00:13:18.110 --> 00:13:18.120 align:start position:0%
what is really important is they've
 
00:13:21.269 --> 00:13:21.279 align:start position:0%
committed to monthly meetings to sit
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
down and talk about who's coming where
 
00:13:26.189 --> 00:13:26.199 align:start position:0%
are we at with transitions but I can
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
double check on that yeah and I'll I'll
 
00:13:30.030 --> 00:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit from DC DF so we have
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
an incredibly Antiquated um thing called
 
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:35.240 align:start position:0%
cwis which is the data system for DCF it
 
00:13:37.310 --> 00:13:37.320 align:start position:0%
was built in the 9s we've been cobbling
 
00:13:39.030 --> 00:13:39.040 align:start position:0%
it together and we've been working
 
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:40.720 align:start position:0%
probably for close to 5 years on
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
bringing on a new um system called
 
00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:45.240 align:start position:0%
Granite families that's actually going
 
00:13:47.910 --> 00:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
to be very close to getting to GNC very
 
00:13:50.550 --> 00:13:50.560 align:start position:0%
soon it's been a tremendous process to
 
00:13:53.430 --> 00:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
do the planning around a complex data
 
00:13:55.790 --> 00:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
system and one of my hopes for that is
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
that it actually has the sort of
 
00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
ticklers and reminders so that part of
 
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
the problem in this is that um kids at
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
certain age points you know like at 6
 
00:14:06.509 --> 00:14:06.519 align:start position:0%
months who need to start doing this and
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
that and at this age you need to do this
 
00:14:11.430 --> 00:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
that we want to have a Tickler that says
 
00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:13.000 align:start position:0%
these are all the kiddos that are coming
 
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:16.360 align:start position:0%
up to age that's what I want our Heights
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
and um Granite families going to work
 
00:14:18.199 --> 00:14:19.550 align:start position:0%
and um Granite families going to work
seamlessly

00:14:19.550 --> 00:14:19.560 align:start position:0%
seamlessly
 
00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.230 align:start position:0%
seamlessly
together

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:21.240 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:14:23.509 --> 00:14:23.519 align:start position:0%
probably that could be in the future the
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
ebi I think they've been talking about
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
using that to actually help bring it
 
00:14:31.629 --> 00:14:31.639 align:start position:0%
together because CCF needs to know okay
 
00:14:34.430 --> 00:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
this person's 16 but so does BDS for
 
00:14:37.230 --> 00:14:37.240 align:start position:0%
planning to make sure we know what the
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
child's needs are um to know what needs
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
to be done while they're under duif care
 
00:14:45.069 --> 00:14:45.079 align:start position:0%
to prepare prepare them for Adult
 
00:14:47.189 --> 00:14:47.199 align:start position:0%
Services so there needs to be that
 
00:14:49.069 --> 00:14:49.079 align:start position:0%
better coordination yeah and the good
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
news is the number is fairly small so we
 
00:14:53.670 --> 00:14:53.680 align:start position:0%
can have these monthly meetings and do
 
00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:56.040 align:start position:0%
it in a little analog way but I think
 
00:14:57.990 --> 00:14:58.000 align:start position:0%
there are huge opportunities to use our
 
00:15:00.230 --> 00:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
systems better and and have systems that
 
00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:02.120 align:start position:0%
actually can do that are current
 
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:04.040 align:start position:0%
Antiquated especially in DCF it just
 
00:15:05.509 --> 00:15:05.519 align:start position:0%
simply can't do
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
it thank you I I've been encouraged to
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
keep my questions uh short and and so
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
that was a very long answer I think that
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
you you just said that no as of now the
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
it system has not been redesigned to
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
support the workflow okay so I I I I
 
00:15:26.269 --> 00:15:26.279 align:start position:0%
just think we have so much tied up
 
00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:28.720 align:start position:0%
potential in our it systems that I I
 
00:15:31.069 --> 00:15:31.079 align:start position:0%
think for us to make the next couple of
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
steps uh we need to be thinking of
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
productivity we couldn't agree more yeah
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
thanks representative
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
Weber this is an easy one I understand
 
00:15:43.069 --> 00:15:43.079 align:start position:0%
the lean concept I just don't remember
 
00:15:46.350 --> 00:15:46.360 align:start position:0%
whether the acronym is L en or L Ean L
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:52.350 --> 00:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
you Senator
 
00:15:56.230 --> 00:15:56.240 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:15:58.590 --> 00:15:58.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for the work you've done on
 
00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.829 align:start position:0%
thank you for the work you've done on
this

00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:16:03.110 --> 00:16:03.120 align:start position:0%
um my question's more hypothetical I
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
think as you know there's going to be
 
00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
discussion again this year about
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
breaking up the
 
00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
department and I just wonder if
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
DCF and other services involving
 
00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
children were split off from the rest of
 
00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
Medicaid and the DD
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
Services whether this process would
 
00:16:31.829 --> 00:16:31.839 align:start position:0%
still work as well as it seems like it's
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to that's a great question and so
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
um we think it wouldn't to to be to
 
00:16:39.949 --> 00:16:39.959 align:start position:0%
answer short uh have a concise answer we
 
00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:42.440 align:start position:0%
think it wouldn't it is much easier to
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
have these kind of conversations to
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
understand the data systems and the
 
00:16:49.230 --> 00:16:49.240 align:start position:0%
workflows when we're all within the same
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
Department under the same leadership
 
00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:57.949 --> 00:16:57.959 align:start position:0%
priorities representative Woods thank
 
00:17:00.269 --> 00:17:00.279 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thanks for taking my
 
00:17:03.189 --> 00:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
question um um sounds like a good
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
program um but um is there a way to sort
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
of identify how well you've done I mean
 
00:17:12.990 --> 00:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
it's nice to have another and secondly U
 
00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:16.120 align:start position:0%
it um in some sense not trying to be a
 
00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
detractor another layer of biography
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
have you created any new problems so a
 
00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:24.520 align:start position:0%
how well have you done uh to have you
 
00:17:27.069 --> 00:17:27.079 align:start position:0%
really solve the problem and and
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
secondly um are are there any new
 
00:17:31.789 --> 00:17:31.799 align:start position:0%
problems you can Envision having been
 
00:17:34.310 --> 00:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
created great you sure um I think
 
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:37.120 align:start position:0%
actually we will be able to identify it
 
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:39.200 align:start position:0%
through the actual transitions for the
 
00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:41.240 align:start position:0%
Youth and so through these monthly
 
00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
meetings and um probably anecdotally the
 
00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440 align:start position:0%
less emails that Trish and I have to be
 
00:17:49.029 --> 00:17:49.039 align:start position:0%
involved in when the problem isn't
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
working right you know um but really
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
when youth transition and we know
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
exactly how it's going to be so the
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
team's going to be tracking that as well
 
00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:00.600 align:start position:0%
and I actually think we're not creating
 
00:18:02.230 --> 00:18:02.240 align:start position:0%
any new layers we're actually
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
streamlining and um aligning our
 
00:18:08.710 --> 00:18:08.720 align:start position:0%
processes to reduce the
 
00:18:11.549 --> 00:18:11.559 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy yes follow up thank you
 
00:18:14.029 --> 00:18:14.039 align:start position:0%
thanks one of my concerns was my
 
00:18:16.990 --> 00:18:17.000 align:start position:0%
daughter's a parent and deals with this
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
transition type of thing um I can
 
00:18:23.470 --> 00:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
Envision the uh new transition team you
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
have in the middle actually creating a
 
00:18:29.590 --> 00:18:29.600 align:start position:0%
longer time to get where you want to go
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
and that was That's the basis for my
 
00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.520 align:start position:0%
question is that thank you I mean it is
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
our intent to make it as streamlined as
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
possible what we were finding was that
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
someone you know when this happens in
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
organizations we're not unique and you
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
know we're happy to show you our our
 
00:18:45.990 --> 00:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
dirty laundry but like someone sends an
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
email it sit it has a question maybe
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
someone can't really answer and it sits
 
00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:52.240 align:start position:0%
in someone's inbox for you know three
 
00:18:54.390 --> 00:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
weeks this way there's actually a pro
 
00:18:56.149 --> 00:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
everyone understands the process from
 
00:18:59.110 --> 00:18:59.120 align:start position:0%
Soup To Nuts and again with these tick
 
00:19:01.310 --> 00:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
through the U monthly meetings that were
 
00:19:04.149 --> 00:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
acting quickly enough like soon enough
 
00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:06.360 align:start position:0%
to in order to get that transition
 
00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:08.600 align:start position:0%
happened on time so there isn't sort of
 
00:19:10.870 --> 00:19:10.880 align:start position:0%
a fire drill going we have two weeks to
 
00:19:12.750 --> 00:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
get this done for a kid and and I think
 
00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
through the discovery process the team
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
spent a lot of time talking about the
 
00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:21.240 align:start position:0%
roles and responsibilities so everybody
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
understanding you know what DCF has to
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
do what developmental Services has to do
 
00:19:30.310 --> 00:19:30.320 align:start position:0%
what they can't do really helped I think
 
00:19:32.310 --> 00:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
um to have a shared understanding
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
because at the end of the day and
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosen all this kind of goes to
 
00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:37.710 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosen all this kind of goes to
your

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:37.720 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
question this child is the
 
00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of DHHS and it doesn't
 
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:45.480 align:start position:0%
matter if it's DCF developmental
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
Services they have to work together and
 
00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:51.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:53.710 --> 00:19:53.720 align:start position:0%
that representative
 
00:19:56.390 --> 00:19:56.400 align:start position:0%
Weber um I have a question and a comment
 
00:19:59.110 --> 00:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
if that's okay Mr chair it is um my
 
00:20:01.230 --> 00:20:01.240 align:start position:0%
question following up on uh
 
00:20:04.350 --> 00:20:04.360 align:start position:0%
representative Wood's question is my
 
00:20:06.149 --> 00:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
understanding as I'm sort of scribbling
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
here is that you have not created a new
 
00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
bureaucracy what you have done is have
 
00:20:13.029 --> 00:20:13.039 align:start position:0%
two departments
 
00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:15.159 align:start position:0%
interrelate to each other a little
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
better and that might in the long run
 
00:20:21.110 --> 00:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
although it takes more time now will
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
both save time and we hope produce a
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
more secure route for the Youth who is
 
00:20:33.549 --> 00:20:33.559 align:start position:0%
transitioning into adulthood is that
 
00:20:35.029 --> 00:20:35.039 align:start position:0%
correct thank you for that excellent
 
00:20:38.029 --> 00:20:38.039 align:start position:0%
summary okay thank you and then my
 
00:20:40.350 --> 00:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
comment is because my other volunteer
 
00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
job is as a casa um I just want to say
 
00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for the added
 
00:20:50.669 --> 00:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
attention that kids making this
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
transition without what we think of as
 
00:20:55.909 --> 00:20:55.919 align:start position:0%
normal familial
 
00:20:58.750 --> 00:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
supports um they have gotten
 
00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:01.760 align:start position:0%
considerably more services and supports
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and thank you
 
00:21:05.149 --> 00:21:05.159 align:start position:0%
for making that happen thank you this is
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
an incredibly vulnerable group of young
 
00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
adults and it is our honor to serve them
 
00:21:14.310 --> 00:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
and and as you note these are these are
 
00:21:16.029 --> 00:21:16.039 align:start position:0%
youth that often have not had
 
00:21:19.110 --> 00:21:19.120 align:start position:0%
connections to other um family members
 
00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:22.039 align:start position:0%
and it's our responsibility to do this
 
00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:24.240 align:start position:0%
right there have been a few people
 
00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
recently who have suggested that dcyf
 
00:21:32.269 --> 00:21:32.279 align:start position:0%
has broken out from DHHS and my argument
 
00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
was put him under the same roof it's
 
00:21:36.310 --> 00:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
much easier to talk and collaborate
 
00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
would you agree I would agree with that
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
100% also a couple years ago or more I
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
was working a lot with the DD community
 
00:21:47.350 --> 00:21:47.360 align:start position:0%
and I had a couple of observations one
 
00:21:49.149 --> 00:21:49.159 align:start position:0%
was there needed to be greater
 
00:21:52.390 --> 00:21:52.400 align:start position:0%
engagement with the actual uh loved ones
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
of hurting people I'm very happy to see
 
00:21:57.390 --> 00:21:57.400 align:start position:0%
that that is improving that's the
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
feedback I'm getting and the other was
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
answers weren't easily coming to
 
00:22:06.430 --> 00:22:06.440 align:start position:0%
questions and it sounds like this is
 
00:22:09.310 --> 00:22:09.320 align:start position:0%
going to work to that problem too thank
 
00:22:12.430 --> 00:22:12.440 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
questions thank
 
00:22:21.549 --> 00:22:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%

00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
associate infections I'm going to
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
abbreviate that as Hai going forward
 
00:22:52.310 --> 00:22:52.320 align:start position:0%
it's a mouthful um this is a
 
00:22:54.230 --> 00:22:54.240 align:start position:0%
legislatively created program within the
 
00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health Services I'm
 
00:22:58.630 --> 00:22:58.640 align:start position:0%
also joined here today by Darlene Craig
 
00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:01.720 align:start position:0%
manages the Hai program um in your
 
00:23:03.710 --> 00:23:03.720 align:start position:0%
packets there are some blue folders um
 
00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
similar to what Darlene has um you'll
 
00:23:09.149 --> 00:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
see a letter to the committee um and an
 
00:23:11.789 --> 00:23:11.799 align:start position:0%
executive summary for each 2023 data
 
00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
report that I'll briefly discuss um
 
00:23:15.909 --> 00:23:15.919 align:start position:0%
these will eventually be available
 
00:23:18.190 --> 00:23:18.200 align:start position:0%
online within the next week or two um
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
and then I will also provide some budget
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
and other program
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
updates um since 2007 New Hampshire has
 
00:23:25.990 --> 00:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
been heavily involved in reducing
 
00:23:28.149 --> 00:23:28.159 align:start position:0%
Healthcare associate infections we have
 
00:23:29.669 --> 00:23:29.679 align:start position:0%
provided these reports to the public
 
00:23:32.590 --> 00:23:32.600 align:start position:0%
which is required under RSA 15132
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
through 35 and since the program was
 
00:23:37.350 --> 00:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
established this requires certain Health
 
00:23:40.909 --> 00:23:40.919 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities hospitals nursing homes
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%
um dialysis centers and Ambulatory
 
00:23:44.750 --> 00:23:44.760 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers to report certain
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
infections for context um I know I
 
00:23:49.190 --> 00:23:49.200 align:start position:0%
presented to this group multiple years
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
in a row but I did want to provide this
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
additional detail to start but what are
 
00:23:55.110 --> 00:23:55.120 align:start position:0%
Healthcare associate infections they are
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
infections that people acquire when
 
00:23:58.870 --> 00:23:58.880 align:start position:0%
being treated for something else so for
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
example if a person has a knee
 
00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:01.960 align:start position:0%
replacement and then later has an
 
00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
infection in their wound or deep within
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
within their knee or a person has an
 
00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:08.360 align:start position:0%
accident they're in the Intensive Care
 
00:24:10.149 --> 00:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
Unit and then later have a bloodstream
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
infection due to improper infection
 
00:24:14.269 --> 00:24:14.279 align:start position:0%
prevention practices these infections
 
00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
are primarily preventable and patients
 
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:18.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes end up sicker after receiving
 
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:21.200 align:start position:0%
care for medical reasons the reports
 
00:24:22.269 --> 00:24:22.279 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you are
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
intended for the public so patients can
 
00:24:25.830 --> 00:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
make decisions and discuss how to reduce
 
00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
infections with their providers and we
 
00:24:29.549 --> 00:24:29.559 align:start position:0%
also know how care facilities use this
 
00:24:31.710 --> 00:24:31.720 align:start position:0%
information readily so they can work on
 
00:24:33.149 --> 00:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
quality improvement initiatives to
 
00:24:33.159 --> 00:24:34.070 align:start position:0%
quality improvement initiatives to
reduce

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
00:24:36.190 --> 00:24:36.200 align:start position:0%
infections so because these reports are
 
00:24:38.230 --> 00:24:38.240 align:start position:0%
very lengthy I am going to just provide
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
some very um high level updates and
 
00:24:42.870 --> 00:24:42.880 align:start position:0%
highlights for each report for hospitals
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers arc's
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
dialysis centers and long-term care
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
facilities all hospitals reported as
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
required in
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
2023 um sure because I'm trying to
 
00:24:57.269 --> 00:24:57.279 align:start position:0%
figure out what I need to write down and
 
00:24:59.590 --> 00:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
what I don't yep it could you point me
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
to the piece of paper in our folder that
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
you're working off of if there is one
 
00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
because if there is then I don't have to
 
00:25:09.430 --> 00:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
yes and and I will actually save you
 
00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:10.760 align:start position:0%
from writing everything down I can
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
provide my these are talking points and
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to share those forence lat
 
00:25:18.029 --> 00:25:18.039 align:start position:0%
to save your hand yes um the letter in
 
00:25:20.470 --> 00:25:20.480 align:start position:0%
front of you also does address some of
 
00:25:22.590 --> 00:25:22.600 align:start position:0%
these highle points that I've got I
 
00:25:23.789 --> 00:25:23.799 align:start position:0%
don't want you to have to thumb through
 
00:25:25.950 --> 00:25:25.960 align:start position:0%
150 pages though I'll save you from that
 
00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.830 align:start position:0%
150 pages though I'll save you from that
as

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
well um these infections are central
 
00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
line bloodstream infections catheter
 
00:25:33.230 --> 00:25:33.240 align:start position:0%
Associated urin tract infections and
 
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640 align:start position:0%
surgical site infections following
 
00:25:37.310 --> 00:25:37.320 align:start position:0%
certain procedure types they also report
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
Chester defal or SEI infection and
 
00:25:41.310 --> 00:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
aggregate Healthcare Personnel
 
00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates overall in the
 
00:25:45.870 --> 00:25:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in 2023 hospitals observe
 
00:25:48.029 --> 00:25:48.039 align:start position:0%
fewer infections and predicted based on
 
00:25:49.909 --> 00:25:49.919 align:start position:0%
National Data and this is statistically
 
00:25:51.870 --> 00:25:51.880 align:start position:0%
significant um there were significantly
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
few infections ac across all of these
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
main categories and only 135 were
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
reported for the state um and also 24
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
hospitals reported 174 SE diff
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
infections as well and this is
 
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than the national
 
00:26:07.549 --> 00:26:07.559 align:start position:0%
rate as well Healthcare Personnel
 
00:26:10.389 --> 00:26:10.399 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination rate was 89.9%
 
00:26:12.269 --> 00:26:12.279 align:start position:0%
this is a slight decrease decrease from
 
00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
the prior year of 90.4% however
 
00:26:15.909 --> 00:26:15.919 align:start position:0%
hospitals have routinely and
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
continuously had higher vaccination
 
00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:20.159 align:start position:0%
rates than other facility types
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers um there
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
eight reported surgical site infections
 
00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:29.080 align:start position:0%
um there were a total of six infections
 
00:26:32.190 --> 00:26:32.200 align:start position:0%
that were reported um this is lower than
 
00:26:34.149 --> 00:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
is reported or is predicted based on
 
00:26:36.310 --> 00:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
National Data though a slight increase
 
00:26:38.990 --> 00:26:39.000 align:start position:0%
from the prior year which was Zero um
 
00:26:40.230 --> 00:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Personnel influenza
 
00:26:42.630 --> 00:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate was 80.1% which is a
 
00:26:45.669 --> 00:26:45.679 align:start position:0%
decrease from the prior year um which
 
00:26:45.679 --> 00:26:46.990 align:start position:0%
decrease from the prior year um which
was

00:26:46.990 --> 00:26:47.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:26:49.430 --> 00:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
87.7% and since we started collecting
 
00:26:52.029 --> 00:26:52.039 align:start position:0%
these data certain antibiotic um
 
00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:54.520 align:start position:0%
intravenous therapy or Pro prophylaxis
 
00:26:56.510 --> 00:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
has been remained above
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
96% um since we started working on this
 
00:27:00.909 --> 00:27:00.919 align:start position:0%
in 15 of those facilities though they
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
did not report they either had
 
00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:04.360 align:start position:0%
challenges with incomplete data or did
 
00:27:05.909 --> 00:27:05.919 align:start position:0%
not have qualifying procedures in which
 
00:27:07.149 --> 00:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
to report since they have to have
 
00:27:08.590 --> 00:27:08.600 align:start position:0%
specific procedures to report that
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
measure but they've routinely had very
 
00:27:12.510 --> 00:27:12.520 align:start position:0%
high adherence uh to protecting patients
 
00:27:15.870 --> 00:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
for that measure dialysis centers 18
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
reported four types of vascular access
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
site infections in addition they also
 
00:27:22.110 --> 00:27:22.120 align:start position:0%
reported vaccination rate among their
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Personnel overall the number
 
00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
of infections was also lower in dialysis
 
00:27:29.029 --> 00:27:29.039 align:start position:0%
compared to national data to 299
 
00:27:31.630 --> 00:27:31.640 align:start position:0%
infections were reported as compared to
 
00:27:35.310 --> 00:27:35.320 align:start position:0%
379 for the prior year of those four
 
00:27:37.669 --> 00:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
types that are reported however uh local
 
00:27:39.789 --> 00:27:39.799 align:start position:0%
access site infections that was actually
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
significantly higher than National Data
 
00:27:43.149 --> 00:27:43.159 align:start position:0%
so something that we'll be monitoring
 
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
and looking into Healthcare Personnel
 
00:27:47.509 --> 00:27:47.519 align:start position:0%
influence of vaccination Dialysis in
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
dialysis centers was
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
52.6% which is a slight decrease from
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
the prior year
 
00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
55.0% in long-term care facilities which
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
this includes a broad cat or of skilled
 
00:28:00.990 --> 00:28:01.000 align:start position:0%
nursing assisted living and Residential
 
00:28:02.950 --> 00:28:02.960 align:start position:0%
Care Facilities they only report
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination rates and in those
 
00:28:08.149 --> 00:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
facilities that um percentage was
 
00:28:10.149 --> 00:28:10.159 align:start position:0%
50.1% which is an increase from the
 
00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
prior season which is
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
37.8% and the vaccination coverage in
 
00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
those facilities range from 0 to
 
00:28:20.149 --> 00:28:20.159 align:start position:0%
100% some other program activities um
 
00:28:22.190 --> 00:28:22.200 align:start position:0%
our program conducted over 100
 
00:28:25.269 --> 00:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
investigations in 2022 or 2023 which is
 
00:28:26.870 --> 00:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
more than double compared to the prior
 
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
year this includes outbreaks infection
 
00:28:32.230 --> 00:28:32.240 align:start position:0%
control breach events drug diversion of
 
00:28:34.669 --> 00:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
injectable medications and antimicrob
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
resistant and unusual organisms our
 
00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:38.960 align:start position:0%
program also continues its efforts to
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
coordinate antimicrobial resistant
 
00:28:44.269 --> 00:28:44.279 align:start position:0%
pathogens response uh for example um in
 
00:28:47.029 --> 00:28:47.039 align:start position:0%
2023 we had 84 antibiotic resistant
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
organisms reported to us under RSA
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
141c some of these required patient
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
notification and screening this
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
primarily includes bacteria that have
 
00:28:58.750 --> 00:28:58.760 align:start position:0%
enzymes that can spread resistance to
 
00:29:01.509 --> 00:29:01.519 align:start position:0%
other bacteria in that setting uh the
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
program continues to see a trend of more
 
00:29:04.909 --> 00:29:04.919 align:start position:0%
of these drug resistant bacteria
 
00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
requiring substantial effort to prevent
 
00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.350 align:start position:0%
requiring substantial effort to prevent
further

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:07.360 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:29:09.549 --> 00:29:09.559 align:start position:0%
transmission and then lastly our program
 
00:29:11.350 --> 00:29:11.360 align:start position:0%
conducted 20 infection prevention
 
00:29:13.750 --> 00:29:13.760 align:start position:0%
assessments within Healthcare
 
00:29:17.230 --> 00:29:17.240 align:start position:0%
settings so per RSA 140
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
15134 um the department is also required
 
00:29:22.269 --> 00:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
to report on Hai program costs and
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
facility fees um to the healthcare H or
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
HHS oversight the House and Senate
 
00:29:28.909 --> 00:29:28.919 align:start position:0%
weighs and me
 
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:31.080 align:start position:0%
um and this also includes the fa fees
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
paid for um by Healthcare facilities in
 
00:29:37.029 --> 00:29:37.039 align:start position:0%
2023 State fiscal year the AI program
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
budget to complete these reports was
 
00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
348,000 and then State fiscal year we
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
are also awarded $328 $817 through one
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
particular grant called the epidemiology
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
laboratory capacity grant that Grant was
 
00:29:54.190 --> 00:29:54.200 align:start position:0%
later reduced by 40% in the following
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year however our program has
 
00:29:58.310 --> 00:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
received several other fundings funding
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
sources to cover operational costs of
 
00:30:03.310 --> 00:30:03.320 align:start position:0%
our Hai program was which also includes
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
Hai reporting so due to receipt of our
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds we have not had to fee
 
00:30:11.789 --> 00:30:11.799 align:start position:0%
facilities and assess fees in 2023 nor
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
have we had to fee facilities for the
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
past four or so years and previous years
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
when we have had to fee um those fees
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
range from 22,000 to 150,000 depending
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
on the size the facility and the number
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
of procedures they
 
00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
perform so in closing in this coming
 
00:30:28.830 --> 00:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
year we really are looking to create a
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
lot of efficiencies in our program by
 
00:30:33.590 --> 00:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
making these data much more accessible
 
00:30:35.389 --> 00:30:35.399 align:start position:0%
and interactive to the public so we
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
don't have such static large heavy dense
 
00:30:38.950 --> 00:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
reports we'd like to make them more
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
accessible online for for everyone to
 
00:30:43.549 --> 00:30:43.559 align:start position:0%
access we also continue to prioritize
 
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:46.120 align:start position:0%
our our outbreak response responding to
 
00:30:47.909 --> 00:30:47.919 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial resistant infections and
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
Drug diversion events and infection
 
00:30:52.710 --> 00:30:52.720 align:start position:0%
control breach events as they occur and
 
00:30:54.029 --> 00:30:54.039 align:start position:0%
we are also expanding infection
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
prevention training to various
 
00:30:57.629 --> 00:30:57.639 align:start position:0%
Geographic areas of the state as well as
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
impr proving the number of organizations
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
that go to those trainings including
 
00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
Emergency Medical Services dialysis and
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities and this
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
training will also respond to gaps in
 
00:31:08.549 --> 00:31:08.559 align:start position:0%
drug diversion reporting as well as
 
00:31:11.310 --> 00:31:11.320 align:start position:0%
enhancements to infection prevention and
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
that's all I have for you today pending
 
00:31:15.149 --> 00:31:15.159 align:start position:0%
any questions thank you for bearing with
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
me through all that it's exciting that
 
00:31:20.430 --> 00:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
the numbers of bad things in many
 
00:31:23.350 --> 00:31:23.360 align:start position:0%
categories is going down is this just
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
something that happens periodically or
 
00:31:28.509 --> 00:31:28.519 align:start position:0%
were there intentional actions that
 
00:31:31.029 --> 00:31:31.039 align:start position:0%
perhaps in part cause this it's an
 
00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
excellent question you know I I've been
 
00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
presenting for over 14 years and I am
 
00:31:39.070 --> 00:31:39.080 align:start position:0%
seeing our infection ratios decrease
 
00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
over time and continuously being
 
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:43.880 align:start position:0%
remaining below the national average
 
00:31:46.629 --> 00:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
which is excellent I do think though
 
00:31:48.950 --> 00:31:48.960 align:start position:0%
this work takes a village it's not just
 
00:31:51.230 --> 00:31:51.240 align:start position:0%
our program we are a piece of the puzzle
 
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
there are many individuals involved with
 
00:31:55.149 --> 00:31:55.159 align:start position:0%
reducing infections across the state
 
00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
from infection prevention at at
 
00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
hospitals to Direct Care Providers to
 
00:32:02.350 --> 00:32:02.360 align:start position:0%
our program bringing training and
 
00:32:05.029 --> 00:32:05.039 align:start position:0%
responding if we see increases so I
 
00:32:06.750 --> 00:32:06.760 align:start position:0%
think we play a role but I don't think
 
00:32:08.549 --> 00:32:08.559 align:start position:0%
we are the primary players to reducing
 
00:32:12.070 --> 00:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
these infections I will say uh for the
 
00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
reducing uh the spread in transmission
 
00:32:16.149 --> 00:32:16.159 align:start position:0%
of these antibiotic resistant
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
organisms our program is heavily
 
00:32:19.789 --> 00:32:19.799 align:start position:0%
involved in reducing transmission and
 
00:32:21.629 --> 00:32:21.639 align:start position:0%
spread and I do think we have a direct
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
impact in reducing spread we have a
 
00:32:25.909 --> 00:32:25.919 align:start position:0%
pretty low burden compared to many other
 
00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:28.600 align:start position:0%
states um across the country and
 
00:32:31.230 --> 00:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
regionally um we we don't really see as
 
00:32:34.590 --> 00:32:34.600 align:start position:0%
many of these organisms as other states
 
00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
could you very briefly give just a few
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
examples of what people are doing which
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
may seem to have a cause and
 
00:32:44.710 --> 00:32:44.720 align:start position:0%
effect sure so um for antibiotic
 
00:32:47.870 --> 00:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
resistant bacteria if we identify a
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
individual that has one of these these
 
00:32:52.710 --> 00:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
bacteria we will work with a provider
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
and a healthcare facility to identify
 
00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
patients that may have been near that
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
patient so if there's a roommate or
 
00:33:00.909 --> 00:33:00.919 align:start position:0%
patient subsequent that may have had
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
care after them and we kind of have this
 
00:33:05.070 --> 00:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
approach where we look at the potential
 
00:33:07.870 --> 00:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
risk and we'll work with that facility
 
00:33:10.509 --> 00:33:10.519 align:start position:0%
to contact patients and let them know of
 
00:33:12.669 --> 00:33:12.679 align:start position:0%
that potential risk and exposure and
 
00:33:14.310 --> 00:33:14.320 align:start position:0%
then they will have testing and
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
screening and we work closely with a
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
laboratory in New York state to do that
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
screening and so we have um our staff
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
maybe a handful three or so staff will
 
00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
work to either work with the facility or
 
00:33:29.789 --> 00:33:29.799 align:start position:0%
we'll directly make patient calls and
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
notifications so they can have screening
 
00:33:35.909 --> 00:33:35.919 align:start position:0%
done did I answer your question okay yes
 
00:33:37.710 --> 00:33:37.720 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions repres
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:45.110 --> 00:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
I have two questions one
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious
 
00:33:54.389 --> 00:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
why we're getting 2023 data when we're
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
six months
 
00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:00.240 align:start position:0%
into the next fiscal year already that's
 
00:34:02.029 --> 00:34:02.039 align:start position:0%
a really good question and I did
 
00:34:05.190 --> 00:34:05.200 align:start position:0%
anticipate it so we have these data
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
produced every year they end of the
 
00:34:09.069 --> 00:34:09.079 align:start position:0%
calendar year so right now calendar year
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
so it's calendar year data and it takes
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
around six months of reconciliation so
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
between the end of the year and to when
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
we close that out a month later so
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
around February March we start a
 
00:34:22.909 --> 00:34:22.919 align:start position:0%
Reconciliation process we go back and
 
00:34:24.589 --> 00:34:24.599 align:start position:0%
forth with facilities to make sure what
 
00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
they reported was accurate so we we have
 
00:34:29.109 --> 00:34:29.119 align:start position:0%
a very Rob bu quality assurance piece
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
and then we do a lot of data cleaning
 
00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
and it takes a massive effort to put
 
00:34:35.349 --> 00:34:35.359 align:start position:0%
these reports together we are also
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
slightly delayed this year because we
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
also had transition and Staffing the
 
00:34:41.430 --> 00:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
role primarily responsible for this for
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
this work was vacated uh due to tr staff
 
00:34:46.829 --> 00:34:46.839 align:start position:0%
transition in September so we are
 
00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:49.000 align:start position:0%
running around six months delay due to
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
some of those challenges and also we've
 
00:34:52.550 --> 00:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
had nearly double the number of
 
00:34:54.149 --> 00:34:54.159 align:start position:0%
Investigations and when we are
 
00:34:55.829 --> 00:34:55.839 align:start position:0%
prioritizing our work we have to make
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
sure we put Patients First and respond
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
to those events immediately and then
 
00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to these reports and if
 
00:35:04.589 --> 00:35:04.599 align:start position:0%
fact follow up yes thank you thank you
 
00:35:08.550 --> 00:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
um so I'm struck by the difference in
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
the flu vaccine rate between Hospital
 
00:35:16.270 --> 00:35:16.280 align:start position:0%
staff and dialysis center and long-term
 
00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:22.440 align:start position:0%
care facility staff and um I'm wondering
 
00:35:27.750 --> 00:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
what if anything the department can do
 
00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:29.710 align:start position:0%
what if anything the department can do
clinics

00:35:29.710 --> 00:35:29.720 align:start position:0%
clinics
 
00:35:33.550 --> 00:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
or I I don't even know what to bring
 
00:35:35.109 --> 00:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
that flu
 
00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
vaccine rate up at dialysis centers and
 
00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.510 align:start position:0%
vaccine rate up at dialysis centers and
nursing

00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
nursing
 
00:35:44.270 --> 00:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
homes we we collect the different or the
 
00:35:46.630 --> 00:35:46.640 align:start position:0%
data across all facility types we are
 
00:35:49.510 --> 00:35:49.520 align:start position:0%
not requiring any types of vaccine and
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
we are also working with our facilities
 
00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
to ensure there are requirements they
 
00:35:56.790 --> 00:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
have to make sure it's available um what
 
00:35:59.030 --> 00:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
we do is we we collect the aggregate
 
00:36:01.069 --> 00:36:01.079 align:start position:0%
data and we put it in the reports and we
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
let those reports really Drive some of
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
that change and it has we have seen some
 
00:36:06.750 --> 00:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
of that change some facilities have
 
00:36:08.670 --> 00:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
implemented a variety of policies which
 
00:36:10.109 --> 00:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
they are actually in the reports
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
themselves we do have some documentation
 
00:36:16.030 --> 00:36:16.040 align:start position:0%
on that um and hospitals have um
 
00:36:17.990 --> 00:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
continuously been around 90% and they've
 
00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:19.640 align:start position:0%
really kind of LED that charge other
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
facility types I am seeing a change um
 
00:36:23.990 --> 00:36:24.000 align:start position:0%
there has been site decrease from the
 
00:36:26.589 --> 00:36:26.599 align:start position:0%
prior year that could be just normal
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
variation of decrease and changes over
 
00:36:30.630 --> 00:36:30.640 align:start position:0%
time and I think there's we need more
 
00:36:31.829 --> 00:36:31.839 align:start position:0%
time to really know that and I don't
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
have my crystal ball to say if we're
 
00:36:36.109 --> 00:36:36.119 align:start position:0%
going to see increases but I I do think
 
00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:37.480 align:start position:0%
facilities are making conservative
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
efforts to make sure vaccine is
 
00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680 align:start position:0%
available to their health care Personnel
 
00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
um this has been an ongoing challenge we
 
00:36:46.750 --> 00:36:46.760 align:start position:0%
also have had some challenges with um
 
00:36:49.270 --> 00:36:49.280 align:start position:0%
reporting as well though um sometimes
 
00:36:50.750 --> 00:36:50.760 align:start position:0%
facilities don't know they have to
 
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
report and so we do have some facilities
 
00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
that haven't reported in some of these
 
00:36:57.069 --> 00:36:57.079 align:start position:0%
reports and so we have we are making a
 
00:36:59.390 --> 00:36:59.400 align:start position:0%
concerted effort ourselves as a program
 
00:37:01.069 --> 00:37:01.079 align:start position:0%
to reach out to all of those facility
 
00:37:02.950 --> 00:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
types to make sure they know to report
 
00:37:05.710 --> 00:37:05.720 align:start position:0%
so some of the data could be skewed if
 
00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:06.960 align:start position:0%
facilities that may have high
 
00:37:08.910 --> 00:37:08.920 align:start position:0%
vaccination rates actually didn't didn't
 
00:37:11.510 --> 00:37:11.520 align:start position:0%
report um so we don't have a full
 
00:37:13.950 --> 00:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
comprehensive look for all of them uh we
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
will work closely with our colleagues in
 
00:37:17.910 --> 00:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
other areas and we do provide this data
 
00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:19.800 align:start position:0%
to our immunization colleagues to be
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
able to provide education and resources
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
for healthcare workers so they can make
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
informed decisions for themselves just a
 
00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
commment I mean you can't go go to a
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
grocery store or Pharmacy without seeing
 
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:35.160 align:start position:0%
a sign in the window saying fre blue
 
00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:38.000 align:start position:0%
shot is your vaccine yeah so it's so
 
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:39.349 align:start position:0%
shot is your vaccine yeah so it's so
easy

00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
easy
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
convenient and
 
00:37:44.470 --> 00:37:44.480 align:start position:0%
inexpensive I just
 
00:37:47.069 --> 00:37:47.079 align:start position:0%
wonder why the raids are so it's good
 
00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
and this is also self-reporting too so
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
you know we could be missing some Nuance
 
00:37:52.870 --> 00:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
there with if people didn't run a report
 
00:37:55.349 --> 00:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
or self-report for themselves thank you
 
00:37:58.589 --> 00:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
Senator gray um I'm I want to give Mr
 
00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
Williams a go do um the chair's question
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
about whether the Improvement was
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
statistically um important or not uh I
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
think that there are people in the
 
00:38:12.870 --> 00:38:12.880 align:start position:0%
department who might be able to answer
 
00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
that question and figure out what the
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
control limits on this process is and
 
00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:21.040 align:start position:0%
actually tell us that so if you would at
 
00:38:22.870 --> 00:38:22.880 align:start position:0%
least come back and tell me whether you
 
00:38:24.910 --> 00:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
have or don't have the people that that
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
could do that analysis I would certainly
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
appreci appreciate that we do we're well
 
00:38:30.309 --> 00:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
staffed with some very strong
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
epidemiologists and several people
 
00:38:33.910 --> 00:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
behind you are pointing to you
 
00:38:36.990 --> 00:38:37.000 align:start position:0%
volunteering you to do this again you
 
00:38:40.550 --> 00:38:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's the statistician and
 
00:38:42.309 --> 00:38:42.319 align:start position:0%
those that can develop the control
 
00:38:45.069 --> 00:38:45.079 align:start position:0%
limits on the process that allows you to
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
answer the question that the chair asks
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
so and I think that's something I would
 
00:38:51.870 --> 00:38:51.880 align:start position:0%
like to look more into we have explored
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
looking at vaccination and outbreaks
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
we've also looked at um
 
00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680 align:start position:0%
how like how can we really pull
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves out and see are we making a
 
00:39:05.069 --> 00:39:05.079 align:start position:0%
change among this puzzle of many other
 
00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
partners also working to reduce knee
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
infections for example that is something
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
we'd like to do more of I think the
 
00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:16.880 align:start position:0%
challenge is our Staffing Resources
 
00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:18.920 align:start position:0%
having to often be redirected to
 
00:39:21.069 --> 00:39:21.079 align:start position:0%
outbreak response and when we are
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
redirected it really is challenging to
 
00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:25.680 align:start position:0%
pull ourselves out of a very in-depth
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
analysis project but Senator GR
 
00:39:28.750 --> 00:39:28.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate your feedback and we will
 
00:39:30.150 --> 00:39:30.160 align:start position:0%
look into that and we'll bring it back
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
to the best of our ability for for the
 
00:39:34.190 --> 00:39:34.200 align:start position:0%
liberal arts guide a piggyback on the
 
00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
engineer if you can identify a few
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
things that seem really to have made a
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
difference the medical facility of which
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
I'm part-time CEO would like to
 
00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:46.040 align:start position:0%
implement those things so this is a this
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
is um spiraling for the
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
good other
 
00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative uh
 
00:40:00.030 --> 00:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
Edwards I I'm going to um look at the
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
data here and and tell you I'm a little
 
00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
bit confused by something and maybe
 
00:40:09.870 --> 00:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
maybe you can clarify it for me uh uh we
 
00:40:13.710 --> 00:40:13.720 align:start position:0%
predicted uh increased or we predicted
 
00:40:16.589 --> 00:40:16.599 align:start position:0%
more infections that than we actually
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
observed um in a year in which the
 
00:40:25.710 --> 00:40:25.720 align:start position:0%
vaccination rate went down for the flu
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
and and we have some of the these
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
hospitals like Memorial at
 
00:40:33.670 --> 00:40:33.680 align:start position:0%
88.3% uh several of them below or in the
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
70s and below and I'm just wondering if
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh there's an in if we've got the right
 
00:40:43.200 --> 00:40:44.990 align:start position:0%
uh there's an in if we've got the right
correlation

00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
correlation
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
between wanting to have the vaccine and
 
00:40:50.109 --> 00:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
expecting it to make a difference in the
 
00:40:52.470 --> 00:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
infection rate because this little bit
 
00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:55.480 align:start position:0%
of data makes me question whether or not
 
00:40:58.190 --> 00:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
there's an authentic correl
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
between a high vaccination rate in the
 
00:41:02.750 --> 00:41:02.760 align:start position:0%
hospital and whether or not it's
 
00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:05.319 align:start position:0%
positively influencing observed
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
infections do do you do you correlate
 
00:41:10.510 --> 00:41:10.520 align:start position:0%
this like Memorial Hospital do we know
 
00:41:13.069 --> 00:41:13.079 align:start position:0%
how many observed infections occurred
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
per that
 
00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
hospital that is an amazing question and
 
00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
I I really appreciate you for bringing
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
it up so the influence of vaccination
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
rates and that tracking is really it's a
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
best practice measure just like
 
00:41:29.950 --> 00:41:29.960 align:start position:0%
antimicrobial prophylaxis Administration
 
00:41:32.790 --> 00:41:32.800 align:start position:0%
they are good practices to ensure
 
00:41:34.829 --> 00:41:34.839 align:start position:0%
patient safety but they aren't cause and
 
00:41:36.790 --> 00:41:36.800 align:start position:0%
effect to these infections that you're
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
looking at in the report I think where
 
00:41:40.790 --> 00:41:40.800 align:start position:0%
you may we would want to do a little
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
more research into it and and digging is
 
00:41:45.150 --> 00:41:45.160 align:start position:0%
looking at outbreaks that may have
 
00:41:47.270 --> 00:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
occurred in that facility uh of
 
00:41:49.390 --> 00:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
influenza For That season that we
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
actually have that vaccination rate for
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
this law does not tie those together but
 
00:41:57.790 --> 00:41:57.800 align:start position:0%
it is something we have explored and we
 
00:42:01.829 --> 00:42:01.839 align:start position:0%
want to look into um so there isn't a
 
00:42:04.270 --> 00:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
direct cause and effect but there's also
 
00:42:06.790 --> 00:42:06.800 align:start position:0%
very specific ways to calculate this
 
00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:08.319 align:start position:0%
this the numbers that you see in front
 
00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:10.480 align:start position:0%
of you yeah um the facilities have to
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
report with these very stringent
 
00:42:15.309 --> 00:42:15.319 align:start position:0%
standards of what meets a criteria of an
 
00:42:17.630 --> 00:42:17.640 align:start position:0%
infection and these infections are like
 
00:42:19.309 --> 00:42:19.319 align:start position:0%
bacterial infections after a knee
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
surgery which are not the same as um
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
influenza but there are certain Pro so
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
it's a mix of process measures and
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
infection me measures and they not they
 
00:42:31.270 --> 00:42:31.280 align:start position:0%
don't all go hand inand together right
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
so so if I may just to follow up uh so
 
00:42:38.950 --> 00:42:38.960 align:start position:0%
um the implication of having the data in
 
00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040 align:start position:0%
the same report is that it's one of the
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
things uh that is a positive influence
 
00:42:47.470 --> 00:42:47.480 align:start position:0%
on managing the infection and there
 
00:42:50.030 --> 00:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be just from this high
 
00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
level correlation of the data to suggest
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
that and this goes back to Senator Rosen
 
00:42:57.829 --> 00:42:57.839 align:start position:0%
wald's question how do we get the
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
influenza vaccination rate up higher I'm
 
00:43:03.790 --> 00:43:03.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that's important from
 
00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:04.950 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that that's important from
this

00:43:04.950 --> 00:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:43:07.950 --> 00:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
report and I will I will note we are
 
00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:09.520 align:start position:0%
looking at all these measures these are
 
00:43:12.069 --> 00:43:12.079 align:start position:0%
all very much specific in our rules and
 
00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:13.960 align:start position:0%
our statute and we may not need to
 
00:43:16.270 --> 00:43:16.280 align:start position:0%
collect all these measures um the
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
surgical Care Improvement ones from the
 
00:43:20.190 --> 00:43:20.200 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery centers they've
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
consistently been higher high high
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
percentage and we've seen that since
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
2012 is that worth the return on
 
00:43:28.829 --> 00:43:28.839 align:start position:0%
investment I don't know I think we'd
 
00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:30.720 align:start position:0%
like to revise and look at some of them
 
00:43:32.510 --> 00:43:32.520 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
m representative Woods oh thank you Mr
 
00:43:38.589 --> 00:43:38.599 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm GNA ask a couple questions
 
00:43:40.309 --> 00:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
just for clarification I have not a
 
00:43:43.790 --> 00:43:43.800 align:start position:0%
chance to really look at and digest so
 
00:43:46.549 --> 00:43:46.559 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of information and I'm new to
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
the committee as well um the first
 
00:43:54.030 --> 00:43:54.040 align:start position:0%
question was um when you uh identify U
 
00:43:57.190 --> 00:43:57.200 align:start position:0%
infections for ambulatory centers are
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
these truly freestanding or or uh like
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
conquered Orthopedics used to have one
 
00:44:07.470 --> 00:44:07.480 align:start position:0%
in-house uh Bedford uh but now hospitals
 
00:44:09.349 --> 00:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
have ambulatory surgeries with within
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
the hospital now are the ones in the
 
00:44:13.990 --> 00:44:14.000 align:start position:0%
hospital a
 
00:44:16.150 --> 00:44:16.160 align:start position:0%
hospital or are they an ambulatory
 
00:44:19.470 --> 00:44:19.480 align:start position:0%
surgicals I think go ahead for that
 
00:44:21.190 --> 00:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
question that's a really good question
 
00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
so they are based on lure status so it's
 
00:44:26.549 --> 00:44:26.559 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Surgery C is licensed under
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
the RS say 151 so majority of them I
 
00:44:31.950 --> 00:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
think are freestanding I think there may
 
00:44:34.390 --> 00:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
have been one that was embedded or close
 
00:44:35.390 --> 00:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
to a
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
facility so the ones that follow yes um
 
00:44:42.630 --> 00:44:42.640 align:start position:0%
so the ones that are in truly in
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
hospital that are ambulatory providing
 
00:44:48.190 --> 00:44:48.200 align:start position:0%
the same services that a freestanding
 
00:44:51.230 --> 00:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
with they're categorized with a
 
00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:53.839 align:start position:0%
hospital they they are not probably
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
included in these reports if they are
 
00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
under the hospital lure because those
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
measures in the Ambulatory Surgery
 
00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
component are different for the
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
freestanding ones than the hospital
 
00:45:06.829 --> 00:45:06.839 align:start position:0%
measures so there's different um so for
 
00:45:09.309 --> 00:45:09.319 align:start position:0%
hospitals for example there's surgery
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
site infections following knee abdominal
 
00:45:14.790 --> 00:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
hysterectomy colon and um coronary
 
00:45:17.030 --> 00:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
artery bypass procedures and Ambulatory
 
00:45:19.069 --> 00:45:19.079 align:start position:0%
Surgery centers those are really very um
 
00:45:20.270 --> 00:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
invasive procedures with the
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
freestanding clinics we worked with
 
00:45:24.549 --> 00:45:24.559 align:start position:0%
ambul surger Ambulatory Surgery centers
 
00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:26.800 align:start position:0%
and so they report certain breast hernia
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
and open reduction of fracture
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
procedures so it really does depend on
 
00:45:33.829 --> 00:45:33.839 align:start position:0%
the lure um so if they are a facility
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
and they do ambulatory outpatient Same
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
Day Care procedures but if it's under a
 
00:45:41.990 --> 00:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
hospital license they would not be
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
included in this report yeah I was my
 
00:45:48.069 --> 00:45:48.079 align:start position:0%
concern because as we transition to more
 
00:45:48.079 --> 00:45:49.589 align:start position:0%
concern because as we transition to more
ambulatory

00:45:49.589 --> 00:45:49.599 align:start position:0%
ambulatory
 
00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:52.480 align:start position:0%
surgeries the risks that are involved
 
00:45:54.150 --> 00:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
with an ambulatory patient versus an
 
00:45:56.589 --> 00:45:56.599 align:start position:0%
in-house patient is is different as good
 
00:45:59.190 --> 00:45:59.200 align:start position:0%
to have that kind of that other followup
 
00:46:01.190 --> 00:46:01.200 align:start position:0%
if I could yes
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
um um if if someone has u in a a total
 
00:46:10.270 --> 00:46:10.280 align:start position:0%
hip arthroplasty and they have a
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
infection six months later and they're
 
00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
admitted they have an infection how is
 
00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:16.950 align:start position:0%
admitted they have an infection how is
that

00:46:16.950 --> 00:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:19.750 --> 00:46:19.760 align:start position:0%
categorized so it's excellent question I
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
I wish I brought all the definitions in
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
front of me for you um so we don't we
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
don't track hip procedures though that
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
has been discussed if that's something
 
00:46:28.510 --> 00:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
that should considered but basically it
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
depends if if they have any um record or
 
00:46:34.510 --> 00:46:34.520 align:start position:0%
documentation that there was maybe an
 
00:46:36.549 --> 00:46:36.559 align:start position:0%
infection immediately after their
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
procedure so even if it was superficial
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
on their skin and then 6 months later it
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
became a really deep infection that may
 
00:46:46.549 --> 00:46:46.559 align:start position:0%
be included but there's various criteria
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
of time cut off so it may be within 30
 
00:46:50.710 --> 00:46:50.720 align:start position:0%
days they're no longer counted as an
 
00:46:52.630 --> 00:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
infection but you need to have some sort
 
00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:54.800 align:start position:0%
of medical documentation that indicates
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
that there was an infection Brewing
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
before they can really count it in
 
00:47:01.109 --> 00:47:01.119 align:start position:0%
infection um and there's a lot of um
 
00:47:02.750 --> 00:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of stop Gap measures within the
 
00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
system that collects this information
 
00:47:06.150 --> 00:47:06.160 align:start position:0%
that guys reporters to make sure that
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
they follow the criteria to a tea well
 
00:47:10.750 --> 00:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
well thank you I just would would like
 
00:47:13.589 --> 00:47:13.599 align:start position:0%
to offer another comment I I think it's
 
00:47:15.470 --> 00:47:15.480 align:start position:0%
really important because as as I was
 
00:47:17.589 --> 00:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
alluding there's a lot more surgeries
 
00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
being done and to
 
00:47:22.470 --> 00:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
differentiate uh to and so for the
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
practicing physician to be able to know
 
00:47:26.990 --> 00:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
is this number really applicable to my
 
00:47:29.950 --> 00:47:29.960 align:start position:0%
patient surgery or inpatient U because
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
right now we're start we're doing U
 
00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
total hips now
 
00:47:37.990 --> 00:47:38.000 align:start position:0%
outpatient um when I was in training for
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
to to have thought back when I was in
 
00:47:41.309 --> 00:47:41.319 align:start position:0%
training this would be done as an
 
00:47:43.630 --> 00:47:43.640 align:start position:0%
outpatient uh but this is going to be
 
00:47:47.589 --> 00:47:47.599 align:start position:0%
crucially important uh in this process I
 
00:47:49.030 --> 00:47:49.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
 
00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:50.710 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you
representative

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.390 align:start position:0%
representative
representative

00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:55.390 --> 00:47:55.400 align:start position:0%
Weber thank you and this is again
 
00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:57.000 align:start position:0%
because I've been scribbling enough not
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
looking through your report which is
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
what I would do if I wasn't no no no no
 
00:48:03.309 --> 00:48:03.319 align:start position:0%
it's not that it's it's a question that
 
00:48:05.109 --> 00:48:05.119 align:start position:0%
I just don't want to seem to be being
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
inattentive but um I'm following up on
 
00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:09.790 align:start position:0%
inattentive but um I'm following up on
representative

00:48:09.790 --> 00:48:09.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:48:14.430 --> 00:48:14.440 align:start position:0%
Edward's questions about flu
 
00:48:19.150 --> 00:48:19.160 align:start position:0%
vaccines um does the report because all
 
00:48:21.549 --> 00:48:21.559 align:start position:0%
that I'm hearing you talk about are
 
00:48:23.430 --> 00:48:23.440 align:start position:0%
infections of the sort that I think of
 
00:48:26.349 --> 00:48:26.359 align:start position:0%
as being bacterial or or surgical
 
00:48:26.359 --> 00:48:27.309 align:start position:0%
as being bacterial or or surgical
related

00:48:27.309 --> 00:48:27.319 align:start position:0%
related
 
00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
does the report also talk about
 
00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:30.910 align:start position:0%
does the report also talk about
influenza

00:48:30.910 --> 00:48:30.920 align:start position:0%
influenza
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
outbreaks it does not it's not required
 
00:48:35.790 --> 00:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
under this particular law so we only
 
00:48:38.710 --> 00:48:38.720 align:start position:0%
report on what's under the RSA 15132
 
00:48:41.589 --> 00:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
through 34 so follow up so there is
 
00:48:44.829 --> 00:48:44.839 align:start position:0%
nothing that would would uh provide
 
00:48:47.589 --> 00:48:47.599 align:start position:0%
information on that correlation that in
 
00:48:49.829 --> 00:48:49.839 align:start position:0%
your report because that's not what this
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
is intended to do correct it's not in
 
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:54.069 align:start position:0%
is intended to do correct it's not in
this

00:48:54.069 --> 00:48:54.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:48:58.150 --> 00:48:58.160 align:start position:0%
report anyone else yes senator wal also
 
00:49:01.030 --> 00:49:01.040 align:start position:0%
following up on representative Edward's
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
question we know that about
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
10% of the residents at the Veterans
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
Home die from influenza every year um do
 
00:49:18.030 --> 00:49:18.040 align:start position:0%
we know what that death rate is in the
 
00:49:21.549 --> 00:49:21.559 align:start position:0%
rest of long-term care
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
facilities that's a good question so
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll put on my my other um hat out
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
of my other work which is kind of our
 
00:49:30.270 --> 00:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
surveillance of other infectious
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
diseases influenza alone is not a
 
00:49:34.710 --> 00:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
reportable condition in public health so
 
00:49:36.990 --> 00:49:37.000 align:start position:0%
we do not track influenza cases across
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
across the state so it is really hard
 
00:49:41.150 --> 00:49:41.160 align:start position:0%
for us to know when we get reports of
 
00:49:43.870 --> 00:49:43.880 align:start position:0%
outbreaks is this on par with the rest
 
00:49:46.270 --> 00:49:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the data across the state that said
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
it is required to report certain
 
00:49:49.589 --> 00:49:49.599 align:start position:0%
outbreaks or clusters of infectious
 
00:49:51.829 --> 00:49:51.839 align:start position:0%
disease including influenza so if we do
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
track outbreaks and clusters if there
 
00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
was um if there was interest we could
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
always pull a data request on that but
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
we we may not necessarily have total
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
count in those clusters or outbreaks of
 
00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
all those ill and then those who aren't
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
ill to be able to get um a a rate of
 
00:50:13.910 --> 00:50:13.920 align:start position:0%
infection we should be able to provide a
 
00:50:17.309 --> 00:50:17.319 align:start position:0%
mortality rate of those outbreaks or of
 
00:50:20.030 --> 00:50:20.040 align:start position:0%
the season um but Where It's Tricky is
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
not everyone will have testing and not
 
00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
everyone may show signs and symptoms but
 
00:50:25.630 --> 00:50:25.640 align:start position:0%
we can do our best to try to pull that
 
00:50:27.230 --> 00:50:27.240 align:start position:0%
by season
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:34.069 --> 00:50:34.079 align:start position:0%
though seeing No Hands thank you for
 
00:50:35.710 --> 00:50:35.720 align:start position:0%
your report thank you so much for all
 
00:50:37.549 --> 00:50:37.559 align:start position:0%
your qu great qu and and very
 
00:50:39.390 --> 00:50:39.400 align:start position:0%
inquisitive questions thank you and just
 
00:50:40.829 --> 00:50:40.839 align:start position:0%
remember they volunteered you for
 
00:50:43.549 --> 00:50:43.559 align:start position:0%
something uh
 
00:50:47.910 --> 00:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
oh Mr chair yes um I'd like to offer a
 
00:50:49.829 --> 00:50:49.839 align:start position:0%
comment just an observation that we've
 
00:50:52.630 --> 00:50:52.640 align:start position:0%
used the term correlation fairly
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
liberally well um and that's okay but
 
00:51:00.190 --> 00:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
but I think um for myself uh and I would
 
00:51:02.710 --> 00:51:02.720 align:start position:0%
encourage all of us that there there's
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
an old saying in physics that says uh
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
correlation does not mean mean CA and I
 
00:51:11.390 --> 00:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
think we sometimes if we look at data
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
and I don't I'm not trying to implied
 
00:51:15.470 --> 00:51:15.480 align:start position:0%
data is not applicable I don't mean that
 
00:51:17.549 --> 00:51:17.559 align:start position:0%
but we just something I think we as a
 
00:51:19.190 --> 00:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
committee just have to be very very
 
00:51:21.789 --> 00:51:21.799 align:start position:0%
mindful of correlations do not mean
 
00:51:24.309 --> 00:51:24.319 align:start position:0%
causation that's a Maxim in the world I
 
00:51:29.150 --> 00:51:29.160 align:start position:0%
live into thank you uh uh let's see okay
 
00:51:31.549 --> 00:51:31.559 align:start position:0%
State Health assessment and State Health
 
00:51:37.230 --> 00:51:37.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:39.870 --> 00:51:39.880 align:start position:0%
ship I won't use my shash ship
 
00:51:43.549 --> 00:51:43.559 align:start position:0%
Redemption joke because I used it last
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
year you know what you can um
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
oh we it leads to a lot of good joke
 
00:51:54.910 --> 00:51:54.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:57.309 --> 00:51:57.319 align:start position:0%
sir um so
 
00:51:59.470 --> 00:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
hello my name is Whitney Hammond I'm the

of Public Health
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
Services um and I asked our current
 
00:52:08.789 --> 00:52:08.799 align:start position:0%
chair um so the new chair of the Sha
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
ship Council to join me today so I think
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
you know most people I'm Dave Nagel I'm
 
00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.630 align:start position:0%
you know most people I'm Dave Nagel I'm
representative

00:52:16.630 --> 00:52:16.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
physician okay um and I just wanted to
 
00:52:22.230 --> 00:52:22.240 align:start position:0%
make sure people are aware so the Sha
 
00:52:25.150 --> 00:52:25.160 align:start position:0%
ship Council annual report was sent
 
00:52:27.630 --> 00:52:27.640 align:start position:0%
electronically earlier this week to you
 
00:52:29.950 --> 00:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
all and I don't have any additional
 
00:52:32.470 --> 00:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
materials that I brought in hard copy My
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
Hope was to be able to just engage and
 
00:52:37.390 --> 00:52:37.400 align:start position:0%
answer questions so to not we don't have
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
a ton of dense information to go over um
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
so to start I figured I would uh just
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of the context because
 
00:52:48.990 --> 00:52:49.000 align:start position:0%
some of you are very much familiar with
 
00:52:51.430 --> 00:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
the SHA ship Council and for some it may
 
00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
be new
 
00:52:55.230 --> 00:52:55.240 align:start position:0%
information um so the council was
 
00:52:58.270 --> 00:52:58.280 align:start position:0%
established through statute um HB
 
00:53:01.150 --> 00:53:01.160 align:start position:0%
1639 and was introduced in January of
 
00:53:04.829 --> 00:53:04.839 align:start position:0%
2020 it was signed into law July 29th
 
00:53:08.549 --> 00:53:08.559 align:start position:0%
2020 uh and established this Council and
 
00:53:11.150 --> 00:53:11.160 align:start position:0%
then in the next legislative session in
 
00:53:14.990 --> 00:53:15.000 align:start position:0%
2021 there was HB 157
 
00:53:18.430 --> 00:53:18.440 align:start position:0%
introduced um as I understand it the
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
initial intent behind that legislation
 
00:53:22.710 --> 00:53:22.720 align:start position:0%
was to eliminate the council because of
 
00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:25.799 align:start position:0%
concerns about duplication between the
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
uh community Health assessments and
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
Community Health Improvement plans that
 
00:53:32.549 --> 00:53:32.559 align:start position:0%
hospitals develop uh but through some
 
00:53:35.349 --> 00:53:35.359 align:start position:0%
back and forth and and hearings the
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
decision was made to move forward
 
00:53:39.230 --> 00:53:39.240 align:start position:0%
because it was determined to be not
 
00:53:42.270 --> 00:53:42.280 align:start position:0%
duplicative and the new legislation
 
00:53:44.230 --> 00:53:44.240 align:start position:0%
expanded the members that are on the
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
council So for anybody who's familiar
 
00:53:49.910 --> 00:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
with that um it's a very large Council
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
of 40 different appointed members um the
 
00:53:55.270 --> 00:53:55.280 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about that is with 40
 
00:53:58.789 --> 00:53:58.799 align:start position:0%
appointed members there's a very broad
 
00:54:00.990 --> 00:54:01.000 align:start position:0%
range of perspectives represented on
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
that Council so everything from um
 
00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
critical access hospitals public health
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
networks federally qualified Health
 
00:54:11.630 --> 00:54:11.640 align:start position:0%
Centers uh we have people from housing
 
00:54:16.230 --> 00:54:16.240 align:start position:0%
Transportation EMS um so it's a a large
 
00:54:20.150 --> 00:54:20.160 align:start position:0%
Council but has um so many different
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
perspectives at the
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
table um so the scope of what was in the
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
legislation for that Council to achieve
 
00:54:30.789 --> 00:54:30.799 align:start position:0%
was uh the completion of a state health
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
assessment um and the goal behind that
 
00:54:36.230 --> 00:54:36.240 align:start position:0%
was to understand health status in New
 
00:54:40.349 --> 00:54:40.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire there was a there was language
 
00:54:42.030 --> 00:54:42.040 align:start position:0%
saying that we should engage with
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
community members and gather input at a
 
00:54:47.630 --> 00:54:47.640 align:start position:0%
local level to help understand um what's
 
00:54:50.109 --> 00:54:50.119 align:start position:0%
going on in New Hampshire and that that
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
information gathering would then be used
 
00:54:55.109 --> 00:54:55.119 align:start position:0%
to identify gaps in access to care and
 
00:54:57.549 --> 00:54:57.559 align:start position:0%
services uh there was also emphasis on
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
us mapping healthc care services and
 
00:55:02.430 --> 00:55:02.440 align:start position:0%
then describing the role of all the
 
00:55:05.309 --> 00:55:05.319 align:start position:0%
different state agencies in terms of um
 
00:55:08.270 --> 00:55:08.280 align:start position:0%
impacting Health in New Hampshire so we
 
00:55:11.390 --> 00:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
did that um the so we call it the shaw
 
00:55:13.589 --> 00:55:13.599 align:start position:0%
the shaw was developed and completed in
 
00:55:16.349 --> 00:55:16.359 align:start position:0%
2020 and it is available online there's
 
00:55:19.470 --> 00:55:19.480 align:start position:0%
a a web-based version of it with live
 
00:55:22.510 --> 00:55:22.520 align:start position:0%
data dashboards the second charge of the
 
00:55:25.390 --> 00:55:25.400 align:start position:0%
council was to then take that data and
 
00:55:26.670 --> 00:55:26.680 align:start position:0%
develop what we call the the State
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
Health Improvement plan or ship um that
 
00:55:32.230 --> 00:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
was completed in
 
00:55:34.990 --> 00:55:35.000 align:start position:0%
2023 um the legislation said the ship
 
00:55:37.150 --> 00:55:37.160 align:start position:0%
needed to address how to improve health
 
00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:39.480 align:start position:0%
and wellness how to improve specific
 
00:55:41.789 --> 00:55:41.799 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes and how to optimize
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
Public Health and Human Service
 
00:55:47.829 --> 00:55:47.839 align:start position:0%
delivery um the so in the ship there
 
00:55:50.470 --> 00:55:50.480 align:start position:0%
were four broad domains identified by
 
00:55:53.109 --> 00:55:53.119 align:start position:0%
the council that needed to be addressed
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
those were access to opportunity um
 
00:55:57.549 --> 00:55:57.559 align:start position:0%
which is really looking at things like
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
do people have basic needs met do they
 
00:56:03.150 --> 00:56:03.160 align:start position:0%
have adequate food do they have adequate
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
Broadband access uh do they have
 
00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:08.200 align:start position:0%
transportation housing then there was a
 
00:56:10.510 --> 00:56:10.520 align:start position:0%
domain around community that included
 
00:56:13.270 --> 00:56:13.280 align:start position:0%
things like environmental health threats
 
00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:15.880 align:start position:0%
um whether people are safe in their
 
00:56:18.750 --> 00:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
homes as a form of community then there
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
was a domain around social connectedness
 
00:56:23.270 --> 00:56:23.280 align:start position:0%
which was talked about things like
 
00:56:26.910 --> 00:56:26.920 align:start position:0%
engaging in um voting and just Civic
 
00:56:29.109 --> 00:56:29.119 align:start position:0%
engagement and then the kind of typical
 
00:56:31.069 --> 00:56:31.079 align:start position:0%
health status and outcomes was the
 
00:56:35.589 --> 00:56:35.599 align:start position:0%
fourth domain um so the ship was
 
00:56:38.789 --> 00:56:38.799 align:start position:0%
finalized in 2023 with those domains and
 
00:56:41.109 --> 00:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
the thought of the council at that time
 
00:56:43.069 --> 00:56:43.079 align:start position:0%
was that each of the council members
 
00:56:45.870 --> 00:56:45.880 align:start position:0%
would become a champion for the ship and
 
00:56:47.390 --> 00:56:47.400 align:start position:0%
would bring the ship to their own
 
00:56:50.109 --> 00:56:50.119 align:start position:0%
organization or their own work in New
 
00:56:52.789 --> 00:56:52.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and figure out how to align
 
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:55.280 align:start position:0%
underneath the ship so I was going to
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit today about how the
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
department has done that um so as a
 
00:57:04.950 --> 00:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
result of having the finalized ship the
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
department has then identified
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
priorities underneath it and has
 
00:57:12.349 --> 00:57:12.359 align:start position:0%
developed their own internal um plan for
 
00:57:14.870 --> 00:57:14.880 align:start position:0%
how to change specific measures related
 
00:57:16.029 --> 00:57:16.039 align:start position:0%
to those
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
priorities um just to give a little more
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
detail on that uh so we have five
 
00:57:25.430 --> 00:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
priority areas that we're focusing in on
 
00:57:27.230 --> 00:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
heart disease
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
um we are focusing on maternal and child
 
00:57:32.710 --> 00:57:32.720 align:start position:0%
health child mental health sexually
 
00:57:35.270 --> 00:57:35.280 align:start position:0%
transmitted infections and environmental
 
00:57:37.990 --> 00:57:38.000 align:start position:0%
health um and then you can and those
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
priorities came from you know what where
 
00:57:42.029 --> 00:57:42.039 align:start position:0%
there were opportunities and where there
 
00:57:45.309 --> 00:57:45.319 align:start position:0%
was work being done internal to the
 
00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
department yeah which ones
 
00:57:50.950 --> 00:57:50.960 align:start position:0%
the sure um heart
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
disease uh Maternal Child
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
Health childhood Mental Health
 
00:58:01.950 --> 00:58:01.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:03.829 --> 00:58:03.839 align:start position:0%
infections and
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
then environmental
 
00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:08.829 align:start position:0%
then environmental
health

00:58:08.829 --> 00:58:08.839 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:58:11.750 --> 00:58:11.760 align:start position:0%
sure um and so it was it was sort of
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
fascinating because the council did
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
their developed the plan and then for
 
00:58:18.510 --> 00:58:18.520 align:start position:0%
the next year they did the review of The
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
Shaw and the ship which is the third
 
00:58:22.270 --> 00:58:22.280 align:start position:0%
charge from the legislation that they're
 
00:58:24.349 --> 00:58:24.359 align:start position:0%
going to annually look at is this still
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
relevant is this still what we need to
 
00:58:28.589 --> 00:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
be focused on so for the last year and I
 
00:58:30.710 --> 00:58:30.720 align:start position:0%
think that was at some point when
 
00:58:33.150 --> 00:58:33.160 align:start position:0%
representative Nagel joined us we were
 
00:58:35.349 --> 00:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
doing the work of going through and
 
00:58:37.910 --> 00:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
talking about what is the current status
 
00:58:40.029 --> 00:58:40.039 align:start position:0%
in all these different areas that the
 
00:58:43.150 --> 00:58:43.160 align:start position:0%
ship touches and interestingly enough a
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
lot of those presentations focused in on
 
00:58:48.990 --> 00:58:49.000 align:start position:0%
those five priority areas that we are
 
00:58:52.029 --> 00:58:52.039 align:start position:0%
now focused on for the Department um and
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
then I'm guessing many of you have heard
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
about the Department's road map and so
 
00:58:59.309 --> 00:58:59.319 align:start position:0%
we have worked to connect our internal
 
00:59:01.270 --> 00:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
ship to the road map so we have two
 
00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:03.160 align:start position:0%
priorities from the list that I just
 
00:59:05.630 --> 00:59:05.640 align:start position:0%
said that are clearly articulated in our
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
road map so we call it healthy babies
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
healthy moms which is the Maternal Child
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
Health and then environmental health is
 
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
also in the Department's road map um and
 
00:59:17.309 --> 00:59:17.319 align:start position:0%
some of the things that are being
 
00:59:20.470 --> 00:59:20.480 align:start position:0%
impacted uh in in our work in that area
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
are improving lead screening um giving
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
Healthcare Providers more guidance
 
00:59:28.270 --> 00:59:28.280 align:start position:0%
around pasas and how to work with their
 
00:59:31.029 --> 00:59:31.039 align:start position:0%
patients who have concerns about that
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
and then getting more moms into prenatal
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
and postnatal
 
00:59:38.109 --> 00:59:38.119 align:start position:0%
care do you have anything you'd like to
 
00:59:40.750 --> 00:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
add about what we've been working
 
00:59:44.950 --> 00:59:44.960 align:start position:0%
on um a little bit um this is exciting
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me um I think we're in a
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
little bit of a transition right now
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
which is neat because it gives us an
 
00:59:54.670 --> 00:59:54.680 align:start position:0%
opportunity to relook at where we are
 
00:59:56.589 --> 00:59:56.599 align:start position:0%
where we want to go um
 
00:59:59.109 --> 00:59:59.119 align:start position:0%
I learned my lesson about opening my
 
01:00:02.390 --> 01:00:02.400 align:start position:0%
mouth I I did ask a question at an hhsa
 
01:00:05.069 --> 01:00:05.079 align:start position:0%
meeting once where I asked them very
 
01:00:06.670 --> 01:00:06.680 align:start position:0%
specifically this looks great but where
 
01:00:08.190 --> 01:00:08.200 align:start position:0%
are we headed the next thing I know I
 
01:00:10.990 --> 01:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
got a call and I'm the vi the chair so
 
01:00:13.069 --> 01:00:13.079 align:start position:0%
um you know this is an exciting
 
01:00:17.470 --> 01:00:17.480 align:start position:0%
opportunity for me um to unite Health
 
01:00:20.589 --> 01:00:20.599 align:start position:0%
Providers and and organizations to
 
01:00:22.910 --> 01:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
basically a mutual goal of Public Health
 
01:00:25.230 --> 01:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
and something I've been interested in
 
01:00:27.589 --> 01:00:27.599 align:start position:0%
for a long time time because as you know
 
01:00:29.230 --> 01:00:29.240 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of fragmentation in our
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
Health Care system and and if this is a
 
01:00:33.230 --> 01:00:33.240 align:start position:0%
way to break down barriers that's really
 
01:00:34.270 --> 01:00:34.280 align:start position:0%
important to
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
me how's that it's great so I that's
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
what I had as an update but I'm happy to
 
01:00:46.990 --> 01:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.630 --> 01:00:50.640 align:start position:0%
have seeing none thank you thank
 
01:00:53.270 --> 01:00:53.280 align:start position:0%
you did you have written materials and
 
01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:56.079 align:start position:0%
have I lost them in my mauve paper here
 
01:00:57.549 --> 01:00:57.559 align:start position:0%
the only written I so I didn't bring
 
01:00:59.430 --> 01:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
anything in hard copy we have the
 
01:01:01.870 --> 01:01:01.880 align:start position:0%
electronic annual report that that's
 
01:01:04.430 --> 01:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
fine I just wanted to be sure I had
 
01:01:07.470 --> 01:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
linked the people and the reports to the
 
01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:09.280 align:start position:0%
extent that I could do that and can you
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
tell me your name again please because
 
01:01:12.309 --> 01:01:12.319 align:start position:0%
there were two names and I didn't write
 
01:01:13.750 --> 01:01:13.760 align:start position:0%
it down because I assumed the name would
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
be here but I don't know which one you
 
01:01:17.789 --> 01:01:17.799 align:start position:0%
are so I'm Whitney Hammond okay that I
 
01:01:19.670 --> 01:01:19.680 align:start position:0%

good thank if if I could make one more
 
01:01:23.630 --> 01:01:23.640 align:start position:0%
comment one of my priority goals is to
 
01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
change the acronym for the organization
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
to avoid future jokes at the beginning
 
01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
of meetings as you would that was an
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%

150 emails last night and I I don't know
 
01:02:05.029 --> 01:02:05.039 align:start position:0%
whether I really would like to look at
 
01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:07.559 align:start position:0%
this uh what's the correct term this
 
01:02:09.549 --> 01:02:09.559 align:start position:0%

a consequence I'm not sure that I really
 
01:02:22.510 --> 01:02:22.520 align:start position:0%

looking at it right now and it's very
 
01:02:57.029 --> 01:02:57.039 align:start position:0%
comprehensive and very impressive
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%

she wasn't Bagel it's not as bad as that
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
but that was the business I was going to
 
01:03:18.589 --> 01:03:18.599 align:start position:0%

committee I am representing Rob rodler
 
01:04:03.470 --> 01:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
my name is Elizabeth NE and my position
 
01:04:06.549 --> 01:04:06.559 align:start position:0%
is with the Adolescent program at
 
01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
dcyf as youth engagement specialist and
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's broad but part of it encompasses
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
the tuition waiver program and my name
 
01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
Coello so um I'm not going to read the
 
01:04:26.109 --> 01:04:26.119 align:start position:0%
whole report to you I am going to to
 
01:04:29.069 --> 01:04:29.079 align:start position:0%
highlight some things that I think are
 
01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:32.799 align:start position:0%
important as we look at the program and
 
01:04:32.799 --> 01:04:34.069 align:start position:0%
important as we look at the program and
its

01:04:34.069 --> 01:04:34.079 align:start position:0%
its
 
01:04:37.309 --> 01:04:37.319 align:start position:0%
success we continue to see a significant
 
01:04:39.470 --> 01:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
positive change to the tuition waiver
 
01:04:41.470 --> 01:04:41.480 align:start position:0%
program through the passage of house
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
bill to FN a local when our youth-driven
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
work with the state legislature created
 
01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
a welcomed expansion of the program
 
01:04:55.069 --> 01:04:55.079 align:start position:0%
these changes included increasing the
 
01:04:58.150 --> 01:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
number of wavers per system community
 
01:05:02.150 --> 01:05:02.160 align:start position:0%
college and university from 15 to
 
01:05:05.630 --> 01:05:05.640 align:start position:0%
35 moving the age limitation for
 
01:05:09.950 --> 01:05:09.960 align:start position:0%
application from 23 to 26 because we
 
01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:13.760 align:start position:0%
know all youth do not follow traditional
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
patterns of higher
 
01:05:21.670 --> 01:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
ed uh we allowed youth who left DCF care
 
01:05:24.150 --> 01:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
for Guardianship and remain in
 
01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:27.200 align:start position:0%
guardianship until the the age of 18 or
 
01:05:29.750 --> 01:05:29.760 align:start position:0%
who were placed with a relative out of
 
01:05:32.829 --> 01:05:32.839 align:start position:0%
state to be eligible for the
 
01:05:36.150 --> 01:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
waiver this year there was an
 
01:05:40.029 --> 01:05:40.039 align:start position:0%
unprecedented 84 certified applicants
 
01:05:43.390 --> 01:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
for the tuition waiver program by
 
01:05:46.510 --> 01:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
comparison there were 68 in
 
01:05:49.870 --> 01:05:49.880 align:start position:0%
24 49 in
 
01:05:53.670 --> 01:05:53.680 align:start position:0%

paying their their tuition to go yes um
 
01:10:09.270 --> 01:10:09.280 align:start position:0%

01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
gratitude on the basis of the re
 
01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:14.320 align:start position:0%

01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
there's any in if there's a way for them
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
to explicitly give back to the program
 
01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:24.960 align:start position:0%
somehow is there a way for them to after
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
they've gone on they become successful
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%

01:10:34.510 --> 01:10:34.520 align:start position:0%
specific program to help the next wave
 
01:10:37.669 --> 01:10:37.679 align:start position:0%

01:10:42.310 --> 01:10:42.320 align:start position:0%
consideration at this point I don't
 
01:10:46.430 --> 01:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
believe that that exists so you know um
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
our youth give back in other ways by
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%

01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
actually appointed till yesterday so
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
some of us are a little behind in terms
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.950 --> 01:15:12.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:15.870 --> 01:15:15.880 align:start position:0%

01:15:17.550 --> 01:15:17.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:21.360 align:start position:0%
3255 Health officers in the state 199 of
 
01:15:22.870 --> 01:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
those Health officers are a member of
 
01:15:25.629 --> 01:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
our association
 
01:15:28.030 --> 01:15:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh one of our focuses for this year is
 
01:15:29.270 --> 01:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
Health offic
 
01:15:31.270 --> 01:15:31.280 align:start position:0%
collaboration uh in addition to being
 
01:15:34.350 --> 01:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
the secretary to the local Board of
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
Health uh we also uh meet and work with
 
01:15:41.550 --> 01:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
other members of the community such as
 
01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh firefight Fire Chiefs uh Town
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
administrators code enforcement and so
 
01:15:50.629 --> 01:15:50.639 align:start position:0%
forth State and regionally we do work
 
01:15:52.950 --> 01:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the public health networks Dees
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
DHHS food protection adult and child
 
01:15:59.229 --> 01:15:59.239 align:start position:0%
services and a number of other
 
01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
agencies uh this support report uh shows
 
01:16:05.790 --> 01:16:05.800 align:start position:0%
the Readiness to respond to health uh
 
01:16:08.390 --> 01:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
threats such as involvement with the
 
01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:09.229 align:start position:0%
threats such as involvement with the
health

01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:16:11.550 --> 01:16:11.560 align:start position:0%
network uh we are heavily involved in
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
training three-hour training initials uh
 
01:16:16.990 --> 01:16:17.000 align:start position:0%
Health officer trainings on roles and
 
01:16:19.669 --> 01:16:19.679 align:start position:0%
responsibilities continuing education
 
01:16:23.470 --> 01:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
and health officer additional uh two a
 
01:16:25.709 --> 01:16:25.719 align:start position:0%
year training sessions as well as
 
01:16:27.590 --> 01:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
webinars uh do you want to speak a
 
01:16:30.189 --> 01:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
little bit about training
 
01:16:34.470 --> 01:16:34.480 align:start position:0%
sessions sure um hello chair and members
 
01:16:36.270 --> 01:16:36.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Sophia
 
01:16:38.310 --> 01:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
Johnson and I lead the health officer
 
01:16:40.709 --> 01:16:40.719 align:start position:0%
liaison program at the department to
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
just step back a little bit this is a
 
01:16:45.950 --> 01:16:45.960 align:start position:0%
really unique report in the fact that um
 
01:16:49.270 --> 01:16:49.280 align:start position:0%
the legislature in 2021 wanted to get a
 
01:16:51.590 --> 01:16:51.600 align:start position:0%
better idea of how ready our Municipal
 
01:16:53.950 --> 01:16:53.960 align:start position:0%
Health officers were to respond to local
 
01:16:56.350 --> 01:16:56.360 align:start position:0%
threats in their community ities um so
 
01:16:58.390 --> 01:16:58.400 align:start position:0%
this requirement brought together the
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
health officer Association and the
 
01:17:02.270 --> 01:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
department who who both work with this
 
01:17:05.470 --> 01:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
group of officials to figure out what is
 
01:17:07.550 --> 01:17:07.560 align:start position:0%
that Readiness so this report is really
 
01:17:09.350 --> 01:17:09.360 align:start position:0%
a joint effort between the health
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
officer Association and the department
 
01:17:14.310 --> 01:17:14.320 align:start position:0%
to gauge the Readiness um at a a on a
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
yearly interval um so as Wayne was
 
01:17:19.510 --> 01:17:19.520 align:start position:0%
saying uh the department does have um
 
01:17:21.990 --> 01:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
very strong training initiatives this
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
local Workforce um as the report
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
describes is primarily volunteer and if
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
they're not volunteers they're often
 
01:17:30.790 --> 01:17:30.800 align:start position:0%
serving in multiple Municipal roles in
 
01:17:33.310 --> 01:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
their community so it's a very important
 
01:17:35.149 --> 01:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
position in terms of being able to
 
01:17:37.510 --> 01:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
respond to public health issues but
 
01:17:39.990 --> 01:17:40.000 align:start position:0%
they're often stretched to work in other
 
01:17:41.590 --> 01:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
Municipal roles we find that they're
 
01:17:43.950 --> 01:17:43.960 align:start position:0%
often also the fire chief or also the
 
01:17:46.110 --> 01:17:46.120 align:start position:0%
building code inspector and they come
 
01:17:49.110 --> 01:17:49.120 align:start position:0%
into this role with not necessarily a
 
01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
wide range of of understanding of
 
01:17:54.149 --> 01:17:54.159 align:start position:0%
environmental health and public threats
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
um so our our role is to really bring
 
01:17:58.830 --> 01:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
those Health officers up to speed and
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
provide the training that they need to
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
be effective in their roles um so this
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
year in particular what our program is
 
01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:08.360 align:start position:0%
really focusing on is making um
 
01:18:10.950 --> 01:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
connections to other state programs to
 
01:18:12.629 --> 01:18:12.639 align:start position:0%
provide more sufficient and more
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
comprehensive training um as you may be
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
aware Health officers can respond to
 
01:18:19.270 --> 01:18:19.280 align:start position:0%
things like septic failures and they can
 
01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
also respond to hoarding conditions so
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
as a result they work with a lot of
 
01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
different state agents ranging from the
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Ed um to subsurface over
 
01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
at Dees um so we are working
 
01:18:32.430 --> 01:18:32.440 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with all those State
 
01:18:34.709 --> 01:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
programs to figure out how can we build
 
01:18:36.709 --> 01:18:36.719 align:start position:0%
a really comprehensive training schedule
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
um training plan and that's something I
 
01:18:41.030 --> 01:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
think that this report really highlights
 
01:18:43.550 --> 01:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
this year is the success of building
 
01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.470 align:start position:0%
this year is the success of building
those

01:18:44.470 --> 01:18:44.480 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:18:46.510 --> 01:18:46.520 align:start position:0%
collaborations um the other thing I do
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
want to touch on in this report is um we
 
01:18:52.189 --> 01:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
generated the content of this report
 
01:18:54.310 --> 01:18:54.320 align:start position:0%
from suring local Health officers so
 
01:18:56.310 --> 01:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
this is not not just the health officer
 
01:18:58.070 --> 01:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
Association and the department sitting
 
01:19:00.110 --> 01:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
around a table writing this report this
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
is generated from the communities and
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
from the local Health officers and what
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
they're telling us um are those main
 
01:19:08.910 --> 01:19:08.920 align:start position:0%
threats that you can see at the end of
 
01:19:11.110 --> 01:19:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the report they don't have the
 
01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
capacity necessarily to respond to what
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
they need to in their communities um
 
01:19:18.149 --> 01:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that they are
 
01:19:19.870 --> 01:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
volunteer or they are serving in
 
01:19:21.270 --> 01:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
multiple um
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
roles um they respond to a lot of
 
01:19:25.590 --> 01:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
different issues like septic failures
 
01:19:27.430 --> 01:19:27.440 align:start position:0%
that they say are just occurring very
 
01:19:29.070 --> 01:19:29.080 align:start position:0%
frequently to what they've seen in the
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
past and they need more support so
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
that's why we're building relationships
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
with Dees to provide that additional
 
01:19:38.350 --> 01:19:38.360 align:start position:0%
support um if you have any other
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
questions yeah I'm I'm happy to take
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
them at this time Wayne did you have
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
anything else to add no I just want to
 
01:19:46.390 --> 01:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh uh comment that the public health
 
01:19:47.830 --> 01:19:47.840 align:start position:0%
threats which are identified in the
 
01:19:50.470 --> 01:19:50.480 align:start position:0%
report include housing issues such as
 
01:19:52.790 --> 01:19:52.800 align:start position:0%
safe and sanitary housing rental house
 
01:19:55.310 --> 01:19:55.320 align:start position:0%
conditions inadequate zoning
 
01:19:57.709 --> 01:19:57.719 align:start position:0%
septic system compliance like Sophia
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned addressing the fail SE septic
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
systems and coordinating with Dees
 
01:20:05.990 --> 01:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
subservice Bureau nuisances such as
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
odors noises septic trash junk yards and
 
01:20:12.830 --> 01:20:12.840 align:start position:0%
so forth and lack of capacity as Sophia
 
01:20:14.990 --> 01:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned many of the health officers
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
are wearing several different hats or
 
01:20:18.669 --> 01:20:18.679 align:start position:0%
serve on a volunteer
 
01:20:22.870 --> 01:20:22.880 align:start position:0%
basis uh this is a shared position uh 86
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
full-time Health offices are most in the
 
01:20:28.629 --> 01:20:28.639 align:start position:0%
cities of the State uh 57 P time and
 
01:20:32.110 --> 01:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
there's 72 volunteer Health offices and
 
01:20:34.510 --> 01:20:34.520 align:start position:0%
that has to do with inadequate budgets
 
01:20:36.910 --> 01:20:36.920 align:start position:0%
and there is no state or federal uh
 
01:20:39.950 --> 01:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
support for the health offices I have a
 
01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
question uh I represent several towns so
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
I do not know who the local Health
 
01:20:48.830 --> 01:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
officer is in each one how do I find out
 
01:20:51.189 --> 01:20:51.199 align:start position:0%
that's a great question um so every town
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire under RSA 128 is
 
01:20:55.510 --> 01:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
required to have a health office officer
 
01:20:58.270 --> 01:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
um and our department is responsible for
 
01:20:59.950 --> 01:20:59.960 align:start position:0%
receiving nominations from towns and
 
01:21:02.189 --> 01:21:02.199 align:start position:0%
conducting those appointments so because
 
01:21:05.629 --> 01:21:05.639 align:start position:0%
of that process we do publish monthly a
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
report on our website that highlights um
 
01:21:10.590 --> 01:21:10.600 align:start position:0%
the health officers for each town and
 
01:21:12.590 --> 01:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
their contact information so I am happy
 
01:21:14.590 --> 01:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
to share that link with you thank you
 
01:21:16.070 --> 01:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
you're welcome other questions
 
01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.430 align:start position:0%
you're welcome other questions

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
Weber so w would things like um
 
01:21:24.030 --> 01:21:24.040 align:start position:0%
infestation of bed bugs and Rental
 
01:21:27.229 --> 01:21:27.239 align:start position:0%
housing fall within your purview yes
 
01:21:29.270 --> 01:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you that's a great question
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
yes Senator gray I now have an answer
 
01:21:34.350 --> 01:21:34.360 align:start position:0%
for a
 
01:21:37.310 --> 01:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
constituent page three section one where
 
01:21:41.070 --> 01:21:41.080 align:start position:0%
you list I can't tell whether the 19
 
01:21:45.030 --> 01:21:45.040 align:start position:0%
vacancies are Health officers Deputy
 
01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:48.080 align:start position:0%
Health officers Etc so I don't know if
 
01:21:50.270 --> 01:21:50.280 align:start position:0%
there's 19 communities you know from
 
01:21:52.430 --> 01:21:52.440 align:start position:0%
this report from from the other report
 
01:21:54.870 --> 01:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you said is available yes I
 
01:21:56.750 --> 01:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
probably could glean that information
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
but if it's there a difference between
 
01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
if it's 19 communities don't have health
 
01:22:05.510 --> 01:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
officers at all or 19 communities don't
 
01:22:08.270 --> 01:22:08.280 align:start position:0%
have Deputy Health officers but normally
 
01:22:10.790 --> 01:22:10.800 align:start position:0%
have them that makes a big difference
 
01:22:12.750 --> 01:22:12.760 align:start position:0%
and the report I don't think really
 
01:22:14.669 --> 01:22:14.679 align:start position:0%
tells me that that's a great question
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
and we will make that note for next year
 
01:22:19.149 --> 01:22:19.159 align:start position:0%
and we will add that um clarification
 
01:22:21.470 --> 01:22:21.480 align:start position:0%
that number is the um the communities
 
01:22:23.790 --> 01:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
that don't have a health officer so that
 
01:22:25.510 --> 01:22:25.520 align:start position:0%
they are towns are required to have a
 
01:22:27.110 --> 01:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
health officer they're not necessarily
 
01:22:29.189 --> 01:22:29.199 align:start position:0%
required to have a deputy Health officer
 
01:22:30.870 --> 01:22:30.880 align:start position:0%
so if there are 19 communities that
 
01:22:32.550 --> 01:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
don't have um a health officer it is
 
01:22:34.950 --> 01:22:34.960 align:start position:0%
that Primary Health officer and in those
 
01:22:37.550 --> 01:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
situations um our office is aware of
 
01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:40.480 align:start position:0%
those um vacancies and our staff reach
 
01:22:42.350 --> 01:22:42.360 align:start position:0%
out to the towns and have conversations
 
01:22:45.070 --> 01:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
with them on progress to to nominating
 
01:22:47.870 --> 01:22:47.880 align:start position:0%
another Health officer um in situations
 
01:22:49.910 --> 01:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
where if an emergency were to arise in
 
01:22:52.430 --> 01:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
those towns um adjacent Health officers
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
so in surrounding communities are giving
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
and the ability to go into those towns
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
and respond so there's still that um
 
01:23:02.629 --> 01:23:02.639 align:start position:0%
option yes follow up um and that's
 
01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
another part in the uh changes that we
 
01:23:08.189 --> 01:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
did to the health officer statute last
 
01:23:10.790 --> 01:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
year uh one of the things was that there
 
01:23:14.790 --> 01:23:14.800 align:start position:0%
was people there were people who were in
 
01:23:17.030 --> 01:23:17.040 align:start position:0%
joining communities that you shared a
 
01:23:19.950 --> 01:23:19.960 align:start position:0%
health officer how is that handled in
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
the report is that still the community
 
01:23:24.950 --> 01:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
that's sharing
 
01:23:29.229 --> 01:23:29.239 align:start position:0%
still listed as one of the 19 or I again
 
01:23:31.790 --> 01:23:31.800 align:start position:0%
just great question so if communities
 
01:23:33.870 --> 01:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
are sharing a health officer under RSA
 
01:23:36.870 --> 01:23:36.880 align:start position:0%
128 they can only do so for a period of
 
01:23:40.110 --> 01:23:40.120 align:start position:0%
30 days so that information not is not
 
01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily reflected in this report
 
01:23:44.669 --> 01:23:44.679 align:start position:0%
because it is for a temporary basis some
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
health officers um are appointed in both
 
01:23:49.910 --> 01:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
towns so the health officer in
 
01:23:51.669 --> 01:23:51.679 align:start position:0%
Chichester and Pittsfield may be the
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
same person but they go through separate
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
appointment processes so they're both
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
towns follow up so just clarifying it my
 
01:24:07.310 --> 01:24:07.320 align:start position:0%
mind so a person who is temporary can
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
only be there 30 days but they could be
 
01:24:13.950 --> 01:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
appointed as a part-time in two
 
01:24:16.709 --> 01:24:16.719 align:start position:0%
different locations and serve the full
 
01:24:18.510 --> 01:24:18.520 align:start position:0%
terms that is
 
01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.470 align:start position:0%
terms that is
correct

01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
01:24:26.830 --> 01:24:26.840 align:start position:0%
Weber brings up a question for me when
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
we say
 
01:24:31.709 --> 01:24:31.719 align:start position:0%
fulltime I'm assuming that depending on
 
01:24:32.950 --> 01:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
the size of the
 
01:24:35.669 --> 01:24:35.679 align:start position:0%
municipality I come from a town of just
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
north of
 
01:24:39.149 --> 01:24:39.159 align:start position:0%
4,000 uh we're not talking about
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
full-time anything because in my town
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
it's the
 
01:24:47.709 --> 01:24:47.719 align:start position:0%
vet um and he's pretty busy um it it's
 
01:24:50.830 --> 01:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
it's not a full necessarily a full-time
 
01:24:53.590 --> 01:24:53.600 align:start position:0%
position though it could be in in larger
 
01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:54.910 align:start position:0%
position though it could be in in larger
municipalities

01:24:54.910 --> 01:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
01:24:56.870 --> 01:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
that is correct the statute doesn't say
 
01:24:58.189 --> 01:24:58.199 align:start position:0%
that towns have to have a full-time
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
Health officer it says they have to have
 
01:25:02.629 --> 01:25:02.639 align:start position:0%
a health officer so towns are very
 
01:25:05.030 --> 01:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
creative and how they meet that
 
01:25:07.790 --> 01:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
requirement representative
 
01:25:10.669 --> 01:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:25:12.550 --> 01:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
looking at the report on page two I
 
01:25:15.149 --> 01:25:15.159 align:start position:0%
believe it is uh it talks about all of
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
the people that uh local Health offices
 
01:25:20.990 --> 01:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
collaborate with and um it's quite a
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
list very impressive and thorough list
 
01:25:25.870 --> 01:25:25.880 align:start position:0%
talks about Department of Public Health
 
01:25:27.510 --> 01:25:27.520 align:start position:0%
Services I believe it is infectious
 
01:25:30.109 --> 01:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
disease staff and it talks about rabies
 
01:25:32.870 --> 01:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
and mosquito born ill disease I assume
 
01:25:35.470 --> 01:25:35.480 align:start position:0%
that's not limited to that or there's a
 
01:25:37.270 --> 01:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
lot of other infectious diseases other
 
01:25:40.550 --> 01:25:40.560 align:start position:0%
than those so there are other infectious
 
01:25:43.629 --> 01:25:43.639 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases um and normally the
 
01:25:45.550 --> 01:25:45.560 align:start position:0%
health officers are not pulled into
 
01:25:49.669 --> 01:25:49.679 align:start position:0%
those types of um outbreaks however if a
 
01:25:52.109 --> 01:25:52.119 align:start position:0%
health officer is asked to for some
 
01:25:54.310 --> 01:25:54.320 align:start position:0%
reason participate in another type of
 
01:25:56.310 --> 01:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
outbreak or another infectious disease
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
they do have to go through a
 
01:26:01.109 --> 01:26:01.119 align:start position:0%
confidentiality training um and sign a
 
01:26:02.910 --> 01:26:02.920 align:start position:0%
form that's saying that they've had all
 
01:26:06.030 --> 01:26:06.040 align:start position:0%
the hippo necessary training so um
 
01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:07.560 align:start position:0%
because of the sensitive health
 
01:26:09.709 --> 01:26:09.719 align:start position:0%
information that's associated with some
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
of those conditions there are other
 
01:26:12.709 --> 01:26:12.719 align:start position:0%
requirements that Health officers have
 
01:26:14.750 --> 01:26:14.760 align:start position:0%
to meet in order to participate in those
 
01:26:16.870 --> 01:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
types of situations did I have a
 
01:26:20.109 --> 01:26:20.119 align:start position:0%
followup followup um I'm just curious
 
01:26:22.950 --> 01:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
how those two particular diseases or
 
01:26:25.189 --> 01:26:25.199 align:start position:0%
conditions were arrived at uh just
 
01:26:28.510 --> 01:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
research or frequency or severity or so
 
01:26:31.149 --> 01:26:31.159 align:start position:0%
with rabies um and arboviral diseases so
 
01:26:34.109 --> 01:26:34.119 align:start position:0%
mosquitoes and ticks um if the state
 
01:26:36.350 --> 01:26:36.360 align:start position:0%
identifies an area that is seeing um
 
01:26:38.310 --> 01:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
above average normal activity let's say
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
during the mosquito season they will
 
01:26:42.189 --> 01:26:42.199 align:start position:0%
communicate with the health officer and
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
request that the health officer provide
 
01:26:46.590 --> 01:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
certain messaging to the community to
 
01:26:48.950 --> 01:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
help them understand the risk and know
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
how to um take measures to protect
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
themselves so they're more of a
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
Communication channel for the state too
 
01:26:58.470 --> 01:26:58.480 align:start position:0%
to reach local populations um and then
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
with rabies Health officers do have some
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
very limited authority to help with
 
01:27:06.950 --> 01:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
containment of animals who have um
 
01:27:09.750 --> 01:27:09.760 align:start position:0%
rabies thank you you're welcome
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so uh that last
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
sentence of yours uh triggered a
 
01:27:18.350 --> 01:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
question I I was holding off on and that
 
01:27:21.590 --> 01:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
is as I'm looking at page two all the
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
bullet items with collaborate and
 
01:27:23.639 --> 01:27:24.750 align:start position:0%
bullet items with collaborate and
support

01:27:24.750 --> 01:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:27:27.750 --> 01:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't see any um power words
 
01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:28.790 align:start position:0%
I I don't I don't see any um power words
like

01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
like
 
01:27:31.390 --> 01:27:31.400 align:start position:0%
enforce uh and it's and you just gave us
 
01:27:34.070 --> 01:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
an example of how they have an
 
01:27:36.950 --> 01:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement power are there other
 
01:27:40.030 --> 01:27:40.040 align:start position:0%
enforcement Powers yes that's a great
 
01:27:42.310 --> 01:27:42.320 align:start position:0%
question so Health officers really serve
 
01:27:45.030 --> 01:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of roles and a lot of them is are
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
um mostly around transmitting messaging
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
for the state programs but enforcement
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
um Authority is given under RSA 147
 
01:27:55.149 --> 01:27:55.159 align:start position:0%
which which is the public health
 
01:27:57.990 --> 01:27:58.000 align:start position:0%
nuisance statute um and they are given
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
powers to enforce things like failed
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
septic systems so that um is an
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
authority that Dees uses very frequently
 
01:28:08.709 --> 01:28:08.719 align:start position:0%
so Dees licenses um septic designs and
 
01:28:10.870 --> 01:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
installations but if a septic system is
 
01:28:13.189 --> 01:28:13.199 align:start position:0%
to fail the health officer is the
 
01:28:15.709 --> 01:28:15.719 align:start position:0%
primary enforcement mechanism for those
 
01:28:18.629 --> 01:28:18.639 align:start position:0%
types of situations so rather go to the
 
01:28:20.189 --> 01:28:20.199 align:start position:0%
followup so rather than go to the
 
01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
building inspector and have the other
 
01:28:25.510 --> 01:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
Town's normal procedure for citing
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
issues this this individual has the
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
power to to do what exactly issue a
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
subpoena issue of citation issue you
 
01:28:39.750 --> 01:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
what yes so for RSA 147 it's very
 
01:28:41.629 --> 01:28:41.639 align:start position:0%
specific to Public Health nuisances is
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
what health officers can enforce and the
 
01:28:45.990 --> 01:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
language is very specific around septic
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
system so a septic system is failed the
 
01:28:50.229 --> 01:28:50.239 align:start position:0%
health officer can require that they
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
bring it back into a sanitary condition
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
so sometimes that's pumping sometimes
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
that's replacing the system um but they
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
can enforce the repair of that system
 
01:29:02.950 --> 01:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
okay final comment yes uh okay so I
 
01:29:05.470 --> 01:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
would just say that for a future report
 
01:29:07.590 --> 01:29:07.600 align:start position:0%
given the Live Free or Die attitude in
 
01:29:10.470 --> 01:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and the people's concerns
 
01:29:13.510 --> 01:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
about the state enforcing things it
 
01:29:16.470 --> 01:29:16.480 align:start position:0%
would might be nice to clarify for uh in
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
the report what the limits um and extent
 
01:29:21.990 --> 01:29:22.000 align:start position:0%
of the enforcement Authority is that's a
 
01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
great idea thank you we will incorporate
 
01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
that Senator gray um just a suggestion
 
01:29:32.830 --> 01:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
for a future look okay um right now in
 
01:29:36.030 --> 01:29:36.040 align:start position:0%
the education thing um because the way
 
01:29:38.910 --> 01:29:38.920 align:start position:0%
the education statutes are a even a
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
small school has to have you know a
 
01:29:44.709 --> 01:29:44.719 align:start position:0%
principal superintendent uh you know it
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
it appears to me that probably these
 
01:29:50.109 --> 01:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
Health officers uh even if I'm talking
 
01:29:54.550 --> 01:29:54.560 align:start position:0%
19 or 23 I'm talking around
 
01:29:56.910 --> 01:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
8 to 10% of the communities in the
 
01:29:59.470 --> 01:29:59.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that don't have a health
 
01:30:02.669 --> 01:30:02.679 align:start position:0%
officer and if I open that up so that
 
01:30:05.229 --> 01:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
the county could have a health
 
01:30:09.390 --> 01:30:09.400 align:start position:0%
officer and then the community share it
 
01:30:11.629 --> 01:30:11.639 align:start position:0%
uh but that would take legislation but
 
01:30:14.830 --> 01:30:14.840 align:start position:0%
it would take a suggestion from Mr
 
01:30:17.950 --> 01:30:17.960 align:start position:0%
Williams and yourselves um to get that
 
01:30:21.149 --> 01:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
rolling uh you know somebody needs to
 
01:30:23.030 --> 01:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
think and see if that's would be
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
advantageous uh to do that and and cost
 
01:30:29.430 --> 01:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
savings to do that I think that is a
 
01:30:31.709 --> 01:30:31.719 align:start position:0%
very very great question and suggestion
 
01:30:33.830 --> 01:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are a few Regional
 
01:30:35.709 --> 01:30:35.719 align:start position:0%
public health networks who have
 
01:30:38.229 --> 01:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
approached us with interest of having a
 
01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
health officer for their Public Health
 
01:30:43.870 --> 01:30:43.880 align:start position:0%
Network so I think there is opportunity
 
01:30:46.270 --> 01:30:46.280 align:start position:0%
to look at the current structure of this
 
01:30:48.390 --> 01:30:48.400 align:start position:0%
local Health officer position and think
 
01:30:50.189 --> 01:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
about maybe ways that would be more
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
efficient especially if they were at a
 
01:30:53.470 --> 01:30:53.480 align:start position:0%
county level there might be opportunity
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
for full time and bring in someone who
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
has a background you know in
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
environmental health issues so I think
 
01:31:00.950 --> 01:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's it's a great point and I'll bring
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:10.109 --> 01:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:12.990 --> 01:31:13.000 align:start position:0%
else singing no one thank you so much
 
01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:16.310 align:start position:0%
else singing no one thank you so much
thank

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
you did you entertain a motion I would
 
01:31:22.229 --> 01:31:22.239 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion uh M Mr chair I'd
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
like to uh make a motion I I I move that
 
01:31:28.430 --> 01:31:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh we place um representative Wayne
 
01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
McDonald into nomination to be Vice
 
01:31:33.189 --> 01:31:33.199 align:start position:0%
chair of this committee for the I think
 
01:31:35.870 --> 01:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
that's next term excellent
 
01:31:38.350 --> 01:31:38.360 align:start position:0%
suggestion we need to find out if
 
01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:41.239 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald is willing to do
 
01:31:43.990 --> 01:31:44.000 align:start position:0%
that I do accept the nomination thank
 
01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:45.510 align:start position:0%
that I do accept the nomination thank
you

01:31:45.510 --> 01:31:45.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:31:47.990 --> 01:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
wonderful any other
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
nominations seeing none all in favor I
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
opposed thank you
 
01:31:58.189 --> 01:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
I'll take next month off Mr chair yes um
 
01:32:00.870 --> 01:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
there was an open item that uh I had
 
01:32:02.590 --> 01:32:02.600 align:start position:0%
suggested to Mr Williams that didn't
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
make it on the agenda that may be worth
 
01:32:07.870 --> 01:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
mention we do have time if you would
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
like to raise it to see if we can do
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
this okay so um it it happened that a a
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
blinding flash of the obvious uh hit me
 
01:32:23.310 --> 01:32:23.320 align:start position:0%
the other day that um one of the things
 
01:32:24.870 --> 01:32:24.880 align:start position:0%
that I I think all of the
 
01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:27.560 align:start position:0%
representatives are asked to do on
 
01:32:31.510 --> 01:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
occasion is to um support a constituent
 
01:32:33.790 --> 01:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
request to follow up and find out what
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
the status of their situation is with
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I've been doing this for eight
 
01:32:42.109 --> 01:32:42.119 align:start position:0%
years I've just sort of you know goofed
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
around and tried to get it into somebody
 
01:32:48.109 --> 01:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
and it struck me that um I think it was
 
01:32:50.390 --> 01:32:50.400 align:start position:0%
during one of Mr Williams other
 
01:32:53.629 --> 01:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
presentations that um that the they're
 
01:32:57.149 --> 01:32:57.159 align:start position:0%
all already set up and to some extent it
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
may be a really great extent to handle
 
01:33:03.669 --> 01:33:03.679 align:start position:0%
individual cases from legislators and
 
01:33:07.030 --> 01:33:07.040 align:start position:0%
others and feed it into a control system
 
01:33:08.910 --> 01:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
so that they can
 
01:33:11.470 --> 01:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
systematically pursue a followup and
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that the case was resolved
 
01:33:16.350 --> 01:33:16.360 align:start position:0%
properly or if it wasn't that they could
 
01:33:20.070 --> 01:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
go back and remediate gaps um it it
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
would be great if we could as an element
 
01:33:26.910 --> 01:33:26.920 align:start position:0%
of over site maybe get um a monthly
 
01:33:29.430 --> 01:33:29.440 align:start position:0%
report a quarterly report an annual
 
01:33:32.590 --> 01:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
report that just tells us the numbers
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
how many of these constituent cases have
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
they had to process um and and and to
 
01:33:43.310 --> 01:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
the extent that there are any uh Sops
 
01:33:46.629 --> 01:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
standard operating procedures on how to
 
01:33:49.229 --> 01:33:49.239 align:start position:0%
send the information to a particular
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
person in in DHHS and know that you're
 
01:33:54.910 --> 01:33:54.920 align:start position:0%
going to get an answer back someday that
 
01:33:57.629 --> 01:33:57.639 align:start position:0%
this was okay this this wasn't quite
 
01:33:59.950 --> 01:33:59.960 align:start position:0%
okay and we fixed it you know just some
 
01:34:03.950 --> 01:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
sort of feedback so so I I I I think Mr
 
01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
Williams may be able to tell us a lot
 
01:34:10.189 --> 01:34:10.199 align:start position:0%
about a system that exists that I never
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
knew about
 
01:34:14.870 --> 01:34:14.880 align:start position:0%
formally so great or or Miss Tilly thank
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
you I I got the Short Straw today so
 
01:34:18.830 --> 01:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
because I stayed late so thank you so
 
01:34:20.709 --> 01:34:20.719 align:start position:0%
much again Patricia Tilly associate
 
01:34:22.350 --> 01:34:22.360 align:start position:0%
commissioner at the department um so
 
01:34:23.470 --> 01:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for this question and I think
 
01:34:25.870 --> 01:34:25.880 align:start position:0%
you're asking important things um the
 
01:34:27.270 --> 01:34:27.280 align:start position:0%
first thing that I would say just for
 
01:34:30.070 --> 01:34:30.080 align:start position:0%
the immediate ask I know that uh there
 
01:34:33.109 --> 01:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
were some uh needy clarification about
 
01:34:34.990 --> 01:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
so if I have a problem today who do I
 
01:34:37.709 --> 01:34:37.719 align:start position:0%
contact at the at the department the
 
01:34:39.790 --> 01:34:39.800 align:start position:0%
easiest answer for you to do on this
 
01:34:41.950 --> 01:34:41.960 align:start position:0%
list there's Kathy Capron it says
 
01:34:43.950 --> 01:34:43.960 align:start position:0%
scheduling for associate Commissioners
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
Kathy is your go-to she handles all of
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
the constituent concerns from the
 
01:34:51.070 --> 01:34:51.080 align:start position:0%
governor's office and then she routes
 
01:34:53.310 --> 01:34:53.320 align:start position:0%
them once they get to the department she
 
01:34:55.270 --> 01:34:55.280 align:start position:0%
will always be able to Route it to the
 
01:34:57.030 --> 01:34:57.040 align:start position:0%
right person or find the right person
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
through one of us to get the question to
 
01:35:01.070 --> 01:35:01.080 align:start position:0%
so that's the immediate request we can
 
01:35:03.550 --> 01:35:03.560 align:start position:0%
take care of that so send stuff to Kathy
 
01:35:06.669 --> 01:35:06.679 align:start position:0%
right there um and Kathy with an ie if
 
01:35:07.950 --> 01:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
you want to really make her happy and
 
01:35:10.229 --> 01:35:10.239 align:start position:0%
make sure you spell it right so I didn't
 
01:35:12.109 --> 01:35:12.119 align:start position:0%
I I wasn't ready when you said it where
 
01:35:14.149 --> 01:35:14.159 align:start position:0%
where on the page so on this page where
 
01:35:16.030 --> 01:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
it says scheduling for associate
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
Commissioners that Kathy Capron right
 
01:35:20.910 --> 01:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
there outstanding she's your go-to lady
 
01:35:22.990 --> 01:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
she will take care of you the bigger
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
question you're asking around how can we
 
01:35:28.430 --> 01:35:28.440 align:start position:0%
capture this in a more systemic way is
 
01:35:30.629 --> 01:35:30.639 align:start position:0%
is very interesting we know that the
 
01:35:32.790 --> 01:35:32.800 align:start position:0%
governor's office um under Governor
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
snono built in a new constituent um
 
01:35:37.790 --> 01:35:37.800 align:start position:0%
relationship sort of database or process
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
where they can manage some of those
 
01:35:42.350 --> 01:35:42.360 align:start position:0%
inquiries it's based off of our own
 
01:35:45.189 --> 01:35:45.199 align:start position:0%
Salesforce um platform that you're well
 
01:35:47.109 --> 01:35:47.119 align:start position:0%
aware of which we we'd like to remind
 
01:35:49.470 --> 01:35:49.480 align:start position:0%
them that we paid for but we it is a
 
01:35:51.830 --> 01:35:51.840 align:start position:0%
great system to start with we are
 
01:35:54.910 --> 01:35:54.920 align:start position:0%
investigating how we can um Not
 
01:35:56.910 --> 01:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
Duplicate but sort of enhance that
 
01:35:59.310 --> 01:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
moving forward it's not ready yet but
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
it's certainly something that we're
 
01:36:02.270 --> 01:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
interested in because you're right we're
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
all chasing down um concerns because not
 
01:36:08.149 --> 01:36:08.159 align:start position:0%
only is Kathy the right person to go to
 
01:36:09.270 --> 01:36:09.280 align:start position:0%
we know that all of you have
 
01:36:10.950 --> 01:36:10.960 align:start position:0%
relationships with some of us at the
 
01:36:12.550 --> 01:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
department that you've been successful
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
with and you know that we'll get it to
 
01:36:16.310 --> 01:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
the right person as well so that's the
 
01:36:18.350 --> 01:36:18.360 align:start position:0%
long-term Vision we're not quite there
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
yet um but that's where we would like to
 
01:36:23.590 --> 01:36:23.600 align:start position:0%
be distinguish that please from me
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
calling John Williams on the weekend oh
 
01:36:29.189 --> 01:36:29.199 align:start position:0%
no wait a minute um there's there is the
 
01:36:31.950 --> 01:36:31.960 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman Jennifer Jones and there's
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
also something I've been given these
 
01:36:35.910 --> 01:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
things for nine years I don't think I
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
ever noticed the one on the bottom left
 
01:36:40.830 --> 01:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
where it said Client Services would you
 
01:36:43.390 --> 01:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
distinguish those you want to talk a
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
01:36:47.310 --> 01:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
about okay um as it as it relates to my
 
01:36:49.709 --> 01:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
relationship with the uh members of the
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
legislature I I look amongst the
 
01:36:52.510 --> 01:36:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee and I think represent Woods
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
you're the only person I have not worked
 
01:36:56.070 --> 01:36:56.080 align:start position:0%
with directly in constituent um
 
01:36:57.709 --> 01:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
inquiries that come through and I do
 
01:37:00.790 --> 01:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
receive them not only from the um State
 
01:37:02.590 --> 01:37:02.600 align:start position:0%
Legislature but also from our
 
01:37:04.629 --> 01:37:04.639 align:start position:0%
Congressional Delegation that sometimes
 
01:37:07.470 --> 01:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
will reach out to me as well and I am
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
good at getting people linked up but
 
01:37:11.189 --> 01:37:11.199 align:start position:0%
what Trisha what associate commissioner
 
01:37:13.109 --> 01:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
Tilly is explaining that we already have
 
01:37:15.709 --> 01:37:15.719 align:start position:0%
a built-in process in place and we're
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
we're getting to metrics which was what
 
01:37:19.590 --> 01:37:19.600 align:start position:0%
um represent Edwards was getting at
 
01:37:21.350 --> 01:37:21.360 align:start position:0%
that's where the repository coming to
 
01:37:23.189 --> 01:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
Kathy allows us the opportunity to give
 
01:37:26.109 --> 01:37:26.119 align:start position:0%
you the number of um referrals that have
 
01:37:27.950 --> 01:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
come in perhaps even broken down by
 
01:37:30.070 --> 01:37:30.080 align:start position:0%
which program areas or program areas
 
01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
multiple uh were involved with
 
01:37:34.390 --> 01:37:34.400 align:start position:0%
addressing those issues when I receive
 
01:37:36.870 --> 01:37:36.880 align:start position:0%
your email phone call whatever I just do
 
01:37:38.910 --> 01:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
my best to try to be a problem solver
 
01:37:40.350 --> 01:37:40.360 align:start position:0%
working with you and working with those
 
01:37:42.310 --> 01:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
problem solvers within the department
 
01:37:44.750 --> 01:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
and I just my goal is to to get you to
 
01:37:46.430 --> 01:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
the right people or your constituent to
 
01:37:47.990 --> 01:37:48.000 align:start position:0%
getting their problem looked at
 
01:37:51.470 --> 01:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
meaningfully and and perhaps resolved so
 
01:37:52.870 --> 01:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
um that's something that I've been doing
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
with you folks for well over a decade
 
01:37:57.669 --> 01:37:57.679 align:start position:0%
plus but there is this other process
 
01:37:59.189 --> 01:37:59.199 align:start position:0%
that's already built in and if you're
 
01:38:00.750 --> 01:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
looking for the type of information that
 
01:38:02.870 --> 01:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly direct excuse me associate
 
01:38:04.870 --> 01:38:04.880 align:start position:0%
Commissioners Bo that's going way back
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
call me Trish um in time that that is
 
01:38:10.109 --> 01:38:10.119 align:start position:0%
that is the ideal process if you're
 
01:38:11.470 --> 01:38:11.480 align:start position:0%
looking to getting the metrics that
 
01:38:13.470 --> 01:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards was was referring to
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
but I will say I do enjoy working with
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
you and I enjoy troubleshooting and but
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to keep it into the system
 
01:38:22.430 --> 01:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
for data purposes uh that as described
 
01:38:25.430 --> 01:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
by Comm absolutely and I think all of us
 
01:38:27.470 --> 01:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
are always available to anyone to answer
 
01:38:29.109 --> 01:38:29.119 align:start position:0%
any questions so we want to make sure
 
01:38:31.589 --> 01:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
that we're not closing a door there but
 
01:38:34.030 --> 01:38:34.040 align:start position:0%
we can um Kathy's a great person to just
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
send it to and you know it's off your
 
01:38:37.589 --> 01:38:37.599 align:start position:0%
plate and we can get it organized to
 
01:38:39.270 --> 01:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
where it needs to go that your note
 
01:38:41.470 --> 01:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
around you see Client Services elsewhere
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
this is where it's complex because many
 
01:38:45.189 --> 01:38:45.199 align:start position:0%
of our divisions clearly have client
 
01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
facing roles where they address client
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
concerns um Even in our division for
 
01:38:52.629 --> 01:38:52.639 align:start position:0%
children youth and family we have some
 
01:38:54.550 --> 01:38:54.560 align:start position:0%
con a new new role which is really
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
around constituent inquiries and so
 
01:38:58.830 --> 01:38:58.840 align:start position:0%
that's what we need to organize on our
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
end to think about as a department level
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
how do we sort through all that because
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're already figuring it out at a
 
01:39:07.229 --> 01:39:07.239 align:start position:0%
division level we need to bring that up
 
01:39:08.950 --> 01:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
and sort of have a big picture at the
 
01:39:11.709 --> 01:39:11.719 align:start position:0%
department my followup is uh could you
 
01:39:14.070 --> 01:39:14.080 align:start position:0%
give me the information so I can put it
 
01:39:17.709 --> 01:39:17.719 align:start position:0%
here under dcyf who that uh person
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
Fielding things from the public is I
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
I'll forward you her um email address
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
I'll forward it to the group I'll
 
01:39:24.229 --> 01:39:24.239 align:start position:0%
forward it to you and the group and a
 
01:39:26.510 --> 01:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
followup to my first question was uh
 
01:39:28.270 --> 01:39:28.280 align:start position:0%
what is the role then of the Ombudsman
 
01:39:28.280 --> 01:39:29.189 align:start position:0%
what is the role then of the Ombudsman
in

01:39:29.189 --> 01:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
this take the you're the lawyer so the
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
ombudsman's office there's actually two
 
01:39:35.870 --> 01:39:35.880 align:start position:0%
distinct different types of Ombudsman
 
01:39:38.229 --> 01:39:38.239 align:start position:0%
within our agency just for clarity we
 
01:39:40.470 --> 01:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
have the office of long-term care um
 
01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:42.920 align:start position:0%
budsman that deals with uh in
 
01:39:44.910 --> 01:39:44.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who are residents in
 
01:39:47.430 --> 01:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
long-term care facility setting and Su
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
buckon is our long-term care um budsman
 
01:39:53.430 --> 01:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
we had a similar um discussion before uh
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
chairman McDonald's committee uh when we
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:56.920 align:start position:0%
did our our speed meet and greet
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
orientation on this very subject that
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
was also attended by division three in
 
01:40:03.030 --> 01:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
addition to that we have Jennifer Jones
 
01:40:05.669 --> 01:40:05.679 align:start position:0%
she is an attorney by background um and
 
01:40:08.070 --> 01:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
she is the Department's um budsman under
 
01:40:10.030 --> 01:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
statute they do fall under the umbrella
 
01:40:12.910 --> 01:40:12.920 align:start position:0%
of the department she does report uh to
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
our chief legal officer Melissa Saint
 
01:40:17.350 --> 01:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
Seer however under statute they are
 
01:40:19.189 --> 01:40:19.199 align:start position:0%
independent in terms of their actions
 
01:40:21.270 --> 01:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
because they're enabled to help
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
individuals navigate through the process
 
01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:25.960 align:start position:0%
with with their concerns um they serve
 
01:40:28.109 --> 01:40:28.119 align:start position:0%
an incredibly important function with
 
01:40:30.189 --> 01:40:30.199 align:start position:0%
the within the agency but as as
 
01:40:32.870 --> 01:40:32.880 align:start position:0%
identified there are other um Solutions
 
01:40:35.070 --> 01:40:35.080 align:start position:0%
also to trying to addressing individuals
 
01:40:37.709 --> 01:40:37.719 align:start position:0%
um concerns or problems um so we try to
 
01:40:39.669 --> 01:40:39.679 align:start position:0%
have as many doors open um my door is
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
open associate commissioner uh Tilly's
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
door is open and so is Jennifer Jones
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
and trying to get to the right place if
 
01:40:49.870 --> 01:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
I would say just from a highlevel um
 
01:40:51.750 --> 01:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
Viewpoint of the EMB budsman they tend
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
to get involved with uh matters that
 
01:40:56.270 --> 01:40:56.280 align:start position:0%
were other um resources within the
 
01:40:57.990 --> 01:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
department they may not be satisfied
 
01:40:59.589 --> 01:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
with necessarily the answer so they go
 
01:41:01.189 --> 01:41:01.199 align:start position:0%
to the um budman's office to get an
 
01:41:03.470 --> 01:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
independent person to help sort out so I
 
01:41:06.910 --> 01:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
I I believe they they are involved with
 
01:41:09.550 --> 01:41:09.560 align:start position:0%
much more complex issues uh at at that
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
point in time because they are looking
 
01:41:15.229 --> 01:41:15.239 align:start position:0%
for additional followup based upon
 
01:41:16.750 --> 01:41:16.760 align:start position:0%
information provided earlier by the
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
department whether it's for eligibility
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
for services or benefits and and that's
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
where um uh
 
01:41:25.709 --> 01:41:25.719 align:start position:0%
uh Jones as the um budsman serves a
 
01:41:27.270 --> 01:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
really important function within the
 
01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:28.760 align:start position:0%
office to have that independent Voice
 
01:41:30.750 --> 01:41:30.760 align:start position:0%
who understands the department but also
 
01:41:32.629 --> 01:41:32.639 align:start position:0%
can act independently to look into those
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
individuals uh concerns uh also in
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
addition to that we have our
 
01:41:37.830 --> 01:41:37.840 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit which also
 
01:41:39.070 --> 01:41:39.080 align:start position:0%
falls under the umbrella of the
 
01:41:41.589 --> 01:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
department that are independent and they
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
will take appeals for denials of
 
01:41:45.430 --> 01:41:45.440 align:start position:0%
services and benefits from the
 
01:41:48.229 --> 01:41:48.239 align:start position:0%
Department denial period uh the um
 
01:41:50.229 --> 01:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
period for filing for an appeal is 30
 
01:41:52.950 --> 01:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
days from whatever administrative action
 
01:41:54.470 --> 01:41:54.480 align:start position:0%
uh and I'm just giving you that for a
 
01:41:56.149 --> 01:41:56.159 align:start position:0%
more complete picture of what falls
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
under uh Melissa saints's umbrella as it
 
01:42:00.669 --> 01:42:00.679 align:start position:0%
relates to addressing individual
 
01:42:00.679 --> 01:42:02.750 align:start position:0%
relates to addressing individual
constituents

01:42:02.750 --> 01:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that's a lot of the
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards so so this
 
01:42:10.109 --> 01:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
followup is kind of mostly for you Mr
 
01:42:13.510 --> 01:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
chair um is this a topic that you would
 
01:42:15.709 --> 01:42:15.719 align:start position:0%
like to have the oversight committee
 
01:42:19.070 --> 01:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
request the department to periodically
 
01:42:22.510 --> 01:42:22.520 align:start position:0%
report back on a summary basis on the
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
kind of volume
 
01:42:25.589 --> 01:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
and results they're
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
getting yeah I think so I think that
 
01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
would be able to help me when somebody
 
01:42:34.350 --> 01:42:34.360 align:start position:0%
says you know they don't just listen and
 
01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
and I want to be able to say hey wait a
 
01:42:39.669 --> 01:42:39.679 align:start position:0%
minute in the last three months alone
 
01:42:41.149 --> 01:42:41.159 align:start position:0%
there were
 
01:42:43.990 --> 01:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
569 serious queries that they had dealt
 
01:42:45.669 --> 01:42:45.679 align:start position:0%
with and gotten back to people on that
 
01:42:48.550 --> 01:42:48.560 align:start position:0%
so it would be a good thing it would uh
 
01:42:51.189 --> 01:42:51.199 align:start position:0%
help me as I tell people what a great
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
DHHS we have yeah I think that'd be
 
01:42:57.790 --> 01:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
goodes and then as a followup to that
 
01:42:59.950 --> 01:42:59.960 align:start position:0%
followup the the other part of that
 
01:43:02.270 --> 01:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
question is what sort of frequency are
 
01:43:05.589 --> 01:43:05.599 align:start position:0%
you thinking I I I I I would I would not
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
want to ask them to do it very
 
01:43:09.870 --> 01:43:09.880 align:start position:0%
frequently because this is going to be
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
new work new process clean up I mean for
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
them to actually do this right and want
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
to report on it probably it's going to
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
take six months for them to figure it
 
01:43:22.109 --> 01:43:22.119 align:start position:0%
out right so I was thinking our June
 
01:43:25.750 --> 01:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
meeting maybe we can give you uh by June
 
01:43:27.790 --> 01:43:27.800 align:start position:0%
we can give you an update on our process
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
I you know hopefully we'll have some
 
01:43:31.070 --> 01:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
anecdotal information by then I don't
 
01:43:33.189 --> 01:43:33.199 align:start position:0%
want to say that by June we will have a
 
01:43:35.350 --> 01:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
full picture because I think we need to
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
Define it of what's an inquiry what's
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
not an inquiry what's just someone
 
01:43:41.550 --> 01:43:41.560 align:start position:0%
following up on their um their case you
 
01:43:43.229 --> 01:43:43.239 align:start position:0%
know so I think we have some thinking to
 
01:43:44.950 --> 01:43:44.960 align:start position:0%
do about that but we can certainly give
 
01:43:47.310 --> 01:43:47.320 align:start position:0%
you an update in June about where we are
 
01:43:51.310 --> 01:43:51.320 align:start position:0%
I also think a flowchart saying initial
 
01:43:54.870 --> 01:43:54.880 align:start position:0%
number to call sounds like Kathy kapron
 
01:43:57.390 --> 01:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
and if it's really in your opinion not
 
01:43:59.390 --> 01:43:59.400 align:start position:0%
really going anywhere then there is an
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
OB Ombudsman for appeal and then if it
 
01:44:04.109 --> 01:44:04.119 align:start position:0%
really hit the wall you've got the
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
administrative Appeals Unit or something
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
just a little flowchart so people don't
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
call at the wrong level or feel like
 
01:44:14.270 --> 01:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
there's only one bite of the apple and
 
01:44:16.229 --> 01:44:16.239 align:start position:0%
if that doesn't work they're dead that
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
would be helpful for me as I route
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
people okay otherwise I'll just call
 
01:44:24.669 --> 01:44:24.679 align:start position:0%
John yes representative Weber
 
01:44:27.830 --> 01:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
and I just want to express my concern
 
01:44:31.189 --> 01:44:31.199 align:start position:0%
with everything I've just heard because
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
my experience is that when I have a
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
constituent concern or when others have
 
01:44:42.430 --> 01:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
a constituent concern and they consult
 
01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
me and this is all for
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
legislators either I know the person
 
01:44:48.750 --> 01:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
that they need to talk to or I know that
 
01:44:50.830 --> 01:44:50.840 align:start position:0%
John knows the person that I need to
 
01:44:55.990 --> 01:44:56.000 align:start position:0%
talk to and I have never had an
 
01:44:58.990 --> 01:44:59.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate response take more than 24
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
hours on any issue no matter how
 
01:45:08.070 --> 01:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
complex and if I have to have a chart of
 
01:45:11.189 --> 01:45:11.199 align:start position:0%
whom to call and then whom to call and
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
then I have to wait and then I have to
 
01:45:16.950 --> 01:45:16.960 align:start position:0%
go somewhere else that is going to
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
result in significantly less Nimble
 
01:45:24.750 --> 01:45:24.760 align:start position:0%
constituent response than what is
 
01:45:29.030 --> 01:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
happening regularly now and for which I
 
01:45:31.229 --> 01:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
am eternally grateful and my
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
constituents are eternally grateful
 
01:45:34.990 --> 01:45:35.000 align:start position:0%
because some of them were in very
 
01:45:37.350 --> 01:45:37.360 align:start position:0%
difficult circumstances and needed a
 
01:45:42.910 --> 01:45:42.920 align:start position:0%
response within 2 24 hours uh but I I I
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
also think that we need to be very
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
careful with the reporting requirements
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
because if every time I make a phone
 
01:45:53.790 --> 01:45:53.800 align:start position:0%
call somebody has to sit down and make a
 
01:45:56.189 --> 01:45:56.199 align:start position:0%
report and send it to their supervisor
 
01:45:58.030 --> 01:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
to be sent to their supervisor to be
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
sent to the reporter data data entry
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
people I think we're creating a
 
01:46:07.109 --> 01:46:07.119 align:start position:0%
nightmare to solve a problem that
 
01:46:09.669 --> 01:46:09.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't exist and I just wanted to be
 
01:46:12.910 --> 01:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
sure that I got that on the
 
01:46:15.910 --> 01:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
record except for that very last bit I
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
would wholeheartly
 
01:46:21.870 --> 01:46:21.880 align:start position:0%
agree um I have made use of these cards
 
01:46:25.270 --> 01:46:25.280 align:start position:0%
ever since I got them them and uh if I
 
01:46:28.270 --> 01:46:28.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what to do because there are
 
01:46:30.910 --> 01:46:30.920 align:start position:0%
obviously units in here that aren't
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
printed out I do call attorney Williams
 
01:46:37.189 --> 01:46:37.199 align:start position:0%
I'm responding I'm jumping in on this
 
01:46:39.350 --> 01:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
because now we were told about Kathy
 
01:46:44.310 --> 01:46:44.320 align:start position:0%
kapron and and um maybe I am hearing it
 
01:46:47.750 --> 01:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
being made more complex than was said
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
and if that's the case I apologize for
 
01:46:53.550 --> 01:46:53.560 align:start position:0%
that and representative um uh Weber I
 
01:46:56.669 --> 01:46:56.679 align:start position:0%
would wholeheartedly agree with your
 
01:46:59.790 --> 01:46:59.800 align:start position:0%
experience has been my experience
 
01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:01.310 align:start position:0%
experience has been my experience
representative

01:47:01.310 --> 01:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:06.430 --> 01:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
Edwards I I I I want a Nimble uh
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
responsive system the the experience
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
that representative Weber uh gets I'm
 
01:47:15.430 --> 01:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
sure has is somewhat a function of her
 
01:47:18.149 --> 01:47:18.159 align:start position:0%
experience her judgment her wisdom her
 
01:47:21.030 --> 01:47:21.040 align:start position:0%
you knowledge of who does what but I'm
 
01:47:23.510 --> 01:47:23.520 align:start position:0%
reminded that we have a a third of the
 
01:47:26.109 --> 01:47:26.119 align:start position:0%
house turnover every two years we all
 
01:47:28.510 --> 01:47:28.520 align:start position:0%
have constituents we're all sort of
 
01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:30.520 align:start position:0%
confused the first couple of terms and
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
if there was a simple way without
 
01:47:36.070 --> 01:47:36.080 align:start position:0%
breaking the good stuff that we have to
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
help the new kids be able to support
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
their constituents or at least be told
 
01:47:43.390 --> 01:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
how to do it I think that would be good
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
and the summary report once a year or
 
01:47:48.830 --> 01:47:48.840 align:start position:0%
whatever that says something to the
 
01:47:52.270 --> 01:47:52.280 align:start position:0%
effect that you know uh we we have we've
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
had X
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
number of inquiries through this uh
 
01:48:01.070 --> 01:48:01.080 align:start position:0%
constituent service and uh 89% of them
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
were revealed to to be handled properly
 
01:48:07.350 --> 01:48:07.360 align:start position:0%
to begin with and the other 11% we
 
01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:09.639 align:start position:0%
resolved I mean I'm not looking for any
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
personal data I just want to know did we
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
do it right or did we figure out we
 
01:48:16.990 --> 01:48:17.000 align:start position:0%
needed to do something slightly
 
01:48:18.589 --> 01:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
different I don't want to get involved
 
01:48:20.189 --> 01:48:20.199 align:start position:0%
in the case I don't want to get involved
 
01:48:22.910 --> 01:48:22.920 align:start position:0%
in the investigation I just want to know
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
that I've done my job to communicate
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
effectively and that the grown-ups are
 
01:48:29.629 --> 01:48:29.639 align:start position:0%
looking into
 
01:48:33.550 --> 01:48:33.560 align:start position:0%
it I get almost no constituent concerns
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
because I'm in a floal and they know the
 
01:48:38.310 --> 01:48:38.320 align:start position:0%
individual who lives in their Town what
 
01:48:42.430 --> 01:48:42.440 align:start position:0%
I get is constituent concerns secondhand
 
01:48:45.430 --> 01:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
from lots of Representatives hey who do
 
01:48:47.990 --> 01:48:48.000 align:start position:0%
you know over there who it usually
 
01:48:50.990 --> 01:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
starts off with and not only do I have
 
01:48:53.629 --> 01:48:53.639 align:start position:0%
it on the card I know most these people
 
01:48:55.470 --> 01:48:55.480 align:start position:0%
so that's what I do if I don't have to
 
01:48:55.480 --> 01:48:56.350 align:start position:0%
so that's what I do if I don't have to
call

01:48:56.350 --> 01:48:56.360 align:start position:0%
call
 
01:48:58.910 --> 01:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
you anything else representative
 
01:49:01.790 --> 01:49:01.800 align:start position:0%
McDonald thank you Mr chairman I think I
 
01:49:03.390 --> 01:49:03.400 align:start position:0%
know the answer to this question but I
 
01:49:06.149 --> 01:49:06.159 align:start position:0%
have to ask it I just because I get
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
asked it um the number one thing I
 
01:49:11.830 --> 01:49:11.840 align:start position:0%
people call me about whether it's a
 
01:49:14.510 --> 01:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
constituent or another legislator or a
 
01:49:16.790 --> 01:49:16.800 align:start position:0%
person from outside of my district the
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
number one question I usually get is I
 
01:49:21.470 --> 01:49:21.480 align:start position:0%
was turned down for benefits that's how
 
01:49:23.870 --> 01:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
the conversation start
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
and I said well did you get a I assume
 
01:49:28.030 --> 01:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
they still get a notice of decision
 
01:49:31.390 --> 01:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
whether it's email or regular mail and
 
01:49:33.189 --> 01:49:33.199 align:start position:0%
that's the first question I said I I'll
 
01:49:34.750 --> 01:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
ask them well did you get a notice of
 
01:49:38.189 --> 01:49:38.199 align:start position:0%
decision well what's that I said well
 
01:49:39.709 --> 01:49:39.719 align:start position:0%
you're not just turned down you have to
 
01:49:41.910 --> 01:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
be given an explanation it's usually
 
01:49:44.550 --> 01:49:44.560 align:start position:0%
very clearly indicated on there uh
 
01:49:45.990 --> 01:49:46.000 align:start position:0%

01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
income is over whether you know you
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
didn't Supply the proper information or
 
01:49:53.189 --> 01:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
they need addition something additional
 
01:49:55.390 --> 01:49:55.400 align:start position:0%
so that that process has not changed
 
01:49:57.870 --> 01:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
with you folks then I assume that is
 
01:50:01.550 --> 01:50:01.560 align:start position:0%

01:50:07.589 --> 01:50:07.599 align:start position:0%
followup at that point there is a 30-day
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
appeals period where they can appeal to
 
01:50:16.709 --> 01:50:16.719 align:start position:0%

be struck because it was not going to be
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
