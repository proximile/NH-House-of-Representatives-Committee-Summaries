00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:23.919 align:start position:0%
uh yeah with d.o.e um
 
00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 align:start position:0%
the it was announced this morning the
 
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:28.560 align:start position:0%
public here or the public hearing
 
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 align:start position:0%
the legislative briefing
 
00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
will be held on april 6th
 
00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 align:start position:0%
there's no time at this point
 
00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:43.040 align:start position:0%
also i believe that
 
00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 align:start position:0%
the presentations for
 
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:49.600 align:start position:0%
the budget are going to be held on the
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
29th and the voting
 
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 align:start position:0%
the finance committee voting
 
00:05:01.749 --> 00:05:01.759 align:start position:0%
will be on the um 31st
 
00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 align:start position:0%
i think that's the schedule and as
 
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
soon as i know something final
 
00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
then i will be sure to
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
let everyone know um
 
00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 align:start position:0%
because those are obviously extremely
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
important dates
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
so that's what i know at this point
 
00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:28.479 align:start position:0%
so the second one i believe the
 
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
legislative briefing before the vote
 
00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:31.919 align:start position:0%
what was that one
 
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
the 31st you know what was on the one
 
00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
before that
 
00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:40.400 align:start position:0%
oh the 29th and that was
 
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's when division two will present
 
00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 align:start position:0%
its um information to the full finance
 
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.909 align:start position:0%
its um information to the full finance
committee

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
each each one of the divisions okay
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
so um i think that's the plan
 
00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 align:start position:0%
and we'll um as a
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:22.080 align:start position:0%
relatively easy relatively easily on
 
00:07:25.189 --> 00:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
friday morning so that mickey has an
 
00:07:25.199 --> 00:07:26.070 align:start position:0%
friday morning so that mickey has an
opportunity

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
to do his things so that we are
 
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:32.400 align:start position:0%
all prepared for
 
00:07:36.870 --> 00:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh the division presentation to the full
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
full committee so okay
 
00:07:44.309 --> 00:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
um i see that uh
 
00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
some of our education folks are here so
 
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:51.440 align:start position:0%
um caitlin if you would
 
00:07:56.469 --> 00:07:56.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:00.309 --> 00:08:00.319 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning
 
00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
um so we don't have a formal
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
presentation prepared
 
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
um i don't know how you how do you want
 
00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.510 align:start position:0%
um i don't know how you how do you want
us

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:09.360 align:start position:0%
what would you like us to do today i
 
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
guess how what works best for the
 
00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:12.390 align:start position:0%
guess how what works best for the
committee

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
well what i'd like you to do is
 
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:17.189 align:start position:0%
well what i'd like you to do is
basically

00:08:17.189 --> 00:08:17.199 align:start position:0%
basically
 
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:26.400 align:start position:0%
where we are and um
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:32.550 --> 00:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
what things are we needing to come to
 
00:08:34.149 --> 00:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
grips with
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:45.680 align:start position:0%
i have a couple of questions that uh
 
00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:48.240 align:start position:0%
i need to ask so okay do you want to
 
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
start off by asking the questions and
 
00:08:51.269 --> 00:08:51.279 align:start position:0%
then we can talk
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
oh you go ahead okay all right so
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
um today we're here to specifically talk
 
00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
about the education trust fund there may
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
be some other areas of the budget that
 
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
need to be discussed
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
um but we're going to excuse yeah excuse
 
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:05.200 align:start position:0%
me just a second uh representative
 
00:09:07.430 --> 00:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
ellison would you put yourself on mute
 
00:09:13.590 --> 00:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:17.190 --> 00:09:17.200 align:start position:0%
and if you have a question at any time
 
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:20.800 align:start position:0%
just raise your hand and i will
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
i will call on you in uh
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
in order so i'm sorry caitlyn excuse me
 
00:09:28.630 --> 00:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
that's okay i needed to put my
 
00:09:30.389 --> 00:09:30.399 align:start position:0%
headphones in anyways i forgot about
 
00:09:30.399 --> 00:09:31.430 align:start position:0%
headphones in anyways i forgot about
that

00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:09:34.470 --> 00:09:34.480 align:start position:0%
um okay so today i believe we need to
 
00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
make a couple decisions about the
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:09:39.430 --> 00:09:39.440 align:start position:0%
and then a couple other department of
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
education expenditures potentially
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
around student information systems
 
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
um i think their first couple things the
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
first thing that we actually wanted to
 
00:09:47.430 --> 00:09:47.440 align:start position:0%
talk about just
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
for the sake of timing is we wanted to
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
talk about career in tech education
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
um so eric falworth is able to be on the
 
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:55.360 align:start position:0%
phone with us but not for the entire
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
morning so i wanted to make sure that if
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
the committee has any
 
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
specific special education question or
 
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:01.600 align:start position:0%
sorry special education
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
um career and tech education questions
 
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.160 align:start position:0%
that we address them with eric
 
00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
so where we left things off two weeks
 
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:10.320 align:start position:0%
ago three weeks ago when the department
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
had done the original presentation
 
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
as we discussed the continuing
 
00:10:17.190 --> 00:10:17.200 align:start position:0%
appropriations of career and tech
 
00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
education tuition and transportation
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
that's in the education trust fund
 
00:10:24.230 --> 00:10:24.240 align:start position:0%
um so that is currently in the education
 
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
trust fund budgeted at an amount
 
00:10:30.949 --> 00:10:30.959 align:start position:0%
of i'm sorry i just don't have that um
 
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
of of nine million dollars per year so
 
00:10:36.069 --> 00:10:36.079 align:start position:0%
that nine million dollars per year
 
00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
um is consistent what was budgeted in
 
00:10:41.430 --> 00:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 and 21.
 
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.160 align:start position:0%
um we believe that provides a prorated
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
career in tech education across the
 
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:48.560 align:start position:0%
state of new hampshire
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
to not prorate it we would need about
 
00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:55.120 align:start position:0%
12 million eric you can jump in with the
 
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:56.310 align:start position:0%
12 million eric you can jump in with the
number

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:56.320 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
and so did the committee have any
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
specific questions about career and tech
 
00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:02.949 align:start position:0%
specific questions about career and tech
education

00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:05.670 --> 00:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
yes um i just i wanted to get a firm
 
00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:06.870 align:start position:0%
yes um i just i wanted to get a firm
number

00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
if what we uh would project
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
to fully fund uh the uh
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to answer that one
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
sure i can pull that up i believe
 
00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
it was close to 15 but
 
00:11:31.670 --> 00:11:31.680 align:start position:0%
one second and i can pull the two extra
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:54.829 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.839 --> 00:12:08.829 align:start position:0%
 
mine

00:12:08.829 --> 00:12:08.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:08.839 --> 00:12:21.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:12:21.590 --> 00:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh so it would be and this was
 
00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:34.389 --> 00:12:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:35.829 --> 00:12:35.839 align:start position:0%
transportation because this year's
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
transportation is very altered because
 
00:12:40.389 --> 00:12:40.399 align:start position:0%
of covid and not moving students around
 
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:41.120 align:start position:0%
as much
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
so we would be basing on the 1920
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
busing so
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
an additional 5.1 million dollars
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
above the nine so 14 million
 
00:13:00.870 --> 00:13:00.880 align:start position:0%
uh would cover estimated cover
 
00:13:05.269 --> 00:13:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:09.200 align:start position:0%
uh is the major shortfall in tuition
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
so uh tuition is
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
three million short
 
00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
can i ask a quick question
 
00:13:36.310 --> 00:13:36.320 align:start position:0%
representative just a clarification i
 
00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:38.079 align:start position:0%
think that might be needed here
 
00:13:40.310 --> 00:13:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes please go ahead eric we've heard in
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
the past that
 
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:43.600 align:start position:0%
if the tuition and transportation level
 
00:13:45.269 --> 00:13:45.279 align:start position:0%
were to be increased
 
00:13:47.670 --> 00:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
that that would essentially set a new
 
00:13:49.110 --> 00:13:49.120 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort level
 
00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:51.760 align:start position:0%
moving forward for the perkins grants is
 
00:13:53.189 --> 00:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
can you speak a little bit to that just
 
00:13:54.629 --> 00:13:54.639 align:start position:0%
so the committee understands
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
sure uh that absolutely will um the
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
the moe is based on any monies the state
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
spends on cte and so
 
00:14:08.870 --> 00:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh if this was increased for an
 
00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:10.240 align:start position:0%
additional five million or whatever it
 
00:14:11.350 --> 00:14:11.360 align:start position:0%
would be increased
 
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
that will increase the annual moe
 
00:14:16.870 --> 00:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
which would mean reducing it in the
 
00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.470 align:start position:0%
which would mean reducing it in the
future

00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
would be next to impossible uh because
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
any time
 
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't meet moe then however much
 
00:14:26.470 --> 00:14:26.480 align:start position:0%
we miss it
 
00:14:28.870 --> 00:14:28.880 align:start position:0%
that amount is reduced by our perkins
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
for the following year
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
and we would need to reimburse the
 
00:14:34.069 --> 00:14:34.079 align:start position:0%
federal government for the missed
 
00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:35.360 align:start position:0%
for the current year so it's sort of a
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
double hit so yes an increase need
 
00:14:42.829 --> 00:14:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:42.839 --> 00:14:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
perpetuity

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
yeah i just want to make sure i
 
00:14:53.509 --> 00:14:53.519 align:start position:0%
understand that so if there's an
 
00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
increase that's not necessarily a good
 
00:14:58.230 --> 00:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
thing because if there's a decrease in
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
tuition or enrollment later on we're
 
00:15:01.750 --> 00:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
stuck with paying
 
00:15:03.829 --> 00:15:03.839 align:start position:0%
that difference is that right so there's
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
a downside to it being increased
 
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
well and what's the i'm sorry sure
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
um i well yes i mean ultimately i would
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
imagine yes the downside would be
 
00:15:21.189 --> 00:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
if um if in the future for whatever
 
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
reason there was lower enrollment
 
00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:26.560 align:start position:0%
and the full three million
 
00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
extra intuition was not paid um
 
00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:32.720 align:start position:0%
there could be the possibility of um
 
00:15:35.189 --> 00:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
of a gap problem yes and state has to
 
00:15:36.470 --> 00:15:36.480 align:start position:0%
fill in the gap
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
yes uh i i can tell you you know
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
honestly we are
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
even over the past several years as high
 
00:15:42.639 --> 00:15:43.509 align:start position:0%
even over the past several years as high
school

00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:15:46.230 --> 00:15:46.240 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers have declined cte
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
enrollment numbers have
 
00:15:50.310 --> 00:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
increased and we are continually looking
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
to increase our cte numbers so i i can't
 
00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:53.350 align:start position:0%
to increase our cte numbers so i i can't
ima

00:15:53.350 --> 00:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
ima
 
00:15:56.629 --> 00:15:56.639 align:start position:0%
i can't envision a drastic decrease in
 
00:15:58.150 --> 00:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
enrollment that would impact this but
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
you are correct
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ellison you
 
00:16:04.310 --> 00:16:04.320 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i i think this is
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
related to the maintenance of effort
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
uh and it's the six hundred thousand
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
dollars that's been in there every
 
00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
budget for the school dropout account uh
 
00:16:19.189 --> 00:16:19.199 align:start position:0%
i know it gets administered by career
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
tech i'm not quite sure
 
00:16:22.710 --> 00:16:22.720 align:start position:0%
where it shows up in the budget i should
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
know this i don't so
 
00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
i guess my question to eric or caitlyn
 
00:16:28.550 --> 00:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
is is the 600 000
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
or some figure still in there for the
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
school dropout account
 
00:16:36.389 --> 00:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
no no it is not oh okay
 
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:44.310 --> 00:16:44.320 align:start position:0%
that that was removed this past year um
 
00:16:47.910 --> 00:16:47.920 align:start position:0%
okay if i may representative just to
 
00:16:49.590 --> 00:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
clarify eric just so i think everyone
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
understands let's say
 
00:16:52.389 --> 00:16:52.399 align:start position:0%
the budget for tuition and
 
00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
transportation was increased to 11
 
00:16:55.749 --> 00:16:55.759 align:start position:0%
million dollars this year
 
00:16:57.670 --> 00:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
essentially future budgets would also
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
have to have it at 11 million dollars a
 
00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:01.519 align:start position:0%
year to avoid any sort of
 
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:04.880 align:start position:0%
uh moe non-compliance correct
 
00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
yes and honestly
 
00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:12.400 align:start position:0%
the i will clarify that point
 
00:17:14.789 --> 00:17:14.799 align:start position:0%
the amount of money the state spends on
 
00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:16.150 align:start position:0%
the amount of money the state spends on
cte

00:17:16.150 --> 00:17:16.160 align:start position:0%
cte
 
00:17:17.669 --> 00:17:17.679 align:start position:0%
would need to be the same amount it
 
00:17:20.309 --> 00:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily have to be within
 
00:17:23.350 --> 00:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
the tnt budget if it was
 
00:17:25.110 --> 00:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
allocated under another budget line
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
somewhere as long as
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
all of our state spending on tnt kept
 
00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.590 --> 00:17:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:43.590 --> 00:17:43.600 align:start position:0%
yes thank you i actually i actually have
 
00:17:45.029 --> 00:17:45.039 align:start position:0%
two questions i want to make sure that
 
00:17:45.039 --> 00:17:45.350 align:start position:0%
two questions i want to make sure that
i'm

00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:47.360 align:start position:0%
understanding so if i'm understanding
 
00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:48.390 align:start position:0%
understanding so if i'm understanding
correctly

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
correctly
 
00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
right now the current the governor's
 
00:17:51.830 --> 00:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
proposed budget
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
funds the cte at nine million dollars
 
00:17:56.310 --> 00:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
for each year
 
00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
and you are saying that in order to as
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
you described
 
00:18:01.270 --> 00:18:01.280 align:start position:0%
it fully funded we would have to
 
00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
increase that
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
to 14 million and is that for each year
 
00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:10.000 align:start position:0%
yes that it that is for each year and
 
00:18:11.750 --> 00:18:11.760 align:start position:0%
and i also want to clarify the fully
 
00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.110 align:start position:0%
and i also want to clarify the fully
funding

00:18:13.110 --> 00:18:13.120 align:start position:0%
funding
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
okay still talking about only
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
covering the costs of students from
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
sending schools
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
so it actually is not fully funding cte
 
00:18:26.830 --> 00:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
it is fully funding cte from sending
 
00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
schools i
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
so just so we're we're okay with that
 
00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.270 align:start position:0%
so just so we're we're okay with that
conversation

00:18:31.270 --> 00:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:18:33.750 --> 00:18:33.760 align:start position:0%
but i want to clarify that fully funding
 
00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:34.710 align:start position:0%
but i want to clarify that fully funding
cte

00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
cte
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
would be 35 million dollars and that's a
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
much completely different conversation
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
that we're having today
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
right okay all right and then the second
 
00:18:43.909 --> 00:18:43.919 align:start position:0%
question i want to make sure that i'm
 
00:18:43.919 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
question i want to make sure that i'm
understanding

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
th this um so if
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
if let's say we let's just theoretically
 
00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:52.000 align:start position:0%
say we said okay we
 
00:18:53.669 --> 00:18:53.679 align:start position:0%
you know we we agree we want to fully
 
00:18:56.549 --> 00:18:56.559 align:start position:0%
fund it at 14 million a year
 
00:18:59.190 --> 00:18:59.200 align:start position:0%
and are you saying that the that our
 
00:19:00.549 --> 00:19:00.559 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
would be would be considered to be out
 
00:19:05.430 --> 00:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
of compliance
 
00:19:07.590 --> 00:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
even if like our student suppose that
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
there was a dramatic drop in student
 
00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.070 align:start position:0%
there was a dramatic drop in student
population

00:19:10.070 --> 00:19:10.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.280 align:start position:0%
next year not in the next biennium
 
00:19:16.150 --> 00:19:16.160 align:start position:0%
would we still have we'd still have to
 
00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
to fund it at 14 million or risk losing
 
00:19:19.909 --> 00:19:19.919 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
yes um and you know
 
00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of friends if there is
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
if there's a drastic change
 
00:19:30.789 --> 00:19:30.799 align:start position:0%
in a state situation we can request
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
um a recalculation of the moe
 
00:19:37.990 --> 00:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
but uh the it is intended as
 
00:19:39.510 --> 00:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh if the federal government is going to
 
00:19:41.510 --> 00:19:41.520 align:start position:0%
continue to give us
 
00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:44.240 align:start position:0%
million dollars in perkins money based
 
00:19:45.990 --> 00:19:46.000 align:start position:0%
on our student population
 
00:19:48.630 --> 00:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
and we've committed to providing x
 
00:19:50.549 --> 00:19:50.559 align:start position:0%
amount of dollars say it's 14 million in
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
state money
 
00:19:55.350 --> 00:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
we can't drop our 14 million because
 
00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:57.280 align:start position:0%
they're still giving us the six
 
00:20:00.310 --> 00:20:00.320 align:start position:0%
so okay okay all right
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
all right i see what you're saying okay
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
thank you i think i mean i think
 
00:20:05.350 --> 00:20:05.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance of efforts are extremely
 
00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:05.990 align:start position:0%
maintenance of efforts are extremely
frustrating

00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
frustrating
 
00:20:08.470 --> 00:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
in that way because it forces people to
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
keep sometimes expenditures low when it
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't allow the flexibility
 
00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:14.640 align:start position:0%
um but i guess that is also the point is
 
00:20:16.470 --> 00:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
that so that there will not be
 
00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
you know kind of ebbs and flows as far
 
00:20:20.070 --> 00:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
as funding different programs but
 
00:20:22.710 --> 00:20:22.720 align:start position:0%
there have certainly been times that you
 
00:20:23.350 --> 00:20:23.360 align:start position:0%
all have
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
you know thought about spending more
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
money on a certain program but then
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
because if you added the money that you
 
00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:30.960 align:start position:0%
had was a one-time money to add
 
00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
um that could cause future declines or
 
00:20:35.669 --> 00:20:35.679 align:start position:0%
elimination of the federal program at
 
00:20:37.350 --> 00:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
the state level if you haven't funded it
 
00:20:37.360 --> 00:20:38.070 align:start position:0%
the state level if you haven't funded it
and

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
it's it's frustrating i've had that
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
conversation with federal partners in
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
the past
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
and um they don't seem to you know
 
00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:45.110 align:start position:0%
and um they don't seem to you know
really

00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:20:48.149 --> 00:20:48.159 align:start position:0%
get it yeah so it's yeah
 
00:20:50.149 --> 00:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
it's a it's unfor it's an unfortunate um
 
00:20:51.510 --> 00:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
side effect of maintenance of effort
 
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.510 align:start position:0%
side effect of maintenance of effort
requirements

00:20:53.510 --> 00:20:53.520 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
uh if we did this do we know what the
 
00:20:59.430 --> 00:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
additional maintenance of effort
 
00:21:08.950 --> 00:21:08.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
our maintenance of effort would increase
 
00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:12.559 align:start position:0%
by whatever
 
00:21:17.590 --> 00:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
the tnt amount was increased by
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
so you're saying our level of effort
 
00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:20.789 align:start position:0%
so you're saying our level of effort
money

00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:20.799 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
would go up from whatever it is today it
 
00:21:23.909 --> 00:21:23.919 align:start position:0%
would go up
 
00:21:27.990 --> 00:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
another 10 million dollars
 
00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
is that what i heard you say no well the
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
the increase of if you
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
increased tnt by three million dollars
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
then that would our maintenance of
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
effort would increase by that same three
 
00:21:44.070 --> 00:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
okay so it's kind of a double whammy is
 
00:21:55.909 --> 00:21:55.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh so uh for example our
 
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh the maintenance of effort for our
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
projected maintenance of effort
 
00:22:06.470 --> 00:22:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.830 --> 00:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
22 right now
 
00:22:10.840 --> 00:22:17.270 align:start position:0%
22 right now
is

00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
nine million five hundred and twenty two
 
00:22:22.470 --> 00:22:22.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is what our protect our
 
00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:23.909 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars is what our protect our
projected

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
projected
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
um maintenance of effort would be for
 
00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.350 align:start position:0%
um maintenance of effort would be for
fy22

00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:31.029 --> 00:22:31.039 align:start position:0%
based on the 9 million for tuition
 
00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
transportation and then all of the other
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.549 --> 00:22:40.559 align:start position:0%
if we increase tnt by three million
 
00:22:40.559 --> 00:22:41.750 align:start position:0%
if we increase tnt by three million
dollars

00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:22:46.549 --> 00:22:46.559 align:start position:0%
then our moe would become
 
00:22:52.230 --> 00:22:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.789 --> 00:22:54.799 align:start position:0%
and then the following year it would it
 
00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
would continue to and they always move
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
up every year because
 
00:23:00.149 --> 00:23:00.159 align:start position:0%
as you know salaries and benefits for
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
all the state might see employers
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
it will keep inching up and so we would
 
00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
need to continue to
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
to meet that match yes
 
00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:10.640 align:start position:0%
okay represent murray you have a
 
00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.070 align:start position:0%
okay represent murray you have a
question

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i just want to i guess
 
00:23:14.159 --> 00:23:15.110 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you i just want to i guess
interject

00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
interject
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
so given demographic projections even
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
though you have a really strong and
 
00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:20.559 align:start position:0%
robust program
 
00:23:22.390 --> 00:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
there being fewer people around to
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
attend the programs
 
00:23:25.669 --> 00:23:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's a pretty good bet that enrollment
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:33.110 --> 00:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
we're actually hoping not i can
 
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.350 align:start position:0%
we're actually hoping not i can
certainly

00:23:35.350 --> 00:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
understand an argument on both sides of
 
00:23:39.830 --> 00:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
this our goal is to expand cte to more
 
00:23:39.840 --> 00:23:40.470 align:start position:0%
this our goal is to expand cte to more
students

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:40.480 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:23:43.590 --> 00:23:43.600 align:start position:0%
uh and that as especially as the state
 
00:23:44.630 --> 00:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
continues to push
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
towards the 65 by 25 enrolling more and
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
more students into cte
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
whether they are physically at the cte
 
00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:55.600 align:start position:0%
the regional cte centers or we begin
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
offering cte programming at
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
local high schools we are talking to
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
vlax about offering cte programs
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
through vlax so we are we are absolutely
 
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
hoping to expand cte
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
eric um for this this cte for yours does
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
it have a student way of looking at it
 
00:24:18.710 --> 00:24:18.720 align:start position:0%
or it's just dollar for dollar because i
 
00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:20.000 align:start position:0%
know some of our maintenance of efforts
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
look at the number of students and some
 
00:24:21.909 --> 00:24:21.919 align:start position:0%
of them
 
00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:25.120 align:start position:0%
you just know we are we are
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
strictly dollar so for example just for
 
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
the committee's knowledge so we have a
 
00:24:30.950 --> 00:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort for like our title
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
programs for every student succeeds act
 
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
and our maintenance of effort for that
 
00:24:37.269 --> 00:24:37.279 align:start position:0%
looks you can do it two different ways
 
00:24:38.950 --> 00:24:38.960 align:start position:0%
you can look at total spending or you
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
can look at
 
00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
student by students or student spending
 
00:24:47.750 --> 00:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
pet spending by student there we go
 
00:24:50.470 --> 00:24:50.480 align:start position:0%
well uh thank you air oh i'm sorry
 
00:24:51.909 --> 00:24:51.919 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you had another
 
00:24:51.919 --> 00:24:54.070 align:start position:0%
representative lynn you had another
question

00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm sorry i'm sorry i just wanna so
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
you know what can i just ask one other
 
00:24:58.710 --> 00:24:58.720 align:start position:0%
thing to make sure that i'm fully
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
understanding this does the
 
00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
federal amount
 
00:25:05.350 --> 00:25:05.360 align:start position:0%
does the amount that the federal
 
00:25:07.029 --> 00:25:07.039 align:start position:0%
government gives us
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
related to this does that change based
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
upon students
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
in other words if we if we say in a you
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
know in a future biennium well we have
 
00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:17.360 align:start position:0%
less students are they going to give us
 
00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:18.549 align:start position:0%
less students are they going to give us
less

00:25:18.549 --> 00:25:18.559 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
less federal money so the the perkins
 
00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.669 align:start position:0%
less federal money so the the perkins
allocation

00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:26.880 align:start position:0%
um is cannot be lower
 
00:25:30.549 --> 00:25:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:33.909 --> 00:25:33.919 align:start position:0%
but it will increase it increases if the
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
federal government increases the budget
 
00:25:35.990 --> 00:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
for it or
 
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
if our student population
 
00:25:42.870 --> 00:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
and part of it is our student population
 
00:25:45.669 --> 00:25:45.679 align:start position:0%
uh on um under the poverty line
 
00:25:45.679 --> 00:25:46.789 align:start position:0%
uh on um under the poverty line
increases

00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
increases
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
but under the perkins regulation if we
 
00:25:51.669 --> 00:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
receive 6.1 million dollars this year
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
our allocation next year cannot be less
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
than 6.1 million dollars
 
00:25:59.269 --> 00:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
but hopefully it will continue to go up
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
as the federal government
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
each year has increased the funding by
 
00:26:05.909 --> 00:26:05.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
so yes so it will not go down all right
 
00:26:09.510 --> 00:26:09.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
i think i'm learning more about the
 
00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
perkins grant than i ever wanted to know
 
00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
perkins grant than i ever wanted to know
but

00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:26:22.310 --> 00:26:22.320 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i did not
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
i did not realize that uh the perkins
 
00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:26.789 align:start position:0%
i did not realize that uh the perkins
grant

00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.870 --> 00:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
oh for the the moe yes yeah for the ml
 
00:26:36.230 --> 00:26:36.240 align:start position:0%
for the moe
 
00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
i did not if i knew that i didn't
 
00:26:41.029 --> 00:26:41.039 align:start position:0%
remember it so
 
00:26:43.590 --> 00:26:43.600 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
 
00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.630 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions for
eric

00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
by the way he's doing a great job in the
 
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.789 align:start position:0%
by the way he's doing a great job in the
cte

00:26:52.789 --> 00:26:52.799 align:start position:0%
cte
 
00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
arena so uh thank you for

advisory committee now as well
representative

00:27:06.149 --> 00:27:06.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:27:09.190 --> 00:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
yeah okay that'll be fun all right thank
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
you very much i appreciate it
 
00:27:14.549 --> 00:27:14.559 align:start position:0%
uh caitlyn um can you bring up something
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
that's easier please
 
00:27:20.149 --> 00:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
i can try um let's see
 
00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:22.960 align:start position:0%
we could try with special education aid
 
00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.510 align:start position:0%
we could try with special education aid
um

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:26.470 --> 00:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
well there's a good one yeah it might be
 
00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
easier i'm not 100 sure
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
um so for special education aid
 
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that we have um
 
00:27:37.990 --> 00:27:38.000 align:start position:0%
did fully fund the appropriation and
 
00:27:39.269 --> 00:27:39.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
did fully fund the liability so we were
 
00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.029 align:start position:0%
did fully fund the liability so we were
appropriated

00:27:43.029 --> 00:27:43.039 align:start position:0%
appropriated
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
30 point um
 
00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:50.720 align:start position:0%
sorry just trying to read this
 
00:27:52.789 --> 00:27:52.799 align:start position:0%
special education so we were
 
00:27:54.870 --> 00:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
appropriating 30.8 million dollars in
 
00:27:57.510 --> 00:27:57.520 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 in fiscal year 22
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
and in fiscal year 21 we we fully um
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
expended that obligation
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
meaning we gave all of the money to the
 
00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:06.480 align:start position:0%
schools and were able to pay them at 100
 
00:28:10.389 --> 00:28:10.399 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2020
 
00:28:12.630 --> 00:28:12.640 align:start position:0%
we were slightly short we prorated
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
schools at
 
00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
94 meaning that we
 
00:28:18.789 --> 00:28:18.799 align:start position:0%
think that fully funding catastrophic
 
00:28:18.799 --> 00:28:19.750 align:start position:0%
think that fully funding catastrophic
aid

00:28:19.750 --> 00:28:19.760 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:28:22.870 --> 00:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
state special education aid at
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
around 30 million dollars will likely
 
00:28:26.789 --> 00:28:26.799 align:start position:0%
fully fund
 
00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:29.840 align:start position:0%
um on a normal year
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
it to fully fund it it would have needed
 
00:28:33.269 --> 00:28:33.279 align:start position:0%
to be around
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
33 to 34 million dollars
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
for 21 or sorry for 20. now when i'm
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
talking about 20 though
 
00:28:43.110 --> 00:28:43.120 align:start position:0%
remember that i'm talking about the kids
 
00:28:45.029 --> 00:28:45.039 align:start position:0%
that were in school in fiscal
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
19 or 18 and 19. so it was based on one
 
00:28:49.269 --> 00:28:49.279 align:start position:0%
year behind
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
um so then we were talking about fiscal
 
00:28:53.510 --> 00:28:53.520 align:start position:0%
year 21 it was the kids that were in
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
school year 2019 2020
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
and we had because we had less
 
00:29:00.470 --> 00:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
expenditures and less kids a lot of that
 
00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:02.320 align:start position:0%
had to do with the pandemic
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
beginning in the in march and some of
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
those out of district placement kids
 
00:29:08.230 --> 00:29:08.240 align:start position:0%
being sent home
 
00:29:10.789 --> 00:29:10.799 align:start position:0%
so the costs of those kids were less for
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
21. so that's why we suggest for a
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
normal year we think that
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
a 33 to 34 million dollar appropriation
 
00:29:23.029 --> 00:29:23.039 align:start position:0%
would make the most sense now there is
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
less legislation right now that's
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
proposed to
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
change three and a half times two and a
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
half times so those of you that remember
 
00:29:33.110 --> 00:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
our presentation from a couple weeks ago
 
00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:37.120 align:start position:0%
um so right now we pay for costs for
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
kids that accept
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
exceed three and a half times the
 
00:29:41.669 --> 00:29:41.679 align:start position:0%
average cost for people
 
00:29:44.710 --> 00:29:44.720 align:start position:0%
to educate so right now that's about um
 
00:29:47.190 --> 00:29:47.200 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars per kid that was then
 
00:29:49.110 --> 00:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
eligible for reimbursement
 
00:29:51.750 --> 00:29:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's legislation pending to change
 
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
that to two and a half times and so we
 
00:29:56.549 --> 00:29:56.559 align:start position:0%
estimate that the cost
 
00:30:00.149 --> 00:30:00.159 align:start position:0%
to fund the two and a half times kids
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
um or to change that adjustment would be
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
an additional 10 million dollars
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
for just the kids that we have now the
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
thing that i want to point out is is so
 
00:30:11.669 --> 00:30:11.679 align:start position:0%
school districts don't enter information
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
to us or provide us with information and
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
costs associated with kids
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
until they make that three and a half
 
00:30:18.470 --> 00:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
times so
 
00:30:19.909 --> 00:30:19.919 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about that 10 million
 
00:30:21.830 --> 00:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
dollars is we have the data for those
 
00:30:23.269 --> 00:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
kids that are three and a half times so
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
we can figure out how much
 
00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
more we would owe the school districts
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
at two and a half times
 
00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:29.600 align:start position:0%
the data that we don't have at the
 
00:30:31.510 --> 00:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
department of education and there's a
 
00:30:33.190 --> 00:30:33.200 align:start position:0%
big wild card in this
 
00:30:36.149 --> 00:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
is that the two and a half if uh the
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
number of kids
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
that kind of right now fall between the
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
two and a half times and the three and a
 
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
half times
 
00:30:43.430 --> 00:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
cost you know we don't have any
 
00:30:45.029 --> 00:30:45.039 align:start position:0%
information for them there may be
 
00:30:46.470 --> 00:30:46.480 align:start position:0%
another thousand kids there
 
00:30:48.549 --> 00:30:48.559 align:start position:0%
could be several thousand kids we have
 
00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:50.000 align:start position:0%
about thirty 000 special
 
00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:52.240 align:start position:0%
education kids in the state right now of
 
00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.110 align:start position:0%
education kids in the state right now of
which

00:30:53.110 --> 00:30:53.120 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:30:55.830 --> 00:30:55.840 align:start position:0%
um about 900 of them are eligible for
 
00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:56.789 align:start position:0%
um about 900 of them are eligible for
catastrophic

00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
catastrophic
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
state special education aid um and so
 
00:31:00.789 --> 00:31:00.799 align:start position:0%
that number would
 
00:31:03.190 --> 00:31:03.200 align:start position:0%
likely increase um but we don't know
 
00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
uh could you repeat the number of
 
00:31:11.990 --> 00:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
children at the three and a half percent
 
00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:12.630 align:start position:0%
children at the three and a half percent
please

00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:12.640 align:start position:0%
please
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
sure so let me pull up the exact number
 
00:31:16.310 --> 00:31:16.320 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:31:29.350 --> 00:31:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
i have 742 is that what you have yes
 
00:31:33.029 --> 00:31:33.039 align:start position:0%
yeah that's the number
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
742. so 742 was the number this year
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
um mark could you pull up the number for
 
00:31:40.230 --> 00:31:40.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 or fiscal year 20 as well
 
00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.269 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 or fiscal year 20 as well
though

00:31:41.269 --> 00:31:41.279 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know if i have that it says 742
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
students who
 
00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.909 align:start position:0%
students who
are

00:31:49.909 --> 00:31:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
three times the 3.5 times the average
 
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
expenditure per pupil that's what their
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
special education aid is costing
 
00:31:59.669 --> 00:31:59.679 align:start position:0%
so it's costing about the average uh
 
00:32:01.909 --> 00:32:01.919 align:start position:0%
average expenditure per pupil
 
00:32:04.630 --> 00:32:04.640 align:start position:0%
is around 17 000 so they're costing
 
00:32:07.350 --> 00:32:07.360 align:start position:0%
closer to 60 000
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
are costing the state
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars is that what i'm
 
00:32:29.919 --> 00:32:30.470 align:start position:0%
60 million dollars is that what i'm
hearing

00:32:30.470 --> 00:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to screen share with you
 
00:32:37.509 --> 00:32:37.519 align:start position:0%
so you can see this you can see the
 
00:32:42.070 --> 00:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
chart in front of me here
 
00:32:45.509 --> 00:32:45.519 align:start position:0%
yes i can perfect um so
 
00:32:47.669 --> 00:32:47.679 align:start position:0%
you can see here for fiscal year 21 we
 
00:32:50.149 --> 00:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
had 742 kids
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
the total expended to those kids right
 
00:32:52.559 --> 00:32:53.269 align:start position:0%
the total expended to those kids right
now

00:32:53.269 --> 00:32:53.279 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:32:56.789 --> 00:32:56.799 align:start position:0%
um was 80 million dollars um then that's
 
00:32:58.549 --> 00:32:58.559 align:start position:0%
what the school districts cost total for
 
00:32:59.750 --> 00:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
those kids
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
um what the state would pay for them is
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
29 million dollars
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
at three and a half times now when we
 
00:33:08.230 --> 00:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
went back and did the math and we said
 
00:33:08.789 --> 00:33:08.799 align:start position:0%
all right well
 
00:33:10.630 --> 00:33:10.640 align:start position:0%
when when did the kid hit the cap cut
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
off of two and a half times
 
00:33:14.710 --> 00:33:14.720 align:start position:0%
um that would be an additional 10
 
00:33:16.549 --> 00:33:16.559 align:start position:0%
million dollars on top of this so about
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
40 million dollars
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
for this so this number wouldn't change
 
00:33:22.870 --> 00:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
right here so the districts are still
 
00:33:25.350 --> 00:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
spending that amount of money per kid
 
00:33:27.590 --> 00:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
no matter what it's just how much they
 
00:33:29.029 --> 00:33:29.039 align:start position:0%
are eligible for to submit for
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the state
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
because this 59 million becomes about 40
 
00:33:33.679 --> 00:33:37.269 align:start position:0%
because this 59 million becomes about 40
million

00:33:37.269 --> 00:33:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
so this is expense and then
 
00:33:41.430 --> 00:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the following year is
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:48.149 align:start position:0%
that correct
exactly

00:33:48.149 --> 00:33:48.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:51.200 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
00:33:54.470 --> 00:33:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i don't have an moe on this right
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
well we do have an moe on this um it's a
 
00:33:58.630 --> 00:33:58.640 align:start position:0%
little bit more
 
00:34:01.110 --> 00:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
um or less complicated or more
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
complicated depending on
 
00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
what you want to say so um that
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort also has several
 
00:34:09.190 --> 00:34:09.200 align:start position:0%
other pots of money in it including
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding and some 402 funding
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
in other areas um so there is a
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort if you did
 
00:34:18.149 --> 00:34:18.159 align:start position:0%
increase it in theory it could increase
 
00:34:20.629 --> 00:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
increase the maintenance of effort i do
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
believe though for
 
00:34:23.750 --> 00:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
special education they have two
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
different things so they have a
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
way of looking at it by pu by people so
 
00:34:30.310 --> 00:34:30.320 align:start position:0%
they look at the number of student
 
00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.349 align:start position:0%
they look at the number of student
spending

00:34:31.349 --> 00:34:31.359 align:start position:0%
spending
 
00:34:33.829 --> 00:34:33.839 align:start position:0%
and it's also a percentage reduction so
 
00:34:35.430 --> 00:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
if you reduce it by two percent then
 
00:34:37.510 --> 00:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
they reduce the idea grant by two
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
percent rather than a dollar for dollar
 
00:34:43.030 --> 00:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
dollar dollar reduction um so um
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
and and because adequacy is in the
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort for this one it's
 
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:46.710 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort for this one it's
there's

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
there's
 
00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
definitely a lot more flexibility
 
00:34:53.990 --> 00:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:57.109 --> 00:34:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions that
 
00:34:59.270 --> 00:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
anyone has on
 
00:35:04.710 --> 00:35:04.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
so if i understood correctly to get it
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.150 align:start position:0%
so if i understood correctly to get it
down

00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:11.920 align:start position:0%
to the two and a half percent
 
00:35:14.069 --> 00:35:14.079 align:start position:0%
that would require an additional 10
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars is that correct yes that
 
00:35:17.190 --> 00:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
is correct
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
so i do want to point out through that
 
00:35:21.349 --> 00:35:21.359 align:start position:0%
there is um the availa
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
allowability in state law to prorate
 
00:35:25.349 --> 00:35:25.359 align:start position:0%
this amount of payment
 
00:35:27.190 --> 00:35:27.200 align:start position:0%
so if you were to say two and a half
 
00:35:28.470 --> 00:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
times the department
 
00:35:31.109 --> 00:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
add no appropriation for example the
 
00:35:33.270 --> 00:35:33.280 align:start position:0%
proration would just go
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
maybe down to 70 or 60 or maybe even 50
 
00:35:38.470 --> 00:35:38.480 align:start position:0%
depending how many more kids are added
 
00:35:40.950 --> 00:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement for you to add
 
00:35:43.030 --> 00:35:43.040 align:start position:0%
more appropriation but it certainly
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
decreases the amount of money each
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
school district may get
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
if they have a catastrophic aid special
 
00:35:50.630 --> 00:35:50.640 align:start position:0%
education student
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
i'll be right with you representative
 
00:35:54.870 --> 00:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
porter but i need a i need a follow-up
 
00:35:57.829 --> 00:35:57.839 align:start position:0%
the law right now if i'm not mistaken
 
00:35:57.839 --> 00:35:58.790 align:start position:0%
the law right now if i'm not mistaken
says

00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
that if there's any money left over
 
00:36:05.589 --> 00:36:05.599 align:start position:0%
in uh the paying
 
00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:08.560 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the three and a half that
 
00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:08.950 align:start position:0%
80 percent of the three and a half that
it

00:36:08.950 --> 00:36:08.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:36:11.670 --> 00:36:11.680 align:start position:0%
automatically goes to court-ordered
 
00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:12.790 align:start position:0%
automatically goes to court-ordered
placements

00:36:12.790 --> 00:36:12.800 align:start position:0%
placements
 
00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct and
 
00:36:19.750 --> 00:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
how is our funding currently for
 
00:36:23.190 --> 00:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
co-order placements so
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
so governor has it at
 
00:37:14.310 --> 00:37:14.320 align:start position:0%
two million uh each fiscal year
 
00:37:17.829 --> 00:37:17.839 align:start position:0%
so and and two million um with exception
 
00:37:18.790 --> 00:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
of last year
 
00:37:21.510 --> 00:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
is about correct so the last two years
 
00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:22.069 align:start position:0%
is about correct so the last two years
well

00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:37:25.030 --> 00:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
so our spending in fiscal year 2018 was
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
2.3 million
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
our spending in fiscal year 2009 sorry
 
00:37:33.109 --> 00:37:33.119 align:start position:0%
school year 2018 so fiscal year 2019
 
00:37:36.470 --> 00:37:36.480 align:start position:0%
was 22.3 million
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
um 18 and 19 was 2.8 million and 19 and
 
00:37:42.470 --> 00:37:42.480 align:start position:0%
20 is 3.2 million
 
00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.990 align:start position:0%
20 is 3.2 million
so

00:37:45.990 --> 00:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
we have quite a bit of spend in that um
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's for a hundred
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
we had 103 kids in fiscal year 1920
 
00:38:01.990 --> 00:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:05.109 --> 00:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay um i'll come back i
 
00:38:06.470 --> 00:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
i do have another question but
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
representative porter please
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um i apologize if
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
this was said and i missed it
 
00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
the number of students this year is
 
00:38:20.950 --> 00:38:20.960 align:start position:0%
significantly lower than two years ago
 
00:38:22.950 --> 00:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
is that and we are assuming that that's
 
00:38:24.950 --> 00:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
a function of
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
um the coven i guess i
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
are we looking at a reduction in this
 
00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
number that's likely to be permanent as
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
as um enrollment goes down or
 
00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
demographically or is this just a fluke
 
00:38:41.109 --> 00:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
this year that it's at 742
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
and you know two years ago it was if i
 
00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
remember the chart correctly it was
 
00:38:50.710 --> 00:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
so you can see i shared my chart again
 
00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:54.230 align:start position:0%
so you can see i shared my chart again
okay

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:57.280 align:start position:0%
it was not that much okay so we have had
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
a tendency to go down each year we are
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
trending down
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
um but i do think that likely this past
 
00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:05.109 align:start position:0%
um but i do think that likely this past
year

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:05.119 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:08.720 align:start position:0%
um was historically low because of cobit
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
because a lot of those fair care
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
facilities that the the children are in
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
were either closed or
 
00:39:15.589 --> 00:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
the parents chose to take the children
 
00:39:18.790 --> 00:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
home and and whatnot
 
00:39:22.550 --> 00:39:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:27.270 --> 00:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
yes am i understanding correctly that in
 
00:39:31.030 --> 00:39:31.040 align:start position:0%
the in i understand
 
00:39:33.430 --> 00:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
that in some other state aid programs
 
00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
that the situation is different but in
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
my understanding correctly that for this
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
for this uh state program
 
00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:42.960 align:start position:0%
no there's no fact there's no factor
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
that goes into the formula
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
that um accounts for the
 
00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term the
 
00:39:52.550 --> 00:39:52.560 align:start position:0%
wealthiness of the town where that where
 
00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
the child is
 
00:39:56.790 --> 00:39:56.800 align:start position:0%
uh um where the child who exceeds the
 
00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:57.190 align:start position:0%
uh um where the child who exceeds the
the

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:59.990 --> 00:40:00.000 align:start position:0%
limit uh lives yes that is accurate so
 
00:40:01.670 --> 00:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
the way this formula works is it
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
it just looks at the total spend for the
 
00:40:06.309 --> 00:40:06.319 align:start position:0%
child so it looks at the child's iep
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
and all of the allowable expenses in the
 
00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
iep in most cases
 
00:40:14.230 --> 00:40:14.240 align:start position:0%
um for a forum for state special
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
education kid
 
00:40:17.910 --> 00:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
usually has an out of district placement
 
00:40:19.670 --> 00:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
and it looks at the total costs that
 
00:40:21.670 --> 00:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
exceed three and a half times
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
and those total costs at three and a
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
half times are eligible to be reimbursed
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
by the state at 80 percent
 
00:40:29.829 --> 00:40:29.839 align:start position:0%
and if there's not enough money to pay
 
00:40:32.309 --> 00:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
80 that 80 percent is
 
00:40:36.470 --> 00:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
prorated but there's no there's not
 
00:40:38.309 --> 00:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
where the kid lives does not matter at
 
00:40:38.319 --> 00:40:40.069 align:start position:0%
where the kid lives does not matter at
all

00:40:40.069 --> 00:40:40.079 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:40:43.589 --> 00:40:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter did you have
 
00:40:47.109 --> 00:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
another question or you just didn't
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
lower your hand i'm sorry man i'm sure i
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
just didn't lower my hand
 
00:40:54.069 --> 00:40:54.079 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you um
 
00:40:57.990 --> 00:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:03.750 --> 00:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
if if we don't have enough money for
 
00:41:08.550 --> 00:41:08.560 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
in the budget we just pay it is that
 
00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.309 align:start position:0%
in the budget we just pay it is that
correct

00:41:12.309 --> 00:41:12.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:41:15.750 --> 00:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct and hopefully there's
 
00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:16.870 align:start position:0%
that's correct and hopefully there's
money

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:41:19.990 --> 00:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
available someplace to actually pay
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:26.079 --> 00:41:31.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:41:31.030 --> 00:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:34.480 align:start position:0%
are there um oh
 
00:41:35.910 --> 00:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
represent porter you have another
 
00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:41.510 align:start position:0%
represent porter you have another
question

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.270 --> 00:41:43.280 align:start position:0%
finish your question please and i'll ask
 
00:41:44.870 --> 00:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
mine next no i'm done
 
00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:47.359 align:start position:0%
thank you okay and i'm trying to get my
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
head around this the other figures that
 
00:41:50.309 --> 00:41:50.319 align:start position:0%
we were talking about
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
the three and a half times and those
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
things if the state reduces its
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
amount of funding there um that directly
 
00:41:59.670 --> 00:41:59.680 align:start position:0%
impacts what the school districts have
 
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:01.680 align:start position:0%
to pay and therefore what the
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayer has to absorb is
 
00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.030 align:start position:0%
local property taxpayer has to absorb is
that

00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
am i understanding that art correct so
 
00:42:09.510 --> 00:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
yes and these expenses are completely
 
00:42:10.950 --> 00:42:10.960 align:start position:0%
incurred by the school districts before
 
00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're eligible to be submitted to the
 
00:42:13.829 --> 00:42:13.839 align:start position:0%
department so the school districts
 
00:42:15.589 --> 00:42:15.599 align:start position:0%
haven't already incurred all of these
 
00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.390 align:start position:0%
haven't already incurred all of these
costs

00:42:16.390 --> 00:42:16.400 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:42:18.950 --> 00:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
regardless of what the state reimbursed
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
so the state would just use that amount
 
00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:21.109 align:start position:0%
so the state would just use that amount
the

00:42:21.109 --> 00:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
school district uses that additional
 
00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
amount from the state as as a
 
00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:27.200 align:start position:0%
revenue but the school district has to
 
00:42:28.950 --> 00:42:28.960 align:start position:0%
incur the cost regardless of what the
 
00:42:30.630 --> 00:42:30.640 align:start position:0%
state pays
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
can i follow up madam chair yes please
 
00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:33.750 align:start position:0%
can i follow up madam chair yes please
in

00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
it historically because i'm new to this
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
historically um is this very flexible
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
has the statement
 
00:42:43.829 --> 00:42:43.839 align:start position:0%
going up and down on what it reimburses
 
00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:45.520 align:start position:0%
or has it been pretty steady over the
 
00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:45.990 align:start position:0%
or has it been pretty steady over the
past

00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
past
 
00:42:50.870 --> 00:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
say five years so ten years
 
00:42:52.790 --> 00:42:52.800 align:start position:0%
um you can see can you see that chart
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
again yep
 
00:42:57.030 --> 00:42:57.040 align:start position:0%
okay um so that chart has to make just a
 
00:42:57.990 --> 00:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
little bit bigger
 
00:42:59.430 --> 00:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
um so you can see here's the
 
00:43:01.109 --> 00:43:01.119 align:start position:0%
appropriations so the state of new
 
00:43:01.119 --> 00:43:01.750 align:start position:0%
appropriations so the state of new
hampshire

00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:43:03.670 --> 00:43:03.680 align:start position:0%
kind of historically had increased it up
 
00:43:07.030 --> 00:43:07.040 align:start position:0%
until 2008 910
 
00:43:08.950 --> 00:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
and then we had a pretty large dip you
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
can remember what happened back in 2008
 
00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
9 and 10.
 
00:43:15.270 --> 00:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
state revenues um and then you can see
 
00:43:17.589 --> 00:43:17.599 align:start position:0%
it's been it has been fairly consistent
 
00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
consistent and then now um in the last
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
two years
 
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:23.440 align:start position:0%
there was an increase again so you can
 
00:43:25.990 --> 00:43:26.000 align:start position:0%
see also at this exact same time
 
00:43:29.109 --> 00:43:29.119 align:start position:0%
expenditures declined a little bit but
 
00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
not substantially
 
00:43:33.030 --> 00:43:33.040 align:start position:0%
and so you can see that we prorated it
 
00:43:34.470 --> 00:43:34.480 align:start position:0%
at you know 100
 
00:43:38.069 --> 00:43:38.079 align:start position:0%
then down to 90 85 77
 
00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
69 and kind of in the round in the 70s
 
00:43:42.950 --> 00:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
for most of the
 
00:43:46.230 --> 00:43:46.240 align:start position:0%
mid-2000s or 2010s or other teens
 
00:43:47.270 --> 00:43:47.280 align:start position:0%
whatever they are
 
00:43:51.190 --> 00:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
um and then you have uh the 94
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:58.790 --> 00:43:58.800 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.550 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
question

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:44:02.550 --> 00:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
yeah two things um i just want to
 
00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:03.670 align:start position:0%
yeah two things um i just want to
clarify

00:44:03.670 --> 00:44:03.680 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
00:44:05.589 --> 00:44:05.599 align:start position:0%
the bill that's moving the three and a
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
half to the two and a half um
 
00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
in the end benefits the towns and this
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
the state is going to have to pick up
 
00:44:13.670 --> 00:44:13.680 align:start position:0%
that extra amount this is a way of
 
00:44:15.109 --> 00:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount
 
00:44:17.430 --> 00:44:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the town not reducing the amount that
 
00:44:18.790 --> 00:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
the state's going to pay but reducing
 
00:44:20.069 --> 00:44:20.079 align:start position:0%
the amount that the town's going to pay
 
00:44:20.710 --> 00:44:20.720 align:start position:0%
i want to
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
make clarify that and the other thing
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
given we don't know the status of the
 
00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:26.069 align:start position:0%
given we don't know the status of the
bill

00:44:26.069 --> 00:44:26.079 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
or you know where the bill is going to
 
00:44:29.589 --> 00:44:29.599 align:start position:0%
end up
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
this isn't something i would generally
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
suggest but perhaps we need to think
 
00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.550 align:start position:0%
suggest but perhaps we need to think
about

00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:44:36.950 --> 00:44:36.960 align:start position:0%
making our decision but also having the
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
expectation that it may change when it
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
goes to the senate
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
when they know better what that bill is
 
00:44:43.430 --> 00:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
going to do and when they have
 
00:44:45.589 --> 00:44:45.599 align:start position:0%
they generally have a better sense of
 
00:44:46.870 --> 00:44:46.880 align:start position:0%
revenues than we do
 
00:44:53.430 --> 00:44:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have that we'll have that
 
00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.349 align:start position:0%
okay we'll have that we'll have that
discussion

00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
represent murray there's no no question
 
00:45:02.230 --> 00:45:02.240 align:start position:0%
about that
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
uh right now um that bill is retained
 
00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
in um in our committee
 
00:45:13.349 --> 00:45:13.359 align:start position:0%
and um we'll we'll see what happens with
 
00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:16.790 align:start position:0%
and um we'll we'll see what happens with
that

00:45:16.790 --> 00:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.829 --> 00:45:19.839 align:start position:0%

00:45:37.910 --> 00:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
i know that when covid hit there was a
 
00:45:39.670 --> 00:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
general freeze on
 
00:45:42.790 --> 00:45:42.800 align:start position:0%
things the governor put a freeze on
 
00:45:45.670 --> 00:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:48.640 align:start position:0%
has all that money that you listed down
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
the other 30 million or whatever the
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
figure was at the bottom of the chart
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
has that gone out to school districts
 
00:45:55.670 --> 00:45:55.680 align:start position:0%
yet or is that still
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
still being held no so we pay it on
 
00:46:00.790 --> 00:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
january first each year and there was no
 
00:46:02.550 --> 00:46:02.560 align:start position:0%
instruction to not pay that money so
 
00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.030 align:start position:0%
instruction to not pay that money so
okay

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%

on january 1st okay thank you very much
 
00:46:11.670 --> 00:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
okay what do we want to tackle next
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
caitlyn we could try adequacy
 
00:46:21.190 --> 00:46:21.200 align:start position:0%
oh now there's something that we can all
 
00:46:24.150 --> 00:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
agree on thank you
 
00:46:27.109 --> 00:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
so for adequacy i do actually want to
 
00:46:28.390 --> 00:46:28.400 align:start position:0%
point out to the commission
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
of the committee rather that there was
 
00:46:32.069 --> 00:46:32.079 align:start position:0%
an update to our packet that we had
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
handed out from the week before the
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
from the earlier this month we just had
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
one correction to a document that we
 
00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:39.589 align:start position:0%
one correction to a document that we
made

00:46:39.589 --> 00:46:39.599 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
but we in our document we highlighted
 
00:46:46.550 --> 00:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
um expenditures for both
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
sb 135 which is a bill
 
00:46:53.109 --> 00:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
that has surpassed the senate um i
 
00:46:53.119 --> 00:46:53.750 align:start position:0%
that has surpassed the senate um i
believe

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:46:56.950 --> 00:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
take being taken up shortly by house
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
education or finance i'm not sure if
 
00:47:00.309 --> 00:47:00.319 align:start position:0%
it's going directly to finance or
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
or whatnot um but so house bill 135
 
00:47:08.829 --> 00:47:08.839 align:start position:0%
um and i'm going to just share my screen
 
00:47:08.839 --> 00:47:10.150 align:start position:0%
um and i'm going to just share my screen
again

00:47:10.150 --> 00:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
the senate bill 135 sorry senate bill
 
00:47:13.510 --> 00:47:13.520 align:start position:0%
one yes
 
00:47:18.309 --> 00:47:18.319 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so
 
00:47:20.330 --> 00:47:20.340 align:start position:0%
these are the different um
 
00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:21.430 align:start position:0%
these are the different um
[Music]

00:47:21.430 --> 00:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
the different proposals right now so we
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
have the current law
 
00:47:29.109 --> 00:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
so current law is adequacy
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
funded at you know no changes to the law
 
00:47:32.079 --> 00:47:32.630 align:start position:0%
funded at you know no changes to the law
meaning

00:47:32.630 --> 00:47:32.640 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
that i just want to remind the committee
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
that some of the school districts have
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
experienced a substantial decline in the
 
00:47:40.470 --> 00:47:40.480 align:start position:0%
number of free and reduced lunch kids
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
that is because the federal government
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
allowed school districts to waive
 
00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
the authority to collect a free and
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch application
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
and provide a free and reduced lunch
 
00:47:54.950 --> 00:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
free or reduced lunch
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
meal to every single child that would
 
00:47:58.390 --> 00:47:58.400 align:start position:0%
like one
 
00:48:01.109 --> 00:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
so the number of kids that are free and
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch we don't actually think
 
00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:03.190 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch we don't actually think
that

00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:06.069 --> 00:48:06.079 align:start position:0%
have declined that much across the state
 
00:48:07.510 --> 00:48:07.520 align:start position:0%
however we do
 
00:48:10.790 --> 00:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
believe we do have a substantially lower
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
number of applications that were
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
provided to the department of education
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
so because of coba 19 we did have
 
00:48:18.710 --> 00:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
enrollment drops across the state
 
00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
we had an enrollment drop of
 
00:48:22.870 --> 00:48:22.880 align:start position:0%
approximately four percent across the
 
00:48:22.880 --> 00:48:23.750 align:start position:0%
approximately four percent across the
state

00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:48:25.670 --> 00:48:25.680 align:start position:0%
in a normal year and most of you all
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
know that we do have a
 
00:48:29.270 --> 00:48:29.280 align:start position:0%
population a student population that has
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
historically for the last 10 years
 
00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
been trending down but that downward
 
00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:36.400 align:start position:0%
trend has only been approximately one
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
percent per year
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
so the four percent is a substantially
 
00:48:41.349 --> 00:48:41.359 align:start position:0%
larger decline than we would have
 
00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:42.790 align:start position:0%
larger decline than we would have
predicted

00:48:42.790 --> 00:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
predicted
 
00:48:45.430 --> 00:48:45.440 align:start position:0%
however um the free and reduced lunch
 
00:48:47.109 --> 00:48:47.119 align:start position:0%
population you would think maybe would
 
00:48:49.589 --> 00:48:49.599 align:start position:0%
be a similar decline
 
00:48:51.430 --> 00:48:51.440 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch population across
 
00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
the state has declined
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
by 25 meaning that likely there's 25
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
percent of kids that are still free and
 
00:48:59.829 --> 00:48:59.839 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch in the state of new
 
00:48:59.839 --> 00:49:00.549 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch in the state of new
hampshire

00:49:00.549 --> 00:49:00.559 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:49:02.470 --> 00:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
but did not actually submit an
 
00:49:05.109 --> 00:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
application in for this school year
 
00:49:07.589 --> 00:49:07.599 align:start position:0%
so the current law requires the
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
department of education to use the data
 
00:49:09.920 --> 00:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
department of education to use the data
that

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
is submitted to the department there's
 
00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
no flexibilities that are allowed so if
 
00:49:16.390 --> 00:49:16.400 align:start position:0%
a school district has a kid
 
00:49:18.470 --> 00:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
they that submits an application they
 
00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:19.670 align:start position:0%
they that submits an application they
then

00:49:19.670 --> 00:49:19.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:49:21.030 --> 00:49:21.040 align:start position:0%
provide that information to the
 
00:49:22.470 --> 00:49:22.480 align:start position:0%
department of education and the
 
00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:24.160 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
00:49:27.589 --> 00:49:27.599 align:start position:0%
um provides approximately two thousand
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
dollars more kit per kid in the adequacy
 
00:49:32.470 --> 00:49:32.480 align:start position:0%
funding formula
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
so um the current law if we ran it right
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
now with just the number of kids that
 
00:49:38.549 --> 00:49:38.559 align:start position:0%
submitted an application
 
00:49:40.630 --> 00:49:40.640 align:start position:0%
that's where you're seeing the not the
 
00:49:42.390 --> 00:49:42.400 align:start position:0%
922 million
 
00:49:46.150 --> 00:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
the 922 million so quite a large shop
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget proposes that
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
00:49:53.030 --> 00:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
or proposes that the department of
 
00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:54.630 align:start position:0%
or proposes that the department of
education

00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
provide the same proportional amount of
 
00:49:58.230 --> 00:49:58.240 align:start position:0%
free and reduced
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
lunch aid or for the same number of kids
 
00:50:06.870 --> 00:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
as fiscal year 2020 so the previous year
 
00:50:09.990 --> 00:50:10.000 align:start position:0%
so if a school district was say 30
 
00:50:11.670 --> 00:50:11.680 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch based on the
 
00:50:13.270 --> 00:50:13.280 align:start position:0%
number of adms
 
00:50:15.349 --> 00:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
then we would use that same percentage
 
00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
00:50:20.870 --> 00:50:20.880 align:start position:0%
um so that proposal is 940 million
 
00:50:22.549 --> 00:50:22.559 align:start position:0%
dollars approximately
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
and health bill 135 says
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
provide the essentially use last year's
 
00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:30.390 align:start position:0%
provide the essentially use last year's
numbers

00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
00:50:31.910 --> 00:50:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so it's a you know if a school
 
00:50:34.230 --> 00:50:34.240 align:start position:0%
district had 20 kids last year
 
00:50:36.630 --> 00:50:36.640 align:start position:0%
use the 20 kids except for our school
 
00:50:38.309 --> 00:50:38.319 align:start position:0%
district that did have more kids because
 
00:50:39.270 --> 00:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
we do have a few
 
00:50:40.870 --> 00:50:40.880 align:start position:0%
school districts that have more kids so
 
00:50:42.950 --> 00:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
if they had 20 last year and 25 this
 
00:50:45.109 --> 00:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
year you would use the 25
 
00:50:47.270 --> 00:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
for all categories of aid for
 
00:50:48.790 --> 00:50:48.800 align:start position:0%
differentiated aid for
 
00:50:51.270 --> 00:50:51.280 align:start position:0%
base aid for english language learner
 
00:50:52.790 --> 00:50:52.800 align:start position:0%
and whatnot
 
00:50:54.950 --> 00:50:54.960 align:start position:0%
so those are the different proposals
 
00:50:56.470 --> 00:50:56.480 align:start position:0%
that you have in front of you
 
00:50:58.470 --> 00:50:58.480 align:start position:0%
there are a variety of other proposals
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
that i think have mostly been tabled at
 
00:51:01.030 --> 00:51:01.040 align:start position:0%
this point
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
um but we can discuss them if you need
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
or we can come up with an entirely new
 
00:51:05.119 --> 00:51:06.829 align:start position:0%
or we can come up with an entirely new
proposal

00:51:06.829 --> 00:51:06.839 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
00:51:06.839 --> 00:51:10.549 align:start position:0%
proposal
so

00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:15.109 --> 00:51:15.119 align:start position:0%
okay so um if i understood what you said
 
00:51:19.910 --> 00:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
that 20 roughly 29 million
 
00:51:24.390 --> 00:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
would be what's required to
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
uh put this put the
 
00:51:28.079 --> 00:51:31.190 align:start position:0%
uh put this put the
um

00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
the money back to 2020.
 
00:51:40.150 --> 00:51:40.160 align:start position:0%
yes 20 um 29 million on top of the
 
00:51:42.069 --> 00:51:42.079 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal
 
00:51:45.510 --> 00:51:45.520 align:start position:0%
to put it used to 2020 data yes okay
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
and you do actually want to specify that
 
00:51:57.589 --> 00:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
sp 135
 
00:51:59.829 --> 00:51:59.839 align:start position:0%
just says to you to use the average
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
daily membership so the number of kids
 
00:52:05.270 --> 00:52:05.280 align:start position:0%
um in 20 the 2021
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
formula which actually uses the 19 and
 
00:52:09.190 --> 00:52:09.200 align:start position:0%
20 numbers
 
00:52:12.309 --> 00:52:12.319 align:start position:0%
um there was one time age but 135
 
00:52:14.470 --> 00:52:14.480 align:start position:0%
does not address the one-time aid it
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
only provides funding for the
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:29.829 --> 00:52:29.839 align:start position:0%
a four percent increase in student
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
population is what the difference is
 
00:52:36.150 --> 00:52:36.160 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you
 
00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.030 --> 00:52:43.040 align:start position:0%
yes madam chair thank you um but these
 
00:52:44.630 --> 00:52:44.640 align:start position:0%
these figures that you have here
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
do include differentiation for
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
um english language learners and um
 
00:52:54.309 --> 00:52:54.319 align:start position:0%
how about uh performance third grade
 
00:52:54.319 --> 00:52:54.710 align:start position:0%
how about uh performance third grade
test

00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
test
 
00:52:58.069 --> 00:52:58.079 align:start position:0%
performance and all those are in this
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
figure so yes
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
and you're using averages to get that so
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
if my school district
 
00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
had you know 10 kids that were getting
 
00:53:12.069 --> 00:53:12.079 align:start position:0%
extra aid for um getting free and
 
00:53:13.910 --> 00:53:13.920 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches you're just sending 10
 
00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:14.790 align:start position:0%
reduced lunches you're just sending 10
more

00:53:14.790 --> 00:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:53:18.390 --> 00:53:18.400 align:start position:0%
kids worth or yeah so um
 
00:53:21.430 --> 00:53:21.440 align:start position:0%
there's no actual averages in the in the
 
00:53:23.510 --> 00:53:23.520 align:start position:0%
calculation for average daily membership
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
which is
 
00:53:26.790 --> 00:53:26.800 align:start position:0%
kind of funny i know i know and it's
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
average daily membership and attendance
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
and we actually don't take into acc
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
attendance into to play here so a lot of
 
00:53:33.910 --> 00:53:33.920 align:start position:0%
people think if
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
a kid is sick um which was a large
 
00:53:38.069 --> 00:53:38.079 align:start position:0%
concern this spring as you could imagine
 
00:53:38.079 --> 00:53:38.630 align:start position:0%
concern this spring as you could imagine
that

00:53:38.630 --> 00:53:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:40.950 --> 00:53:40.960 align:start position:0%
kids um were staying home because of
 
00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:41.750 align:start position:0%
kids um were staying home because of
cobin

00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
cobin
 
00:53:44.069 --> 00:53:44.079 align:start position:0%
that a school district may receive less
 
00:53:46.230 --> 00:53:46.240 align:start position:0%
aid because of a kid calling out sick
 
00:53:49.349 --> 00:53:49.359 align:start position:0%
um that is not so there's no
 
00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
there's no average there's there's no
 
00:53:52.790 --> 00:53:52.800 align:start position:0%
attendance actually
 
00:53:54.870 --> 00:53:54.880 align:start position:0%
the attendance is referring to where the
 
00:53:56.549 --> 00:53:56.559 align:start position:0%
kid is attending
 
00:54:00.390 --> 00:54:00.400 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of adequacy but yes so
 
00:54:03.270 --> 00:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
for 135 we would look at the number of
 
00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:04.069 align:start position:0%
for 135 we would look at the number of
kids

00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
kids
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
that were in a school district's
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment that were free and reduced
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
lunch for example if there were 10 kids
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
we would pay for 10 kids if they had a
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
kid that came in in january
 
00:54:17.430 --> 00:54:17.440 align:start position:0%
um then we would so say they had you
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
know nine kids for most of the year and
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
then one kid
 
00:54:21.030 --> 00:54:21.040 align:start position:0%
transfers in january we would actually
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
pay nine and a half kids
 
00:54:24.630 --> 00:54:24.640 align:start position:0%
so we base it on the actual number of
 
00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
days a school a child is enrolled in a
 
00:54:31.670 --> 00:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:33.750 --> 00:54:33.760 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up madam chair oh
 
00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.790 align:start position:0%
can i have a follow-up madam chair oh
absolutely

00:54:34.790 --> 00:54:34.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:54:38.390 --> 00:54:38.400 align:start position:0%
thank you um so i'm trying
 
00:54:39.670 --> 00:54:39.680 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to make sure my brain is
 
00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:41.520 align:start position:0%
clear here i know here in hillsborough
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
deering there was a significant figure
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
the drop in this um ada and the reduced
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
um free reduced lunches i think the
 
00:54:51.030 --> 00:54:51.040 align:start position:0%
figure that the
 
00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:52.799 align:start position:0%
superintendent had told me was somewhere
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
between 400 and 500 thousand dollars for
 
00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:56.390 align:start position:0%
between 400 and 500 thousand dollars for
the

00:54:56.390 --> 00:54:56.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:54:58.630 --> 00:54:58.640 align:start position:0%
upcoming budget that they were figuring
 
00:54:59.910 --> 00:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
that we just passed
 
00:55:04.069 --> 00:55:04.079 align:start position:0%
in march when would this additional aid
 
00:55:06.150 --> 00:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
what time frame are we looking for if
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
this passes
 
00:55:10.069 --> 00:55:10.079 align:start position:0%
when does this money go toward the next
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
budgets for schools
 
00:55:15.109 --> 00:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
or toward the current budget um
 
00:55:18.230 --> 00:55:18.240 align:start position:0%
i guess i need schooling in that yeah
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
so we are talking about um right now so
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
adequacy funding this is the little the
 
00:55:26.069 --> 00:55:26.079 align:start position:0%
confusing thing about adequacy is it's
 
00:55:27.910 --> 00:55:27.920 align:start position:0%
paid on one year behind
 
00:55:31.109 --> 00:55:31.119 align:start position:0%
kids so right now um and we're in fiscal
 
00:55:31.990 --> 00:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
year 21
 
00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the school district
 
00:55:35.030 --> 00:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
budget for fiscal year 21
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
but they're getting paid for the number
 
00:55:39.349 --> 00:55:39.359 align:start position:0%
of kids that were in school in 2019 and
 
00:55:39.359 --> 00:55:40.789 align:start position:0%
of kids that were in school in 2019 and
2020.

00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
2020.
 
00:55:42.549 --> 00:55:42.559 align:start position:0%
so what we're talking about here is the
 
00:55:44.470 --> 00:55:44.480 align:start position:0%
school district budgets for fiscal year
 
00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.750 align:start position:0%
school district budgets for fiscal year
22

00:55:45.750 --> 00:55:45.760 align:start position:0%
22
 
00:55:48.150 --> 00:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
which most passed in the last couple
 
00:55:49.910 --> 00:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
weeks here
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
um and we're talking about state fiscal
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
year budget 22
 
00:55:58.309 --> 00:55:58.319 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be based on 2020
 
00:56:00.789 --> 00:56:00.799 align:start position:0%
and 21 school year kids so the kids are
 
00:56:02.549 --> 00:56:02.559 align:start position:0%
in our school right now
 
00:56:05.109 --> 00:56:05.119 align:start position:0%
okay and the money goes when does when
 
00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
does the school district get the check
 
00:56:08.470 --> 00:56:08.480 align:start position:0%
from the state yeah so
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
four times a year um they receive their
 
00:56:12.150 --> 00:56:12.160 align:start position:0%
first check on september first of every
 
00:56:13.990 --> 00:56:14.000 align:start position:0%
year their second check on november 1st
 
00:56:15.990 --> 00:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
and their third check on
 
00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:17.760 align:start position:0%
january 1st and their last check on
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:27.510 --> 00:56:27.520 align:start position:0%
and caitlin correct me if i'm wrong
 
00:56:31.349 --> 00:56:31.359 align:start position:0%
but if the population
 
00:56:34.549 --> 00:56:34.559 align:start position:0%
the school population
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
goes up or down during
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
each of those check periods then the
 
00:56:45.190 --> 00:56:45.200 align:start position:0%
aid goes up and down as well um
 
00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:48.000 align:start position:0%
so it wouldn't affect the check period
 
00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
because by the check period
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
um we're working one year behind so it's
 
00:56:51.839 --> 00:56:52.710 align:start position:0%
um we're working one year behind so it's
completely

00:56:52.710 --> 00:56:52.720 align:start position:0%
completely
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
finalized but if um when we have our
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
final when we have our calculation that
 
00:56:59.190 --> 00:56:59.200 align:start position:0%
we do in october first every year
 
00:57:01.349 --> 00:57:01.359 align:start position:0%
we base it on the end of the year data
 
00:57:03.750 --> 00:57:03.760 align:start position:0%
and we take it down into the half day
 
00:57:05.349 --> 00:57:05.359 align:start position:0%
level so if a kid were in one school
 
00:57:06.789 --> 00:57:06.799 align:start position:0%
district for half a day
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
and then transferred at lunchtime to
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
another school district the school
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
districts would receive that for
 
00:57:12.789 --> 00:57:12.799 align:start position:0%
the proportional aid it's a very
 
00:57:16.549 --> 00:57:16.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:20.150 --> 00:57:20.160 align:start position:0%
so this aid stays
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
the same all year and the next and then
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
for 23 school year
 
00:57:30.710 --> 00:57:30.720 align:start position:0%
22 23 school year is when
 
00:57:34.630 --> 00:57:34.640 align:start position:0%
any number of children up or down
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:41.349 --> 00:57:41.359 align:start position:0%
um i'm a little confused by your
 
00:57:41.359 --> 00:57:42.150 align:start position:0%
um i'm a little confused by your
question

00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:57:45.349 --> 00:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
on that one i guess what i'm saying is
 
00:57:49.190 --> 00:57:49.200 align:start position:0%
is that the any any adjustment in number
 
00:57:50.549 --> 00:57:50.559 align:start position:0%
of children
 
00:57:54.069 --> 00:57:54.079 align:start position:0%
that occurred this year would be
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in what the school
 
00:57:56.640 --> 00:57:57.190 align:start position:0%
would be reflected in what the school
district

00:57:57.190 --> 00:57:57.200 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:58:00.710 --> 00:58:00.720 align:start position:0%
received next year yes so yes this
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
any kids are in school right now that
 
00:58:03.750 --> 00:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
are changing will be
 
00:58:06.069 --> 00:58:06.079 align:start position:0%
in 22 and then kids that are going to
 
00:58:08.069 --> 00:58:08.079 align:start position:0%
say start this coming fall will be the
 
00:58:13.510 --> 00:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay and so the
 
00:58:20.829 --> 00:58:20.839 align:start position:0%
the number that 135
 
00:58:24.150 --> 00:58:24.160 align:start position:0%
says to true up
 
00:58:28.710 --> 00:58:28.720 align:start position:0%
the um the budget or to true up
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
adequacy for 22
 
00:58:37.109 --> 00:58:37.119 align:start position:0%
and 23 would be an additional 28 million
 
00:58:37.750 --> 00:58:37.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:58:41.030 --> 00:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes just
 
00:58:45.910 --> 00:58:45.920 align:start position:0%
scroll to the top here yes 28 million
 
00:58:49.030 --> 00:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
all right does anyone have any more
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay very good can we try the next
 
00:59:03.030 --> 00:59:03.040 align:start position:0%
issue so the next issue
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
is building aid so i actually might put
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
mickey on the spot a little bit on this
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
one because i know he was doing a lot of
 
00:59:11.270 --> 00:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
homework over the weekend on building
 
00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:12.309 align:start position:0%
homework over the weekend on building
aid

00:59:12.309 --> 00:59:12.319 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:59:15.430 --> 00:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
but so for building aid we have the
 
00:59:16.549 --> 00:59:16.559 align:start position:0%
building aid tale
 
00:59:19.990 --> 00:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
that we fund historically that we
 
00:59:22.309 --> 00:59:22.319 align:start position:0%
likely should probably continue to fund
 
00:59:23.910 --> 00:59:23.920 align:start position:0%
um that building a tale
 
00:59:28.390 --> 00:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
is um over school bonded projects over
 
00:59:29.910 --> 00:59:29.920 align:start position:0%
20 years that was funded
 
00:59:31.910 --> 00:59:31.920 align:start position:0%
under the old way of funding building
 
00:59:31.920 --> 00:59:32.950 align:start position:0%
under the old way of funding building
aid

00:59:32.950 --> 00:59:32.960 align:start position:0%
aid
 
00:59:35.829 --> 00:59:35.839 align:start position:0%
and then we have requests for new
 
00:59:35.839 --> 00:59:36.870 align:start position:0%
and then we have requests for new
projects

00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
projects
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
so the new projects are projects that
 
00:59:41.030 --> 00:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
school districts have voted on
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
or are going to be voting on next spring
 
00:59:47.510 --> 00:59:47.520 align:start position:0%
and potentially will be going forward to
 
00:59:49.109 --> 00:59:49.119 align:start position:0%
build those schools
 
00:59:51.589 --> 00:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
um assuming that building aid is
 
00:59:51.599 --> 00:59:52.710 align:start position:0%
um assuming that building aid is
received

00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
received
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
so those schools we have a prioritized
 
00:59:55.680 --> 00:59:57.510 align:start position:0%
so those schools we have a prioritized
list

00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:00:00.069 --> 01:00:00.079 align:start position:0%
of schools the department hasn't
 
01:00:00.789 --> 01:00:00.799 align:start position:0%
published it's
 
01:00:02.549 --> 01:00:02.559 align:start position:0%
sorry the state board of education
 
01:00:04.390 --> 01:00:04.400 align:start position:0%
hasn't published its ranked
 
01:00:07.349 --> 01:00:07.359 align:start position:0%
state list yet but the way that it works
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
is if any new money is appropriated in
 
01:00:10.630 --> 01:00:10.640 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
01:00:13.030 --> 01:00:13.040 align:start position:0%
mon that building aid would go to
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
projects on the list
 
01:00:17.910 --> 01:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
that have voted um there or have passed
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
rather their warrant article to build
 
01:00:22.309 --> 01:00:22.319 align:start position:0%
the building
 
01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:29.450 align:start position:0%
or the renovation or whatnot so
 
01:00:29.450 --> 01:00:31.190 align:start position:0%
or the renovation or whatnot so
[Music]

01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
are there any schools any building
 
01:00:40.829 --> 01:00:40.839 align:start position:0%
aid that would be applicable to
 
01:00:43.030 --> 01:00:43.040 align:start position:0%
2022 yes
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
mickey do you happen to have that list
 
01:00:48.630 --> 01:00:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
i mean these are folks that have already
 
01:00:52.470 --> 01:00:52.480 align:start position:0%
passed the bond
 
01:00:56.870 --> 01:00:56.880 align:start position:0%
and are just waiting for the school aid
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
so i i don't have it handy i just uh
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
so one thing i'm unsure of caitlin is
 
01:01:07.349 --> 01:01:07.359 align:start position:0%
um the last list i saw had winiswom as
 
01:01:08.230 --> 01:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
number one
 
01:01:10.789 --> 01:01:10.799 align:start position:0%
and allen's town is number two sunapee
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
is number three
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
um but i don't know if their prioritized
 
01:01:15.510 --> 01:01:15.520 align:start position:0%
ranking would change at all based on
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
this last town meeting because i know
 
01:01:18.710 --> 01:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
out of those three for instance only
 
01:01:20.950 --> 01:01:20.960 align:start position:0%
allen's town's been locally approved so
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
would that be elevated when we're
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
talking about new projects for the
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
upcoming biennium
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
so there's no requirement for the state
 
01:01:28.150 --> 01:01:28.160 align:start position:0%
board of education and the state
 
01:01:29.589 --> 01:01:29.599 align:start position:0%
building aid authority to
 
01:01:31.270 --> 01:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
change the ranking based on their
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
approval and
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
actually in a normal year they would be
 
01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:38.079 align:start position:0%
publishing the approved list well before
 
01:01:41.670 --> 01:01:41.680 align:start position:0%
the um the votes so typically um
 
01:01:44.630 --> 01:01:44.640 align:start position:0%
there that is published on december
 
01:01:46.390 --> 01:01:46.400 align:start position:0%
first of every year
 
01:01:48.150 --> 01:01:48.160 align:start position:0%
and then the votes obviously happen in
 
01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:49.750 align:start position:0%
and then the votes obviously happen in
march

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
march
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
because of the pandemic the department
 
01:01:54.230 --> 01:01:54.240 align:start position:0%
of education actually needed to seek
 
01:01:57.109 --> 01:01:57.119 align:start position:0%
a executive order to extend that
 
01:01:58.710 --> 01:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
deadline because we were not able to do
 
01:02:01.349 --> 01:02:01.359 align:start position:0%
a lot of the visits that we needed
 
01:02:03.270 --> 01:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
that were required to approve the
 
01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:04.710 align:start position:0%
that were required to approve the
projects

01:02:04.710 --> 01:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
projects
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
so the state board of education should
 
01:02:07.990 --> 01:02:08.000 align:start position:0%
be putting out their list
 
01:02:11.430 --> 01:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know if they will or will
 
01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
not change the order but there's no
 
01:02:16.789 --> 01:02:16.799 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to change the order
 
01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
i can share this if you want just uh so
 
01:02:20.870 --> 01:02:20.880 align:start position:0%
everyone can see the list we are talking
 
01:02:20.880 --> 01:02:21.589 align:start position:0%
everyone can see the list we are talking
about

01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.710 --> 01:02:30.720 align:start position:0%
can you see the excel hopefully yes yes
 
01:02:32.230 --> 01:02:32.240 align:start position:0%
we can
 
01:02:34.470 --> 01:02:34.480 align:start position:0%
so these are the three projects we were
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
just discussing here i could probably
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:42.630 --> 01:02:42.640 align:start position:0%
um but this is the information that we
 
01:02:44.470 --> 01:02:44.480 align:start position:0%
have that amy provided us
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
i think even in one of the older
 
01:02:47.349 --> 01:02:47.359 align:start position:0%
documents from a couple weeks ago this
 
01:02:48.150 --> 01:02:48.160 align:start position:0%
this information
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
is in there too but this would be the
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
column that you're looking at when
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the state
 
01:03:03.270 --> 01:03:03.280 align:start position:0%
aid portion of these projects
 
01:03:07.510 --> 01:03:07.520 align:start position:0%
so the first three well okay
 
01:03:10.870 --> 01:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
so all right so
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
allen's town has
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
voter approval if
 
01:03:21.109 --> 01:03:21.119 align:start position:0%
state aid is available which is roughly
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.829 --> 01:03:31.839 align:start position:0%
do not have
 
01:03:37.750 --> 01:03:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:42.829 --> 01:03:42.839 align:start position:0%
the 19 the 19 million
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
and a vote
 
01:03:51.270 --> 01:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.029 --> 01:04:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
would yeah okay would um
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
if they if they voted in favor of
 
01:04:12.710 --> 01:04:12.720 align:start position:0%
the bond in 2022
 
01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
then this money
 
01:04:19.750 --> 01:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
would come out in 23 the six and
 
01:04:25.349 --> 01:04:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:25.359 --> 01:04:31.190 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:04:31.190 --> 01:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:34.799 align:start position:0%
and do we have um
 
01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:39.920 align:start position:0%
down at the bottom salem nashua pelham
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
that have
 
01:04:45.430 --> 01:04:45.440 align:start position:0%
and oh nasho again
 
01:04:48.950 --> 01:04:48.960 align:start position:0%
all have approved
 
01:04:53.109 --> 01:04:53.119 align:start position:0%
the uh the school the the bond
 
01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:03.270 --> 01:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
was that in something that amy had given
 
01:05:04.470 --> 01:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
us before
 
01:05:05.990 --> 01:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
yes i believe so i think at the time
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
though the town meetings hadn't happened
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
so we didn't have the local approval
 
01:05:10.549 --> 01:05:10.559 align:start position:0%
status in that
 
01:05:13.589 --> 01:05:13.599 align:start position:0%
binder she gave yeah okay
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
because i had i had looked for this
 
01:05:16.950 --> 01:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
yesterday and
 
01:05:20.309 --> 01:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
didn't find it so um i can send this
 
01:05:21.750 --> 01:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
table out to the committee just so
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
everybody has this
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
okay that would be that would be good
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
mickey just so that we uh
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
so that we um we know what we're talking
 
01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:35.349 align:start position:0%
so that we um we know what we're talking
about

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:35.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
01:05:48.549 --> 01:05:48.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
i know that when we did redid the
 
01:05:54.069 --> 01:05:54.079 align:start position:0%
formula on school building aid
 
01:05:57.670 --> 01:05:57.680 align:start position:0%
we did it because we didn't like the
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
idea of
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
the state having to pay every year
 
01:06:07.349 --> 01:06:07.359 align:start position:0%
and the result of that is that right now
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
we have um
 
01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:13.440 align:start position:0%
26 million dollars in
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
roughly in tail money
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
and um that is
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh you know that that takes away
 
01:06:27.510 --> 01:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
significantly our ability
 
01:06:31.589 --> 01:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:42.069 --> 01:06:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:45.109 --> 01:06:45.119 align:start position:0%
if we decided to
 
01:06:49.029 --> 01:06:49.039 align:start position:0%
pay off some of that tail money
 
01:06:52.630 --> 01:06:52.640 align:start position:0%
the the money that um the state owes
 
01:06:55.829 --> 01:06:55.839 align:start position:0%
the individual school districts
 
01:06:59.510 --> 01:06:59.520 align:start position:0%
is that something that is um
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
feasible to bring that down
 
01:07:06.630 --> 01:07:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
and um you know
 
01:07:12.230 --> 01:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't give us any necessarily any
 
01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
money for
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 but it might help us
 
01:07:20.789 --> 01:07:20.799 align:start position:0%
significantly in
 
01:07:25.109 --> 01:07:25.119 align:start position:0%
the next budget the 24 25
 
01:07:28.230 --> 01:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
god i can't believe it's that far okay
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
so that so that's a very interesting
 
01:07:31.270 --> 01:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
question that i don't think
 
01:07:33.910 --> 01:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's ever asked before um so i
 
01:07:35.349 --> 01:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
think we would have to do a little bit
 
01:07:36.870 --> 01:07:36.880 align:start position:0%
of homework on our side of things for
 
01:07:36.880 --> 01:07:37.589 align:start position:0%
of homework on our side of things for
that

01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
um but i mean we at the department right
 
01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:42.150 align:start position:0%
um but i mean we at the department right
now

01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
we could certainly tell you exactly how
 
01:07:46.069 --> 01:07:46.079 align:start position:0%
much we owe each school district out
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
through 2041
 
01:07:48.870 --> 01:07:48.880 align:start position:0%
which is up the last tail payment that
 
01:07:50.630 --> 01:07:50.640 align:start position:0%
we have um the last
 
01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
in 2041 we have um only 700 000
 
01:07:57.109 --> 01:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
of payments um but so we could tell we
 
01:07:58.069 --> 01:07:58.079 align:start position:0%
could tell you that
 
01:08:01.190 --> 01:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so yeah
 
01:08:03.829 --> 01:08:03.839 align:start position:0%
we can look into that and and see um
 
01:08:03.839 --> 01:08:04.950 align:start position:0%
we can look into that and and see um
other

01:08:04.950 --> 01:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:08:07.109 --> 01:08:07.119 align:start position:0%
and i don't know if you would know know
 
01:08:09.430 --> 01:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
this but are there certain
 
01:08:11.190 --> 01:08:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh would you want to pay off a group of
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
projects do you think or would you
 
01:08:17.269 --> 01:08:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
i think just so katelyn's aware i kind
 
01:08:21.189 --> 01:08:21.199 align:start position:0%
of had a conversation with amy clark
 
01:08:22.149 --> 01:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
about this
 
01:08:24.550 --> 01:08:24.560 align:start position:0%
and she did um suggest that it could be
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
possible we probably need some
 
01:08:27.269 --> 01:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 language around the
 
01:08:29.189 --> 01:08:29.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation just so it's clear
 
01:08:31.030 --> 01:08:31.040 align:start position:0%
that if there was amounts appropriated
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
for school building 8 above and beyond
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
the required payments
 
01:08:35.349 --> 01:08:35.359 align:start position:0%
how those would be treated so if we were
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
going to prorate those for the
 
01:08:38.950 --> 01:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
future tail payments that are going to
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
be made you know in upcoming years as a
 
01:08:42.149 --> 01:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
way to pay down
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
the liability for the state i think she
 
01:08:45.120 --> 01:08:47.590 align:start position:0%
the liability for the state i think she
could

01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:50.789 --> 01:08:50.799 align:start position:0%
you know she could make those payments
 
01:08:52.550 --> 01:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
those would be probably at least for the
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
first year considered unanticipated
 
01:08:55.910 --> 01:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
revenues for the districts
 
01:08:58.709 --> 01:08:58.719 align:start position:0%
um that's a local school budget issue
 
01:08:58.719 --> 01:08:59.349 align:start position:0%
um that's a local school budget issue
but

01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:09:02.309 --> 01:09:02.319 align:start position:0%
from a state perspective you could
 
01:09:04.149 --> 01:09:04.159 align:start position:0%
recommend appropriating money to
 
01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:06.319 align:start position:0%
to pay off some of the tail quicker than
 
01:09:13.829 --> 01:09:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.229 --> 01:09:16.239 align:start position:0%
anyhow that's just a just another
 
01:09:16.239 --> 01:09:17.669 align:start position:0%
anyhow that's just a just another
thought

01:09:17.669 --> 01:09:17.679 align:start position:0%
thought
 
01:09:21.910 --> 01:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
we can um come up with the whatever it
 
01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.110 align:start position:0%
we can um come up with the whatever it
was

01:09:28.110 --> 01:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:09:30.550 --> 01:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
25 million
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
to do three
 
01:09:37.430 --> 01:09:37.440 align:start position:0%
projects and that that some other
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
amount of money might be
 
01:09:44.630 --> 01:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
more beneficial for the future of school
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
building aid
 
01:09:51.430 --> 01:09:51.440 align:start position:0%
so i mean i i just throw that out
 
01:09:54.950 --> 01:09:54.960 align:start position:0%
um as something to uh
 
01:09:57.990 --> 01:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
to think about okay
 
01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
i mean i think i think we have the the
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
information to have it done
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
so i just think it would take some
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:14.149 --> 01:10:14.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:17.270 --> 01:10:17.280 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions on this
 
01:10:21.750 --> 01:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
area from uh the committee
 
01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
okay caitlyn seeing none
 
01:10:29.189 --> 01:10:29.199 align:start position:0%
uh don't go back to careertech okay okay
 
01:10:31.750 --> 01:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh well the last one is i think it's
 
01:10:33.910 --> 01:10:33.920 align:start position:0%
probably also an equally complicated one
 
01:10:35.110 --> 01:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
just based on
 
01:10:36.550 --> 01:10:36.560 align:start position:0%
um maybe some questions that have been
 
01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
coming to the department of education
 
01:10:39.750 --> 01:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
but it is the public school
 
01:10:42.390 --> 01:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund um so as we know the
 
01:10:44.630 --> 01:10:44.640 align:start position:0%
governor appropriated 30 million dollars
 
01:10:46.229 --> 01:10:46.239 align:start position:0%
15 million dollars in
 
01:10:48.870 --> 01:10:48.880 align:start position:0%
22 in fiscal year 20 and 15 million
 
01:10:50.709 --> 01:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
dollars in fiscal year 23
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
for the public school infrastructure
 
01:10:54.950 --> 01:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
fund um just a reminder for those of you
 
01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:56.239 align:start position:0%
that are new the public school
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure is a fund is
 
01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:01.600 align:start position:0%
a fund of money that school districts
 
01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:01.910 align:start position:0%
a fund of money that school districts
can

01:11:01.910 --> 01:11:01.920 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:11:05.110 --> 01:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
apply for for infrastructure e-rate
 
01:11:08.229 --> 01:11:08.239 align:start position:0%
and school safety type projects
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
there's a legislative committee that
 
01:11:12.709 --> 01:11:12.719 align:start position:0%
reviews the school applications and
 
01:11:15.110 --> 01:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
approves the school applications and
 
01:11:16.550 --> 01:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
then the department of education
 
01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.510 align:start position:0%
then the department of education
reimburses

01:11:17.510 --> 01:11:17.520 align:start position:0%
reimburses
 
01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
school districts once the projects have
 
01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
been completed
 
01:11:26.390 --> 01:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
so we right now so the first bit of
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
money was appropriated to the public
 
01:11:30.310 --> 01:11:30.320 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund in 2017. it
 
01:11:32.149 --> 01:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
was about 20 million dollars
 
01:11:33.830 --> 01:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then the next pot of money if you
 
01:11:35.669 --> 01:11:35.679 align:start position:0%
believe it was fiscal year 19 but i'm
 
01:11:37.750 --> 01:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
not 100 sure on that another 10 million
 
01:11:40.229 --> 01:11:40.239 align:start position:0%
dollars is appropriate to that fund
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
those funds have been fully obligated to
 
01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:11:47.110 --> 01:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
and those projects have been paid out
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
so there is no more money available for
 
01:11:51.189 --> 01:11:51.199 align:start position:0%
new projects in the public school
 
01:11:52.709 --> 01:11:52.719 align:start position:0%
infrastructure at this time unless
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
there's a new appropriation
 
01:11:55.910 --> 01:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
which that 30 million dollars for the
 
01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:57.350 align:start position:0%
which that 30 million dollars for the
governor's

01:11:57.350 --> 01:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
governor's
 
01:12:02.310 --> 01:12:02.320 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget may would provide
 
01:12:06.070 --> 01:12:06.080 align:start position:0%
so questions about the public school
 
01:12:09.990 --> 01:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:12.950 --> 01:12:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative porter thank you madam
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
chair other
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
projects waiting for funding yes there
 
01:12:17.990 --> 01:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
is a wait list of
 
01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
projects the department provided that
 
01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:49.990 --> 01:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
can you see my screen again
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
yes we can okay so we have here um
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
there are it looks like there's 59
 
01:12:57.110 --> 01:12:57.120 align:start position:0%
projects on the wait list
 
01:13:00.310 --> 01:13:00.320 align:start position:0%
i actually don't have the total amount i
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
believe on the wait list
 
01:13:03.510 --> 01:13:03.520 align:start position:0%
but there are still project projects oh
 
01:13:04.870 --> 01:13:04.880 align:start position:0%
yep they're right there so
 
01:13:07.750 --> 01:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
1.2 million dollars of projects on the
 
01:13:13.510 --> 01:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.910 --> 01:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
so at this time the committee would
 
01:13:19.590 --> 01:13:19.600 align:start position:0%
probably have to review that project
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
in all projects um so you know if there
 
01:13:24.870 --> 01:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
was no money appropriated
 
01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:31.750 align:start position:0%
was no money appropriated
but

01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.830 --> 01:13:35.840 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:13:39.189 --> 01:13:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.470 --> 01:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
are any questions on this um
 
01:13:46.870 --> 01:13:46.880 align:start position:0%
this this is a commission
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
and not uh and not a a committee
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
okay it's um
 
01:13:55.750 --> 01:13:55.760 align:start position:0%
i don't know i don't know who's on it
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:13:59.110 --> 01:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
i mean obviously there are legislators
 
01:14:00.070 --> 01:14:00.080 align:start position:0%
on it but there's
 
01:14:05.270 --> 01:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
also um the commission of education
 
01:14:08.470 --> 01:14:08.480 align:start position:0%
um and a couple of other people that are
 
01:14:11.830 --> 01:14:11.840 align:start position:0%
outside the legislature and
 
01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
i believe that representative
 
01:14:20.430 --> 01:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
was appointed as one of the
 
01:14:22.950 --> 01:14:22.960 align:start position:0%
representatives to this commission if it
 
01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
representatives to this commission if it
continues

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:29.910 --> 01:14:29.920 align:start position:0%
okay any are there any questions at all
 
01:14:34.630 --> 01:14:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none caitlyn do you have
 
01:14:37.679 --> 01:14:38.229 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none caitlyn do you have
anything

01:14:38.229 --> 01:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:14:42.310 --> 01:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
else that you want to share with us
 
01:14:45.510 --> 01:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
the only other thing um is that i know
 
01:14:47.430 --> 01:14:47.440 align:start position:0%
you had asked us to provide information
 
01:14:48.630 --> 01:14:48.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee on
 
01:14:50.870 --> 01:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
the new federal stimulus packages that
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
were available to school districts
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:20.229 align:start position:0%
 
quick

01:15:20.229 --> 01:15:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:20.239 --> 01:15:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:15:23.590 --> 01:15:23.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:26.630 --> 01:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
this is very small so i apologize this
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
was in your packet from a few weeks ago
 
01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:33.600 align:start position:0%
um but so as of right now
 
01:15:36.709 --> 01:15:36.719 align:start position:0%
there have been three large
 
01:15:38.630 --> 01:15:38.640 align:start position:0%
federal stimulus packages that have
 
01:15:40.390 --> 01:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
passed that have provided funding
 
01:15:41.910 --> 01:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
directly for education
 
01:15:44.390 --> 01:15:44.400 align:start position:0%
through the department of education so
 
01:15:45.270 --> 01:15:45.280 align:start position:0%
those programs
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
are the cares act which provided 33
 
01:15:50.470 --> 01:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
million dollars 34 million dollars to
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:15:55.430 --> 01:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
um then there is carissa act which
 
01:15:55.440 --> 01:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
um then there is carissa act which
provided

01:15:55.990 --> 01:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
provided
 
01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
140 million dollars directly to school
 
01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.510 align:start position:0%
140 million dollars directly to school
districts

01:15:59.510 --> 01:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:16:03.990 --> 01:16:04.000 align:start position:0%
and now the arp act which provides
 
01:16:06.870 --> 01:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
100 350 million dollars to school
 
01:16:06.880 --> 01:16:07.910 align:start position:0%
100 350 million dollars to school
districts

01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
so it's a lot of federal money received
 
01:16:11.110 --> 01:16:11.120 align:start position:0%
being received directly by school
 
01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:11.910 align:start position:0%
being received directly by school
districts

01:16:11.910 --> 01:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
um in a normal year like a normal just
 
01:16:15.510 --> 01:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
regular operation year
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
the department of education flows
 
01:16:19.990 --> 01:16:20.000 align:start position:0%
approximately 130
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
140 million dollars directly just
 
01:16:23.910 --> 01:16:23.920 align:start position:0%
through school districts
 
01:16:25.510 --> 01:16:25.520 align:start position:0%
so you can imagine we have quite a bit
 
01:16:27.110 --> 01:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
more federal money flowing through the
 
01:16:30.790 --> 01:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
each part of this money is flexible
 
01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
each part of this money is flexible
money

01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:16:36.790 --> 01:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
it's allocated to school districts in a
 
01:16:38.709 --> 01:16:38.719 align:start position:0%
formula that's required
 
01:16:41.110 --> 01:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
by the federal law meaning the
 
01:16:42.390 --> 01:16:42.400 align:start position:0%
department of education has no
 
01:16:43.510 --> 01:16:43.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility in that
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
formula which is a proportional amount
 
01:16:48.310 --> 01:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
to the title 1 formula
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
so the title 1 formula weights
 
01:16:53.430 --> 01:16:53.440 align:start position:0%
enrollment and free introduced lunch
 
01:16:55.189 --> 01:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
kids so school districts with a high
 
01:16:56.870 --> 01:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch rate
 
01:16:59.590 --> 01:16:59.600 align:start position:0%
get a higher amount of money we have
 
01:17:01.030 --> 01:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
some school districts that as
 
01:17:03.830 --> 01:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
you know manchester is receiving um from
 
01:17:05.510 --> 01:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
cares act for example almost seven
 
01:17:07.030 --> 01:17:07.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars from
 
01:17:09.590 --> 01:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
carissa i believe it's almost 28 million
 
01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:10.719 align:start position:0%
dollars and then we have school
 
01:17:12.149 --> 01:17:12.159 align:start position:0%
districts that receive
 
01:17:15.030 --> 01:17:15.040 align:start position:0%
a few dollars or not no dollars at all
 
01:17:17.110 --> 01:17:17.120 align:start position:0%
from this fund
 
01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
so um the cares act
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
one funding was available to school
 
01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:23.430 align:start position:0%
one funding was available to school
districts

01:17:23.430 --> 01:17:23.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:17:25.669 --> 01:17:25.679 align:start position:0%
in early may school districts were
 
01:17:27.110 --> 01:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
notified in april and the money was
 
01:17:28.630 --> 01:17:28.640 align:start position:0%
dispersed in may
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
um care then the governor actually gave
 
01:17:33.990 --> 01:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
school districts out of the state pot of
 
01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:34.630 align:start position:0%
school districts out of the state pot of
money

01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
that had you know was not required to be
 
01:17:38.070 --> 01:17:38.080 align:start position:0%
spent for education the governor
 
01:17:39.910 --> 01:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
allocated an additional 40 mil
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
45 million dollars to school districts
 
01:17:44.470 --> 01:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
and that was available to school
 
01:17:47.110 --> 01:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
districts in november and that 45
 
01:17:49.030 --> 01:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
million was specifically related to
 
01:17:50.870 --> 01:17:50.880 align:start position:0%
covet expenses
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
that had already been had incurred
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
before 12 30.
 
01:17:56.709 --> 01:17:56.719 align:start position:0%
um i should mention that that the first
 
01:17:59.350 --> 01:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
allocation the cares allocation in may
 
01:18:01.990 --> 01:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
goes through september of 23 or sorry
 
01:18:03.910 --> 01:18:03.920 align:start position:0%
september of 22
 
01:18:05.669 --> 01:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
and it's relatively flexible it should
 
01:18:07.110 --> 01:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
be related to covid
 
01:18:09.910 --> 01:18:09.920 align:start position:0%
and cares to covet and reopening schools
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
but it's
 
01:18:13.590 --> 01:18:13.600 align:start position:0%
relatively flexible the second part of
 
01:18:14.550 --> 01:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
money from the governor
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
had to be spent before 12 30 2020
 
01:18:21.270 --> 01:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
covert related non-budget expenditures
 
01:18:22.630 --> 01:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
that 45 million
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
and then that new hundred and fifty
 
01:18:26.310 --> 01:18:26.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars school districts were
 
01:18:28.390 --> 01:18:28.400 align:start position:0%
notified on january 29th
 
01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:29.840 align:start position:0%
and school districts received their
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
money last week from the department of
 
01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:32.790 align:start position:0%
money last week from the department of
education

01:18:32.790 --> 01:18:32.800 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:18:35.110 --> 01:18:35.120 align:start position:0%
that money is some of the most flexible
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
money that i've ever seen in my tenure
 
01:18:38.709 --> 01:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
at the department of education as far as
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
federal money
 
01:18:41.669 --> 01:18:41.679 align:start position:0%
school districts can use it on
 
01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
continuing operations anything related
 
01:18:45.669 --> 01:18:45.679 align:start position:0%
to any of the other title grants that
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
they receive
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
special education reopening
 
01:18:53.030 --> 01:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
a variety of different things and we
 
01:18:55.830 --> 01:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
expect the same level of flexibility on
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
the new 350 million dollars that's being
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
awarded to the state
 
01:19:01.030 --> 01:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
although we don't have all of the
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
information from the u.s department of
 
01:19:03.910 --> 01:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
education at that time
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
at the time so what you see here in
 
01:19:08.870 --> 01:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
front of you as is as of a few weeks ago
 
01:19:10.550 --> 01:19:10.560 align:start position:0%
but it's the one-time money that school
 
01:19:11.990 --> 01:19:12.000 align:start position:0%
districts received
 
01:19:14.470 --> 01:19:14.480 align:start position:0%
pretty much in fiscal year 21 you could
 
01:19:15.510 --> 01:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
argue that the
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
cares act um won even though it was
 
01:19:19.590 --> 01:19:19.600 align:start position:0%
received in may
 
01:19:21.430 --> 01:19:21.440 align:start position:0%
it really falls under fiscal year 21
 
01:19:22.630 --> 01:19:22.640 align:start position:0%
because schools really begin
 
01:19:25.669 --> 01:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
spending in fiscal year 21. so you can
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
see here
 
01:19:29.669 --> 01:19:29.679 align:start position:0%
um the total so there's 219 million
 
01:19:29.679 --> 01:19:30.950 align:start position:0%
um the total so there's 219 million
dollars

01:19:30.950 --> 01:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:19:33.669 --> 01:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
of new federal money um not counting the
 
01:19:35.590 --> 01:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars that's coming in
 
01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:36.470 align:start position:0%
350 million dollars that's coming in
shortly

01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
01:19:39.270 --> 01:19:39.280 align:start position:0%
and then on top of it i would i was
 
01:19:40.229 --> 01:19:40.239 align:start position:0%
asked to provide
 
01:19:42.390 --> 01:19:42.400 align:start position:0%
um in the same spreadsheet the one-time
 
01:19:43.270 --> 01:19:43.280 align:start position:0%
money that was
 
01:19:47.669 --> 01:19:47.679 align:start position:0%
in adequacy 2. so a total of 274 million
 
01:19:49.750 --> 01:19:49.760 align:start position:0%
dollars of new federal and state money
 
01:19:52.870 --> 01:19:52.880 align:start position:0%
to school districts in fiscal year 21.
 
01:19:55.430 --> 01:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
so so in a few weeks you will likely see
 
01:19:56.950 --> 01:19:56.960 align:start position:0%
this updated from the department of
 
01:19:56.960 --> 01:19:57.990 align:start position:0%
this updated from the department of
education

01:19:57.990 --> 01:19:58.000 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
that has a new column with that
 
01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:07.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.470 --> 01:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
so you'll be giving that to the senate
 
01:20:12.550 --> 01:20:12.560 align:start position:0%
in their budget deliberations correct
 
01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.189 align:start position:0%
in their budget deliberations correct
yes

01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
yes okay and you will be sure to
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
send it to us as well yes of course
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
thanks uh representative ellison i
 
01:20:24.550 --> 01:20:24.560 align:start position:0%

can i get a a copy of this particular
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
that's up here this chart i i'm subbing
 
01:20:36.950 --> 01:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
today and so i think i probably
 
01:20:38.950 --> 01:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
have it somewhere in all the materials
 
01:20:40.790 --> 01:20:40.800 align:start position:0%
but if i could just have that
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate it
 
01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:45.189 align:start position:0%
i would appreciate it

01:20:50.310 --> 01:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
committee i'll break out this one uh
 
01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:51.350 align:start position:0%
committee i'll break out this one uh
schedule

01:20:51.350 --> 01:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
schedule

thank you representative porter
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair caitlin the money
 
01:21:00.149 --> 01:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
that's coming in for the new
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
um act that just happened
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
is that going all this money goes to the
 
01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:07.760 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:10.320 align:start position:0%
first and then they disperse it out to
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
the um
 
01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
school districts or can the school
 
01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
districts apply for it directly
 
01:21:18.070 --> 01:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
from the federal government i know the
 
01:21:19.510 --> 01:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
money goes directly to the department of
 
01:21:20.870 --> 01:21:20.880 align:start position:0%
education first
 
01:21:23.510 --> 01:21:23.520 align:start position:0%
the department of education has a large
 
01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
number of
 
01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
application requirements that the
 
01:21:29.030 --> 01:21:29.040 align:start position:0%
department is supposed to do and then
 
01:21:30.629 --> 01:21:30.639 align:start position:0%
also monitor to make sure the school
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
districts are doing
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
um the department of education is
 
01:21:35.750 --> 01:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
responsible for overseeing and approving
 
01:21:37.830 --> 01:21:37.840 align:start position:0%
things like allowability and we also
 
01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
have a large number of compliance
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
requirements around the fund
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
the funding it's uh pretty restrictive
 
01:21:44.950 --> 01:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
so what our process is is that the
 
01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:45.750 align:start position:0%
so what our process is is that the
department

01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
in additional the us department of
 
01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:49.120 align:start position:0%
education doesn't do the allocations the
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:52.320 align:start position:0%
itself we actually have staff on hand
 
01:21:54.149 --> 01:21:54.159 align:start position:0%
that will put together the allocations
 
01:21:55.669 --> 01:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
and with our data
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
so the depart the process is is that the
 
01:22:00.149 --> 01:22:00.159 align:start position:0%
us department of education will
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
typically issue a grant award
 
01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:02.870 align:start position:0%
typically issue a grant award
notification

01:22:02.870 --> 01:22:02.880 align:start position:0%
notification
 
01:22:04.550 --> 01:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
um and then the department of education
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
will do a budget meaning
 
01:22:07.910 --> 01:22:07.920 align:start position:0%
figuring out how much money goes out is
 
01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:10.000 align:start position:0%
directly allocated to schools versus how
 
01:22:10.950 --> 01:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
much of that money
 
01:22:12.470 --> 01:22:12.480 align:start position:0%
is allocated to the department of
 
01:22:14.790 --> 01:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
education um because we do receive some
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
money that we need to oversee
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
and monitor the grant the department of
 
01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:20.390 align:start position:0%
and monitor the grant the department of
education

01:22:20.390 --> 01:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:22:23.430 --> 01:22:23.440 align:start position:0%
then prepares allocations that are given
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
to school districts
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
school districts usually have to do
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
assurances as well
 
01:22:29.910 --> 01:22:29.920 align:start position:0%
as an application for the funding so we
 
01:22:31.189 --> 01:22:31.199 align:start position:0%
allocate the money to the school
 
01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:32.719 align:start position:0%
districts in something called our grant
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
management system
 
01:22:36.709 --> 01:22:36.719 align:start position:0%
and our grant management system then
 
01:22:37.830 --> 01:22:37.840 align:start position:0%
shows the school district what their
 
01:22:38.709 --> 01:22:38.719 align:start position:0%
allocation is
 
01:22:40.790 --> 01:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
they can go in and write an application
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
we have department of education
 
01:22:44.629 --> 01:22:44.639 align:start position:0%
staff that review the applications to
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
make sure each thing that they're
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
requesting is allowable
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
and then we will approve the school
 
01:22:50.159 --> 01:22:51.030 align:start position:0%
and then we will approve the school
districts

01:22:51.030 --> 01:22:51.040 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
start spending that money school
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
districts then go in
 
01:22:56.950 --> 01:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
monthly and request reimbursements from
 
01:22:58.629 --> 01:22:58.639 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
01:23:00.629 --> 01:23:00.639 align:start position:0%
um for the expenses that incurred
 
01:23:02.709 --> 01:23:02.719 align:start position:0%
incurred they incurred in the previous
 
01:23:02.719 --> 01:23:03.590 align:start position:0%
incurred they incurred in the previous
month

01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:23:04.950 --> 01:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
and this is the process that i'm
 
01:23:06.790 --> 01:23:06.800 align:start position:0%
actually um that i'm talking about is
 
01:23:07.990 --> 01:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
the process for
 
01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
most of our federal grants at the
 
01:23:11.110 --> 01:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:23:14.390 --> 01:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
um so that process is it
 
01:23:19.350 --> 01:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
seems kind of cumbersome which it is but
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
that is what the department of education
 
01:23:22.709 --> 01:23:22.719 align:start position:0%
does and it's kind of what we do best
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
we're set up to do that
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
um so that's why that money kind of um
 
01:23:27.750 --> 01:23:27.760 align:start position:0%
did this
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
um is is used in that same way
 
01:23:33.350 --> 01:23:33.360 align:start position:0%
madam chair can have a follow-up
 
01:23:34.390 --> 01:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
certainly may
 
01:23:37.910 --> 01:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um so so the district has to
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
actually spend the money before it gets
 
01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.070 align:start position:0%
actually spend the money before it gets
reimbursed

01:23:42.070 --> 01:23:42.080 align:start position:0%
reimbursed
 
01:23:43.910 --> 01:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
yes and what happens if the district
 
01:23:46.149 --> 01:23:46.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have cash on hand
 
01:23:48.709 --> 01:23:48.719 align:start position:0%
to pay the bill prior to being
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
reimbursed how does that work
 
01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:52.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure we've never had that
 
01:23:54.310 --> 01:23:54.320 align:start position:0%
situation um we are
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
relatively quick as far as doing the
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
reimbursements um
 
01:24:00.550 --> 01:24:00.560 align:start position:0%
there may be another federal process
 
01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
that we would need to follow
 
01:24:04.310 --> 01:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
but we actually have a treasury
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
agreement with the u.s department of
 
01:24:07.590 --> 01:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
treasury that actually says that we will
 
01:24:08.470 --> 01:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
do a draw
 
01:24:10.149 --> 01:24:10.159 align:start position:0%
several days after the expense have been
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
reincurred it's
 
01:24:14.629 --> 01:24:14.639 align:start position:0%
it's how education grants typically have
 
01:24:14.639 --> 01:24:15.270 align:start position:0%
it's how education grants typically have
worked

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:15.280 align:start position:0%
worked
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:22.229 --> 01:24:22.239 align:start position:0%
just to follow up on that so we we are
 
01:24:23.110 --> 01:24:23.120 align:start position:0%
not putting
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
any school district in harm's way
 
01:24:30.070 --> 01:24:30.080 align:start position:0%
for paying ahead of time is that your we
 
01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:30.470 align:start position:0%
for paying ahead of time is that your we
have

01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:24:32.470 --> 01:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
never had a school district request that
 
01:24:34.470 --> 01:24:34.480 align:start position:0%
you know request anything relative to
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
that but we could certainly you know if
 
01:24:37.350 --> 01:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
a school district had that issue we
 
01:24:37.360 --> 01:24:37.830 align:start position:0%
a school district had that issue we
could

01:24:37.830 --> 01:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
01:24:39.830 --> 01:24:39.840 align:start position:0%
talk through them it would require us
 
01:24:41.189 --> 01:24:41.199 align:start position:0%
working with the us department of
 
01:24:41.199 --> 01:24:41.910 align:start position:0%
working with the us department of
education

01:24:41.910 --> 01:24:41.920 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:24:43.990 --> 01:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
and essentially some other people at the
 
01:24:45.910 --> 01:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
feds to see what to do with it and
 
01:24:47.990 --> 01:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
also including new hampshire treasury
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
and whatnot um
 
01:24:50.550 --> 01:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
but we've we've never had that issue
 
01:24:52.629 --> 01:24:52.639 align:start position:0%
before we've we've had issues where you
 
01:24:54.310 --> 01:24:54.320 align:start position:0%
have a school district that hasn't drawn
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
down the money for like
 
01:24:57.270 --> 01:24:57.280 align:start position:0%
five or six months and then all of a
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
sudden they're saying oh well now we
 
01:25:00.229 --> 01:25:00.239 align:start position:0%
actually you know can you get this to us
 
01:25:00.239 --> 01:25:00.950 align:start position:0%
actually you know can you get this to us
quickly

01:25:00.950 --> 01:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
quickly
 
01:25:03.990 --> 01:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
but with the the quick turnaround um it
 
01:25:06.709 --> 01:25:06.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be an issue
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative murray you have
 
01:25:10.229 --> 01:25:10.239 align:start position:0%
a question
 
01:25:12.950 --> 01:25:12.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um how much money
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
has yet to be dispersed
 
01:25:16.870 --> 01:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
how much money do you have that is
 
01:25:19.510 --> 01:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
available for students to request
 
01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:22.560 align:start position:0%
um are you are you talking about how
 
01:25:23.350 --> 01:25:23.360 align:start position:0%
much have
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
the department not allocated to the
 
01:25:26.709 --> 01:25:26.719 align:start position:0%
schools or how much has the schools not
 
01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:33.430 --> 01:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
i guess perhaps both so
 
01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:35.920 align:start position:0%
the department has allocated all of the
 
01:25:38.709 --> 01:25:38.719 align:start position:0%
34 or the first 34 million dollars
 
01:25:41.350 --> 01:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
all of the 45 million dollars and all of
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
the 140 million dollars so the
 
01:25:44.950 --> 01:25:44.960 align:start position:0%
department has put all of that money in
 
01:25:46.629 --> 01:25:46.639 align:start position:0%
the school district's hands
 
01:25:49.110 --> 01:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
um the 45 million dollars has been fully
 
01:25:50.149 --> 01:25:50.159 align:start position:0%
expended because
 
01:25:52.390 --> 01:25:52.400 align:start position:0%
it had to be fully expended by 12 30
 
01:25:54.229 --> 01:25:54.239 align:start position:0%
with the exception of a few pennies
 
01:25:55.590 --> 01:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
being returned to the department of
 
01:25:56.550 --> 01:25:56.560 align:start position:0%
education but
 
01:25:59.189 --> 01:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
most of it has been completely expended
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
the last i had looked
 
01:26:05.270 --> 01:26:05.280 align:start position:0%
with as far as the 34 million dollars i
 
01:26:07.030 --> 01:26:07.040 align:start position:0%
believe school districts had
 
01:26:09.030 --> 01:26:09.040 align:start position:0%
asked for reimbursement of nine million
 
01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:10.470 align:start position:0%
asked for reimbursement of nine million
dollars

01:26:10.470 --> 01:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
um out of the 34 million dollars and
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
then the remaining 140 million dollars
 
01:26:16.790 --> 01:26:16.800 align:start position:0%
because the department awarded
 
01:26:18.390 --> 01:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
that money last week school districts
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
have not asked for reimbursement at all
 
01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:23.990 align:start position:0%
have not asked for reimbursement at all
yet

01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up certainly
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
so this is probably a very simple
 
01:26:30.239 --> 01:26:31.270 align:start position:0%
so this is probably a very simple
question

01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:26:32.629 --> 01:26:32.639 align:start position:0%
when you've allocated the money to the
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
school districts you
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
tell the school district that they have
 
01:26:38.149 --> 01:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
been allotted this much money
 
01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
and that it's their it's up to them they
 
01:26:41.350 --> 01:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
know this
 
01:26:42.870 --> 01:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
so now they need to go through your
 
01:26:44.229 --> 01:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
process in order to get that money
 
01:26:44.239 --> 01:26:45.350 align:start position:0%
process in order to get that money
dispersed

01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
dispersed
 
01:26:46.629 --> 01:26:46.639 align:start position:0%
yeah so we put it in the grants
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
management system and we also typically
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
especially in these and send an email
 
01:26:52.870 --> 01:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
that has that information on it
 
01:26:56.149 --> 01:26:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:59.350 --> 01:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh caitlyn the so the schools
 
01:27:02.390 --> 01:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
have the ability to look at
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
the grant management system and that's
 
01:27:05.830 --> 01:27:05.840 align:start position:0%
how they
 
01:27:08.390 --> 01:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
request all their stuff and how the
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
payments get made well
 
01:27:13.590 --> 01:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
yes okay yep yep a grants management
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
system each school district has its own
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
login and actually
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
many school districts have many people
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
that can log in depending on the
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
different grants
 
01:27:21.910 --> 01:27:21.920 align:start position:0%
you pull up all the grants that are
 
01:27:23.990 --> 01:27:24.000 align:start position:0%
available to a school each year
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
they can go in they write out the budget
 
01:27:27.990 --> 01:27:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's a workflow type system
 
01:27:29.110 --> 01:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
01:27:31.030 --> 01:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
the schools write a budget you can see
 
01:27:32.149 --> 01:27:32.159 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
approvals or any comments on the budget
 
01:27:35.270 --> 01:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
if they were to say
 
01:27:37.430 --> 01:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
write a request for a pony well that's
 
01:27:38.790 --> 01:27:38.800 align:start position:0%
not allowable please take that out of
 
01:27:40.149 --> 01:27:40.159 align:start position:0%
your application
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
um and then um when they go in and put
 
01:27:45.830 --> 01:27:45.840 align:start position:0%
the monthly draws in it actually
 
01:27:47.350 --> 01:27:47.360 align:start position:0%
interfaces directly with new hampshire
 
01:27:49.030 --> 01:27:49.040 align:start position:0%
first our accounting system
 
01:27:51.189 --> 01:27:51.199 align:start position:0%
um so depart somebody from the
 
01:27:52.870 --> 01:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
department like um representative
 
01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:53.510 align:start position:0%
department like um representative
ellison

01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
ellison
 
01:27:54.870 --> 01:27:54.880 align:start position:0%
when he was at the department would go
 
01:27:56.149 --> 01:27:56.159 align:start position:0%
in and say yes i approve your
 
01:27:56.159 --> 01:27:57.030 align:start position:0%
in and say yes i approve your
expenditure

01:27:57.030 --> 01:27:57.040 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:27:59.189 --> 01:27:59.199 align:start position:0%
he would well superintendent would first
 
01:28:00.950 --> 01:28:00.960 align:start position:0%
ask for permission
 
01:28:02.470 --> 01:28:02.480 align:start position:0%
the department of education staff would
 
01:28:03.910 --> 01:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
go in and say yes i approve your
 
01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:05.189 align:start position:0%
go in and say yes i approve your
expenditure

01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
expenditure
 
01:28:06.390 --> 01:28:06.400 align:start position:0%
and then it goes through our payment
 
01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:10.470 align:start position:0%
and then it goes through our payment
system

01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:28:17.350 --> 01:28:17.360 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:26.310 --> 01:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
i guess that for me i am
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
a little concerned that
 
01:28:33.430 --> 01:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
in the um the 34 million
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
that only 9 million has been spent
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
that is um you know or
 
01:28:41.669 --> 01:28:41.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i shouldn't say spent i should
 
01:28:43.030 --> 01:28:43.040 align:start position:0%
say build
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
to uh the department of education
 
01:28:49.350 --> 01:28:49.360 align:start position:0%
um especially since
 
01:28:53.270 --> 01:28:53.280 align:start position:0%
we have heard uh you know that this
 
01:28:55.270 --> 01:28:55.280 align:start position:0%
and i think that it doesn't have to
 
01:28:56.950 --> 01:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily be
 
01:29:00.470 --> 01:29:00.480 align:start position:0%
directly covered related in
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
this particular grant and the
 
01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
the next one coming out is the same way
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
so there's a lot of federal money
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
floating around out there and um and
 
01:29:16.629 --> 01:29:16.639 align:start position:0%
there will be more
 
01:29:19.750 --> 01:29:19.760 align:start position:0%
so um i think we
 
01:29:23.510 --> 01:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
we need to um once we get
 
01:29:27.030 --> 01:29:27.040 align:start position:0%
the allocation of the uh
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
the 350 320 whatever the figure is
 
01:29:35.910 --> 01:29:35.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to sincerely encourage
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
our school boards to
 
01:29:42.070 --> 01:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
look at you know what are what are the
 
01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
look at you know what are what are the
shortfalls

01:29:43.990 --> 01:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
shortfalls
 
01:29:46.149 --> 01:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
in uh in the way they can spend the
 
01:29:48.629 --> 01:29:48.639 align:start position:0%
money obviously we don't want them to
 
01:29:50.149 --> 01:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
increase their budgets
 
01:29:53.189 --> 01:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
by whatever amount it is but
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
there are obviously uh
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
shortfalls that that every school has
 
01:30:03.910 --> 01:30:03.920 align:start position:0%
you know if it's um you know maybe it's
 
01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:05.110 align:start position:0%
you know if it's um you know maybe it's
uh

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:05.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:30:06.950 --> 01:30:06.960 align:start position:0%
they've never had money to do summer
 
01:30:08.550 --> 01:30:08.560 align:start position:0%
school before
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
you know so let's let's plan on
 
01:30:15.270 --> 01:30:15.280 align:start position:0%
doing summer school or you know let's
 
01:30:16.229 --> 01:30:16.239 align:start position:0%
plan on
 
01:30:20.390 --> 01:30:20.400 align:start position:0%
um you know we've we've
 
01:30:22.390 --> 01:30:22.400 align:start position:0%
half the computers that we've handed out
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
to kids are
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
are not any good anymore or they need
 
01:30:29.910 --> 01:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
larger servers or you know i mean
 
01:30:32.070 --> 01:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
there's all kinds of things that
 
01:30:35.189 --> 01:30:35.199 align:start position:0%
each one of us can think of think
 
01:30:38.550 --> 01:30:38.560 align:start position:0%
of pretty much off the top of our head
 
01:30:42.149 --> 01:30:42.159 align:start position:0%
in order to uh for the school districts
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
to allocate this money so
 
01:30:46.229 --> 01:30:46.239 align:start position:0%
anyhow that's enough of me uh
 
01:30:48.790 --> 01:30:48.800 align:start position:0%
representative murray
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
thank you again madam chair um caitlin
 
01:30:52.149 --> 01:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
are there
 
01:30:54.070 --> 01:30:54.080 align:start position:0%
you know i i guess we really don't know
 
01:30:55.750 --> 01:30:55.760 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with that 350
 
01:30:55.760 --> 01:30:56.550 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen with that 350
million

01:30:56.550 --> 01:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:30:59.189 --> 01:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
but might there be opportunities that
 
01:31:00.790 --> 01:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
some of that money could go to some of
 
01:31:01.990 --> 01:31:02.000 align:start position:0%
the 59 projects
 
01:31:05.270 --> 01:31:05.280 align:start position:0%
listed on the infrastructure you know
 
01:31:07.110 --> 01:31:07.120 align:start position:0%
might they they be projects that would
 
01:31:08.470 --> 01:31:08.480 align:start position:0%
fall within
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
the rubric of the 350 million
 
01:31:14.870 --> 01:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
so there there might be i'm not familiar
 
01:31:17.350 --> 01:31:17.360 align:start position:0%
with them um on the top of my head
 
01:31:21.270 --> 01:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
um we would have to to look at that
 
01:31:24.229 --> 01:31:24.239 align:start position:0%
um but i think it's this this is some of
 
01:31:25.990 --> 01:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
the most flexible money that i've ever
 
01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:26.709 align:start position:0%
the most flexible money that i've ever
seen

01:31:26.709 --> 01:31:26.719 align:start position:0%
seen
 
01:31:28.950 --> 01:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
federal money um so i think it would be
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
it would be a different process because
 
01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
the school districts would have to write
 
01:31:35.110 --> 01:31:35.120 align:start position:0%
an application for that um
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
and they'd have to follow the federal
 
01:31:39.110 --> 01:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
process rather than getting approval
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
from that the commission and one it
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
would have to be completely segregated
 
01:31:46.470 --> 01:31:46.480 align:start position:0%
but it's entirely possible that some if
 
01:31:46.480 --> 01:31:46.790 align:start position:0%
but it's entirely possible that some if
not

01:31:46.790 --> 01:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:31:48.790 --> 01:31:48.800 align:start position:0%
all of those projects might also be
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
allowable um
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
under these various various federal pots
 
01:31:53.830 --> 01:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
of money the other thing too is with
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
this new federal money the new federal
 
01:31:55.679 --> 01:31:56.310 align:start position:0%
this new federal money the new federal
stimulus

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
stimulus
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
money it's the first time since
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
at least i've been at the department of
 
01:32:02.709 --> 01:32:02.719 align:start position:0%
education if not ever that
 
01:32:04.310 --> 01:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
federal education money can be used for
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
construction construction is very rarely
 
01:32:08.390 --> 01:32:08.400 align:start position:0%
allowable use of federal
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
education funding other federal funding
 
01:32:11.590 --> 01:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
of course but not
 
01:32:15.189 --> 01:32:15.199 align:start position:0%
not um education money so we um
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
are working through those requirements
 
01:32:18.070 --> 01:32:18.080 align:start position:0%
too at the department because once
 
01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're doing construction with federal
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
money there's a lot of
 
01:32:22.790 --> 01:32:22.800 align:start position:0%
compliance restrictions that come in
 
01:32:25.110 --> 01:32:25.120 align:start position:0%
place but these projects
 
01:32:29.590 --> 01:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
very well may be allowable follow-up
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
please that was my next frightening
 
01:32:32.239 --> 01:32:32.790 align:start position:0%
please that was my next frightening
question

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
is that could schools use some of this
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
to deal with
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
the tail i know we owe money to the
 
01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
schools that's the tale
 
01:32:42.310 --> 01:32:42.320 align:start position:0%
could schools use some of this money to
 
01:32:43.430 --> 01:32:43.440 align:start position:0%
pay down
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
what their you know what they're paying
 
01:32:46.790 --> 01:32:46.800 align:start position:0%
on that and i guess the other part of
 
01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:47.110 align:start position:0%
on that and i guess the other part of
this

01:32:47.110 --> 01:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:32:49.270 --> 01:32:49.280 align:start position:0%
is you know we this is maybe unrealistic
 
01:32:51.110 --> 01:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
since we only have a very short time in
 
01:32:53.350 --> 01:32:53.360 align:start position:0%
which we have to make our decisions
 
01:32:54.870 --> 01:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
how is there any way we can use
 
01:32:56.709 --> 01:32:56.719 align:start position:0%
information like this to inform
 
01:32:58.709 --> 01:32:58.719 align:start position:0%
our decision making or is it just too
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
short a timeline
 
01:33:03.030 --> 01:33:03.040 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:33:06.629 --> 01:33:06.639 align:start position:0%
so as far as for the
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
he's talking about the bonds okay but i
 
01:33:15.110 --> 01:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
do so the
 
01:33:17.030 --> 01:33:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the waitlist too you know any
 
01:33:18.629 --> 01:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
information of how we decide
 
01:33:21.350 --> 01:33:21.360 align:start position:0%
for for the bonds i mean i think that
 
01:33:22.390 --> 01:33:22.400 align:start position:0%
would we would have to work with our
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
federal partners on that one that would
 
01:33:24.239 --> 01:33:24.629 align:start position:0%
federal partners on that one that would
be

01:33:24.629 --> 01:33:24.639 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:33:28.310 --> 01:33:28.320 align:start position:0%
um an interesting one um i
 
01:33:30.790 --> 01:33:30.800 align:start position:0%
i i don't know i can look into it i i
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't know if we can get an answer
 
01:33:34.629 --> 01:33:34.639 align:start position:0%
soon enough on that one um but the bond
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
payments are
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
pretty large too so some of the school
 
01:33:39.189 --> 01:33:39.199 align:start position:0%
districts with smaller allocations that
 
01:33:42.709 --> 01:33:42.719 align:start position:0%
might not go to that much of it so um
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
we could we could certainly look into it
 
01:33:44.159 --> 01:33:47.350 align:start position:0%
we could we could certainly look into it
though

01:33:47.350 --> 01:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
okay all right oh okay uh i'm sorry
 
01:33:52.310 --> 01:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
represent murray i thought we had
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
discussed the uh
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so sorry interrupt so i'm just
 
01:33:57.590 --> 01:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
thinking right now so like for a period
 
01:33:59.030 --> 01:33:59.040 align:start position:0%
of allowability
 
01:34:01.270 --> 01:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
um i think probably for the bonds it's
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
likely no because the period of
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
allowability would be an expense that
 
01:34:04.870 --> 01:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
was occurred
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
long a long long time ago whereas there
 
01:34:08.550 --> 01:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
is a very specific period of
 
01:34:08.560 --> 01:34:09.830 align:start position:0%
is a very specific period of
allowability

01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
allowability
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
um for these grants so it would probably
 
01:34:13.430 --> 01:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
need to be expenses that's
 
01:34:17.110 --> 01:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
incurred or were began to incur after
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
three one twenty twenty three thirteen
 
01:34:20.629 --> 01:34:20.639 align:start position:0%
whatever the dates are um i'd have to
 
01:34:22.149 --> 01:34:22.159 align:start position:0%
look at each individual grant so the
 
01:34:22.159 --> 01:34:23.350 align:start position:0%
look at each individual grant so the
bonds

01:34:23.350 --> 01:34:23.360 align:start position:0%
bonds
 
01:34:25.590 --> 01:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
those are probably a likely no but
 
01:34:32.629 --> 01:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
future construction projects potentially
 
01:34:37.030 --> 01:34:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:41.270 --> 01:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.149 --> 01:34:44.159 align:start position:0%
oh has the federal government made up
 
01:34:45.669 --> 01:34:45.679 align:start position:0%
their minds if we can
 
01:34:48.790 --> 01:34:48.800 align:start position:0%
use the old free and reduced lunch
 
01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:49.830 align:start position:0%
use the old free and reduced lunch
numbers

01:34:49.830 --> 01:34:49.840 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
for title 1 2 3 12 17
 
01:34:56.229 --> 01:34:56.239 align:start position:0%
whatever yep um yes so we actually do
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
have the authority to use
 
01:35:00.229 --> 01:35:00.239 align:start position:0%
um the fiscal year to that well it's
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
funny so the way that the federal
 
01:35:03.270 --> 01:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
language does it says
 
01:35:05.109 --> 01:35:05.119 align:start position:0%
it says the departments can use the best
 
01:35:06.550 --> 01:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
available data which may
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
include fiscal 19 and 20 enrollment
 
01:35:09.119 --> 01:35:09.669 align:start position:0%
include fiscal 19 and 20 enrollment
numbers

01:35:09.669 --> 01:35:09.679 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
um so for fiscal 2020 we will be using
 
01:35:14.709 --> 01:35:14.719 align:start position:0%
um the 20
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
sorry for fiscal year 2022 the
 
01:35:18.709 --> 01:35:18.719 align:start position:0%
allocations that we'll be doing in this
 
01:35:18.719 --> 01:35:19.430 align:start position:0%
allocations that we'll be doing in this
fall

01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
fall
 
01:35:27.270 --> 01:35:27.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.510 --> 01:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's very good news it is great news
 
01:35:31.109 --> 01:35:31.119 align:start position:0%
for the title programs i'm not sure if
 
01:35:32.550 --> 01:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
that same announcement has been made for
 
01:35:32.560 --> 01:35:33.350 align:start position:0%
that same announcement has been made for
other

01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:35:35.109 --> 01:35:35.119 align:start position:0%
title programs or other federal programs
 
01:35:37.750 --> 01:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
like idea the special education grant or
 
01:35:39.910 --> 01:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
career and tech education um but i do
 
01:35:41.350 --> 01:35:41.360 align:start position:0%
know for the title programs which
 
01:35:43.510 --> 01:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
the title programs are 70 million
 
01:35:45.109 --> 01:35:45.119 align:start position:0%
dollars across the state
 
01:35:50.310 --> 01:35:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:56.709 --> 01:35:56.719 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:35:59.350 --> 01:35:59.360 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any other questions for
 
01:35:59.360 --> 01:36:02.229 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any other questions for
caitlyn

01:36:02.229 --> 01:36:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:05.830 --> 01:36:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.270 --> 01:36:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chin first of all
 
01:36:09.510 --> 01:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
caitlyn i want to thank you boy
 
01:36:11.590 --> 01:36:11.600 align:start position:0%
you you know your stuff and you explain
 
01:36:13.430 --> 01:36:13.440 align:start position:0%
it in a way i can understand it so i
 
01:36:14.790 --> 01:36:14.800 align:start position:0%
appreciate that
 
01:36:17.910 --> 01:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
um i had a question about and this is
 
01:36:19.590 --> 01:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
nothing we've discussed this morning but
 
01:36:20.950 --> 01:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
it is in the budget
 
01:36:23.910 --> 01:36:23.920 align:start position:0%
to move a position from federal funds to
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
general funds was a request that was
 
01:36:25.679 --> 01:36:26.390 align:start position:0%
general funds was a request that was
made

01:36:26.390 --> 01:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:36:29.030 --> 01:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and i'm wondering if you can explain
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
what that position is
 
01:36:33.109 --> 01:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
and what um what the duties are and why
 
01:36:34.709 --> 01:36:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's going from federal to
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
to general funds so i don't oversee the
 
01:36:37.990 --> 01:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
entire department
 
01:36:39.590 --> 01:36:39.600 align:start position:0%
of education budget so we would actually
 
01:36:41.669 --> 01:36:41.679 align:start position:0%
need our cfo tammy valencourt to be able
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
to provide that information
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
um i can certainly have her either
 
01:36:46.390 --> 01:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
provide it in writing or another
 
01:36:50.390 --> 01:36:50.400 align:start position:0%
time but i i don't have that information
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i would appreciate if you
 
01:36:53.750 --> 01:36:53.760 align:start position:0%
could do that for us
 
01:36:56.310 --> 01:36:56.320 align:start position:0%
yeah i uh thank you for asking that
 
01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:56.870 align:start position:0%
yeah i uh thank you for asking that
question

01:36:56.870 --> 01:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:36:59.350 --> 01:36:59.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative porter but uh yeah
 
01:37:01.189 --> 01:37:01.199 align:start position:0%
just send it to mickey and he'll get it
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
to us okay
 
01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
represent ellison did you have your hand
 
01:37:09.750 --> 01:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
up oh i'm all set thank you very much
 
01:37:11.109 --> 01:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
madam chair
 
01:37:14.229 --> 01:37:14.239 align:start position:0%
okay um
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
caitlin i have a question about this uh
 
01:37:21.830 --> 01:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
data system that you want to do
 
01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you actually for asking
 
01:37:25.669 --> 01:37:25.679 align:start position:0%
um i know the committee has some
 
01:37:27.510 --> 01:37:27.520 align:start position:0%
concerns with the the data system and
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
especially the large ticket
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
price that it comes with um but so the
 
01:37:33.430 --> 01:37:33.440 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
is requesting and we have requested for
 
01:37:37.109 --> 01:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
the last several years now
 
01:37:39.109 --> 01:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
funding for a new student information
 
01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:40.149 align:start position:0%
funding for a new student information
system

01:37:40.149 --> 01:37:40.159 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
so in 2001 the department of education
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
spent a
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money developing a
 
01:37:49.030 --> 01:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
new student information system
 
01:37:51.109 --> 01:37:51.119 align:start position:0%
um and we're talking about 20 years ago
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
01:37:55.109 --> 01:37:55.119 align:start position:0%
and at that point um we
 
01:37:57.270 --> 01:37:57.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know but i would assume an rfp
 
01:37:58.950 --> 01:37:58.960 align:start position:0%
was put out and the department developed
 
01:38:01.189 --> 01:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
with a contractor that system
 
01:38:03.030 --> 01:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
that system was a system that was a
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
leader in the country there wasn't
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
software off the
 
01:38:07.590 --> 01:38:07.600 align:start position:0%
shelf software that was available to be
 
01:38:11.189 --> 01:38:11.199 align:start position:0%
able to do this level of work
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
and at that time we said we were a
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
leader in the country
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
now here we are 20 years later and the
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
department of education has the same
 
01:38:22.709 --> 01:38:22.719 align:start position:0%
system in place and that same system is
 
01:38:23.590 --> 01:38:23.600 align:start position:0%
how we collect
 
01:38:25.669 --> 01:38:25.679 align:start position:0%
all of our data from school districts
 
01:38:27.270 --> 01:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
across the entire state
 
01:38:28.830 --> 01:38:28.840 align:start position:0%
to do a variety of different
 
01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:31.760 align:start position:0%
calculations specifically like adequacy
 
01:38:35.030 --> 01:38:35.040 align:start position:0%
graduation rates dropout rates all of
 
01:38:36.870 --> 01:38:36.880 align:start position:0%
the enrollment reports that are used for
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
everything across the board from this
 
01:38:40.149 --> 01:38:40.159 align:start position:0%
for the state
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
so that information in the student data
 
01:38:42.239 --> 01:38:44.229 align:start position:0%
so that information in the student data
system

01:38:44.229 --> 01:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
the department we really just feel like
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
we need to have a new student data
 
01:38:48.149 --> 01:38:48.159 align:start position:0%
system so
 
01:38:51.430 --> 01:38:51.440 align:start position:0%
in that time period many many vendors
 
01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:51.750 align:start position:0%
in that time period many many vendors
have

01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
developed across the country to have
 
01:38:56.629 --> 01:38:56.639 align:start position:0%
various different software packages to
 
01:38:58.870 --> 01:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
collect this data the department is
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
requesting one and a half million
 
01:39:02.310 --> 01:39:02.320 align:start position:0%
dollars each year
 
01:39:05.590 --> 01:39:05.600 align:start position:0%
an ongoing basis for for a new
 
01:39:07.990 --> 01:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
student information system that new
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
student information system we will
 
01:39:10.149 --> 01:39:10.159 align:start position:0%
believe will
 
01:39:12.870 --> 01:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
save a lot of work for both department
 
01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:13.430 align:start position:0%
save a lot of work for both department
staff

01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
and additionally school district staff
 
01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
so right now what the process is its
 
01:39:19.910 --> 01:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
school districts
 
01:39:21.590 --> 01:39:21.600 align:start position:0%
enter information to the department of
 
01:39:23.270 --> 01:39:23.280 align:start position:0%
education and essentially
 
01:39:25.669 --> 01:39:25.679 align:start position:0%
giants excel spreadsheets with all of
 
01:39:26.870 --> 01:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
the different information
 
01:39:29.030 --> 01:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
that they that we collect on each
 
01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:29.910 align:start position:0%
that they that we collect on each
student

01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
student
 
01:39:31.990 --> 01:39:32.000 align:start position:0%
that information is aggregated up to the
 
01:39:33.990 --> 01:39:34.000 align:start position:0%
department of education and reports are
 
01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:35.270 align:start position:0%
department of education and reports are
produced

01:39:35.270 --> 01:39:35.280 align:start position:0%
produced
 
01:39:37.669 --> 01:39:37.679 align:start position:0%
and then the system has some data
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
validation but
 
01:39:40.870 --> 01:39:40.880 align:start position:0%
each level of data validation that the
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
system has
 
01:39:45.189 --> 01:39:45.199 align:start position:0%
meaning checks for errors um the manual
 
01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
data validation that the department of
 
01:39:48.310 --> 01:39:48.320 align:start position:0%
education staff is
 
01:39:51.990 --> 01:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
coding into the system um this
 
01:39:55.030 --> 01:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
right so then we will have data that has
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
been changed
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
or school districts data that has been
 
01:39:59.910 --> 01:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
reviewed and school districts
 
01:40:01.750 --> 01:40:01.760 align:start position:0%
find errors for example two school
 
01:40:03.189 --> 01:40:03.199 align:start position:0%
districts according to the same
 
01:40:05.270 --> 01:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
students same student that information
 
01:40:06.550 --> 01:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
is sent back to the school district
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
school districts have to manually change
 
01:40:09.590 --> 01:40:09.600 align:start position:0%
it for the department
 
01:40:11.750 --> 01:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
and then potentially manually change in
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
their own
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
own systems now this is a lot of work
 
01:40:16.310 --> 01:40:16.320 align:start position:0%
that is
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
in 2001 absolutely necessary but with
 
01:40:21.430 --> 01:40:21.440 align:start position:0%
the advancements in technology now
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
it is absolutely not necessary for staff
 
01:40:26.070 --> 01:40:26.080 align:start position:0%
to be doing that level of work
 
01:40:27.910 --> 01:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
there should be automatic systems
 
01:40:29.830 --> 01:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
interfaces where the systems can
 
01:40:31.510 --> 01:40:31.520 align:start position:0%
automatically upload information from
 
01:40:32.950 --> 01:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
the department of education
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
our system can then process that data um
 
01:40:39.350 --> 01:40:39.360 align:start position:0%
have a her a variety of
 
01:40:42.310 --> 01:40:42.320 align:start position:0%
data validation checks and then report
 
01:40:43.590 --> 01:40:43.600 align:start position:0%
information back down to school
 
01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.390 align:start position:0%
information back down to school
districts

01:40:44.390 --> 01:40:44.400 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
and make changes automatically if if
 
01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:48.390 align:start position:0%
and make changes automatically if if
needed

01:40:48.390 --> 01:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
needed
 
01:40:50.470 --> 01:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
we are just right now we're just behind
 
01:40:52.229 --> 01:40:52.239 align:start position:0%
times we're behind other states because
 
01:40:53.830 --> 01:40:53.840 align:start position:0%
we haven't made the investment in the
 
01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
systems that we
 
01:40:57.910 --> 01:40:57.920 align:start position:0%
that we need to um and and so
 
01:40:59.910 --> 01:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
purchasing new systems going forward
 
01:41:01.669 --> 01:41:01.679 align:start position:0%
would cause
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
a number of improvements for the
 
01:41:05.430 --> 01:41:05.440 align:start position:0%
department and then also for department
 
01:41:05.440 --> 01:41:05.990 align:start position:0%
department and then also for department
of

01:41:05.990 --> 01:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
school staff across the state i mean we
 
01:41:10.149 --> 01:41:10.159 align:start position:0%
estimate that school staff could
 
01:41:11.669 --> 01:41:11.679 align:start position:0%
could save probably across the state
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds or maybe thousands of
 
01:41:16.070 --> 01:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
hours some of the larger school
 
01:41:17.750 --> 01:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
districts have full-time staff that are
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
dedicated to entering data into student
 
01:41:21.590 --> 01:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
information systems
 
01:41:24.310 --> 01:41:24.320 align:start position:0%
so it's it's pretty cumbersome and it's
 
01:41:25.430 --> 01:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
a large lift
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
but think of this as you know when we
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
invested in systems at the department of
 
01:41:32.470 --> 01:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
revenue to have automate
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
automatic filing or e-filing of taxes is
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
a big
 
01:41:39.109 --> 01:41:39.119 align:start position:0%
lift it's expensive but the num the
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
amount of time and money and
 
01:41:42.790 --> 01:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
resources that save for the taxpayers
 
01:41:44.550 --> 01:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
across the state has been exponential
 
01:41:44.560 --> 01:41:44.790 align:start position:0%
across the state has been exponential
and

01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
this would be the same sort of thing at
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:53.430 --> 01:41:53.440 align:start position:0%
so okay i'm sorry representative porter
 
01:41:57.510 --> 01:41:57.520 align:start position:0%
i know who was first represent murray
 
01:42:00.070 --> 01:42:00.080 align:start position:0%
i don't care i don't know one of you go
 
01:42:00.709 --> 01:42:00.719 align:start position:0%
for it
 
01:42:03.910 --> 01:42:03.920 align:start position:0%
all right thanks again um so
 
01:42:07.590 --> 01:42:07.600 align:start position:0%
i guess two things it sounds like
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
um you're you're you will be collecting
 
01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.030 align:start position:0%
um you're you're you will be collecting
and

01:42:13.030 --> 01:42:13.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:42:16.229 --> 01:42:16.239 align:start position:0%
manipulating the same data that you're
 
01:42:19.750 --> 01:42:19.760 align:start position:0%
collecting now yes so is there any new
 
01:42:19.760 --> 01:42:20.310 align:start position:0%
collecting now yes so is there any new
data

01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
data
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
that you will be collecting or this is
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
this really just
 
01:42:25.990 --> 01:42:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to be a new way of doing what
 
01:42:27.030 --> 01:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
you're doing now
 
01:42:28.310 --> 01:42:28.320 align:start position:0%
so what new information are you
 
01:42:30.950 --> 01:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
collecting so new data is up to you guys
 
01:42:32.950 --> 01:42:32.960 align:start position:0%
so every time you uh pass a bill that
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
says the department of education must
 
01:42:35.350 --> 01:42:35.360 align:start position:0%
you know collect
 
01:42:37.350 --> 01:42:37.360 align:start position:0%
x y or z like a gifted and talented
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
report for example
 
01:42:41.189 --> 01:42:41.199 align:start position:0%
that would require a new data collection
 
01:42:42.070 --> 01:42:42.080 align:start position:0%
um it
 
01:42:44.149 --> 01:42:44.159 align:start position:0%
we collect data that's required for
 
01:42:46.470 --> 01:42:46.480 align:start position:0%
state or federal reporting requirements
 
01:42:48.310 --> 01:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
um there were some pretty substantial
 
01:42:49.910 --> 01:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
changes in the last couple years
 
01:42:51.510 --> 01:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
relative to essa the
 
01:42:54.629 --> 01:42:54.639 align:start position:0%
new that every student succeeds act and
 
01:42:56.709 --> 01:42:56.719 align:start position:0%
we had to make quite a few changes
 
01:42:58.550 --> 01:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
fortunately because of those changes
 
01:43:00.709 --> 01:43:00.719 align:start position:0%
that were made um
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
most of that we were able to pay for
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
with federal money but it has been
 
01:43:07.109 --> 01:43:07.119 align:start position:0%
it's still relatively limiting the
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
ability of our system
 
01:43:10.709 --> 01:43:10.719 align:start position:0%
only goes so far and we're basically
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
maxed out on capacity for that one
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
but yeah we don't we don't collect or
 
01:43:16.229 --> 01:43:16.239 align:start position:0%
maintain any data that's not required
 
01:43:17.830 --> 01:43:17.840 align:start position:0%
for state and or federal reporting
 
01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.109 align:start position:0%
for state and or federal reporting
requirements

01:43:19.109 --> 01:43:19.119 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:43:22.310 --> 01:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you representative porter
 
01:43:25.189 --> 01:43:25.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um so if i'm
 
01:43:27.510 --> 01:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
understanding correctly the process now
 
01:43:29.189 --> 01:43:29.199 align:start position:0%
is that the school district send the
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
information to you
 
01:43:33.510 --> 01:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
and then you process it or just do stuff
 
01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.030 align:start position:0%
and then you process it or just do stuff
there

01:43:35.030 --> 01:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
and under this system you'll you'll go
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
into this you'll collect
 
01:43:40.790 --> 01:43:40.800 align:start position:0%
from the school district you you will be
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
able to get into the school districts
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
directly or no no no no um school
 
01:43:47.430 --> 01:43:47.440 align:start position:0%
districts would
 
01:43:49.669 --> 01:43:49.679 align:start position:0%
be able to have an automated interface
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
with the system
 
01:43:53.910 --> 01:43:53.920 align:start position:0%
um that they could tell oh give caitlyn
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
this specific data at this time and they
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
would set it up that way
 
01:43:58.950 --> 01:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
because the school districts at this
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
point have all invested in their own
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
software that do this
 
01:44:04.470 --> 01:44:04.480 align:start position:0%
but i would never be able to say oh i
 
01:44:05.990 --> 01:44:06.000 align:start position:0%
want to go press i want to know
 
01:44:08.070 --> 01:44:08.080 align:start position:0%
all of the kids that wore a blue shirt
 
01:44:09.270 --> 01:44:09.280 align:start position:0%
today at concord high
 
01:44:11.189 --> 01:44:11.199 align:start position:0%
and then go collect that information
 
01:44:12.790 --> 01:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely would never have that
 
01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:13.510 align:start position:0%
that's absolutely would never have that
information

01:44:13.510 --> 01:44:13.520 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:44:15.910 --> 01:44:15.920 align:start position:0%
okay and that would be against ferpa
 
01:44:17.669 --> 01:44:17.679 align:start position:0%
when we we would never be able
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
we would never and i won't i don't want
 
01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
to do that i don't want to collect more
 
01:44:22.229 --> 01:44:22.239 align:start position:0%
than you guys make me collect already
 
01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah okay thank you very much for
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
that information because i had
 
01:44:28.390 --> 01:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
heard concerns about privacy with this
 
01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
new system and i just wanted to make
 
01:44:31.910 --> 01:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
all of our remembering representative
 
01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.750 align:start position:0%
all of our remembering representative
kirk

01:44:35.750 --> 01:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
kirk
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
on our privacy things that he worked so
 
01:44:39.750 --> 01:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
hard for i just wanted to make sure that
 
01:44:40.709 --> 01:44:40.719 align:start position:0%
they were
 
01:44:43.189 --> 01:44:43.199 align:start position:0%
still there no i mean what we do
 
01:44:43.199 --> 01:44:43.830 align:start position:0%
still there no i mean what we do
envision

01:44:43.830 --> 01:44:43.840 align:start position:0%
envision
 
01:44:46.629 --> 01:44:46.639 align:start position:0%
is now the next time a new data element
 
01:44:47.590 --> 01:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
is collected
 
01:44:51.189 --> 01:44:51.199 align:start position:0%
that there be um that improved the way
 
01:44:53.109 --> 01:44:53.119 align:start position:0%
that it's been collected so for example
 
01:44:54.229 --> 01:44:54.239 align:start position:0%
i forget which bill
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
is but there is a bill right now in
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
house education
 
01:44:59.030 --> 01:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
and representative ellison might know
 
01:45:01.350 --> 01:45:01.360 align:start position:0%
this to
 
01:45:04.950 --> 01:45:04.960 align:start position:0%
allow school districts to include three
 
01:45:06.229 --> 01:45:06.239 align:start position:0%
genders for students
 
01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
so non-binary male or female right now
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
the department of education is actually
 
01:45:11.669 --> 01:45:11.679 align:start position:0%
required to
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
collect gender for a student and report
 
01:45:16.470 --> 01:45:16.480 align:start position:0%
on gender as a subgroup for a variety of
 
01:45:18.390 --> 01:45:18.400 align:start position:0%
state and or federal requirements
 
01:45:20.870 --> 01:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
we don't have a third category that is
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
actually going to be a lot of manual
 
01:45:24.470 --> 01:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
work for the department of education to
 
01:45:24.480 --> 01:45:25.109 align:start position:0%
work for the department of education to
collect

01:45:25.109 --> 01:45:25.119 align:start position:0%
collect
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
and then also also for the school
 
01:45:28.790 --> 01:45:28.800 align:start position:0%
districts to be able to report
 
01:45:31.590 --> 01:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
because there are very specific very
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
finicky templates right now the
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
department of education has at school
 
01:45:34.639 --> 01:45:35.430 align:start position:0%
department of education has at school
districts

01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:45:37.189 --> 01:45:37.199 align:start position:0%
download information from their system
 
01:45:38.550 --> 01:45:38.560 align:start position:0%
and then upload from the to the
 
01:45:39.830 --> 01:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:45:41.669 --> 01:45:41.679 align:start position:0%
so we would need to change our system to
 
01:45:43.030 --> 01:45:43.040 align:start position:0%
have that new field
 
01:45:44.229 --> 01:45:44.239 align:start position:0%
then we would need to change the
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
download and upload templates to the
 
01:45:46.159 --> 01:45:46.950 align:start position:0%
download and upload templates to the
department

01:45:46.950 --> 01:45:46.960 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:45:48.870 --> 01:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
and then we would have to change all of
 
01:45:50.790 --> 01:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
our reporting or manual reporting that
 
01:45:52.390 --> 01:45:52.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing on the back side of things
 
01:45:54.470 --> 01:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
so each time there's a reporting field
 
01:45:56.390 --> 01:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
with a new student information system
 
01:45:58.149 --> 01:45:58.159 align:start position:0%
this is where we could see this would be
 
01:46:00.310 --> 01:46:00.320 align:start position:0%
press a button or what we would tell our
 
01:46:01.990 --> 01:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
vendor that would maintain all this
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
information for us
 
01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
hey we need this new change there's a
 
01:46:07.430 --> 01:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
new state law and it would automatically
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
change our system and then school
 
01:46:11.270 --> 01:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
districts that have the same vendor
 
01:46:12.390 --> 01:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
because there's only
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
so many vendors in the state but school
 
01:46:15.510 --> 01:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
districts that have the same vendor
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
there they would probably see absolutely
 
01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
no change on their side of all it would
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
just automatically automatically
 
01:46:23.350 --> 01:46:23.360 align:start position:0%
change what is being reported to the
 
01:46:27.669 --> 01:46:27.679 align:start position:0%
department so
 
01:46:30.950 --> 01:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
so caitlin um
 
01:46:33.510 --> 01:46:33.520 align:start position:0%
i know that school systems bought
 
01:46:36.709 --> 01:46:36.719 align:start position:0%
student information systems um
 
01:46:38.870 --> 01:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
i don't know five four five years ago
 
01:46:40.550 --> 01:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
um or at least it was started then so
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
that it was automated
 
01:46:49.990 --> 01:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
uh i believe there were two or three
 
01:46:53.109 --> 01:46:53.119 align:start position:0%
different systems out there right now at
 
01:46:54.470 --> 01:46:54.480 align:start position:0%
the schools
 
01:46:57.910 --> 01:46:57.920 align:start position:0%
um so we think there's about 10
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
large vendors at the schools right now
 
01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.270 align:start position:0%
large vendors at the schools right now
um

01:47:01.270 --> 01:47:01.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
but there's two or three large ones in
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
the state the largest one right now we
 
01:47:06.229 --> 01:47:06.239 align:start position:0%
know of is power school
 
01:47:07.750 --> 01:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
and almost everybody's using power
 
01:47:10.070 --> 01:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
school and then um there's alma which
 
01:47:11.830 --> 01:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
seems to be up and coming and infinite
 
01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:12.870 align:start position:0%
seems to be up and coming and infinite
campus

01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
campus
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
there's a few other ones um that are out
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
there and you're correct so schools have
 
01:47:18.950 --> 01:47:18.960 align:start position:0%
gone out already and purchased their own
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
software on their side of things
 
01:47:22.950 --> 01:47:22.960 align:start position:0%
minutes has made their lives a lot
 
01:47:24.629 --> 01:47:24.639 align:start position:0%
easier we wouldn't ask
 
01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
school districts to change their systems
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they are using
 
01:47:30.390 --> 01:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
um originally we had potentially thought
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
about something like that but we're too
 
01:47:35.669 --> 01:47:35.679 align:start position:0%
far behind the gate on this one um
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know had we done this in 2015 maybe
 
01:47:40.149 --> 01:47:40.159 align:start position:0%
when school districts hadn't made
 
01:47:42.709 --> 01:47:42.719 align:start position:0%
substantial investments in in systems
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
we would they would maybe want to use
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
our system but now what we see
 
01:47:50.229 --> 01:47:50.239 align:start position:0%
is we see um we see that school we see
 
01:47:51.189 --> 01:47:51.199 align:start position:0%
an opportunity
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
if the department of education selects a
 
01:47:55.030 --> 01:47:55.040 align:start position:0%
vendor that many school districts in the
 
01:47:56.390 --> 01:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
state are using right now the school
 
01:47:58.470 --> 01:47:58.480 align:start position:0%
districts would likely be offered a
 
01:48:01.109 --> 01:48:01.119 align:start position:0%
discount from their vendor too we
 
01:48:01.119 --> 01:48:01.590 align:start position:0%
discount from their vendor too we
actually

01:48:01.590 --> 01:48:01.600 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:04.480 align:start position:0%
required that as a information for our
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
rfp that's published right now
 
01:48:08.390 --> 01:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
so we do hope that we should be able to
 
01:48:10.149 --> 01:48:10.159 align:start position:0%
offer some sort of incentivizing for
 
01:48:11.430 --> 01:48:11.440 align:start position:0%
school districts that either want to
 
01:48:13.109 --> 01:48:13.119 align:start position:0%
change vendors to the state vendor
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
or are already on that vendor so then
 
01:48:16.310 --> 01:48:16.320 align:start position:0%
they could have a decline
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
reduced cost school districts are paying
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
anywhere from eight to
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
fifteen dollars per student right now
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
for a student information system and we
 
01:48:24.950 --> 01:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
would hope that we would be able to
 
01:48:26.790 --> 01:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
incentivize the cost of like two or
 
01:48:28.310 --> 01:48:28.320 align:start position:0%
three dollars if they were on the state
 
01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:29.109 align:start position:0%
three dollars if they were on the state
system

01:48:29.109 --> 01:48:29.119 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:48:30.870 --> 01:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
now and when i say the state system i
 
01:48:32.390 --> 01:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
still mean we would have an
 
01:48:34.390 --> 01:48:34.400 align:start position:0%
entirely separate instance so we would
 
01:48:35.669 --> 01:48:35.679 align:start position:0%
have the department of education with
 
01:48:37.350 --> 01:48:37.360 align:start position:0%
the department of education information
 
01:48:38.470 --> 01:48:38.480 align:start position:0%
the school district would have their
 
01:48:40.390 --> 01:48:40.400 align:start position:0%
information and they would interface
 
01:48:41.189 --> 01:48:41.199 align:start position:0%
where they've
 
01:48:42.870 --> 01:48:42.880 align:start position:0%
been told to interface but we would
 
01:48:44.470 --> 01:48:44.480 align:start position:0%
never be able to see information that we
 
01:48:45.350 --> 01:48:45.360 align:start position:0%
can't see
 
01:48:48.550 --> 01:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
or we're not supposed to see rather
 
01:48:51.350 --> 01:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
so are you suggesting and make sure i
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
understand this
 
01:48:54.709 --> 01:48:54.719 align:start position:0%
that school districts would have the
 
01:48:54.719 --> 01:48:56.310 align:start position:0%
that school districts would have the
opportunity

01:48:56.310 --> 01:48:56.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
to have a spot on the state
 
01:49:05.270 --> 01:49:05.280 align:start position:0%
yes yep absolutely
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
then they would pay
 
01:49:11.990 --> 01:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
whom um so likely their vendor would
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
just charge them less money so with
 
01:49:14.790 --> 01:49:14.800 align:start position:0%
their vendor so say
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
if for a power school for example power
 
01:49:18.229 --> 01:49:18.239 align:start position:0%
school would say hey we can offer you
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
your system at two dollars per student
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
right now rather than the seven dollars
 
01:49:26.830 --> 01:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.990 --> 01:49:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay and
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
you would have interfaces with all of
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
the various
 
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:37.270 align:start position:0%
the various
um

01:49:37.270 --> 01:49:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.189 --> 01:49:39.199 align:start position:0%
systems that are out there in the
 
01:49:40.830 --> 01:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
schools is that correct
 
01:49:44.629 --> 01:49:44.639 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh representative porter
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair caitlin would this
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
be something that could be paid for with
 
01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
the federal money that's coming in
 
01:49:52.390 --> 01:49:52.400 align:start position:0%
so right now we actually have um federal
 
01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
money to purchase the system
 
01:49:57.589 --> 01:49:57.599 align:start position:0%
so we have if you see historically going
 
01:49:57.599 --> 01:49:58.310 align:start position:0%
so we have if you see historically going
back

01:49:58.310 --> 01:49:58.320 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:50:02.310 --> 01:50:02.320 align:start position:0%
um we have um
 
01:50:04.070 --> 01:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
putting a capital budget request in
 
01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
about two and a half million dollars and
 
01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
then a hundred
 
01:50:08.709 --> 01:50:08.719 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million dollars in our operating
 
01:50:08.719 --> 01:50:10.070 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 million dollars in our operating
budget

01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:50:11.910 --> 01:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
we have been successful in going out to
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
use a competitive federal
 
01:50:16.629 --> 01:50:16.639 align:start position:0%
grant to purchase the operating
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
the sorry the capital initial purchase
 
01:50:19.750 --> 01:50:19.760 align:start position:0%
so you won't see that in
 
01:50:22.550 --> 01:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
the capital budget this year as far as
 
01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:23.109 align:start position:0%
the capital budget this year as far as
the

01:50:23.109 --> 01:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:50:26.149 --> 01:50:26.159 align:start position:0%
um the state level portions
 
01:50:28.950 --> 01:50:28.960 align:start position:0%
there may be um but we actually have
 
01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
we've received a pretty limited amount
 
01:50:31.990 --> 01:50:32.000 align:start position:0%
of money at the state that is really for
 
01:50:33.910 --> 01:50:33.920 align:start position:0%
the oversight management of the grant
 
01:50:37.669 --> 01:50:37.679 align:start position:0%
so we could potentially but like likely
 
01:50:39.830 --> 01:50:39.840 align:start position:0%
so we could choose between slowing down
 
01:50:41.270 --> 01:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
approving grants for school districts
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
because we could have less staff
 
01:50:45.109 --> 01:50:45.119 align:start position:0%
and then having a quicker data system or
 
01:50:45.830 --> 01:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
we could have
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
no data system but quicker approvals for
 
01:50:50.070 --> 01:50:50.080 align:start position:0%
the 150 million dollars for school staff
 
01:50:52.870 --> 01:50:52.880 align:start position:0%
so it's one or the other
 
01:50:55.350 --> 01:50:55.360 align:start position:0%
could um could school districts use this
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
money to
 
01:50:59.109 --> 01:50:59.119 align:start position:0%
update their school districts school
 
01:50:59.119 --> 01:50:59.669 align:start position:0%
update their school districts school
district

01:50:59.669 --> 01:50:59.679 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:51:01.510 --> 01:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
could absolutely update their systems
 
01:51:03.030 --> 01:51:03.040 align:start position:0%
with this um but they're
 
01:51:04.390 --> 01:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't affect the department of
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
education at all right now
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
the issue is the department of education
 
01:51:09.830 --> 01:51:09.840 align:start position:0%
budgets but
 
01:51:14.390 --> 01:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:17.830 --> 01:51:17.840 align:start position:0%
so the 1.2 is for operating costs
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
is that correct um 1.5 but yes for the
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
ongoing operating costs of the system
 
01:51:29.270 --> 01:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.950 --> 01:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll take 1.2 if that's all i can
 
01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:35.350 align:start position:0%
i mean i'll take 1.2 if that's all i can
get

01:51:35.350 --> 01:51:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:38.070 --> 01:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 is what's in the budget is that
 
01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:38.709 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 is what's in the budget is that
correct

01:51:38.709 --> 01:51:38.719 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
yes we actually um we had 2 million in
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
01:51:45.189 --> 01:51:45.199 align:start position:0%
um and i believe that we've reduced it
 
01:51:47.030 --> 01:51:47.040 align:start position:0%
down to 1.5 we've we've
 
01:51:48.790 --> 01:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
actively because we have that federal
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
grant to purchase the system
 
01:51:52.709 --> 01:51:52.719 align:start position:0%
we put out the rfp and um some of our
 
01:51:53.830 --> 01:51:53.840 align:start position:0%
proposals and the
 
01:51:55.109 --> 01:51:55.119 align:start position:0%
conversations we've been having with the
 
01:51:56.950 --> 01:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
vendors it looks like it's gonna be
 
01:51:58.950 --> 01:51:58.960 align:start position:0%
about one and a half rather than the two
 
01:52:00.390 --> 01:52:00.400 align:start position:0%
so we did we did feel comfortable
 
01:52:09.030 --> 01:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh representative i'm sorry i don't know
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:16.310 --> 01:52:16.320 align:start position:0%
represent murray were you first to
 
01:52:17.510 --> 01:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
represent turcotte
 
01:52:20.950 --> 01:52:20.960 align:start position:0%
no he was first okay i'm sorry i was uh
 
01:52:22.950 --> 01:52:22.960 align:start position:0%
i was writing something on my pad and
 
01:52:24.070 --> 01:52:24.080 align:start position:0%
missed the hand so
 
01:52:26.550 --> 01:52:26.560 align:start position:0%
representative turcotte please thank you
 
01:52:28.870 --> 01:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
it didn't really matter who went um
 
01:52:30.709 --> 01:52:30.719 align:start position:0%
you mentioned a few times that with the
 
01:52:31.910 --> 01:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
system that
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
you think that it would require less
 
01:52:35.430 --> 01:52:35.440 align:start position:0%
staff do you have you estimated the
 
01:52:35.440 --> 01:52:35.830 align:start position:0%
staff do you have you estimated the
actual

01:52:35.830 --> 01:52:35.840 align:start position:0%
actual
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
number of say hours that would be saved
 
01:52:42.709 --> 01:52:42.719 align:start position:0%
levels yeah it wouldn't require less
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
staff at the department of education
 
01:52:45.910 --> 01:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
unfortunately because the department of
 
01:52:47.510 --> 01:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
education is still responsible for
 
01:52:48.390 --> 01:52:48.400 align:start position:0%
collecting all the
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
data and working with the school
 
01:52:51.750 --> 01:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
districts not not initially
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
i wouldn't be comfortable reducing any
 
01:52:56.310 --> 01:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
staff but some school districts spend
 
01:52:58.149 --> 01:52:58.159 align:start position:0%
i can tell you hundreds of hours
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
submitting data to the department of
 
01:53:01.350 --> 01:53:01.360 align:start position:0%
education and then reconciling that data
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
with the department of education
 
01:53:06.070 --> 01:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
um there's staff that um spend most of
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
their june in july working with the
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
department of education
 
01:53:12.310 --> 01:53:12.320 align:start position:0%
um and i always hate the unfortunate
 
01:53:12.950 --> 01:53:12.960 align:start position:0%
time where
 
01:53:15.189 --> 01:53:15.199 align:start position:0%
a school district has think that this is
 
01:53:16.709 --> 01:53:16.719 align:start position:0%
let me just give you a scenario so i
 
01:53:18.149 --> 01:53:18.159 align:start position:0%
have a school district that enters a
 
01:53:19.589 --> 01:53:19.599 align:start position:0%
bunch of information
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
on time they meet their deadline that
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do their staff
 
01:53:22.480 --> 01:53:23.669 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do their staff
enters

01:53:23.669 --> 01:53:23.679 align:start position:0%
enters
 
01:53:25.750 --> 01:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
they call them i4c coordinators their
 
01:53:27.510 --> 01:53:27.520 align:start position:0%
i4c data coordinator put all the
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
information in
 
01:53:29.830 --> 01:53:29.840 align:start position:0%
the superintendents review the
 
01:53:31.750 --> 01:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
information and then certify meaning
 
01:53:32.950 --> 01:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
they sign off believing all the
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
information is correct
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
by the appropriate deadline which is
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
usually the second week of july
 
01:53:41.030 --> 01:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
then a school district is late another
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
school district and the school district
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
enters all of their information
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
they their superintendent signs off on
 
01:53:48.070 --> 01:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
it it goes to the department of
 
01:53:48.080 --> 01:53:49.030 align:start position:0%
it it goes to the department of
education

01:53:49.030 --> 01:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
now the department of education system
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
starts looking at the two different
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
data collections and they're saying oh
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
no there's anomalies both school
 
01:53:56.480 --> 01:53:57.030 align:start position:0%
no there's anomalies both school
districts

01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:53:59.189 --> 01:53:59.199 align:start position:0%
both reported representative umberger
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
and all these other people and
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
or they said that you know she's in
 
01:54:03.910 --> 01:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
third grade but last year we had her in
 
01:54:04.870 --> 01:54:04.880 align:start position:0%
fifth grade and
 
01:54:08.629 --> 01:54:08.639 align:start position:0%
um all this information that's wrong and
 
01:54:10.310 --> 01:54:10.320 align:start position:0%
so not only does the school district
 
01:54:12.550 --> 01:54:12.560 align:start position:0%
that had the information wrong
 
01:54:14.950 --> 01:54:14.960 align:start position:0%
and that was late um have to get called
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
back by the department of education the
 
01:54:18.390 --> 01:54:18.400 align:start position:0%
other superintendent has to get called
 
01:54:19.109 --> 01:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
back too
 
01:54:20.870 --> 01:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
and oftentimes you know they have a
 
01:54:22.390 --> 01:54:22.400 align:start position:0%
part-time staff that did it
 
01:54:24.070 --> 01:54:24.080 align:start position:0%
and that part-time staff is already out
 
01:54:25.510 --> 01:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
of the office for the summer they don't
 
01:54:27.350 --> 01:54:27.360 align:start position:0%
work maybe july and august and they're
 
01:54:28.870 --> 01:54:28.880 align:start position:0%
having to call somebody back and pay
 
01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
them overtime
 
01:54:32.390 --> 01:54:32.400 align:start position:0%
or the superintendent is in there
 
01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:33.109 align:start position:0%
or the superintendent is in there
viewing

01:54:33.109 --> 01:54:33.119 align:start position:0%
viewing
 
01:54:35.669 --> 01:54:35.679 align:start position:0%
you know the data entry themselves the
 
01:54:37.109 --> 01:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
number of times that i've spent late
 
01:54:38.709 --> 01:54:38.719 align:start position:0%
nights working with the superintendent
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
directly to make sure that the data is
 
01:54:43.589 --> 01:54:43.599 align:start position:0%
entered is kind of crazy and that's
 
01:54:44.229 --> 01:54:44.239 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:54:46.950 --> 01:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
um unfortunate consequence of having
 
01:54:51.270 --> 01:54:51.280 align:start position:0%
these older systems at the department
 
01:54:55.189 --> 01:54:55.199 align:start position:0%

from
 
01:55:13.510 --> 01:55:13.520 align:start position:0%

01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:14.470 align:start position:0%
us would you not be able to purchase the
system

01:55:14.470 --> 01:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:55:19.910 --> 01:55:19.920 align:start position:0%

01:56:50.950 --> 01:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
a couple things that we can uh
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
take care of today representing lynn i
 
01:56:55.990 --> 01:56:56.000 align:start position:0%
see you have your hand up
 
01:56:58.229 --> 01:56:58.239 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you you know what um madam
 
01:57:00.790 --> 01:57:00.800 align:start position:0%
chair uh the speaker has appointed me
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
to something called the state county
 
01:57:06.950 --> 01:57:06.960 align:start position:0%
budget commission which is scheduled for
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
a meeting at one o'clock this afternoon
 
01:57:12.070 --> 01:57:12.080 align:start position:0%
i i i caught representative wyler is
 
01:57:13.589 --> 01:57:13.599 align:start position:0%
also on that commission i have to be
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
honest with you
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
i have no idea what it is or what it
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
does i looked at the statute which
 
01:57:20.709 --> 01:57:20.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to give much information
 
01:57:25.270 --> 01:57:25.280 align:start position:0%
um so i think i'm supposed to go there
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh bob i think that if you send
 
01:57:32.470 --> 01:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh ken a note and tell him that we
 
01:57:36.470 --> 01:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
are not finished and would he take notes
 
01:57:38.070 --> 01:57:38.080 align:start position:0%
and get back to you
 
01:57:40.870 --> 01:57:40.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sure that he will be very
 
01:57:42.149 --> 01:57:42.159 align:start position:0%
cooperative in that
 
01:57:45.510 --> 01:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
because we do we really do need to get
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
some of this stuff done
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
oh no that's fine i'm happy i'm happy to
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
do that uh
 
01:57:51.830 --> 01:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
uh so i'll send him and i'll send him a
 
01:57:53.350 --> 01:57:53.360 align:start position:0%
note right now all right
 
01:57:57.510 --> 01:57:57.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:59.669 --> 01:57:59.679 align:start position:0%
don't we have a committee for everything
 
01:58:04.149 --> 01:58:04.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:05.990 --> 01:58:06.000 align:start position:0%
okay i would be curious the most
 
01:58:07.189 --> 01:58:07.199 align:start position:0%
interesting thing about this would be to
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what this commission
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
does but
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh i i can i'll find that out some other
 
01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:14.709 align:start position:0%
uh i i can i'll find that out some other
time

01:58:14.709 --> 01:58:14.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
holy mackerel okay all right we'll see
 
01:58:19.030 --> 01:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
you all at one o'clock
 
01:58:23.430 --> 01:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
and uh hopefully we will be able to
 
01:58:26.950 --> 01:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
get some of these things accomplished
 
01:58:30.149 --> 01:58:30.159 align:start position:0%
that are what mickey calls the
 
01:58:33.189 --> 01:58:33.199 align:start position:0%
the low-hanging fruit and
 
01:58:36.629 --> 01:58:36.639 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens so see it one
 
01:58:36.639 --> 01:58:37.669 align:start position:0%
we'll see what happens so see it one
