members of the legislative

Administration committee it's a pleasure
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
to be here uh my name is representative
 
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:52.360 align:start position:0%
Rebecca McWilliams I represent the west
 
00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:55.360 align:start position:0%
side of conquer uh this is my second
 
00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
term as a rep and so um I am bringing
 
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:02.360 align:start position:0%
forth House Bill 156 because I believe
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
that there are some things we could do
 
00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
better when addressing bills um so it's
 
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
a fairly simple bill but I think it
 
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
would make a big difference for um
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
transparency when we're addressing bills
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
so to dive into the language of the bill
 
00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I have it pulled up on
 
00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.710 align:start position:0%
let me make sure I have it pulled up on
my

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:20.720 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
screen uh this is about amendments for
 
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 align:start position:0%
bills uh being shared with anyone who
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
wants to see what's going on on the
 
00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:34.160 align:start position:0%
house uh website so as you I'm sure you
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
all know but I'll go through the process
 
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.160 align:start position:0%
anyway um when there is a bill being
 
00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:42.120 align:start position:0%
heard in committee uh either the sponsor
 
00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 align:start position:0%
or a member of the committee or another
 
00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:47.759 align:start position:0%
representative co-sponsor uh May propose
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
an amendment they'll go to the Lo
 
00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
they'll explain what the amendment is
 
00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
have it drafted um now that drafted
 
00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 align:start position:0%
amendment is still confidential the only
 
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 align:start position:0%
person who has that Amendment um is the
 
00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
is the person who requested it until it
 
00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:07.960 align:start position:0%
is disseminated and shared with the
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
other members of the committee uh
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
lobbyists the general public spread far
 
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:15.240 align:start position:0%
and wide as the person who drafted the
 
00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:19.720 align:start position:0%
amendment decides to do so um I think
 
00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:21.479 align:start position:0%
there probably are some good reasons to
 
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
keep amendments confidential and so I'm
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
not going there with this specific Bill
 
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:29.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not changing that at all uh what
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
this Bill does is once the amendment has
 
00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
been discussed and adopted by the
 
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:37.400 align:start position:0%
committee it allows that amendment to
 
00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 align:start position:0%
then be published on our house website
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
so when anyone member of the public um
 
00:06:46.029 --> 00:06:46.039 align:start position:0%
or another uh person who's not on the
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
committee wants to see the status or
 
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the underlying Bill
 
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:52.800 align:start position:0%
they're able to click on and see the
 
00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
amendment on our house website so that's
 
00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing and I'm glad to take
 
00:06:58.039 --> 00:06:59.990 align:start position:0%
what I'm proposing and I'm glad to take
questions

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 align:start position:0%
thank you uh are there any questions
 
00:07:07.589 --> 00:07:07.599 align:start position:0%

00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:33.800 align:start position:0%
thinking wow this is a really new idea
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
we need to do
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
this I have not had a conversation with
 
00:07:39.670 --> 00:07:39.680 align:start position:0%

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:54.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there may be good reasons
 
00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:55.469 align:start position:0%
mentioned that there may be good reasons
for

00:07:55.469 --> 00:07:55.479 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
confidentiality um How would how would
 
00:08:02.830 --> 00:08:02.840 align:start position:0%
someone Det DET um whether
 
00:08:06.550 --> 00:08:06.560 align:start position:0%
and there for confidentiality if they
 
00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:08.790 align:start position:0%
and there for confidentiality if they
chose

00:08:08.790 --> 00:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
chose
 
00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
to so this bill is about a an amendment
 
00:08:14.670 --> 00:08:14.680 align:start position:0%
that's already been voted on by the
 
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
committee so by the very nature of the
 
00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879 align:start position:0%
way we have public hearings the
 
00:08:21.909 --> 00:08:21.919 align:start position:0%
amendment is technically public at the
 
00:08:23.589 --> 00:08:23.599 align:start position:0%
time that it's being voted on by the
 
00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
committee so there's no confidentiality
 
00:08:29.550 --> 00:08:29.560 align:start position:0%
past that point but in terms of strategy
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
I've certainly seen prior to committee
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
meetings there may be multiple
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
amendments floating around depending on
 
00:08:38.310 --> 00:08:38.320 align:start position:0%
how complex the bill is uh and some of
 
00:08:39.990 --> 00:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
those don't ever get presented to the
 
00:08:41.630 --> 00:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
committee they're just discussed amongst
 
00:08:44.230 --> 00:08:44.240 align:start position:0%
different interest groups um before it's
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
refined and finally presented so the
 
00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
confidentiality piece may be um
 
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
negotiation or strategy or keep this in
 
00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:53.200 align:start position:0%
take this out um I don't think that
 
00:08:54.990 --> 00:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
those specific things need to see the
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
light of day necessarily or need to be
 
00:08:59.190 --> 00:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
transparent to the public but certainly
 
00:09:01.509 --> 00:09:01.519 align:start position:0%
one once a committee has voted and
 
00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:04.160 align:start position:0%
approved then confidentiality goes out
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
the window because it's public record um
 
00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
you know it's already
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
happened thank
 
00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:14.120 align:start position:0%

address representative mcwilliams's uh
 
00:09:54.069 --> 00:09:54.079 align:start position:0%
point and by the way I'm sorry I should
 
00:09:56.269 --> 00:09:56.279 align:start position:0%
state I'm the house clerk I'm I'm not
 
00:09:59.069 --> 00:09:59.079 align:start position:0%
testifying in favor uh or opposed to
 
00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160 align:start position:0%
this uh particular piece of legislation
 
00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
just to share some uh simple issues with
 
00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:08.360 align:start position:0%
you um uh fundamentally um we don't uh
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
have uh we we tend not to put the
 
00:10:14.190 --> 00:10:14.200 align:start position:0%
internal processes of the house in terms
 
00:10:17.069 --> 00:10:17.079 align:start position:0%
of in into law uh those are those are
 
00:10:19.509 --> 00:10:19.519 align:start position:0%
things that we we try to deal with as as
 
00:10:23.509 --> 00:10:23.519 align:start position:0%
as most as we can uh within um existing
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
practice that being said I do want to
 
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
share with you that this uh particular
 
00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:30.880 align:start position:0%
issue is in fact under development right
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
now we are rolling out a new website
 
00:10:34.949 --> 00:10:34.959 align:start position:0%
within the next couple of months and I
 
00:10:37.269 --> 00:10:37.279 align:start position:0%
have asked the chair uh to allow me to
 
00:10:39.670 --> 00:10:39.680 align:start position:0%
share my screen and I want to show you
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
how that's going to look so if you will
 
00:10:44.069 --> 00:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
bear with me for a moment you can see
 
00:10:47.069 --> 00:10:47.079 align:start position:0%
here um uh you're all familiar with the
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
landing page of legislation right now as
 
00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
a matter of fact uh what else let me
 
00:10:54.069 --> 00:10:54.079 align:start position:0%
stop this one and share you the normal
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh web page
 
00:11:01.030 --> 00:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
um so you all are amiliar with our um
 
00:11:03.949 --> 00:11:03.959 align:start position:0%
our landing page and on this page you
 
00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:06.040 align:start position:0%
you can click to the docket uh to the
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
bill text to the status uh once you get
 
00:11:10.590 --> 00:11:10.600 align:start position:0%
through the session there's a uh a
 
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:12.720 align:start position:0%
history page as well if there's audio
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
that's been recorded etc those will all
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
link here um what we are moving to and
 
00:11:20.389 --> 00:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
let me just go back to it again and I
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
apologize um is is sort of a newer
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
mechanism where uh we will have a
 
00:11:28.629 --> 00:11:28.639 align:start position:0%
landing page that's sort of similar to
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
this and everything will be available
 
00:11:34.269 --> 00:11:34.279 align:start position:0%
right here on the leftand side and that
 
00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:37.360 align:start position:0%
includes the Amendments um
 
00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
representative McWilliams is correct
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
that that amendments are kept
 
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:42.440 align:start position:0%
confidential until they are introduced
 
00:11:45.269 --> 00:11:45.279 align:start position:0%
by the individual members uh we and that
 
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
that process is never going to change um
 
00:11:51.269 --> 00:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear um amendments are
 
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
are often drafted uh for a variety of
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
reasons whether they're going to be put
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
forward or not uh I think back to uh the
 
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
former me member from wear Who as a
 
00:12:03.870 --> 00:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
member of the finance committee would
 
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
would frequently have 45 to 50
 
00:12:08.430 --> 00:12:08.440 align:start position:0%
amendments drafted and then only offer
 
00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:10.880 align:start position:0%
10 or 15 of them uh but they were just
 
00:12:14.550 --> 00:12:14.560 align:start position:0%
sort of back pocket type of items um and
 
00:12:17.269 --> 00:12:17.279 align:start position:0%
while this was certainly a cumbersome uh
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
task for our our folks in OS um you know
 
00:12:23.750 --> 00:12:23.760 align:start position:0%
it did um provide for for you the
 
00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:26.120 align:start position:0%
members to have what you need uh so
 
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:29.320 align:start position:0%
again the the plan is with the new web
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
site that's being worked on is that all
 
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
of the Amendments um will be linked here
 
00:12:37.910 --> 00:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
um and available on the page when you
 
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
get to U that website so uh although I
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
as I said I I'm not um here to testify
 
00:12:45.629 --> 00:12:45.639 align:start position:0%
against the legislation I would simply
 
00:12:48.030 --> 00:12:48.040 align:start position:0%
State I don't think it's needed uh a
 
00:12:50.310 --> 00:12:50.320 align:start position:0%
because our our our our typical past
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
practice is that we do not put internal
 
00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
functions of of the legislative process
 
00:12:59.829 --> 00:12:59.839 align:start position:0%
into statute uh however we we also
 
00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
um we do this kind of thing where where
 
00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:05.079 align:start position:0%
we advance in technology and and and
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
post these things up uh as we move
 
00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
forward into new
 
00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
centuries so happy to take any questions
 
00:13:17.829 --> 00:13:17.839 align:start position:0%
if anyone has any thank you Mr Clark U
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
are there any questions from anyone in
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
little later on another bill I
 
00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:47.389 align:start position:0%
little later on another bill I
believe

00:13:47.389 --> 00:13:47.399 align:start position:0%
believe
 
00:13:51.430 --> 00:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
um our next person to
 
00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:55.480 align:start position:0%

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
Alvin C I am U uh from ladden and I'm
 
00:14:38.350 --> 00:14:38.360 align:start position:0%
while I'm supporting the bill I also
 
00:14:40.590 --> 00:14:40.600 align:start position:0%
would like to say that I support what
 
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
the uh clerk just uh talked about um and
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
like the look of the new
 
00:14:51.069 --> 00:14:51.079 align:start position:0%
page um I had an experience just a
 
00:14:54.550 --> 00:14:54.560 align:start position:0%
couple weeks ago where I'd um uh where
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
one of the Committees was talking about
 
00:14:58.870 --> 00:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment and of course I wasn't able
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
to to see the amendment because it
 
00:15:03.030 --> 00:15:03.040 align:start position:0%
hadn't been posted or
 
00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:06.040 align:start position:0%
anything um and so i' called into the
 
00:15:08.509 --> 00:15:08.519 align:start position:0%
state house and ended up talking to two
 
00:15:10.069 --> 00:15:10.079 align:start position:0%
people before I talked to somebody who
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
was able to who had access to the U
 
00:15:17.230 --> 00:15:17.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment and was able to email it to me
 
00:15:19.150 --> 00:15:19.160 align:start position:0%
uh so that was very helpful and uh
 
00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:21.440 align:start position:0%
thanks to Pam smling for
 
00:15:21.440 --> 00:15:23.350 align:start position:0%
thanks to Pam smling for
that

00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:23.360 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
um I would like to suggest that
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
amendments are posted as early as
 
00:15:28.399 --> 00:15:29.790 align:start position:0%
amendments are posted as early as
possible

00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
uh including before committee hearings
 
00:15:36.189 --> 00:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
where where the U uh people who may want
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
to testify should know what the
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
amendment has in it uh in case that
 
00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:45.040 align:start position:0%
changes what they would testify about uh
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
I find it frustrating
 
00:15:49.749 --> 00:15:49.759 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
00:15:52.829 --> 00:15:52.839 align:start position:0%
about uh a bill and then find out that
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
there's a an amendment that's
 
00:15:56.189 --> 00:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
eliminating part of what I was
 
00:15:56.199 --> 00:15:57.550 align:start position:0%
eliminating part of what I was
testifying

00:15:57.550 --> 00:15:57.560 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
about uh also for floor
 
00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:03.560 align:start position:0%
amendments uh before house sessions they
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
should be up uh the day before so that
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh um any citizen who wants to contact
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
their uh representative or senator for
 
00:16:17.870 --> 00:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
that matter uh would be able to do so
 
00:16:19.110 --> 00:16:19.120 align:start position:0%
before the
 
00:16:21.870 --> 00:16:21.880 align:start position:0%
session and with that I thank you and uh
 
00:16:24.749 --> 00:16:24.759 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer any
 
00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
questions C uh did you have written
 
00:16:31.069 --> 00:16:31.079 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr C I I didn't but I can uh
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
put this into an email and send it to
 
00:16:36.350 --> 00:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
you think that would be helpful to our
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
clerk um does anyone in the committee
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
room have questions
 
00:16:47.870 --> 00:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
for Mr C no anyone on Zoom we
 
00:16:50.269 --> 00:16:50.279 align:start position:0%
have is it new
 
00:16:52.509 --> 00:16:52.519 align:start position:0%
entrance yes thank you for your
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
testimony Mr C um next uh the chair will
 
00:17:02.550 --> 00:17:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much Mr chair I I
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
don't have written testimony on this
 
00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
bill um I just decided to uh I just
 
00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:12.240 align:start position:0%
decided this morning to chime in so I I
 
00:17:14.429 --> 00:17:14.439 align:start position:0%
agree um I agree that this is an
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
excellent idea of making easier to see
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
amendments that's been something that
 
00:17:19.829 --> 00:17:19.839 align:start position:0%
has uh frustrated me throughout my like
 
00:17:22.470 --> 00:17:22.480 align:start position:0%
13 years in counting as a State Rep
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
that's very hard keep track of
 
00:17:27.870 --> 00:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
amendments and it may suffice just to
 
00:17:29.750 --> 00:17:29.760 align:start position:0%
have you know Central place for them to
 
00:17:31.990 --> 00:17:32.000 align:start position:0%
be like where the clerk is because
 
00:17:35.110 --> 00:17:35.120 align:start position:0%
before they're sort distributed on paper
 
00:17:37.590 --> 00:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
and procedure for dist the paper was
 
00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily halfhazard so I can't
 
00:17:42.710 --> 00:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
remember how many times somebody brings
 
00:17:44.430 --> 00:17:44.440 align:start position:0%
up an amendment committee or even on the
 
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
floor and have no way of getting a copy
 
00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.160 align:start position:0%
of it at least no easy well the
 
00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
committee of course you can always have
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant back when we're
 
00:17:52.310 --> 00:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
doing the old fashioned way go and make
 
00:17:56.190 --> 00:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
a copy so and there's also uh there's
 
00:17:57.750 --> 00:17:57.760 align:start position:0%
also a lot of gamesmanship that takes
 
00:17:59.590 --> 00:17:59.600 align:start position:0%
place especially in hearings where the
 
00:18:01.870 --> 00:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor will have a bill that lots
 
00:18:04.230 --> 00:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
of people hate and then they'll allude
 
00:18:06.029 --> 00:18:06.039 align:start position:0%
to an amendment which none of the
 
00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
opponents have seen so that's uh that
 
00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
often place you in a frustrating
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
situation where you're uh place and I
 
00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
suppose also sometimes when your favor
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
of the bill when you're
 
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
speaking to something that isn't what
 
00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
the committee is going to be considering
 
00:18:21.350 --> 00:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
and that's that's extraordinarily
 
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
frustrating although they sometimes
 
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
that's done I think it's
 
00:18:27.750 --> 00:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
gang the four
 
00:18:29.430 --> 00:18:29.440 align:start position:0%
amendments if and when we're ever
 
00:18:30.990 --> 00:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
meeting in rep Hall they hand them
 
00:18:33.909 --> 00:18:33.919 align:start position:0%
around to the Rose and that's uh
 
00:18:35.950 --> 00:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
traditional practice that in my opinion
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
uh Sant arms office and clerk's office
 
00:18:40.630 --> 00:18:40.640 align:start position:0%
worked very hard to make it happen but
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
we've uh there's been many many times
 
00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
when nobody not everyone gets the
 
00:18:47.789 --> 00:18:47.799 align:start position:0%
amendment and there is and uh sometimes
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
there's a stack of amount in the ante
 
00:18:50.710 --> 00:18:50.720 align:start position:0%
room sometime there isn't and of course
 
00:18:52.590 --> 00:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
if you're in the audience or you know
 
00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
either up in the gallery or watching on
 
00:18:58.190 --> 00:18:58.200 align:start position:0%
uh watching on uh streaming video you
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
have no way of all of knowing uh what
 
00:19:02.710 --> 00:19:02.720 align:start position:0%
the floor amendment is so having a
 
00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:03.919 align:start position:0%
central place to put the floor
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
amendments um is a good idea and um that
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
can probably be done without before this
 
00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:11.720 align:start position:0%
bill is uh is passed I think it be a
 
00:19:14.149 --> 00:19:14.159 align:start position:0%
good idea and also uh I'll just
 
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned back during the drive-in
 
00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.120 align:start position:0%
session um we had the Senate uh amended
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
a bill that at least some of us were
 
00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:23.960 align:start position:0%
planning to consider on floor or the
 
00:19:26.149 --> 00:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
tarmac of that session and um I don't
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
know why that never came the floor but
 
00:19:30.390 --> 00:19:30.400 align:start position:0%
part of the problem with doubtless that
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
uh somebody was going to have to go
 
00:19:34.029 --> 00:19:34.039 align:start position:0%
around and print 400 copies and go
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
around a golf cart to all 400 cars and
 
00:19:38.630 --> 00:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
I'm I don't know all the details of it
 
00:19:40.430 --> 00:19:40.440 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure if any provision had
 
00:19:41.789 --> 00:19:41.799 align:start position:0%
been made to make that possible
 
00:19:43.390 --> 00:19:43.400 align:start position:0%
certainly it didn't happen that
 
00:19:46.110 --> 00:19:46.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment amended version from the
 
00:19:47.909 --> 00:19:47.919 align:start position:0%
Senate was never distributed to the
 
00:19:49.990 --> 00:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
members so we never had a chance to
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
consider it and that's uh election law
 
00:19:54.590 --> 00:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
Bill Which senate was hoping to have
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
passed that very day so the governor was
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
ready apparently ready to sign in
 
00:20:00.470 --> 00:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
himself St we lost an important bill
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
that way related to election law but so
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
I just want to say I think this is a
 
00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
good bill to represent MC Williams and
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
um regardless of whether or not this
 
00:20:11.669 --> 00:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
even if we even if even if this doesn't
 
00:20:13.590 --> 00:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
get passed it helps start the discussion
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
and um I certainly appreciate uh the
 
00:20:18.909 --> 00:20:18.919 align:start position:0%
work the clerk's office and it are doing
 
00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
on so that was a very I'm glad I tuned
 
00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
in to see that presentation from the
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
clerk so that's um I I that's just what
 
00:20:28.149 --> 00:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
I have to say and supported the bills so
 
00:20:29.630 --> 00:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:31.549 --> 00:20:31.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative hgan uh does

00:20:36.909 --> 00:20:36.919 align:start position:0%
I assume sure why not are there any
 
00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:38.480 align:start position:0%
questions from anyone in the committee
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%

all of the people that have signed up uh

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%

hearing me today uh I'm the vice
 
00:21:23.029 --> 00:21:23.039 align:start position:0%
president for guns of New Hampshire and
 
00:21:25.710 --> 00:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
I'm here to speak in favor of the bill
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
um I I just want honorable Joe Hannah it
 
00:21:31.990 --> 00:21:32.000 align:start position:0%

yes thank you The Honorable whatever
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
that's fun admin I appreciate that um I
 
00:21:39.590 --> 00:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
I do have one question are there any
 
00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:42.520 align:start position:0%
amendments to this bill um that we don't
 
00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:45.039 align:start position:0%
know about so I'm just kidding
 
00:21:48.510 --> 00:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
so basically I I I do appreciate what
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
the clerk said about and I do like the
 
00:21:52.909 --> 00:21:52.919 align:start position:0%
new landing page that they're developing
 
00:21:54.669 --> 00:21:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh I do think it's very important that
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
the public be aware whether you're for
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
or against the bill to know what's
 
00:21:59.990 --> 00:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
coming and what people are talking about
 
00:22:01.789 --> 00:22:01.799 align:start position:0%
I've been at dozens of hearings where
 
00:22:03.549 --> 00:22:03.559 align:start position:0%
they're talking about an amendment and
 
00:22:05.070 --> 00:22:05.080 align:start position:0%
then I'm asked to speak on that bill and
 
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:06.880 align:start position:0%
I have no idea what they're talking
 
00:22:09.549 --> 00:22:09.559 align:start position:0%
about uh unless I'm actually there and
 
00:22:12.070 --> 00:22:12.080 align:start position:0%
have been given a copy of it uh someone
 
00:22:13.950 --> 00:22:13.960 align:start position:0%
spoke I forget who it was about uh you
 
00:22:15.990 --> 00:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
know the people that are the Insiders or
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
the people who know what's you know are
 
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:19.400 align:start position:0%
working on bills in the in the state
 
00:22:21.590 --> 00:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
house um I don't think it should just be
 
00:22:23.630 --> 00:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
limited to those individuals who are
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
either lobbyists or activists who show
 
00:22:27.190 --> 00:22:27.200 align:start position:0%
up at the capital I think everyone
 
00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
deserves to know what's coming down on
 
00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
the line uh I put in a bill back in 2016
 
00:22:35.430 --> 00:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
when I was a member House Bill 1465 just
 
00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
asking for roll calls to be put in uh
 
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
onto the website so when committee roll
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
calls were done any motions made would
 
00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
be posted and I I remember speaking to
 
00:22:46.390 --> 00:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
the clerk at the time and uh by the way
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
the bill was killed in committee your
 
00:22:51.269 --> 00:22:51.279 align:start position:0%
committee 7 to zero but uh I was told
 
00:22:53.549 --> 00:22:53.559 align:start position:0%
that it was uh something that was in the
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
works and and actually today we do have
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to go to the website and see
 
00:23:00.830 --> 00:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
what the roll calls are for the votes uh
 
00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
not all the specific motions but it is
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
there I think that uh as long as the the
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
clerk's office is developing a website
 
00:23:09.230 --> 00:23:09.240 align:start position:0%
that has everything that's uh completely
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
transparent to the public that happens
 
00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:13.799 align:start position:0%
in that in that honorable building um I
 
00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'd be content but I do think it's
 
00:23:18.029 --> 00:23:18.039 align:start position:0%
important to keep pushing forward and if
 
00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
if it takes legislation I I I appreciate
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:38.549 --> 00:23:38.559 align:start position:0%
honorable Joe no I'm I'm sorry I'll take
 
00:23:39.630 --> 00:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
questions yes I thought you were asking
 
00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:42.960 align:start position:0%

you um I think that concludes
 
00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:06.830 align:start position:0%
you um I think that concludes
the

00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.870 --> 00:24:09.880 align:start position:0%
testimony the very beginning you
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
asked do we can do
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
that um I just thought I would announce
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
that there are on this list that came
 
00:24:22.909 --> 00:24:22.919 align:start position:0%
through by 8 o'clock there were 50
 
00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:25.880 align:start position:0%
people in support I'm not going to read
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
them all um no one opposed and one
 
00:24:32.950 --> 00:24:32.960 align:start position:0%
person neutral which I think was the
 
00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.029 align:start position:0%
person neutral which I think was the
post

00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
post
 
00:24:39.389 --> 00:24:39.399 align:start position:0%

00:24:42.549 --> 00:24:42.559 align:start position:0%
now with that I'll close the hearing on
 
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:48.770 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman yes oh this is Betsy mckenny

says made public or presented to the
 
00:25:38.029 --> 00:25:38.039 align:start position:0%
policy committee I think you have to
 
00:25:42.389 --> 00:25:42.399 align:start position:0%
um take public out and I somebody has to
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
ask Paul about the floor amendments on
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
the well anyway now that I figured out
 
00:25:50.389 --> 00:25:50.399 align:start position:0%
how to ask a question I will at the
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:05.070 --> 00:26:05.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:12.630 --> 00:26:12.640 align:start position:0%

00:26:30.909 --> 00:26:30.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:34.360 align:start position:0%
so it is now 9:30 by our committee room
 
00:26:37.230 --> 00:26:37.240 align:start position:0%

00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
record my name is Ned Gordon I represent
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
Grafton County District
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
nine and more importantly for the last
 
00:27:16.269 --> 00:27:16.279 align:start position:0%
legislative session I served as chair of
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
the joint legislative Ethics
 
00:27:23.630 --> 00:27:23.640 align:start position:0%
Committee this bill House Bill 190 is
 
00:27:26.389 --> 00:27:26.399 align:start position:0%
relative to financial
 
00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
disclosures this bill uh was actually
 
00:27:32.310 --> 00:27:32.320 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 500 in the last session it
 
00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
passed the Senate came over to the house
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
and because of our circumstances was
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
never acted upon in the
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
house wasn't passed the bill is quite
 
00:27:46.389 --> 00:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
simple it deals with financial
 
00:27:49.789 --> 00:27:49.799 align:start position:0%
disclosure forms under the current law
 
00:27:51.950 --> 00:27:51.960 align:start position:0%
legislators are required to fill out a
 
00:27:54.909 --> 00:27:54.919 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure form every year
 
00:27:56.830 --> 00:27:56.840 align:start position:0%
they're required to fill it out by the
 
00:27:59.310 --> 00:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
third Friday in
 
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:02.640 align:start position:0%
January and then the forms are to be
 
00:28:04.509 --> 00:28:04.519 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the Legislative Ethics
 
00:28:07.310 --> 00:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
Committee and then sent over to the
 
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:09.240 align:start position:0%
Secretary of
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
State uh
 
00:28:15.630 --> 00:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
the the as and as legislators you all
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
know that you recently filled one
 
00:28:22.070 --> 00:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
out filling out the forms uh what we've
 
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:24.279 align:start position:0%
discovered is we fill it out in the
 
00:28:27.830 --> 00:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
first year of the session and generally
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
there's no need to fill it out in the
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
second year because people's
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
circumstances haven't changed but if
 
00:28:36.990 --> 00:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
their circumstances have changed they're
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
still required to fill out Declaration
 
00:28:42.909 --> 00:28:42.919 align:start position:0%
of intent forms if in fact they have a
 
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
conflict so there really is no
 
00:28:48.389 --> 00:28:48.399 align:start position:0%
requirement or should be no requirement
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
to fill out the financial disclosure
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
statement every
 
00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
year in
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
addition uh it's really a problem for
 
00:29:01.789 --> 00:29:01.799 align:start position:0%
the staff in that they end up having to
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
chase down 400 legislators every year to
 
00:29:06.750 --> 00:29:06.760 align:start position:0%
get those financial disclosure
 
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
statements and it's a it's a burden not
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
just on the coordinator Rick Lambert for
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
the Ethics Committee but it's a burden
 
00:29:19.590 --> 00:29:19.600 align:start position:0%
upon the staff uh for both the Senate
 
00:29:21.789 --> 00:29:21.799 align:start position:0%
and the house offices to chase down
 
00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:24.960 align:start position:0%
people it's just not an easy thing to do
 
00:29:28.990 --> 00:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
and uh it's takes a lot of time and
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's just wasted time in
 
00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.070 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it's just wasted time in
most

00:29:32.070 --> 00:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
most
 
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
cases so this bill basically says you
 
00:29:36.950 --> 00:29:36.960 align:start position:0%
need to fill out the financial
 
00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:38.470 align:start position:0%
need to fill out the financial
disclosure

00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
disclosure
 
00:29:42.190 --> 00:29:42.200 align:start position:0%
form on the first year after you elected
 
00:29:44.950 --> 00:29:44.960 align:start position:0%
to your first year of the term not have
 
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:47.720 align:start position:0%
to fill it out in the second year and
 
00:29:50.909 --> 00:29:50.919 align:start position:0%
that's as simple as it gets happy to
 
00:29:55.389 --> 00:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:58.990 --> 00:29:59.000 align:start position:0%
any I think you said you have would be
 
00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:01.960 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions yes I'd be
 
00:30:04.430 --> 00:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
more than happy to take questions uh
 
00:30:07.870 --> 00:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
does anyone in the committee room have
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
question seeing not anyone on Zoom I see
 
00:30:15.630 --> 00:30:15.640 align:start position:0%
one hand two hands
 
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
um looking a long way here I'm going to
 
00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
say it's representative Pia it's Pia you
 
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:27.320 align:start position:0%
no good try Mr chair um but thank you um
 
00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:29.240 align:start position:0%
my just question question is if
 
00:30:30.830 --> 00:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
circumstances were to change you know
 
00:30:33.110 --> 00:30:33.120 align:start position:0%
from one year to the next would they be
 
00:30:37.190 --> 00:30:37.200 align:start position:0%
required to file um you know an update I
 
00:30:39.509 --> 00:30:39.519 align:start position:0%
know that you know changing it from from
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
two years to one year but things change
 
00:30:43.990 --> 00:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
I know I've changed jobs within a year
 
00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
um would that be something that uh we as
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
legislators would have to
 
00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:52.320 align:start position:0%
do uh I don't I don't think that you
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
would have you could file an update but
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that you file an
 
00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:59.070 align:start position:0%
there's no requirement that you file an
update

00:30:59.070 --> 00:30:59.080 align:start position:0%
update
 
00:31:03.389 --> 00:31:03.399 align:start position:0%
but you if if in fact a conflict should
 
00:31:07.350 --> 00:31:07.360 align:start position:0%
exist or uh it develop in that two-year
 
00:31:10.629 --> 00:31:10.639 align:start position:0%
period of time you are still required to
 
00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
disclose that conflict and you're
 
00:31:16.070 --> 00:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
required to fill out a form which is
 
00:31:18.629 --> 00:31:18.639 align:start position:0%
called a declaration of intent form and
 
00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:22.200 align:start position:0%
disclose at the time or just before you
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
act on any legislation over which you
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:28.559 --> 00:31:30.430 align:start position:0%
 
follow

00:31:30.430 --> 00:31:30.440 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:31:34.950 --> 00:31:34.960 align:start position:0%
up no uh did I see representative Frost
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
with their hand well
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
no I think we're all set representative
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
Gord representative Richards
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you uh Mr chair and to
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
follow up um on the previous question
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
um it is there any intent or open to any
 
00:32:03.549 --> 00:32:03.559 align:start position:0%
potential amendment that in the change
 
00:32:08.750 --> 00:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
of this um that you do ask not only for
 
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:10.360 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of intent for the
 
00:32:13.950 --> 00:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest but if there is a
 
00:32:16.269 --> 00:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
change in the financial
 
00:32:18.710 --> 00:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
disclosure um
 
00:32:21.030 --> 00:32:21.040 align:start position:0%
that there is
 
00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:22.950 align:start position:0%
that there is
[Music]

00:32:22.950 --> 00:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:28.149 --> 00:32:28.159 align:start position:0%
a update process um so
 
00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
we file in the first year but are
 
00:32:34.750 --> 00:32:34.760 align:start position:0%
required to make an update process if
 
00:32:37.669 --> 00:32:37.679 align:start position:0%
there is a change not only about the
 
00:32:39.269 --> 00:32:39.279 align:start position:0%
conflict of interests but on the
 
00:32:39.279 --> 00:32:40.990 align:start position:0%
conflict of interests but on the
financial

00:32:40.990 --> 00:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:32:43.509 --> 00:32:43.519 align:start position:0%
disclosure just being very transparent
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
to our
 
00:32:47.950 --> 00:32:47.960 align:start position:0%
constituents uh you could you could
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
require that if you if you think
 
00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:54.190 align:start position:0%
require that if you if you think
that's

00:32:54.190 --> 00:32:54.200 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:56.110 align:start position:0%
that's
necessary

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.120 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:32:59.110 --> 00:32:59.120 align:start position:0%
um I guess if you had a change of
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
employment or you came into
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
some financial resources that you didn't
 
00:33:05.039 --> 00:33:06.669 align:start position:0%
some financial resources that you didn't
previously

00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
disos uh you could do that I I I can
 
00:33:13.990 --> 00:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
just tell you but I think the issue is
 
00:33:15.750 --> 00:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
the committee isn't going to be able to
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
monitor that the committee the Ethics
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
Committee basically acts when we're
 
00:33:25.269 --> 00:33:25.279 align:start position:0%
requested to act so if somebody files a
 
00:33:27.470 --> 00:33:27.480 align:start position:0%
complaint we act on a complaint if
 
00:33:30.190 --> 00:33:30.200 align:start position:0%
somebody asks us for an advisory opinion
 
00:33:32.909 --> 00:33:32.919 align:start position:0%
we act on the advisory
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
opinion uh we're required by law to
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
review the financial disclosures at the
 
00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
beginning of every year
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
currently uh but there would be no
 
00:33:45.990 --> 00:33:46.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for the Ethics Committee to
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
uh review updates and I'm not exactly
 
00:33:54.629 --> 00:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
have I I think it would have value if
 
00:33:59.710 --> 00:33:59.720 align:start position:0%
you weren't required to file the
 
00:34:02.870 --> 00:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
Declaration of intent form in any event
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
so if if you do end up having a conflict
 
00:34:10.550 --> 00:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
you would in fact have to disclose
 
00:34:14.470 --> 00:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
that Mr chair can I have a
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
followup follow
 
00:34:17.359 --> 00:34:19.750 align:start position:0%
followup follow
up

00:34:19.750 --> 00:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
up
 
00:34:23.629 --> 00:34:23.639 align:start position:0%
um to your example um I'm just thinking
 
00:34:25.510 --> 00:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
about a
 
00:34:29.030 --> 00:34:29.040 align:start position:0%
situation um and I'm not sure it would
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
matter but let's pretend that
 
00:34:37.230 --> 00:34:37.240 align:start position:0%
um uh I won the
 
00:34:41.669 --> 00:34:41.679 align:start position:0%
lottery um and in that
 
00:34:46.310 --> 00:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
instance um for the purposes of the
 
00:34:46.320 --> 00:34:47.510 align:start position:0%
instance um for the purposes of the
Ethics

00:34:47.510 --> 00:34:47.520 align:start position:0%
Ethics
 
00:34:50.470 --> 00:34:50.480 align:start position:0%
Committee um I would not necessarily
 
00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:52.760 align:start position:0%
have a conflict of
 
00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:54.389 align:start position:0%
have a conflict of
interest

00:34:54.389 --> 00:34:54.399 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:57.839 align:start position:0%
but would that I'm as I'm talking
 
00:34:59.870 --> 00:34:59.880 align:start position:0%
through it may or may not be important
 
00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
information since you're required you
 
00:35:04.470 --> 00:35:04.480 align:start position:0%
know financially would that be of
 
00:35:06.790 --> 00:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
interest to review with your requirement
 
00:35:10.069 --> 00:35:10.079 align:start position:0%
for a yearly review of those financial
 
00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
forms would that perhaps be an in a time
 
00:35:16.829 --> 00:35:16.839 align:start position:0%
in which it would be important to
 
00:35:20.790 --> 00:35:20.800 align:start position:0%
provide for this update
 
00:35:22.950 --> 00:35:22.960 align:start position:0%
process in your work in the Ethics
 
00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
Committee this is me as a new Committee
 
00:35:28.109 --> 00:35:28.119 align:start position:0%
Member kind of learning through this
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
process so I appreciate you um educating
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
me and taking this
 
00:35:37.950 --> 00:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
question well I guess we the the the way
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
you would look at thank you for your
 
00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:43.720 align:start position:0%
question the the way you'd look at it on
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
the current form you're required to
 
00:35:48.670 --> 00:35:48.680 align:start position:0%
disclose your sources of income over a
 
00:35:51.150 --> 00:35:51.160 align:start position:0%
certain limit over
 
00:35:56.589 --> 00:35:56.599 align:start position:0%
,000 so you would have to disclose that
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
question is would that in any way create
 
00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
any conflict for
 
00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:05.440 align:start position:0%
you um in the course of your conducting
 
00:36:09.470 --> 00:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
your business as a legislator and I'm
 
00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
not sure that would create a conflict
 
00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680 align:start position:0%
for you it's I think part of the reason
 
00:36:19.510 --> 00:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
for disclosing your sources of income is
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
you know if your source of income is
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
from a particular type of company that
 
00:36:28.150 --> 00:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
does a particular type of business and
 
00:36:30.390 --> 00:36:30.400 align:start position:0%
and then you act on legislation that
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
would directly impact that business or
 
00:36:37.589 --> 00:36:37.599 align:start position:0%
as we saw in the last in the in the last
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
session if if if you work for a union
 
00:36:43.430 --> 00:36:43.440 align:start position:0%
for example and then you acted on Union
 
00:36:46.430 --> 00:36:46.440 align:start position:0%
legislation um that would be important
 
00:36:48.990 --> 00:36:49.000 align:start position:0%
to disclose those things but simply
 
00:36:51.829 --> 00:36:51.839 align:start position:0%
winning the lottery I'm not sure how
 
00:36:55.109 --> 00:36:55.119 align:start position:0%
that would impact your duties as a
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
legisl other than the fact you might not
 
00:37:04.470 --> 00:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:09.520 align:start position:0%
anymore yes thank you for your testimony
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative Gordon I think you're all
 
00:37:15.109 --> 00:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
set thank you very much there's a hand
 
00:37:21.870 --> 00:37:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:24.470 --> 00:37:24.480 align:start position:0%
you represent
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
M thank you Mr chairman I think if you
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
look at line six it answers the
 
00:37:31.870 --> 00:37:31.880 align:start position:0%
questions it says if the legislator or
 
00:37:34.829 --> 00:37:34.839 align:start position:0%
officers Financial circumstances change
 
00:37:39.150 --> 00:37:39.160 align:start position:0%
here shall file a new Financial uh
 
00:37:41.270 --> 00:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
disclosure so I think that kind of
 
00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
covers what the last few questions have
 
00:37:48.150 --> 00:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
been about it it does um but I I have to
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
tell you that it's it's rare that we
 
00:37:56.069 --> 00:37:56.079 align:start position:0%
ever get a a a an amendment to a
 
00:38:00.349 --> 00:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:03.109 --> 00:38:03.119 align:start position:0%
out of sight out of
 
00:38:05.710 --> 00:38:05.720 align:start position:0%
mind I think I think people look at it
 
00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
as an obligation that they have at the
 
00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
beginning of their at the beginning of
 
00:38:11.829 --> 00:38:11.839 align:start position:0%
the year and generally they have to be
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
reminded of it but after that uh it's
 
00:38:17.190 --> 00:38:17.200 align:start position:0%
it's not something that's on the front
 
00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:18.560 align:start position:0%
of their
 
00:38:21.710 --> 00:38:21.720 align:start position:0%
minds anything else representative
 
00:38:30.109 --> 00:38:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%

for everybody to have to fill out their

00:39:31.150 --> 00:39:31.160 align:start position:0%

00:39:38.109 --> 00:39:38.119 align:start position:0%
requested by the Ethics Committee it is
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
a bill this committee had last year
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
passed the committee on guys fa pass the
 
00:39:46.069 --> 00:39:46.079 align:start position:0%
house on a Voice vote should have been
 
00:39:49.430 --> 00:39:49.440 align:start position:0%
on the Omnibus Bill but was slightly
 
00:39:51.670 --> 00:39:51.680 align:start position:0%
overlooked so we brought it back this
 
00:39:53.470 --> 00:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
year because we know that not only do
 
00:39:57.390 --> 00:39:57.400 align:start position:0%
legislators want it but uh staff really
 
00:39:59.630 --> 00:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
needs this it's really difficult for
 
00:40:02.630 --> 00:40:02.640 align:start position:0%
staff to keep chasing after
 
00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:04.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives who at the beginning of
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
each year are very very busy and we have
 
00:40:10.030 --> 00:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
to go after people and ask have you
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
filled out your disposure form would you
 
00:40:13.870 --> 00:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
please fill it out do you intend to fill
 
00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
it out and almost everybody's always
 
00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:19.720 align:start position:0%
very very Cooperative but um it just
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
takes a tremendous amount of time on
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
behalf of Rich Lambert who takes care of
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
all this who's the administrative um
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
Executive Admin administrator for the
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
Ethics Committee so this will not only
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
streamline our process but will also
 
00:40:35.950 --> 00:40:35.960 align:start position:0%
just be a convenience for everybody all
 
00:40:38.670 --> 00:40:38.680 align:start position:0%
the way around so I strongly support
 
00:40:41.150 --> 00:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
this and would only remind people that
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
if changes occur that you need to
 
00:40:45.670 --> 00:40:45.680 align:start position:0%
disclose during the year uh we'll
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
probably qu putting something in the
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
calendar or announcing on the floor of
 
00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:52.200 align:start position:0%
the house or Senate so that you can uh
 
00:40:54.030 --> 00:40:54.040 align:start position:0%
follow up if there have been changes in
 
00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
your life so thank you very
 
00:40:59.550 --> 00:40:59.560 align:start position:0%
much thank you representative wall any
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:41:07.589 --> 00:41:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
hands we're good to go thank you uh
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
there's anything else or else I will
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:27.430 --> 00:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
we've got uh 15 minutes or 14 minutes or
 
00:41:34.910 --> 00:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:37.829 --> 00:41:37.839 align:start position:0%
509 give you a few minutes for a refill
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
of your copy
 
00:41:44.069 --> 00:41:44.079 align:start position:0%
or or not thank
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
you and I would just remind committee
 
00:41:49.309 --> 00:41:49.319 align:start position:0%
members in the room that the unless you
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
mute the computer up by the big screen
 
00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:54.680 align:start position:0%
you're you're unmuted and if you would
 
00:41:56.589 --> 00:41:56.599 align:start position:0%
like to mute it during breaks that
 
00:41:58.309 --> 00:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
that's fine but somebody just needs to
 
00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:00.440 align:start position:0%
remember to unmute when you're ready to
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
resume so we have to go all the way up
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
there to to mute I can't unmute you from
 
00:42:09.790 --> 00:42:09.800 align:start position:0%
from up here messages because the tech
 
00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:12.480 align:start position:0%
person said we didn't have to so you
 
00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440 align:start position:0%
prefer that we go up to the chair and
 
00:42:18.030 --> 00:42:18.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.910 --> 00:42:20.920 align:start position:0%
to there the
 
00:42:23.990 --> 00:42:24.000 align:start position:0%
room I'm just reminding you that that
 
00:42:25.829 --> 00:42:25.839 align:start position:0%
whoever's in the audience can can hear
 
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:28.280 align:start position:0%
you and not that you would say anything
 
00:42:31.549 --> 00:42:31.559 align:start position:0%
inappropriate but just um it feels like
 
00:42:33.309 --> 00:42:33.319 align:start position:0%
you're alone sometimes when you're not
 
00:42:33.319 --> 00:42:34.230 align:start position:0%
you're alone sometimes when you're not
quite

00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
quite
 
00:42:51.069 --> 00:42:51.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.870 --> 00:42:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%

Madbury I'm presenting M Bill 509 today
 
00:57:17.230 --> 00:57:17.240 align:start position:0%
it's a bill
 
00:57:20.789 --> 00:57:20.799 align:start position:0%
that we had last
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
year on a Voice last year it passed the
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
house on a voice vot last here it was to
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
have been heard in the Senate but of
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
course uh March 13th came and went and
 
00:57:34.789 --> 00:57:34.799 align:start position:0%
everything changed uh this was then to
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
have been put on the omnus bill and it
 
00:57:38.870 --> 00:57:38.880 align:start position:0%
just didn't make it there because there
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
was so much else people were dealing
 
00:57:43.230 --> 00:57:43.240 align:start position:0%
with so we have agreed to sponsor it
 
00:57:46.910 --> 00:57:46.920 align:start position:0%
again this year this bill comes to us at
 
00:57:48.670 --> 00:57:48.680 align:start position:0%
the request of the joint historic
 
00:57:50.470 --> 00:57:50.480 align:start position:0%
committee which makes up members from
 
00:57:53.670 --> 00:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
the House and Senate this is an issue
 
00:57:55.510 --> 00:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
that has been on our minds and we've
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
tried to deal with for many many years
 
00:58:00.270 --> 00:58:00.280 align:start position:0%
and we've decided it's finally time that
 
00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:02.680 align:start position:0%
we file a bill to see if we can
 
00:58:05.230 --> 00:58:05.240 align:start position:0%
straighten out and clarify are the
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for placement as you
 
00:58:09.349 --> 00:58:09.359 align:start position:0%
can see in the analysis of the portraits
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
Flags bus statues or other Memorial
 
00:58:14.990 --> 00:58:15.000 align:start position:0%
objects within or on the State
 
00:58:17.549 --> 00:58:17.559 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Building of Walker
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
house grounds inside or out um this is a
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
bill that's needed because as space
 
00:58:27.510 --> 00:58:27.520 align:start position:0%
declines in this area we're finding it
 
00:58:30.069 --> 00:58:30.079 align:start position:0%
harder and harder to know where to place
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
objects of importance so what this bill
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
says if you look at your bill on the
 
00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:38.920 align:start position:0%
back side the changes that are made are
 
00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:40.960 align:start position:0%
on the areas that are defined more
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
clearly as to where we can place our
 
00:58:46.589 --> 00:58:46.599 align:start position:0%
objects now uh it has always been that
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
the committee has no say over what
 
00:58:51.630 --> 00:58:51.640 align:start position:0%
happens on the second floor of the state
 
00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
house that is the governor's territory
 
00:58:56.349 --> 00:58:56.359 align:start position:0%
we can deal with the first floor in the
 
00:58:58.870 --> 00:58:58.880 align:start position:0%
third floors but we cannot deal with the
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
second floor at all so as portraits come
 
00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:05.280 align:start position:0%
in um space is getting limited that's
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
something we're going to have to deal
 
00:59:09.870 --> 00:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
with over time um there was concern
 
00:59:12.190 --> 00:59:12.200 align:start position:0%
about where objects are placed as well
 
00:59:15.309 --> 00:59:15.319 align:start position:0%
as portraits right here in the
 
00:59:18.670 --> 00:59:18.680 align:start position:0%
lob um we had a portrait that was given
 
00:59:21.710 --> 00:59:21.720 align:start position:0%
to us last year for former Speaker of
 
00:59:23.589 --> 00:59:23.599 align:start position:0%
the House George Roberts who made it
 
00:59:26.390 --> 00:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
possible for us to have this legisl
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
office building and the portrait hangs
 
00:59:31.870 --> 00:59:31.880 align:start position:0%
downstairs now right next to the desk
 
00:59:34.510 --> 00:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
where we all come in uh there was a
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
concern as exactly whether that was the
 
00:59:39.950 --> 00:59:39.960 align:start position:0%
right spot for it or not it may seem
 
00:59:42.630 --> 00:59:42.640 align:start position:0%
like a minor issue but it becomes a big
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
issue over time once again and space
 
00:59:47.349 --> 00:59:47.359 align:start position:0%
becomes more limited so it's a very
 
00:59:49.549 --> 00:59:49.559 align:start position:0%
simple bill it's just a bill to
 
00:59:52.470 --> 00:59:52.480 align:start position:0%
clarify uh where we place these objects
 
00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
and who has
 
00:59:58.190 --> 00:59:58.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh it used to be that the
 
01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:00.880 align:start position:0%
then former director now passed away of
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
The Visitor Center would Place portraits
 
01:00:06.510 --> 01:00:06.520 align:start position:0%
or objects in even the state house where
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
he thought they might look good and well
 
01:00:11.270 --> 01:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't work that way now the law
 
01:00:13.270 --> 01:00:13.280 align:start position:0%
states said we have to confer with the
 
01:00:16.109 --> 01:00:16.119 align:start position:0%
committee so again this is a simple Bill
 
01:00:18.510 --> 01:00:18.520 align:start position:0%
simply clarifying who has the
 
01:00:21.510 --> 01:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
responsibilities what those are and
 
01:00:23.990 --> 01:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
again it's long overd two it passed the
 
01:00:25.750 --> 01:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
committee on a Voice vote the house on a
 
01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:26.630 align:start position:0%
committee on a Voice vote the house on a
voice

01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
voice
 
01:00:28.990 --> 01:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
and we anticipated at wiast the Senate
 
01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:31.359 align:start position:0%
as well um my name's the only one on it
 
01:00:33.190 --> 01:00:33.200 align:start position:0%
this year because even though there were
 
01:00:34.950 --> 01:00:34.960 align:start position:0%
others on it they simply didn't get
 
01:00:37.029 --> 01:00:37.039 align:start position:0%
around to it this yearo they former
 
01:00:38.789 --> 01:00:38.799 align:start position:0%
sponsors whom I can't recall now were
 
01:00:42.150 --> 01:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
all in favor thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:00:44.789 --> 01:00:44.799 align:start position:0%
you uh are there any questions I assume
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
you will take questions if there are any
 
01:00:48.990 --> 01:00:49.000 align:start position:0%
from the committee members anyone on
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
Zoom or on Telephone have
 
01:00:56.029 --> 01:00:56.039 align:start position:0%
questions representative R thank you Mr
 
01:00:58.950 --> 01:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
here U thank you very much wall for
 
01:01:01.029 --> 01:01:01.039 align:start position:0%
presenting this bill the question I have
 
01:01:03.309 --> 01:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
is on paragraph two which is the new
 
01:01:07.670 --> 01:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph added and um although we're
 
01:01:10.870 --> 01:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
talking about uh the state house and
 
01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
Legislative Office Buildings um the
 
01:01:16.870 --> 01:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
state house has all of those
 
01:01:21.029 --> 01:01:21.039 align:start position:0%
flags if does that change the movement
 
01:01:23.950 --> 01:01:23.960 align:start position:0%
of how those flags can and should be
 
01:01:26.910 --> 01:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
moved from what's currently
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
place um for a while thank you very much
 
01:01:31.870 --> 01:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
for your question there was a
 
01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:33.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at one point regarding the
 
01:01:37.150 --> 01:01:37.160 align:start position:0%
flag and we have talked for a long time
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
as to what to do regard those flights
 
01:01:41.109 --> 01:01:41.119 align:start position:0%
there are people from the outside
 
01:01:44.470 --> 01:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
veterans who want very much to take
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
those flags remove them and put up um
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
ref this of them U we're not going to do
 
01:01:52.870 --> 01:01:52.880 align:start position:0%
that this does have this committee does
 
01:01:56.510 --> 01:01:56.520 align:start position:0%
directly have the decision making on the
 
01:01:59.349 --> 01:01:59.359 align:start position:0%
flags and what happens with them there
 
01:02:01.390 --> 01:02:01.400 align:start position:0%
was a flag committee I said at one point
 
01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:03.720 align:start position:0%
but we no longer have
 
01:02:07.190 --> 01:02:07.200 align:start position:0%
that follow up follow up thank you uh so
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
my question is if this bill
 
01:02:12.549 --> 01:02:12.559 align:start position:0%
passes how
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
does whether or not the flags that are
 
01:02:17.710 --> 01:02:17.720 align:start position:0%
there now how does that affect whether
 
01:02:21.190 --> 01:02:21.200 align:start position:0%
they're moved or not moved this doesn't
 
01:02:22.430 --> 01:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
change anything the same
 
01:02:24.789 --> 01:02:24.799 align:start position:0%
responsibilities for the same group of
 
01:02:27.710 --> 01:02:27.720 align:start position:0%
people and they will when the turn comes
 
01:02:30.910 --> 01:02:30.920 align:start position:0%
there is work going on with
 
01:02:33.950 --> 01:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
conservatives cons will be called in for
 
01:02:36.069 --> 01:02:36.079 align:start position:0%
reference as to how we can best deal
 
01:02:38.510 --> 01:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
with the textiles that are there some
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
people claim that the flags are falling
 
01:02:43.829 --> 01:02:43.839 align:start position:0%
apart uh that the deteriorating bage
 
01:02:46.309 --> 01:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
there is no proof of that whatsoever one
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
of the flag cases was open in this past
 
01:02:50.750 --> 01:02:50.760 align:start position:0%
year and determined that nothing is
 
01:02:53.510 --> 01:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
crumbling nothing is falling down this
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
uh cases actually are hermetically
 
01:02:55.400 --> 01:02:56.910 align:start position:0%
uh cases actually are hermetically
sealed

01:02:56.910 --> 01:02:56.920 align:start position:0%
sealed
 
01:02:59.670 --> 01:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
and um so nothing is going to change
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
there unless there is another
 
01:03:04.269 --> 01:03:04.279 align:start position:0%
subcommittee at some point set up and
 
01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:06.680 align:start position:0%
funds are available right now nobody is
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
going to do anything with the fls
 
01:03:11.950 --> 01:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
because all es com forward say cost an
 
01:03:14.670 --> 01:03:14.680 align:start position:0%
excess of million doll we don't
 
01:03:17.470 --> 01:03:17.480 align:start position:0%

idea um he he did say even though as a
 
01:04:48.750 --> 01:04:48.760 align:start position:0%
elected official he was representing
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
himself in this so um that's all I can
 
01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.710 align:start position:0%
himself in this so um that's all I can

01:05:00.950 --> 01:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
no one else to talk
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
to on Zoom or by telephone so I will
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on post Bill 509 our
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
next bill is
 
01:05:15.710 --> 01:05:15.720 align:start position:0%
558 at 10:30 so you've got 20 minutes
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
this is not an easy thing to schedule I
 
01:05:21.069 --> 01:05:21.079 align:start position:0%
gotta tell you
 
01:05:27.150 --> 01:05:27.160 align:start position:0%
um you're on your own till uh 10:30 for
 
01:05:31.029 --> 01:05:31.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:33.750 --> 01:05:33.760 align:start position:0%
558 if I may say Mr chairman I just want
 
01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
to thank you for um scheduling uh a
 
01:05:39.309 --> 01:05:39.319 align:start position:0%
large number of these bills on the same
 
01:05:41.190 --> 01:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
day you know sometimes it's been
 
01:05:42.990 --> 01:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
difficult in the past when we've had
 
01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:45.160 align:start position:0%
hearing days with only one or two bills
 
01:05:47.230 --> 01:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
spread out you know over months and
 
01:05:50.430 --> 01:05:50.440 align:start position:0%
months this is a lot easier I think on a
 
01:05:52.710 --> 01:05:52.720 align:start position:0%
lot of our schedules and uh it is
 
01:05:54.349 --> 01:05:54.359 align:start position:0%
difficult uh for for the chair to
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
predict how long these hearings are
 
01:05:57.750 --> 01:05:57.760 align:start position:0%
going to be U but I I'd just like to
 
01:05:59.230 --> 01:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for putting these all on the
 
01:06:03.430 --> 01:06:03.440 align:start position:0%
same day oh thank you for um I will tell
 
01:06:06.789 --> 01:06:06.799 align:start position:0%
you it a lot of it isn't my fault though
 
01:06:09.670 --> 01:06:09.680 align:start position:0%
um a lot of it is because uh the
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
committee was not assigned any
 
01:06:17.950 --> 01:06:17.960 align:start position:0%
um early bills so we kind of uh were put
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
in the position of of um getting the
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
room when it's available for our bills
 
01:06:26.150 --> 01:06:26.160 align:start position:0%
so it just seemed logical to
 
01:06:28.510 --> 01:06:28.520 align:start position:0%
to put as many as we could here and and
 
01:06:31.190 --> 01:06:31.200 align:start position:0%
the fact is that we're all in this
 
01:06:33.870 --> 01:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
little learning curve for doing things
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
differently than we used to and uh and
 
01:06:39.150 --> 01:06:39.160 align:start position:0%
so it's uh it seemed to make sense to
 
01:06:42.349 --> 01:06:42.359 align:start position:0%
put these bills first so that we get our
 
01:06:45.549 --> 01:06:45.559 align:start position:0%
feet under us uh before we get going on
 
01:06:49.150 --> 01:06:49.160 align:start position:0%
on Monday with uh with probably our
 
01:06:53.789 --> 01:06:53.799 align:start position:0%
busier day so but thank you for saying
 
01:06:57.549 --> 01:06:57.559 align:start position:0%
so I'd like to offer a hearty second on
 
01:07:01.109 --> 01:07:01.119 align:start position:0%
that thank you

11 months the covid-19 pandemic has
 
01:27:19.990 --> 01:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
challenged the legislature like every

other workplace around the world to
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
adapt its business processes to keep its

New Hampshire state house both Chambers

Information Technology including video
 
01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
conferencing for public hearings and
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
committee work which removed barriers
 
01:27:40.590 --> 01:27:40.600 align:start position:0%
and increased access for many members of
 
01:27:42.830 --> 01:27:42.840 align:start position:0%
the public who might otherwise face
 
01:27:46.030 --> 01:27:46.040 align:start position:0%
barriers in order to participate in our
 
01:27:48.390 --> 01:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
democracy as many of my colleagues know
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
from personal experience driving to the
 
01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
state house in conquered can involve
 
01:27:55.109 --> 01:27:55.119 align:start position:0%
upwards of three hours roundtrip which
 
01:27:57.790 --> 01:27:57.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't even consider hurdles like uh
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
taking time off from work and or making
 
01:28:02.189 --> 01:28:02.199 align:start position:0%
arrangements for child care in
 
01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:04.760 align:start position:0%
particular the opportunity for our
 
01:28:06.590 --> 01:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
constituents to provide virtual
 
01:28:08.830 --> 01:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
testimony has leveled the playing field
 
01:28:10.470 --> 01:28:10.480 align:start position:0%
for many of our neighbors who serve as
 
01:28:13.109 --> 01:28:13.119 align:start position:0%
primary caregivers who work Monday
 
01:28:15.750 --> 01:28:15.760 align:start position:0%
through Friday 9:00 am to 5:00 P PM
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
Andor reside in our state's more Rural
 
01:28:19.950 --> 01:28:19.960 align:start position:0%
and remote
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
communities uh as proposed in House Bill
 
01:28:25.990 --> 01:28:26.000 align:start position:0%
558 a committee to review and study the
 
01:28:27.990 --> 01:28:28.000 align:start position:0%
use of Information Technology in public
 
01:28:30.950 --> 01:28:30.960 align:start position:0%
hearings and committee meetings uh would
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
also develop a training needs assessment
 
01:28:36.149 --> 01:28:36.159 align:start position:0%
for legislators and staff to effectively
 
01:28:38.669 --> 01:28:38.679 align:start position:0%
utilize commercial It software for
 
01:28:41.310 --> 01:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
legislative work uh it would evaluate
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
the technical Staffing and logistical
 
01:28:45.350 --> 01:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
needs to continue the use of video
 
01:28:47.470 --> 01:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
conferencing it would determine
 
01:28:49.669 --> 01:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
administrative costs to sustain the use
 
01:28:52.470 --> 01:28:52.480 align:start position:0%
of video conferencing uh it would review
 
01:28:54.790 --> 01:28:54.800 align:start position:0%
House and Senate rules to ident identify
 
01:28:57.629 --> 01:28:57.639 align:start position:0%
which uses of it are currently permitted
 
01:29:00.510 --> 01:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
and what changes might be required uh to
 
01:29:02.430 --> 01:29:02.440 align:start position:0%
further authorize the use of video
 
01:29:04.470 --> 01:29:04.480 align:start position:0%
conferencing for public hearings Andor
 
01:29:07.030 --> 01:29:07.040 align:start position:0%
committee work uh and it would research
 
01:29:09.550 --> 01:29:09.560 align:start position:0%
other states counties and municipalities
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
authorization and use of it uh in the
 
01:29:15.510 --> 01:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
lawmaking process uh so I'd urge my
 
01:29:18.790 --> 01:29:18.800 align:start position:0%
colleagues to send House Bill 558 to the
 
01:29:21.149 --> 01:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
house uh with a unanimous recommendation
 
01:29:22.950 --> 01:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
of a to pass so that we can take time
 
01:29:26.189 --> 01:29:26.199 align:start position:0%
this summer uh perhaps even over Zoom to
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
consider the strengths challenges and
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
opportunities for our colleagues staff
 
01:29:32.470 --> 01:29:32.480 align:start position:0%

01:30:25.149 --> 01:30:25.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General court is that correct
 
01:30:25.159 --> 01:30:25.950 align:start position:0%
Hampshire General court is that correct
that's

01:30:25.950 --> 01:30:25.960 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:30:30.030 --> 01:30:30.040 align:start position:0%
correct okay so I was wondering then on
 
01:30:33.590 --> 01:30:33.600 align:start position:0%
um I think it's letter D this is uh part
 
01:30:37.709 --> 01:30:37.719 align:start position:0%
four Roman numeral 4 uh
 
01:30:40.990 --> 01:30:41.000 align:start position:0%
D um explore any technical Staffing and
 
01:30:43.629 --> 01:30:43.639 align:start position:0%
logistical needs and costs facing local
 
01:30:45.629 --> 01:30:45.639 align:start position:0%
communities to access meetings and
 
01:30:47.950 --> 01:30:47.960 align:start position:0%
hearings so is this just to have them
 
01:30:49.550 --> 01:30:49.560 align:start position:0%
access meetings and hearings of the
 
01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:51.310 align:start position:0%
access meetings and hearings of the
general

01:30:51.310 --> 01:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:30:54.709 --> 01:30:54.719 align:start position:0%
court yes yes it is and I I think the
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
the thought there if I may is
 
01:31:01.510 --> 01:31:01.520 align:start position:0%
to uh think about how uh rural
 
01:31:03.669 --> 01:31:03.679 align:start position:0%
communities that may not have ready
 
01:31:07.030 --> 01:31:07.040 align:start position:0%
readily available uh broadb Broadband
 
01:31:09.229 --> 01:31:09.239 align:start position:0%
access uh that we might be able to
 
01:31:12.229 --> 01:31:12.239 align:start position:0%
partner with say a community college uh
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
that does have that infrastructure so
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
that members of that Community can
 
01:31:19.229 --> 01:31:19.239 align:start position:0%
testify uh Mr chairman followup
 
01:31:22.350 --> 01:31:22.360 align:start position:0%
absolutely followup thank you um I might
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
suggest you just sort of specif ify um
 
01:31:28.790 --> 01:31:28.800 align:start position:0%
to access meetings and of of and
 
01:31:31.270 --> 01:31:31.280 align:start position:0%
hearings of the general court that's all
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
um there might just be a a sensible
 
01:31:35.990 --> 01:31:36.000 align:start position:0%
change um the other qu the other
 
01:31:38.030 --> 01:31:38.040 align:start position:0%
question that I have is on part five
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five letter
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
f um what would be other remote areas of
 
01:31:44.639 --> 01:31:45.430 align:start position:0%
f um what would be other remote areas of
New

01:31:45.430 --> 01:31:45.440 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm in ringe right now is that
 
01:31:50.189 --> 01:31:50.199 align:start position:0%
a remote area I live in Jaffrey is that
 
01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
a remote area um I mean I I Rec all the
 
01:31:57.350 --> 01:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
Genesis of this uh and so I understand
 
01:32:01.030 --> 01:32:01.040 align:start position:0%
the the mention of Coos County um but
 
01:32:03.229 --> 01:32:03.239 align:start position:0%
why make specific mention of one County
 
01:32:05.149 --> 01:32:05.159 align:start position:0%
and then just sort of leave it vague as
 
01:32:07.390 --> 01:32:07.400 align:start position:0%
to other what other areas might be
 
01:32:09.390 --> 01:32:09.400 align:start position:0%
considered remote yeah thank you
 
01:32:11.189 --> 01:32:11.199 align:start position:0%
representative for the question I I do
 
01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:13.040 align:start position:0%
think it has to do with the origins of
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
this bill and I think we could we could
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
easily strike Coos as not to pull out a
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
specific County but I think it was
 
01:32:23.109 --> 01:32:23.119 align:start position:0%
really used as an example of of uh you
 
01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:24.960 align:start position:0%
know again the the origins of the bill
 
01:32:27.270 --> 01:32:27.280 align:start position:0%
but also to to provide an example so
 
01:32:29.350 --> 01:32:29.360 align:start position:0%
people really understand there there's
 
01:32:32.229 --> 01:32:32.239 align:start position:0%
some some people that have a lot harder
 
01:32:34.149 --> 01:32:34.159 align:start position:0%
of a time getting to conquered than
 
01:32:38.750 --> 01:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
others right understood thank you thank
 
01:32:42.629 --> 01:32:42.639 align:start position:0%
you any other questions from uh yes I
 
01:32:57.709 --> 01:32:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:16.950 --> 01:33:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:20.189 --> 01:33:20.199 align:start position:0%
mute don't see him showing anymore on
 
01:33:29.229 --> 01:33:29.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:34.590 --> 01:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:38.830 --> 01:33:38.840 align:start position:0%

01:33:40.990 --> 01:33:41.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I had a question but then I I put
 
01:33:44.430 --> 01:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
my hand out that's my fault um but I I
 
01:33:45.790 --> 01:33:45.800 align:start position:0%
actually I do can I ask can I ask
 
01:33:47.790 --> 01:33:47.800 align:start position:0%
something Mr chair
 
01:33:51.030 --> 01:33:51.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely um so I have one of my
 
01:33:54.229 --> 01:33:54.239 align:start position:0%
questions for for Matt a representative
 
01:33:58.510 --> 01:33:58.520 align:start position:0%
is how like do you know how much you
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
know how much participation has grown
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
amongst folks um like different groups
 
01:34:06.669 --> 01:34:06.679 align:start position:0%
um and their experiences like has it
 
01:34:07.990 --> 01:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
been has it been a good experience for
 
01:34:10.229 --> 01:34:10.239 align:start position:0%
folks especially who are uh who are
 
01:34:12.990 --> 01:34:13.000 align:start position:0%
coming in this uh using using
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
Zoom uh I thank the representative for
 
01:34:19.310 --> 01:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
the question I think this is uh a really
 
01:34:21.629 --> 01:34:21.639 align:start position:0%
great question that the committee should
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
get into I have heard anecdotal
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
uh you feedback that uh people have had
 
01:34:32.590 --> 01:34:32.600 align:start position:0%
access to the legislative process in a
 
01:34:35.390 --> 01:34:35.400 align:start position:0%
way that they hadn't in previous
 
01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:38.440 align:start position:0%
previous sessions so um you know I think
 
01:34:40.590 --> 01:34:40.600 align:start position:0%
to put some data to that could be really
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
helpful and and you know makes a lot of
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
sense for this study committee to dig
 
01:34:45.760 --> 01:34:48.350 align:start position:0%
sense for this study committee to dig
into

01:34:48.350 --> 01:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:34:52.709 --> 01:34:52.719 align:start position:0%
followup no anyone else on Zoom or on
 
01:34:56.750 --> 01:34:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.149 --> 01:35:00.159 align:start position:0%

State
 
01:35:22.830 --> 01:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
Library thank you representative for the
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
question my EXP experience uh chairing a
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
commission a study commission uh last
 
01:35:31.709 --> 01:35:31.719 align:start position:0%
year uh was that that was standard
 
01:35:33.550 --> 01:35:33.560 align:start position:0%
protocol for all study committees and
 
01:35:35.430 --> 01:35:35.440 align:start position:0%
commissions that get archived in the
 
01:35:35.440 --> 01:35:36.470 align:start position:0%
commissions that get archived in the
State

01:35:36.470 --> 01:35:36.480 align:start position:0%
State
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:43.430 --> 01:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
that question Mr
 
01:35:47.030 --> 01:35:47.040 align:start position:0%

01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
Smith yeah uh thank you um
 
01:35:52.629 --> 01:35:52.639 align:start position:0%
representative Wilhelm um would you
 
01:35:57.790 --> 01:35:57.800 align:start position:0%
agree and a very general sense um that
 
01:36:01.390 --> 01:36:01.400 align:start position:0%
more easier public participation in the
 
01:36:03.629 --> 01:36:03.639 align:start position:0%
legislative process is generally a good
 
01:36:06.350 --> 01:36:06.360 align:start position:0%
thing and something we should seek to
 
01:36:10.030 --> 01:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
encourage and explore ways to
 
01:36:12.990 --> 01:36:13.000 align:start position:0%
enable uh thank you representative for
 
01:36:18.550 --> 01:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
the question uh my answer is yes and
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
that I think that the New Hampshire
 
01:36:26.709 --> 01:36:26.719 align:start position:0%
constitution in outlining a 400 member
 
01:36:28.590 --> 01:36:28.600 align:start position:0%
uh House of
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh with you know the
 
01:36:35.550 --> 01:36:35.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for legislators to introduce
 
01:36:37.950 --> 01:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
bills for every Bill to get a hearing
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
for every uh Bill to get a vote in
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
committee and for every Bill to get a
 
01:36:45.870 --> 01:36:45.880 align:start position:0%
vote on the floor um you know as is the
 
01:36:50.030 --> 01:36:50.040 align:start position:0%
tradition of the house is uh very much
 
01:36:53.030 --> 01:36:53.040 align:start position:0%
in line with a transparent open process
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
that wants all voices to be heard and I
 
01:36:58.350 --> 01:36:58.360 align:start position:0%
think uh you know we've stumbled here
 
01:37:02.790 --> 01:37:02.800 align:start position:0%
into uh you know an opportunity uh to
 
01:37:04.109 --> 01:37:04.119 align:start position:0%
engage more people and I think
 
01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
ultimately that's a really good thing
 
01:37:06.270 --> 01:37:06.280 align:start position:0%
for our
 
01:37:08.189 --> 01:37:08.199 align:start position:0%

01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
constituents that are in um Departments
 
01:37:41.270 --> 01:37:41.280 align:start position:0%
of the state um is that something that
 
01:37:43.629 --> 01:37:43.639 align:start position:0%
we could be sure that the study
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
commission um surveys or provides data
 
01:37:51.790 --> 01:37:51.800 align:start position:0%
um to this process on their experience
 
01:37:54.310 --> 01:37:54.320 align:start position:0%
um with our
 
01:37:59.109 --> 01:37:59.119 align:start position:0%
um year of pilot programming with these
 
01:38:03.669 --> 01:38:03.679 align:start position:0%
um uh Zoom hearings I've heard as we've
 
01:38:06.229 --> 01:38:06.239 align:start position:0%
just all mentioned anecdotally but these
 
01:38:08.229 --> 01:38:08.239 align:start position:0%
were in particular two folks one from
 
01:38:10.350 --> 01:38:10.360 align:start position:0%
fishing game who's a constituent of mine

thank you very much for the question
 
01:38:28.109 --> 01:38:28.119 align:start position:0%

absolutely hear from executive
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%

01:38:37.750 --> 01:38:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh this this pilot as you put it which I
 
01:38:40.270 --> 01:38:40.280 align:start position:0%
think is a great way to describe it um
 
01:38:42.550 --> 01:38:42.560 align:start position:0%
and I think we would welcome uh you know
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%

issue sorry about that Mr chairman and
 
01:40:45.830 --> 01:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I was actually
 
01:40:48.950 --> 01:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
um I was sorting out voting devices for
 
01:40:51.310 --> 01:40:51.320 align:start position:0%
our session uh that's coming up later
 
01:40:53.390 --> 01:40:53.400 align:start position:0%
this week and um because we're doing
 
01:40:55.149 --> 01:40:55.159 align:start position:0%
separate entrances I have to go through
 
01:40:57.790 --> 01:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
and um separate them by party and then
 
01:41:00.310 --> 01:41:00.320 align:start position:0%
Alpha and I I apologize I got a little
 
01:41:03.629 --> 01:41:03.639 align:start position:0%
hung up on that um the uh uh the bill
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
before you um I just wanted to to throw
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
out there um that uh uh as you all know
 
01:41:11.790 --> 01:41:11.800 align:start position:0%
many of the practices that we have put
 
01:41:14.390 --> 01:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
in place for the pandemic um we have
 
01:41:17.310 --> 01:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
done um initially last year we we
 
01:41:18.790 --> 01:41:18.800 align:start position:0%
adopted some of those things because of
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
the emergency order uh when speak when
 
01:41:23.950 --> 01:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
speaker schliff um made his uh
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
declaration uh regarding the rules for
 
01:41:29.790 --> 01:41:29.800 align:start position:0%
remote testimony that um was a a an
 
01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
interpretation based on um the the
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
allowance of uh RSA 91a having been
 
01:41:39.950 --> 01:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
relaxed through the emergency order um
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
as you know for this session we have
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
actually adopted a rule um that permits
 
01:41:47.550 --> 01:41:47.560 align:start position:0%
it um so I the the only point I'm trying
 
01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
to make here is that uh um we know that
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
rules are what governs how we operate
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
um and uh you're certainly welcome to to
 
01:42:00.550 --> 01:42:00.560 align:start position:0%
study um various aspects of of how we
 
01:42:03.189 --> 01:42:03.199 align:start position:0%
operate and those sorts of things but uh
 
01:42:05.070 --> 01:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
we know that in order to make things
 
01:42:07.910 --> 01:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
happen uh rules govern how we work uh
 
01:42:09.629 --> 01:42:09.639 align:start position:0%
and that's basically all I just wanted
 
01:42:12.310 --> 01:42:12.320 align:start position:0%
to say again Paul Smith house clerk uh
 
01:42:14.629 --> 01:42:14.639 align:start position:0%
neither in favor nor opposed to the
 
01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
legislation just just throwing that out
 
01:42:17.950 --> 01:42:17.960 align:start position:0%
there that of course I'm a resource to
 
01:42:20.270 --> 01:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
you all the time as my good friend the
 
01:42:22.830 --> 01:42:22.840 align:start position:0%
member from Manchester knows uh who's uh
 
01:42:22.840 --> 01:42:23.669 align:start position:0%
member from Manchester knows uh who's uh
pushed

01:42:23.669 --> 01:42:23.679 align:start position:0%
pushed
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
um his rules Amendment a couple of
 
01:42:27.550 --> 01:42:27.560 align:start position:0%
different sessions in a row um I was
 
01:42:29.390 --> 01:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
very happy to work with him in drafting
 
01:42:30.669 --> 01:42:30.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm always happy to work with
 
01:42:33.910 --> 01:42:33.920 align:start position:0%
members uh on rules that's always been
 
01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh something irrespective of of party
 
01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
who who's in control what not that
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't change so uh rules are are are
 
01:42:42.870 --> 01:42:42.880 align:start position:0%
my focus and what I what I work with you
 
01:42:46.310 --> 01:42:46.320 align:start position:0%

01:42:53.950 --> 01:42:53.960 align:start position:0%
so anyone in the you questions I'm
 
01:42:56.550 --> 01:42:56.560 align:start position:0%
assuming Mr Clerk of course Mr chairman
 
01:42:58.390 --> 01:42:58.400 align:start position:0%
always happy to take
 
01:42:58.400 --> 01:43:00.790 align:start position:0%
always happy to take
questions

01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:43:03.430 --> 01:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
anyone on
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
Zoom I see a hand up representative
 
01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:09.760 align:start position:0%
Frost yes thank you Mr chair um Mr clerk
 
01:43:13.470 --> 01:43:13.480 align:start position:0%
if a rule is adopted as it is now that
 
01:43:15.950 --> 01:43:15.960 align:start position:0%
we can meet remotely and the public can
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
testify remotely um if isn't that
 
01:43:24.030 --> 01:43:24.040 align:start position:0%
subject to the whim of the
 
01:43:27.109 --> 01:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
the next legislature say I mean h how
 
01:43:29.790 --> 01:43:29.800 align:start position:0%
easy is it for a rule to be rescinded to
 
01:43:32.550 --> 01:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
take a a access
 
01:43:35.310 --> 01:43:35.320 align:start position:0%
away that's that's a very good question
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
um I am am always the first person to
 
01:43:40.149 --> 01:43:40.159 align:start position:0%
tell somebody that once you ring a bell
 
01:43:43.430 --> 01:43:43.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard to unring it um so I mean
 
01:43:45.589 --> 01:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's sort of my my professional
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
opinion to folks uh that being said I
 
01:43:50.629 --> 01:43:50.639 align:start position:0%
would note that the the rules Provisions
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh that we adopted this year uh to allow
 
01:43:55.270 --> 01:43:55.280 align:start position:0%
for the meetings as we currently have
 
01:43:59.790 --> 01:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
them um are are actually temporary rules
 
01:44:03.510 --> 01:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
anyway um the the the Proviso at the
 
01:44:06.270 --> 01:44:06.280 align:start position:0%
beginning of of house rule 67 stipulates
 
01:44:08.510 --> 01:44:08.520 align:start position:0%
that uh at the conclusion of the state
 
01:44:11.430 --> 01:44:11.440 align:start position:0%
of the mer emergency um that this rule
 
01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
that does allow for this basically
 
01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:16.760 align:start position:0%
self-terminates um so we would be sort
 
01:44:21.070 --> 01:44:21.080 align:start position:0%
of back to the process uh as we know it
 
01:44:24.550 --> 01:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
knew it before um but again as I
 
01:44:28.229 --> 01:44:28.239 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh how how we do change the
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
actual processes are through rules so if
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
you all wanted to uh make this a
 
01:44:35.589 --> 01:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
permanent structure uh that would be
 
01:44:37.109 --> 01:44:37.119 align:start position:0%
something we would do through rules I
 
01:44:40.950 --> 01:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
would also note um that uh we do have uh
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
in this instance uh the this year
 
01:44:45.229 --> 01:44:45.239 align:start position:0%
because of of the extraordinary
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances we're in we do have the
 
01:44:50.070 --> 01:44:50.080 align:start position:0%
ability to amend house rules on on
 
01:44:52.109 --> 01:44:52.119 align:start position:0%
Wednesday again with a simple majority
 
01:44:54.910 --> 01:44:54.920 align:start position:0%
vote um which which we which was
 
01:44:56.790 --> 01:44:56.800 align:start position:0%
extended uh because usually the first
 
01:44:58.629 --> 01:44:58.639 align:start position:0%
session day is uh sort of the last day
 
01:45:01.270 --> 01:45:01.280 align:start position:0%
to amend by by majority vote in a in a
 
01:45:04.910 --> 01:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
given situation um but in uh you know as
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
you know one legislature does not buy in
 
01:45:09.709 --> 01:45:09.719 align:start position:0%
the hands of the next either so um a a
 
01:45:12.830 --> 01:45:12.840 align:start position:0%
new legislature could Implement on uh
 
01:45:15.189 --> 01:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
almost immediately on the on convenient
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
day uh those new structures for for how
 
01:45:26.229 --> 01:45:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.910 --> 01:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:34.629 align:start position:0%
 
on

01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
question just a just a clarification Mr
 
01:45:39.470 --> 01:45:39.480 align:start position:0%
chairman earlier when I was testifying
 
01:45:41.910 --> 01:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
and and you stated that um I said that
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
this was my favorite committee to all
 
01:45:45.589 --> 01:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
the Committees that is in fact very
 
01:45:48.189 --> 01:45:48.199 align:start position:0%
untrue this is really truly my favorite
 
01:45:50.229 --> 01:45:50.239 align:start position:0%
committee having served on it and
 
01:45:51.990 --> 01:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
because of course it has to deal with
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
so testing the veracity of my statement
 
01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:03.760 align:start position:0%
I suppose
 
01:46:06.149 --> 01:46:06.159 align:start position:0%
no thank you Mr chair and I'm not
 
01:46:08.629 --> 01:46:08.639 align:start position:0%
testing that but something that you did
 
01:46:12.669 --> 01:46:12.679 align:start position:0%
say um Mr clerk that um I wanted to ask
 
01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:15.679 align:start position:0%
a followup on was has there ever been a
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
study committee prior to a rules
 
01:46:24.950 --> 01:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
adoption thereby um allowing more of a
 
01:46:28.830 --> 01:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
process I guess to create uh a rule
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's a really good ringing of the Bell
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
um if you will in your experience have
 
01:46:35.229 --> 01:46:35.239 align:start position:0%
you seen that as a part of the process
 
01:46:37.669 --> 01:46:37.679 align:start position:0%
in the creation of a rule uh so the
 
01:46:39.910 --> 01:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
short answer is in my 18 years no I have
 
01:46:44.229 --> 01:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
not um I I would say that um part of
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
part of the the the process as as you
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
all know uh I know that one of the one
 
01:46:52.189 --> 01:46:52.199 align:start position:0%
of the groups that uh is is listed as as
 
01:46:57.030 --> 01:46:57.040 align:start position:0%
being a resource um has lobbied very
 
01:46:59.430 --> 01:46:59.440 align:start position:0%
heavily on on these these types of
 
01:47:01.589 --> 01:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
issues in the past um and that is
 
01:47:03.669 --> 01:47:03.679 align:start position:0%
certainly well within the purview of of
 
01:47:05.109 --> 01:47:05.119 align:start position:0%
any member of the public and any
 
01:47:07.950 --> 01:47:07.960 align:start position:0%
lobbying organization um I would only
 
01:47:13.229 --> 01:47:13.239 align:start position:0%
note that uh rules tend to to come from
 
01:47:14.750 --> 01:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
um it's it's actually interesting I was
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
I was having a conversation with a
 
01:47:18.189 --> 01:47:18.199 align:start position:0%
member of the committee earlier um and I
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
noted that that sometimes when when when
 
01:47:23.390 --> 01:47:23.400 align:start position:0%
rules come it's because
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
of uh something that we we've sort of uh
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
evolved with technology um I will state
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
you know prior to 1976 we did not have a
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
roll call machine um so so keep that in
 
01:47:41.229 --> 01:47:41.239 align:start position:0%
mind that before 1976 our 400 members
 
01:47:44.070 --> 01:47:44.080 align:start position:0%
were roll calling every individual roll
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
call you know in a half hour period
 
01:47:47.950 --> 01:47:47.960 align:start position:0%
that's why there were much fewer roll
 
01:47:51.310 --> 01:47:51.320 align:start position:0%
calls um but we we do have to adapt uh
 
01:47:53.709 --> 01:47:53.719 align:start position:0%
our rules sometimes for those changing
 
01:47:55.709 --> 01:47:55.719 align:start position:0%
Technologies in the case of the bill I
 
01:47:58.109 --> 01:47:58.119 align:start position:0%
testified on earlier um there are
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
certain practices that we just that just
 
01:48:03.030 --> 01:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
make sense um and in including like
 
01:48:04.750 --> 01:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
putting amendments online so that just
 
01:48:06.390 --> 01:48:06.400 align:start position:0%
makes sense so we don't really need to
 
01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
address it in rules nor in my opinion
 
01:48:10.430 --> 01:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
and statute because we're just moving in
 
01:48:13.870 --> 01:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
that direction um I I would also note um
 
01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:16.360 align:start position:0%
you know that that our rules talk about
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
um printing of bills but uh we actually
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
before we get our bills back from the
 
01:48:25.109 --> 01:48:25.119 align:start position:0%
printer we actually post them online um
 
01:48:27.270 --> 01:48:27.280 align:start position:0%
sort of as a convenience sake before
 
01:48:29.709 --> 01:48:29.719 align:start position:0%
they're even back from the printer uh so
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
I I only note that because you know uh
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
we we we try to do things generally
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
um because we've we've sort of gotten to
 
01:48:41.589 --> 01:48:41.599 align:start position:0%
that point or evolved to that
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
point sometimes uh and and I'm I'm sorry
 
01:48:46.430 --> 01:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
to keep going but sometimes uh you know
 
01:48:49.510 --> 01:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
rules are a response to certain things
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
as well um you know some of the rule
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
changes that I've advocated over the
 
01:48:56.189 --> 01:48:56.199 align:start position:0%
years specifically like um uh the the
 
01:48:58.149 --> 01:48:58.159 align:start position:0%
amendment we adopted uh in session a few
 
01:49:00.550 --> 01:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
weeks ago that that deals with Committee
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
of conference reports and and how we
 
01:49:06.030 --> 01:49:06.040 align:start position:0%
adopt uh something um that hasn't you
 
01:49:07.430 --> 01:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
know that really hasn't had a public
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
hearing or something along those lines
 
01:49:11.669 --> 01:49:11.679 align:start position:0%
um you know in needing two-thirds that's
 
01:49:14.270 --> 01:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
because that that evolved because of of
 
01:49:16.470 --> 01:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
the actions of of our neighbors across
 
01:49:19.629 --> 01:49:19.639 align:start position:0%
the across the wall that that like to do
 
01:49:23.229 --> 01:49:23.239 align:start position:0%
silly things um so uh you know that why
 
01:49:28.750 --> 01:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.149 --> 01:49:32.159 align:start position:0%
well sorry for the very long
 
01:49:35.589 --> 01:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
answer we uh we're done with our
 
01:49:38.390 --> 01:49:38.400 align:start position:0%
favorite testifier um Mr chairman I have
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
a question uh yes representative Smith
 
01:49:45.790 --> 01:49:45.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr clerk um your your
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
testimony focused a bit on the the rules
 
01:49:51.070 --> 01:49:51.080 align:start position:0%
aspect of this um and you you just
 
01:49:53.070 --> 01:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
mentioned um the other chamber on the
 
01:49:55.070 --> 01:49:55.080 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall and I noticed the
 
01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:56.189 align:start position:0%
other side of the wall and I noticed the
study

01:49:56.189 --> 01:49:56.199 align:start position:0%
study
 
01:50:00.709 --> 01:50:00.719 align:start position:0%
committee is not narrowed in scope to
 
01:50:04.589 --> 01:50:04.599 align:start position:0%
the house um it is dealing with the the
 
01:50:06.870 --> 01:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
general court in general um and as a
 
01:50:09.510 --> 01:50:09.520 align:start position:0%
matter of fact the the clerk of the
 
01:50:12.270 --> 01:50:12.280 align:start position:0%
other body um would be a member of the
 
01:50:15.990 --> 01:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
um sorry go ahead uh their their
 
01:50:23.189 --> 01:50:23.199 align:start position:0%
interpretation of whether or not they
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
need rules to use technology um is
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
basically the exact opposite of ours you
 
01:50:32.229 --> 01:50:32.239 align:start position:0%
know the the position of our our
 
01:50:35.390 --> 01:50:35.400 align:start position:0%
chambers's leadership um seems to have
 
01:50:37.149 --> 01:50:37.159 align:start position:0%
been that you know we we need a rule in
 
01:50:39.790 --> 01:50:39.800 align:start position:0%
place before anyone like dials a
 
01:50:42.870 --> 01:50:42.880 align:start position:0%
telephone um the the other chamber has
 
01:50:44.550 --> 01:50:44.560 align:start position:0%
taken the exact opposite approach
 
01:50:47.310 --> 01:50:47.320 align:start position:0%
they're they're utilizing you know
 
01:50:49.310 --> 01:50:49.320 align:start position:0%
extensive technology not just for their
 
01:50:50.990 --> 01:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
committee work but for their sessions
 
01:50:53.709 --> 01:50:53.719 align:start position:0%
without any adopted rule proactively
 
01:50:57.350 --> 01:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do that uh my my
 
01:50:59.229 --> 01:50:59.239 align:start position:0%
question and my concern I'm I'm hoping
 
01:51:01.750 --> 01:51:01.760 align:start position:0%
you can speak to is
 
01:51:04.750 --> 01:51:04.760 align:start position:0%
um given that
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
dichotomy are are you aware or have you
 
01:51:09.790 --> 01:51:09.800 align:start position:0%
been privy to any
 
01:51:13.510 --> 01:51:13.520 align:start position:0%
conversations um on any attempt to like
 
01:51:16.109 --> 01:51:16.119 align:start position:0%
Rectify that between the two Chambers
 
01:51:18.910 --> 01:51:18.920 align:start position:0%
and get some sort of a paradigm that
 
01:51:21.669 --> 01:51:21.679 align:start position:0%
matches uh in the future because you
 
01:51:23.790 --> 01:51:23.800 align:start position:0%
know and where I'm going with this
 
01:51:26.149 --> 01:51:26.159 align:start position:0%
question is I I would hate to
 
01:51:28.950 --> 01:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
see a report come out of a committee
 
01:51:32.350 --> 01:51:32.360 align:start position:0%
like this that has a few specific
 
01:51:34.830 --> 01:51:34.840 align:start position:0%
recommendations and have them adopted by
 
01:51:38.229 --> 01:51:38.239 align:start position:0%
one chamber but not by the
 
01:51:41.550 --> 01:51:41.560 align:start position:0%
other um fantastic series of questions
 
01:51:43.390 --> 01:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
and I'd like to sort of address a couple
 
01:51:45.430 --> 01:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
of those if I could so so first and
 
01:51:49.069 --> 01:51:49.079 align:start position:0%
foremost the the house um as you know
 
01:51:50.910 --> 01:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
with a bigger chamber and and this is
 
01:51:52.669 --> 01:51:52.679 align:start position:0%
sort of true in many states around the
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
country the house utilizes more terms
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
more in terms of of backup and precedent
 
01:52:01.669 --> 01:52:01.679 align:start position:0%
we use Mason's Manual of legislative
 
01:52:02.629 --> 01:52:02.639 align:start position:0%
procedure in the House of
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives the Senate does not the
 
01:52:08.109 --> 01:52:08.119 align:start position:0%
Senate literally looks to its own rules
 
01:52:10.189 --> 01:52:10.199 align:start position:0%
and that's why if you if and I know you
 
01:52:12.390 --> 01:52:12.400 align:start position:0%
are an abute observer of the Senate they
 
01:52:15.229 --> 01:52:15.239 align:start position:0%
say without objection probably 25 times
 
01:52:17.550 --> 01:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
during a session day and the reason is
 
01:52:20.229 --> 01:52:20.239 align:start position:0%
because they're sort of waving really
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
any any sort of formal acknowledge that
 
01:52:25.350 --> 01:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
that that they're doing anything
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
extraordinary of of rules so I I
 
01:52:29.950 --> 01:52:29.960 align:start position:0%
understand your point but I would just
 
01:52:32.310 --> 01:52:32.320 align:start position:0%
state that we are a completely different
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
body in that sense um regarding you know
 
01:52:37.229 --> 01:52:37.239 align:start position:0%
and and I think that addresses your
 
01:52:39.990 --> 01:52:40.000 align:start position:0%
point certainly with with respect to to
 
01:52:41.510 --> 01:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
the the interpretation of rules
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
regarding technology um I I will note
 
01:52:46.149 --> 01:52:46.159 align:start position:0%
that we did have a study committee a
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
couple of years ago that talked about
 
01:52:50.270 --> 01:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
recording of of committees and it was
 
01:52:53.350 --> 01:52:53.360 align:start position:0%
something that uh was studied um
 
01:52:55.750 --> 01:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually the the the the current
 
01:52:57.709 --> 01:52:57.719 align:start position:0%
minority leader was the chair of that
 
01:53:01.189 --> 01:53:01.199 align:start position:0%
committee um and uh I participated with
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
that I would also note too that this
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
legislation actually does not make the
 
01:53:06.910 --> 01:53:06.920 align:start position:0%
the clerks members it's it would just
 
01:53:10.229 --> 01:53:10.239 align:start position:0%
have us referred to uh as being persons
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
to to consult with um and and and and
 
01:53:18.310 --> 01:53:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's fine um but yes we we have in the
 
01:53:21.910 --> 01:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
past had joint rules with the Senate the
 
01:53:23.950 --> 01:53:23.960 align:start position:0%
the the last time we had joint rules
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
with the Senate was the session of 1995
 
01:53:26.239 --> 01:53:27.270 align:start position:0%
with the Senate was the session of 1995
and

01:53:27.270 --> 01:53:27.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:30.510 --> 01:53:30.520 align:start position:0%
1996 um uh so when you and I were in
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
high school representative Smith and and
 
01:53:36.310 --> 01:53:36.320 align:start position:0%
I would just note that um you know in in
 
01:53:38.629 --> 01:53:38.639 align:start position:0%
in those terms that we have attempted I
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
will say this for my own sake when I
 
01:53:43.709 --> 01:53:43.719 align:start position:0%
first became clerk uh in
 
01:53:46.510 --> 01:53:46.520 align:start position:0%
2014 um then speaker Jasper met with
 
01:53:48.910 --> 01:53:48.920 align:start position:0%
then president Morse about the idea of
 
01:53:51.550 --> 01:53:51.560 align:start position:0%
potentially adopting Senate uh uh joint
 
01:53:53.550 --> 01:53:53.560 align:start position:0%
rules with the Senate and that was
 
01:53:56.350 --> 01:53:56.360 align:start position:0%
sarily dismissed uh by by our friends in
 
01:53:59.709 --> 01:53:59.719 align:start position:0%
the upper body um and and so I I I would
 
01:54:02.470 --> 01:54:02.480 align:start position:0%
just state that that you know in terms
 
01:54:05.589 --> 01:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
of of practices that are that are Branch
 
01:54:09.870 --> 01:54:09.880 align:start position:0%
wide it's it's hard to do that when you
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
operate so differently um and and again
 
01:54:16.149 --> 01:54:16.159 align:start position:0%
part of it and and I I look to the staff
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
for example each Senator is is
 
01:54:20.270 --> 01:54:20.280 align:start position:0%
accustomed to to having at least one
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
staff person working for them uh whereas
 
01:54:25.790 --> 01:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh you poor folks sometimes have to do
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
your own photoc copying and and I um you
 
01:54:32.470 --> 01:54:32.480 align:start position:0%
know it's funny to me uh that that that
 
01:54:34.109 --> 01:54:34.119 align:start position:0%
it works that way because you you make
 
01:54:37.149 --> 01:54:37.159 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money um but that
 
01:54:40.030 --> 01:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
that being said uh you know there I
 
01:54:41.310 --> 01:54:41.320 align:start position:0%
would only note that that in the
 
01:54:42.870 --> 01:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
instances of the house and the senate in
 
01:54:45.470 --> 01:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
terms of policies and and procedures the
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
things that really affect us that that
 
01:54:49.950 --> 01:54:49.960 align:start position:0%
do rise to the level of joint issues
 
01:54:52.470 --> 01:54:52.480 align:start position:0%
such as last year when we adopted or a
 
01:54:54.790 --> 01:54:54.800 align:start position:0%
year and a half ago when we adopted the
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
Discrimination uh and harassment policy
 
01:55:00.589 --> 01:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
uh in law uh that that actually set a
 
01:55:03.069 --> 01:55:03.079 align:start position:0%
position uh within the uh General Court
 
01:55:04.709 --> 01:55:04.719 align:start position:0%
business office and and that sort of
 
01:55:09.310 --> 01:55:09.320 align:start position:0%
thing that very much um did deal with a
 
01:55:09.320 --> 01:55:23.550 align:start position:0%
thing that very much um did deal with a
branchwidth

01:55:23.550 --> 01:55:23.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%

01:55:50.109 --> 01:55:50.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
herself she said she is testifying for
 
01:55:55.470 --> 01:55:55.480 align:start position:0%
five minutes I would hope she could
 
01:55:55.480 --> 01:56:00.390 align:start position:0%
five minutes I would hope she could
shorten

01:56:00.390 --> 01:56:00.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:02.990 --> 01:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
that good morning yes I can keep it
 
01:56:05.430 --> 01:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
under five minutes for sure so um hello
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
Representatives my name is Daisy Pierce
 
01:56:09.870 --> 01:56:09.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm the executive director of
 
01:56:11.870 --> 01:56:11.880 align:start position:0%
navigating recovery of the Lakes Region
 
01:56:13.510 --> 01:56:13.520 align:start position:0%
which is one of several recovery
 
01:56:15.030 --> 01:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
Community organizations throughout the
 
01:56:17.390 --> 01:56:17.400 align:start position:0%
state and I am testifying today in
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
support of HB 558 although many
 
01:56:22.510 --> 01:56:22.520 align:start position:0%
communities in New Hampshire would
 
01:56:24.189 --> 01:56:24.199 align:start position:0%
benefit from the continued ability to
 
01:56:27.470 --> 01:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
testify remotely such as I am today I
 
01:56:29.390 --> 01:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
want to speak specifically on behalf of
 
01:56:31.830 --> 01:56:31.840 align:start position:0%
those in recovery from substance use
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
disorder right now there are currently
 
01:56:36.069 --> 01:56:36.079 align:start position:0%
eight bills related to matters that
 
01:56:38.470 --> 01:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
affect treatment and Recovery with many
 
01:56:40.709 --> 01:56:40.719 align:start position:0%
more in Prior years regarding recovery
 
01:56:42.669 --> 01:56:42.679 align:start position:0%
housing Medicaid expansion and
 
01:56:45.069 --> 01:56:45.079 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rates drug cour serin
 
01:56:46.709 --> 01:56:46.719 align:start position:0%
service programs
 
01:56:49.310 --> 01:56:49.320 align:start position:0%
Etc people in recovery throughout the
 
01:56:52.030 --> 01:56:52.040 align:start position:0%
state are actively engaged in civic duty
 
01:56:53.950 --> 01:56:53.960 align:start position:0%
and their voices deserve to be heard
 
01:56:55.830 --> 01:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
when it comes to issues directly
 
01:56:58.390 --> 01:56:58.400 align:start position:0%
impacting their lives however testifying
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
in person is not always feasible I think
 
01:57:02.149 --> 01:57:02.159 align:start position:0%
the language of the bill says it
 
01:57:04.270 --> 01:57:04.280 align:start position:0%
perfectly quote the use of video
 
01:57:06.750 --> 01:57:06.760 align:start position:0%
conferencing Technologies among others
 
01:57:08.709 --> 01:57:08.719 align:start position:0%
enabled legislators to participate in
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
hearings from their homes or other
 
01:57:12.910 --> 01:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
remote locations and eliminated barriers
 
01:57:14.910 --> 01:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
for members of the public for whom it
 
01:57:17.589 --> 01:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
can often be costly timec consuming and
 
01:57:19.229 --> 01:57:19.239 align:start position:0%
logistically challenging to attend
 
01:57:20.589 --> 01:57:20.599 align:start position:0%
committee hearings in person at the
 
01:57:23.189 --> 01:57:23.199 align:start position:0%
state capital when speaking to those
 
01:57:25.390 --> 01:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
logistical challenges let's begin with
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
transportation for those without their
 
01:57:29.870 --> 01:57:29.880 align:start position:0%
own vehicle having to pay for a taxi or
 
01:57:32.589 --> 01:57:32.599 align:start position:0%
uberair is uh cost prohibitive to
 
01:57:35.310 --> 01:57:35.320 align:start position:0%
conquered in addition to that arranging
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
for transportation back home can be
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
difficult when you don't know how long
 
01:57:41.030 --> 01:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing is going to last or when you
 
01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:41.750 align:start position:0%
the hearing is going to last or when you
will

01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
will
 
01:57:43.669 --> 01:57:43.679 align:start position:0%
testify when it comes to public
 
01:57:45.550 --> 01:57:45.560 align:start position:0%
transportation we can all acknowledge
 
01:57:48.109 --> 01:57:48.119 align:start position:0%
that we're wul lacking good options for
 
01:57:50.629 --> 01:57:50.639 align:start position:0%
buses even for those of us with our own
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
transportation driving to to testify can
 
01:57:55.069 --> 01:57:55.079 align:start position:0%
cause other issues and I'm not referring
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
to finding parking um another logistical
 
01:58:00.430 --> 01:58:00.440 align:start position:0%
challenge worth mentioning is employment
 
01:58:02.470 --> 01:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
so for example taking the time off of
 
01:58:05.229 --> 01:58:05.239 align:start position:0%
work if an employer will even allow it
 
01:58:06.910 --> 01:58:06.920 align:start position:0%
cannot cause financial distress on
 
01:58:09.990 --> 01:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
someone many people in early recovery
 
01:58:11.589 --> 01:58:11.599 align:start position:0%
are getting back on their feet they
 
01:58:13.990 --> 01:58:14.000 align:start position:0%
don't have high paying salar positions
 
01:58:16.589 --> 01:58:16.599 align:start position:0%
but rather minimum wage hourly jobs
 
01:58:18.430 --> 01:58:18.440 align:start position:0%
where every penny earned is needed for
 
01:58:20.790 --> 01:58:20.800 align:start position:0%
basic cost of living yet their voices
 
01:58:22.589 --> 01:58:22.599 align:start position:0%
are just as important as those who can
 
01:58:25.470 --> 01:58:25.480 align:start position:0%
afford to take the unpaid time to
 
01:58:27.629 --> 01:58:27.639 align:start position:0%
testify another barrier to those in
 
01:58:29.350 --> 01:58:29.360 align:start position:0%
recover testifying in person
 
01:58:31.470 --> 01:58:31.480 align:start position:0%
particularly during this pandemic is
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
that of underlying medical conditions
 
01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
according to the CDC although the risk
 
01:58:38.189 --> 01:58:38.199 align:start position:0%
of severe illness from covid-19 for
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
people who have substance use disorder
 
01:58:43.510 --> 01:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
is not known they do know that many
 
01:58:45.589 --> 01:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
serious effects that drugs have on the
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
body to the lungs and the Heart could
 
01:58:50.350 --> 01:58:50.360 align:start position:0%
make covid-19 illness more severe no one
 
01:58:51.550 --> 01:58:51.560 align:start position:0%
should ever have to risk their own
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
health in in order to participate in the
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
legislative process so I want to be
 
01:58:57.030 --> 01:58:57.040 align:start position:0%

01:59:03.510 --> 01:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
HB 558 I am happy to answer any
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%

great thank you uh I have provided
 
02:00:09.990 --> 02:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
written testimony that I won't repeat uh
 
02:00:12.350 --> 02:00:12.360 align:start position:0%
I I'm the CEO of AMC Community Health
 
02:00:14.189 --> 02:00:14.199 align:start position:0%
Services and we're in Littleton New
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've had the privilege
 
02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:18.800 align:start position:0%
through the years to testify in person
 
02:00:21.629 --> 02:00:21.639 align:start position:0%
in conquer I love coming to conquer and
 
02:00:25.229 --> 02:00:25.239 align:start position:0%
then often entails a 90 minutes round
 
02:00:27.750 --> 02:00:27.760 align:start position:0%
trip and although I can get some work
 
02:00:31.229 --> 02:00:31.239 align:start position:0%
done on the phone during that trip uh
 
02:00:34.629 --> 02:00:34.639 align:start position:0%
this experience has provided myself the
 
02:00:37.790 --> 02:00:37.800 align:start position:0%
opportunity to provide input in a
 
02:00:40.910 --> 02:00:40.920 align:start position:0%
variety of bills that I hope help
 
02:00:42.790 --> 02:00:42.800 align:start position:0%
legislators craft bills that are
 
02:00:45.709 --> 02:00:45.719 align:start position:0%
cognizant of rural Northern New
 
02:00:50.030 --> 02:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and in addition I serve on the
 
02:00:53.189 --> 02:00:53.199 align:start position:0%
Sha ship commission as well the Medicaid
 
02:00:55.229 --> 02:00:55.239 align:start position:0%
adult Ben benefit
 
02:00:58.390 --> 02:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
commission and the ability to contribute
 
02:01:02.589 --> 02:01:02.599 align:start position:0%
at a more meaningful level is greatly
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
enhanced by the ability to use a
 
02:01:09.950 --> 02:01:09.960 align:start position:0%
platform like this and we have uh many
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
patients we have 10,000 patients some of
 
02:01:13.790 --> 02:01:13.800 align:start position:0%
whom is would like to have their voice
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard and as was previously mentioned
 
02:01:19.709 --> 02:01:19.719 align:start position:0%
transportation is sometimes a challenge
 
02:01:22.470 --> 02:01:22.480 align:start position:0%
40% of the patients we serve are
 
02:01:24.750 --> 02:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
Medicare eligible so they're over the
 
02:01:27.510 --> 02:01:27.520 align:start position:0%
age of 65 and some are less comfortable
 
02:01:29.750 --> 02:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
driving in January and
 
02:01:33.189 --> 02:01:33.199 align:start position:0%
February uh so I appreciate the
 
02:01:35.709 --> 02:01:35.719 align:start position:0%
opportunity to leverage technology to
 
02:01:39.310 --> 02:01:39.320 align:start position:0%
participate in sessions like this so
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
I'll say thank you and I'll Echo the
 
02:01:44.270 --> 02:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
words of the clerk that um you know this
 
02:01:47.310 --> 02:01:47.320 align:start position:0%
is this is um I think it it really
 
02:01:49.109 --> 02:01:49.119 align:start position:0%
brings New Hampshire
 
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
together and gives a voice to one point
 
02:01:53.830 --> 02:01:53.840 align:start position:0%
.3 million people who have an
 
02:01:56.350 --> 02:01:56.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to have their voice heard
 
02:01:57.910 --> 02:01:57.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps more than they've ever had the
 
02:01:59.870 --> 02:01:59.880 align:start position:0%
opportunity with more barriers remove
 
02:02:02.470 --> 02:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
for them um and I still enjoy coming to
 
02:02:05.229 --> 02:02:05.239 align:start position:0%
conquer when I can uh so I will leave it
 
02:02:06.990 --> 02:02:07.000 align:start position:0%
at that and if there are any questions
 
02:02:09.390 --> 02:02:09.400 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to respond to them
 
02:02:10.629 --> 02:02:10.639 align:start position:0%

02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
that provide services to individuals
 
02:03:12.270 --> 02:03:12.280 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities or
 
02:03:15.270 --> 02:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorders um we support
 
02:03:17.950 --> 02:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
almost 13,000 individuals in this
 
02:03:20.510 --> 02:03:20.520 align:start position:0%
community and their families and we are
 
02:03:23.910 --> 02:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
asking you to support House Bill 558 um
 
02:03:26.750 --> 02:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
as the association we do provide um
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
Education and Training opportunities for
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities uh
 
02:03:33.870 --> 02:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorders and also their
 
02:03:36.470 --> 02:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
families and staff members partici um
 
02:03:40.350 --> 02:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
working with them to participate in um
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
educational opportunities with the
 
02:03:44.270 --> 02:03:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislative process so many of the bills
 
02:03:46.229 --> 02:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
that get submitted each year do have a
 
02:03:48.069 --> 02:03:48.079 align:start position:0%
direct impact on the people that we
 
02:03:50.549 --> 02:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
serve um and we often hear that it's
 
02:03:53.030 --> 02:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
hard for them to participate at given um
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges that have already
 
02:03:56.950 --> 02:03:56.960 align:start position:0%
been mentioned here um some of those
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
barriers do include lack of
 
02:04:01.229 --> 02:04:01.239 align:start position:0%
transportation to conquered uh Workforce
 
02:04:03.589 --> 02:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
challenges that the entire state is
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
experiencing the amount of time that it
 
02:04:08.669 --> 02:04:08.679 align:start position:0%
takes to get to and from um as mentioned
 
02:04:10.390 --> 02:04:10.400 align:start position:0%
before if you live over on the Sea Coast
 
02:04:12.510 --> 02:04:12.520 align:start position:0%
or up in a rural area it could be a four
 
02:04:15.589 --> 02:04:15.599 align:start position:0%
plus hour round trip um and that is if
 
02:04:19.109 --> 02:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
the hearings do run on time the day the
 
02:04:21.030 --> 02:04:21.040 align:start position:0%
time of day for public hearings is hard
 
02:04:22.950 --> 02:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
for our families especially those that
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
are um supporting young children who
 
02:04:28.350 --> 02:04:28.360 align:start position:0%
experience disabilities uh they're often
 
02:04:30.350 --> 02:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
shifting them from one therapy or
 
02:04:32.750 --> 02:04:32.760 align:start position:0%
appointment to another um and taking a
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
lot of time off to help support that so
 
02:04:37.069 --> 02:04:37.079 align:start position:0%
it's important for them to get involved
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
but sometimes um this would be kind of
 
02:04:41.669 --> 02:04:41.679 align:start position:0%
the last thing based off of other
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
important things that the families have
 
02:04:44.040 --> 02:04:45.069 align:start position:0%
important things that the families have
to

02:04:45.069 --> 02:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:47.910 --> 02:04:47.920 align:start position:0%
experience um covid-19 has brought
 
02:04:49.750 --> 02:04:49.760 align:start position:0%
significant challenges to our state and
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
communities but it has also given us the
 
02:04:54.990 --> 02:04:55.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to experience what it could
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
look like if a remote option um was here
 
02:05:00.470 --> 02:05:00.480 align:start position:0%
to stay for the future hearings are more
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
accessible uh they're convenient and the
 
02:05:04.510 --> 02:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
legislators get to hear more from the
 
02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
public members on how bills do impact
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
them providing the option for remote
 
02:05:11.910 --> 02:05:11.920 align:start position:0%
testimony in the 2021 legislative
 
02:05:14.069 --> 02:05:14.079 align:start position:0%
session has removed some of those
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
barriers um that have been
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
discussed and
 
02:05:23.430 --> 02:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
um sorry I just a popup that threw me
 
02:05:27.390 --> 02:05:27.400 align:start position:0%
off guard um so people have been able to
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
provide uh important feedback to the
 
02:05:32.149 --> 02:05:32.159 align:start position:0%
legislators and we have heard from
 
02:05:34.149 --> 02:05:34.159 align:start position:0%
families that they they've been able to
 
02:05:36.669 --> 02:05:36.679 align:start position:0%
participate a lot more and we are um
 
02:05:39.109 --> 02:05:39.119 align:start position:0%
getting constant questions on how to
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
help them navigate through signing in a
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
public hearing um in support and
 
02:05:45.750 --> 02:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
opposition to and we hope that it helps
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
them to see the process and empowers
 
02:05:50.870 --> 02:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
them to continue being um part of the
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
legislative proc process so that
 
02:05:55.750 --> 02:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
legislators can hear how bills do impact
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
them um so we do hope that you support
 
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
House Bill 558 and we're happy to be a
 
02:06:03.830 --> 02:06:03.840 align:start position:0%

here to express our support for HB
 
02:07:25.910 --> 02:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
558 uh in most of our work at the
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
grandet organizing project involves
 
02:07:29.870 --> 02:07:29.880 align:start position:0%
working with low-income families and
 
02:07:32.310 --> 02:07:32.320 align:start position:0%
communities of color uh we are
 
02:07:33.910 --> 02:07:33.920 align:start position:0%
dedicating to ensuring that people are
 
02:07:36.069 --> 02:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
participating civically and they feel
 
02:07:37.709 --> 02:07:37.719 align:start position:0%
empowered enough to participate in
 
02:07:39.549 --> 02:07:39.559 align:start position:0%
decisions that affect their day-to-day
 
02:07:44.069 --> 02:07:44.079 align:start position:0%
lives we view HB 558 as an opportunity
 
02:07:46.750 --> 02:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
to expand access to the legislative
 
02:07:49.990 --> 02:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
process uh so that more gr Staters who
 
02:07:52.669 --> 02:07:52.679 align:start position:0%
feel that this St is currently chat have
 
02:07:55.950 --> 02:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
um a regular way of participating um in
 
02:07:59.109 --> 02:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
this process uh during the 2021
 
02:08:01.470 --> 02:08:01.480 align:start position:0%
legislative session we're in currently
 
02:08:03.270 --> 02:08:03.280 align:start position:0%
we have witnessed an increase in
 
02:08:05.709 --> 02:08:05.719 align:start position:0%
participation among our members uh they
 
02:08:07.790 --> 02:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
have become actively engaged in the
 
02:08:09.990 --> 02:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
legislative process because now they can
 
02:08:12.589 --> 02:08:12.599 align:start position:0%
attend hearings online they can register
 
02:08:14.830 --> 02:08:14.840 align:start position:0%
their positions for bills online and
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
they can testy from the comfort of their
 
02:08:20.310 --> 02:08:20.320 align:start position:0%
homes some of our members are limited
 
02:08:22.149 --> 02:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
because of Transportation
 
02:08:24.709 --> 02:08:24.719 align:start position:0%
they don't have Cs and there are few
 
02:08:27.270 --> 02:08:27.280 align:start position:0%
trips to conquer provided by the public
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
transit even a trip from Manchester
 
02:08:31.510 --> 02:08:31.520 align:start position:0%
conquered by local Transit could take
 
02:08:34.430 --> 02:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
two hours and let's not forget the fact
 
02:08:38.149 --> 02:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
that hearings sometimes run late and so
 
02:08:39.950 --> 02:08:39.960 align:start position:0%
if you're in conquered and therefore a
 
02:08:41.629 --> 02:08:41.639 align:start position:0%
hearing and you have to go back to work
 
02:08:43.830 --> 02:08:43.840 align:start position:0%
for a second shift you might not be able
 
02:08:46.270 --> 02:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
to make the hearing and um be able to
 
02:08:48.030 --> 02:08:48.040 align:start position:0%
share what your experiences are because
 
02:08:50.350 --> 02:08:50.360 align:start position:0%
you have to go back to work and also
 
02:08:52.870 --> 02:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
going to conquer this not um a
 
02:08:54.830 --> 02:08:54.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable thing for everyone it can be
 
02:08:57.549 --> 02:08:57.559 align:start position:0%
very intimidating but now that people
 
02:08:59.790 --> 02:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
can actually call in and share their
 
02:09:01.390 --> 02:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
stories and share the experiences from
 
02:09:03.229 --> 02:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
the comfort of their home they feel very
 
02:09:06.229 --> 02:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
comfortable to do that um for instance
 
02:09:09.549 --> 02:09:09.559 align:start position:0%
we have uh members who are parents and
 
02:09:12.149 --> 02:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
they have kids at home and for that
 
02:09:14.390 --> 02:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
reason uh it's been a challenge for them
 
02:09:17.189 --> 02:09:17.199 align:start position:0%
to drive to conquered and then come back
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh and make sure they're taking care of
 
02:09:20.310 --> 02:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
their kids so we find that that is a
 
02:09:22.990 --> 02:09:23.000 align:start position:0%
barrier for them to par in this process
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
so I want to urge all members of this
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
committee to really consider this bill
 
02:09:30.350 --> 02:09:30.360 align:start position:0%
to make sure that those that don't have
 
02:09:31.910 --> 02:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
voices right now to be able to
 
02:09:33.870 --> 02:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
participate in this process have that
 
02:09:36.549 --> 02:09:36.559 align:start position:0%
access that their stories can be heard
 
02:09:39.189 --> 02:09:39.199 align:start position:0%
um and so I really add you to vote a
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
pass on HP 558 thank
 
02:09:45.669 --> 02:09:45.679 align:start position:0%

questions uh sure
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%

02:09:55.990 --> 02:09:56.000 align:start position:0%

02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit Health policy and
 
02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization to advance

policy we work with individuals and
 
02:10:43.270 --> 02:10:43.280 align:start position:0%
organizations throughout the state to
 
02:10:45.270 --> 02:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
help them engage in in the legislative
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
process I don't want to repeat too much
 
02:10:48.629 --> 02:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
of what you've heard this morning but I
 
02:10:50.510 --> 02:10:50.520 align:start position:0%
do want to emphasize new Futures strong
 
02:10:52.189 --> 02:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
support for this business
 
02:10:53.589 --> 02:10:53.599 align:start position:0%
uh many of you may recall that I was
 
02:10:55.390 --> 02:10:55.400 align:start position:0%
here before you last year prior to the
 
02:10:58.470 --> 02:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
onset of covid-19 supporting a similar
 
02:11:00.069 --> 02:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
Bill to look into opportunities for
 
02:11:02.069 --> 02:11:02.079 align:start position:0%
remote testimony to empower and raise
 
02:11:04.189 --> 02:11:04.199 align:start position:0%
the voices of individuals across the
 
02:11:06.069 --> 02:11:06.079 align:start position:0%
state who are unable to get to the state
 
02:11:07.990 --> 02:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
house for committee hearings in the
 
02:11:09.430 --> 02:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
months since you and your colleagues
 
02:11:10.990 --> 02:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
here in the legislature have learned in
 
02:11:12.910 --> 02:11:12.920 align:start position:0%
real time how to open a remote option
 
02:11:14.950 --> 02:11:14.960 align:start position:0%
for individuals to testify from home or
 
02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:16.960 align:start position:0%
from their communities we thank you so
 
02:11:18.510 --> 02:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
much for your patience and support as
 
02:11:20.629 --> 02:11:20.639 align:start position:0%
this process as this system has been put
 
02:11:21.950 --> 02:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
into place
 
02:11:24.189 --> 02:11:24.199 align:start position:0%
with any luck the covid-19 pandemic will
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
soon come to an end and the health
 
02:11:27.310 --> 02:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
challenges facing many of us will
 
02:11:29.430 --> 02:11:29.440 align:start position:0%
receive but for thousands of Grant
 
02:11:31.390 --> 02:11:31.400 align:start position:0%
Staters the obstacles that prevented
 
02:11:33.310 --> 02:11:33.320 align:start position:0%
them from attending and testifying at
 
02:11:34.709 --> 02:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
committee hearings in the first place
 
02:11:37.310 --> 02:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
will remain uh including Geographic
 
02:11:39.430 --> 02:11:39.440 align:start position:0%
physical and economic hurdles that often
 
02:11:41.549 --> 02:11:41.559 align:start position:0%
uh prevent you from hearing from many of
 
02:11:43.950 --> 02:11:43.960 align:start position:0%
your constituents uh including working
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
professionals working parents those with
 
02:11:48.149 --> 02:11:48.159 align:start position:0%
physical or behavioral health challenges
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
and many others who are so directly
 
02:11:52.470 --> 02:11:52.480 align:start position:0%
impacted by the work that you do now
 
02:11:53.750 --> 02:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
that we've opened this door to them we
 
02:11:55.270 --> 02:11:55.280 align:start position:0%
think it's critical that we keep it open
 
02:11:57.109 --> 02:11:57.119 align:start position:0%
and allow their voices to continue to be
 
02:11:59.390 --> 02:11:59.400 align:start position:0%
heard to inform the critical work that
 
02:12:01.350 --> 02:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
you're doing we believe that the
 
02:12:03.589 --> 02:12:03.599 align:start position:0%
committee proposed under house bill 558
 
02:12:05.310 --> 02:12:05.320 align:start position:0%
will serve a critical role looking into
 
02:12:07.189 --> 02:12:07.199 align:start position:0%
some of the challenges uh facing the
 
02:12:08.910 --> 02:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
system and identifying technical
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
Staffing and other needs uh to maintain
 
02:12:13.470 --> 02:12:13.480 align:start position:0%
this remote option going forward with an
 
02:12:15.189 --> 02:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
aging population that's growing more
 
02:12:16.990 --> 02:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
diverse culturally and economically
 
02:12:18.830 --> 02:12:18.840 align:start position:0%
maintaining this virtual option into the
 
02:12:20.350 --> 02:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
future will continue to bring in
 
02:12:21.750 --> 02:12:21.760 align:start position:0%
important and under represented
 
02:12:23.430 --> 02:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
perspectives and will strengthen our
 
02:12:25.589 --> 02:12:25.599 align:start position:0%
legislative process on the whole uh and
 
02:12:27.470 --> 02:12:27.480 align:start position:0%
with that we ask that you support the
 
02:12:29.549 --> 02:12:29.559 align:start position:0%
bill and I'm happy to take
 
02:12:32.830 --> 02:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
questions uh thank you um I'm assuming
 
02:12:35.510 --> 02:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
you have written testimony yes I've sent
 
02:12:37.510 --> 02:12:37.520 align:start position:0%

02:12:44.510 --> 02:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
questions none from this any on Zoom or
 
02:12:44.520 --> 02:12:45.950 align:start position:0%
questions none from this any on Zoom or
on

02:12:45.950 --> 02:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:12:48.910 --> 02:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
Telephone seeing none thank you very
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
much we have no other people that have
 
02:12:55.030 --> 02:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
signed up um I will ask if there's any
 
02:12:57.830 --> 02:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
members of the public that
 
02:12:57.840 --> 02:13:10.229 align:start position:0%
members of the public that
uh

02:13:10.229 --> 02:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:17.149 --> 02:13:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:20.790 --> 02:13:20.800 align:start position:0%
go hello again hello again M Mr chair I
 
02:13:22.910 --> 02:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
I think I neglected to formally
 
02:13:24.790 --> 02:13:24.800 align:start position:0%
introduce myself when I was here a few
 
02:13:27.069 --> 02:13:27.079 align:start position:0%
hours ago um so I I continue to be
 
02:13:29.109 --> 02:13:29.119 align:start position:0%
representative Timothy Horan I continue
 
02:13:31.629 --> 02:13:31.639 align:start position:0%
to represent um Graford County District
 
02:13:34.149 --> 02:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
Six Raider Madbury the towns of Madbury
 
02:13:38.350 --> 02:13:38.360 align:start position:0%
and its suburb Durham um anyways so I I
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
think this committee is long overdue um
 
02:13:44.709 --> 02:13:44.719 align:start position:0%
I've been serving I was elected in uh
 
02:13:47.510 --> 02:13:47.520 align:start position:0%
2008 and even then I thought the way we
 
02:13:50.229 --> 02:13:50.239 align:start position:0%
did things was in many ways uh
 
02:13:52.589 --> 02:13:52.599 align:start position:0%
Antiquated I mean I like like the clerk
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
and like the previous clerk Karen
 
02:13:55.669 --> 02:13:55.679 align:start position:0%
wassworth I'm an old school type of
 
02:13:57.430 --> 02:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
person but still um I think there's a
 
02:13:59.950 --> 02:13:59.960 align:start position:0%
lot of changes that should have been
 
02:14:02.189 --> 02:14:02.199 align:start position:0%
made many many years ago even the things
 
02:14:04.390 --> 02:14:04.400 align:start position:0%
we're doing now are really not cutting
 
02:14:07.950 --> 02:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
edge technology um some ways we moved
 
02:14:10.549 --> 02:14:10.559 align:start position:0%
we've moved uh we've moved backwards
 
02:14:12.589 --> 02:14:12.599 align:start position:0%
like uh and first of all actually I'm a
 
02:14:15.069 --> 02:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
my father served in 1976 which is when
 
02:14:15.079 --> 02:14:16.229 align:start position:0%
my father served in 1976 which is when
the

02:14:16.229 --> 02:14:16.239 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:18.950 --> 02:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh but push button roll call system was
 
02:14:20.430 --> 02:14:20.440 align:start position:0%
put in place so that's how all that
 
02:14:22.229 --> 02:14:22.239 align:start position:0%
technology even though we did put in a
 
02:14:26.350 --> 02:14:26.360 align:start position:0%
new server uh um since I've been here um
 
02:14:28.149 --> 02:14:28.159 align:start position:0%
some ways we our infrastructure is gone
 
02:14:29.990 --> 02:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
backwards like we used to have uh the
 
02:14:31.790 --> 02:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
State House Annex used to actually be a
 
02:14:33.549 --> 02:14:33.559 align:start position:0%
Annex of the state house so we had a lot
 
02:14:36.430 --> 02:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
more uh space and a lot more facilities
 
02:14:38.229 --> 02:14:38.239 align:start position:0%
back then and
 
02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
um and or uh some ways we in some ways
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
our technology would move backwards like
 
02:14:45.709 --> 02:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
our streaming video until uh so the
 
02:14:47.350 --> 02:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
Banta came along was just a little
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
webcam mounted on the rail um in the uh
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
State House um we had my first term we
 
02:14:54.470 --> 02:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually and I'm not sure all the
 
02:14:57.189 --> 02:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
details of how it came to be or why it
 
02:14:59.629 --> 02:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
was done but like a local public access
 
02:15:01.589 --> 02:15:01.599 align:start position:0%
Channel actually had a professional
 
02:15:04.750 --> 02:15:04.760 align:start position:0%
camera uh down there so the sound
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
quality the video I think sometimes even
 
02:15:10.430 --> 02:15:10.440 align:start position:0%
use multiple cameras woohoo which uh a
 
02:15:12.310 --> 02:15:12.320 align:start position:0%
and um and of course that that
 
02:15:14.390 --> 02:15:14.400 align:start position:0%
technology has been around uh you know
 
02:15:16.870 --> 02:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
C-SPAN was event in 1979 various
 
02:15:18.669 --> 02:15:18.679 align:start position:0%
legislatures like the Massachusetts
 
02:15:21.189 --> 02:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
state legislature where I worked uh I
 
02:15:22.510 --> 02:15:22.520 align:start position:0%
worked briefly in the state house in
 
02:15:25.589 --> 02:15:25.599 align:start position:0%
1989 had um had its own cable TV channel
 
02:15:29.270 --> 02:15:29.280 align:start position:0%
so like uh some ways uh so some ways
 
02:15:31.229 --> 02:15:31.239 align:start position:0%
we're we're way behind the time I know
 
02:15:32.589 --> 02:15:32.599 align:start position:0%
we're an old organization we're
 
02:15:34.750 --> 02:15:34.760 align:start position:0%
conservative I understand uh understand
 
02:15:36.830 --> 02:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
that and but I think there's many many
 
02:15:39.790 --> 02:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
changes we've made and so the pandemic
 
02:15:41.270 --> 02:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
is a terrible thing believe it's a
 
02:15:42.790 --> 02:15:42.800 align:start position:0%
blessing and so far it has actually
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
goated us into uh taking some action
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
update the way we do things and I
 
02:15:49.750 --> 02:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
certainly think a lot of the Innovations
 
02:15:51.830 --> 02:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
we were forced to make because otherwise
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
we couldn't function at all um is uh I
 
02:15:58.470 --> 02:15:58.480 align:start position:0%
think it's long overdue and also say uh
 
02:16:00.709 --> 02:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
I'm on the Judiciary Committee the clerk
 
02:16:02.669 --> 02:16:02.679 align:start position:0%
does occasionally uh come to visit us
 
02:16:03.950 --> 02:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
he's I don't think he's ever said we're
 
02:16:05.830 --> 02:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
his favorite committee although um I
 
02:16:08.350 --> 02:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
know he I know U although he's always
 
02:16:09.870 --> 02:16:09.880 align:start position:0%
very gracious and helpful when he comes
 
02:16:12.270 --> 02:16:12.280 align:start position:0%
to see us just as he was uh when he came
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
just as he is when he comes to see you
 
02:16:15.350 --> 02:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
but he's never told us he's a favorite
 
02:16:18.229 --> 02:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
committee and also we're charged in 91a
 
02:16:20.750 --> 02:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
the open meetings law the right to no
 
02:16:22.189 --> 02:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
law LA and our laws are somewhat
 
02:16:23.830 --> 02:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
stricter in other states which has
 
02:16:25.669 --> 02:16:25.679 align:start position:0%
impeded I think our legislators from
 
02:16:28.549 --> 02:16:28.559 align:start position:0%
doing some of the things but uh we but
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
um we still have broad discretion we're
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
not uh we actually do our own 91a
 
02:16:35.589 --> 02:16:35.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement because of the uh you know
 
02:16:37.030 --> 02:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
just because the separation of powers
 
02:16:39.830 --> 02:16:39.840 align:start position:0%
and in some ways we're a lot less the
 
02:16:41.549 --> 02:16:41.559 align:start position:0%
standards of transparency we set for
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
ourselves are in many ways uh much uh
 
02:16:47.429 --> 02:16:47.439 align:start position:0%
we're much less we're much more opaque
 
02:16:49.469 --> 02:16:49.479 align:start position:0%
than a lot of the uh a lot of the bodies
 
02:16:51.870 --> 02:16:51.880 align:start position:0%
we make the laws outside the legislation
 
02:16:53.549 --> 02:16:53.559 align:start position:0%
make the laws for it so I think this uh
 
02:16:55.910 --> 02:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee it's a great idea I almost
 
02:16:57.709 --> 02:16:57.719 align:start position:0%
tempted to suggest we make it a standing
 
02:17:00.790 --> 02:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
committee that uh goes on forever except
 
02:17:02.549 --> 02:17:02.559 align:start position:0%
a lot of those standing committees are
 
02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
uh kind of get kind of kind of stagnant
 
02:17:07.629 --> 02:17:07.639 align:start position:0%
so uh I think this this committee is a
 
02:17:09.549 --> 02:17:09.559 align:start position:0%
great idea it's long overdue and um
 
02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of changes we have to make
 
02:17:14.629 --> 02:17:14.639 align:start position:0%
and so we we we need to there's a lot of
 
02:17:16.990 --> 02:17:17.000 align:start position:0%
things we need to catch up with um so
 
02:17:19.070 --> 02:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
that's all I have to say and I'm also
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
I'm time to speak on the next bill so
 
02:17:23.230 --> 02:17:23.240 align:start position:0%
you want to just so you can either take
 
02:17:24.790 --> 02:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
me off the panel and put me on again
 
02:17:26.270 --> 02:17:26.280 align:start position:0%
then or just leave me on whatever's
 
02:17:28.110 --> 02:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
easier so that's what I have to say and
 
02:17:29.309 --> 02:17:29.319 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll take any questions if
 
02:17:32.309 --> 02:17:32.319 align:start position:0%
anybody has any thank you are there any
 
02:17:35.429 --> 02:17:35.439 align:start position:0%
questions for representative faran I
 
02:17:38.750 --> 02:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
don't see any thank
 
02:17:48.070 --> 02:17:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.230 --> 02:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:57.910 --> 02:17:57.920 align:start position:0%
there you are I think I'm here just
 
02:18:02.070 --> 02:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
takes a few minutes to to transfer over
 
02:18:04.990 --> 02:18:05.000 align:start position:0%
thanks for um taking the time to listen
 
02:18:07.230 --> 02:18:07.240 align:start position:0%
to My Testimony today I really um
 
02:18:10.110 --> 02:18:10.120 align:start position:0%
appreciated some of uh representative
 
02:18:14.910 --> 02:18:14.920 align:start position:0%
Horgan's historical context um I um I'm
 
02:18:17.389 --> 02:18:17.399 align:start position:0%
the daughter of Representative uh Steve
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
Avery who served in the house uh until
 
02:18:23.790 --> 02:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
2002 he was running for a ninth term in
 
02:18:27.469 --> 02:18:27.479 align:start position:0%
2002 and um his drive and my drive now
 
02:18:30.629 --> 02:18:30.639 align:start position:0%
is an hour each way to conquered uh so a
 
02:18:35.790 --> 02:18:35.800 align:start position:0%
two-hour commitment uh to to to to
 
02:18:39.070 --> 02:18:39.080 align:start position:0%
testify uh generally speaking so I am
 
02:18:40.709 --> 02:18:40.719 align:start position:0%
obviously in support of this bill I
 
02:18:42.830 --> 02:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
guess at this point
 
02:18:46.190 --> 02:18:46.200 align:start position:0%
um I um even though it doesn't always in
 
02:18:48.030 --> 02:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
some ways it it benefits me in other
 
02:18:50.990 --> 02:18:51.000 align:start position:0%
ways it doesn't um it makes my job easy
 
02:18:53.629 --> 02:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
in many ways I can show up and sign into
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
to more bills than I was really
 
02:18:58.309 --> 02:18:58.319 align:start position:0%
previously able to do it also means I'm
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
not working in my car or a coffee shop
 
02:19:03.870 --> 02:19:03.880 align:start position:0%
or in the cafeteria of the state house
 
02:19:06.509 --> 02:19:06.519 align:start position:0%
which at this point is unsafe for me to
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
do any of those things um I would say uh
 
02:19:12.669 --> 02:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
some of the other upsides are that uh
 
02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
there's less wear and tear in my car now
 
02:19:16.750 --> 02:19:16.760 align:start position:0%
um and there's also of course the
 
02:19:19.150 --> 02:19:19.160 align:start position:0%
environmental impacts of not having all
 
02:19:21.629 --> 02:19:21.639 align:start position:0%
these people driving around sort of
 
02:19:24.950 --> 02:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
needlessly um so but that also means
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
that I don't get reimbursed for mileage
 
02:19:28.990 --> 02:19:29.000 align:start position:0%
and I know that that is part of the um
 
02:19:31.270 --> 02:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
expenses or what you are reimbursed for
 
02:19:34.389 --> 02:19:34.399 align:start position:0%
as state reps um even though that may be
 
02:19:37.549 --> 02:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
fairly negligible um it has also allowed
 
02:19:40.709 --> 02:19:40.719 align:start position:0%
me to put that money towards my car's
 
02:19:43.750 --> 02:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
expenses so I do see that part as as a
 
02:19:46.549 --> 02:19:46.559 align:start position:0%
negative um but I think there's I think
 
02:19:47.910 --> 02:19:47.920 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of cost savings for the
 
02:19:49.349 --> 02:19:49.359 align:start position:0%
state even though I also understand
 
02:19:51.670 --> 02:19:51.680 align:start position:0%
there are are costs associated with
 
02:19:55.070 --> 02:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
running um running this kind of program
 
02:19:57.870 --> 02:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
but I what I'm seeing so far is that um
 
02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
yes our supporters uh working for a
 
02:20:01.710 --> 02:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
nonprofit I work for rights and
 
02:20:03.790 --> 02:20:03.800 align:start position:0%
democracy and I am a registered lobbyist
 
02:20:07.349 --> 02:20:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire um just
 
02:20:10.389 --> 02:20:10.399 align:start position:0%
want to be clear about that um a lot of
 
02:20:13.710 --> 02:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
my job has been expressed uh by others
 
02:20:15.750 --> 02:20:15.760 align:start position:0%
that work in the nonprofit industry
 
02:20:18.550 --> 02:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
today we work with people who are being
 
02:20:21.630 --> 02:20:21.640 align:start position:0%
affected by the legislation that is
 
02:20:25.510 --> 02:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
being passed by the state and so uh many
 
02:20:27.510 --> 02:20:27.520 align:start position:0%
of those people are working during these
 
02:20:30.309 --> 02:20:30.319 align:start position:0%
hours and taking multiple you know a
 
02:20:32.429 --> 02:20:32.439 align:start position:0%
full day off instead of maybe only a
 
02:20:35.190 --> 02:20:35.200 align:start position:0%
half day or just rearranging their
 
02:20:37.830 --> 02:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
schedule to work different hours so I
 
02:20:39.469 --> 02:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
think this is good for democracy and
 
02:20:41.030 --> 02:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
it's good for the State of New Hampshire
 
02:20:43.790 --> 02:20:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I encourage everyone here to please
 
02:20:46.750 --> 02:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
support this bill thanks so much have a
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
02:21:25.550 --> 02:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
remotely from Randolph New Hampshire
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
which is in the southern part of Coos
 
02:21:30.630 --> 02:21:30.640 align:start position:0%
County my name is Kathleen Kelly
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
representing myself and I'm speaking in
 
02:21:36.630 --> 02:21:36.640 align:start position:0%
favor of HB
 
02:21:39.349 --> 02:21:39.359 align:start position:0%
558 the National Conference of state
 
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
legislators have done research on how to
 
02:21:47.670 --> 02:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
securely um do this kind of Technology
 
02:21:49.510 --> 02:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
they've identified the staffing needs
 
02:21:51.550 --> 02:21:51.560 align:start position:0%
the technology the applications that are
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
used Often by other states we should
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
have a law and a permanent rule that
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
participation in the general court
 
02:22:00.710 --> 02:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
committees and general legislative
 
02:22:03.910 --> 02:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
meetings are possible through online
 
02:22:06.429 --> 02:22:06.439 align:start position:0%
access or live cam or whatever we want
 
02:22:09.590 --> 02:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
to call it other than the brand name
 
02:22:12.389 --> 02:22:12.399 align:start position:0%
though the house rules can be changed by
 
02:22:16.190 --> 02:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
majority vote this year's legislature I
 
02:22:18.150 --> 02:22:18.160 align:start position:0%
don't think we'll be willing to consider
 
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
the safety and the accessibility of the
 
02:22:22.349 --> 02:22:22.359 align:start position:0%
legislative process as it moves
 
02:22:24.710 --> 02:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
forward as this bill suggests New
 
02:22:26.190 --> 02:22:26.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs to study the training
 
02:22:28.710 --> 02:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
needs the evaluation of Staffing
 
02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:31.280 align:start position:0%
technology and software that's available
 
02:22:32.790 --> 02:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
we do need to identify the
 
02:22:34.389 --> 02:22:34.399 align:start position:0%
administrative costs and look at other
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
states for
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
models but for me being able to
 
02:22:40.870 --> 02:22:40.880 align:start position:0%
participate today physically would
 
02:22:43.270 --> 02:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
require a 4-Hour round trip on a snowy
 
02:22:46.550 --> 02:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
day I'm a 65 year-old with a compromised
 
02:22:49.670 --> 02:22:49.680 align:start position:0%
health and I'm limiting my exposure to
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
covid I've had my first shot thank you
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
very much but um I'm not there yet and I
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
really am concerned about going out of
 
02:22:58.920 --> 02:23:00.190 align:start position:0%
really am concerned about going out of
my

02:23:00.190 --> 02:23:00.200 align:start position:0%
my
 
02:23:03.030 --> 02:23:03.040 align:start position:0%
bubble it also tests my driving ability
 
02:23:05.630 --> 02:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
as I get older there are many Community
 
02:23:08.590 --> 02:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
leaders older than I that are disabled
 
02:23:11.030 --> 02:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
or unable to drive to conquered for
 
02:23:13.270 --> 02:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
hearings they usually don't consider
 
02:23:16.550 --> 02:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
running for office for the same reason
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
there are no taxis and no Ubers from
 
02:23:21.349 --> 02:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
Coos to conquered what we normally do is
 
02:23:23.150 --> 02:23:23.160 align:start position:0%
call our neighbor and say hey I'm
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
going in fact my husband and I a few
 
02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
years ago were felt so strongly about a
 
02:23:32.910 --> 02:23:32.920 align:start position:0%
certain uh action being taken we drove
 
02:23:35.870 --> 02:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
six other active voters down to conquer
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
on a snowy winry day to speak on the
 
02:23:41.910 --> 02:23:41.920 align:start position:0%
bills on the way we experienced glare
 
02:23:44.950 --> 02:23:44.960 align:start position:0%
ice in Franconia Notch cars off on
 
02:23:47.030 --> 02:23:47.040 align:start position:0%
either side of the
 
02:23:52.150 --> 02:23:52.160 align:start position:0%
road um many of my fellow neighbors have
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
talked about being able to participate
 
02:23:56.990 --> 02:23:57.000 align:start position:0%
this year as a wonderful thing they've
 
02:24:01.389 --> 02:24:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:04.830 --> 02:24:04.840 align:start position:0%
online my son is a newly elected young
 
02:24:06.910 --> 02:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
representative for New Hampshire in this
 
02:24:09.230 --> 02:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
region and he's managing a small
 
02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
business working full-time and doing his
 
02:24:13.870 --> 02:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
duties as a representative for the
 
02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:16.760 align:start position:0%
Berlin region he's been able to
 
02:24:18.550 --> 02:24:18.560 align:start position:0%
participate in more committee meetings
 
02:24:21.070 --> 02:24:21.080 align:start position:0%
because of the online access
 
02:24:23.429 --> 02:24:23.439 align:start position:0%
he does have to travel though tomorrow
 
02:24:24.790 --> 02:24:24.800 align:start position:0%
during a
 
02:24:27.349 --> 02:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
snowstorm and Wednesday to physically
 
02:24:29.830 --> 02:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
attend a house meeting this is an
 
02:24:31.950 --> 02:24:31.960 align:start position:0%
unnecessary risk to his life of course
 
02:24:34.030 --> 02:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
I'm his mom and I think that's
 
02:24:36.670 --> 02:24:36.680 align:start position:0%
awful but I've worried about our other
 
02:24:38.910 --> 02:24:38.920 align:start position:0%
Coos leaders over the several years
 
02:24:41.510 --> 02:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
because a they're older they have been
 
02:24:44.150 --> 02:24:44.160 align:start position:0%
older and they have to drive several
 
02:24:48.590 --> 02:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
days in a week in January February and
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
March many Co-op us um disabled veterans
 
02:24:54.990 --> 02:24:55.000 align:start position:0%
and Community leaders are unable to run
 
02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
for office or to speak to bills because
 
02:25:01.550 --> 02:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
they can't drive and they're brilliant
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
and they're wonderful people that should
 
02:25:06.349 --> 02:25:06.359 align:start position:0%
be heard we have over 10% of the house
 
02:25:09.309 --> 02:25:09.319 align:start position:0%
now I think under the age of 40 and I
 
02:25:11.230 --> 02:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
assume they're all raising families and
 
02:25:13.910 --> 02:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
working hard New Hampshire will be a
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
better place with their voices included
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
in the process through these tools that
 
02:25:20.870 --> 02:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
are available readily and
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
securely many other states are further
 
02:25:25.190 --> 02:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
along than New Hampshire so it can be
 
02:25:28.150 --> 02:25:28.160 align:start position:0%
done please support HB
 
02:25:30.750 --> 02:25:30.760 align:start position:0%

ca5 which is listed
 
02:26:35.910 --> 02:26:35.920 align:start position:0%
as provision for compensation of
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
legislators to be
 
02:26:42.429 --> 02:26:42.439 align:start position:0%
removed by Uh
 
02:26:42.439 --> 02:26:45.429 align:start position:0%
removed by Uh
current

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:45.439 align:start position:0%
current
 
02:26:48.870 --> 02:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional uh with that I will call
 
02:26:50.750 --> 02:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor
 
02:26:56.550 --> 02:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:02.590 --> 02:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:06.230 --> 02:27:06.240 align:start position:0%
there can you hear me yes we can welcome
 
02:27:08.710 --> 02:27:08.720 align:start position:0%
to legislative Administration thanks
 
02:27:10.870 --> 02:27:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's lovely to see you again um chair
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
Hill and members of the legislative
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
Administration committee
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
um this bill is very simple um wait let
 
02:27:21.230 --> 02:27:21.240 align:start position:0%
me back up um for the record my name is
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
representative Rebecca McWilliams I
 
02:27:25.309 --> 02:27:25.319 align:start position:0%
represent marac 27 which is the west
 
02:27:29.389 --> 02:27:29.399 align:start position:0%
side of conquer um so this bill is very
 
02:27:31.830 --> 02:27:31.840 align:start position:0%
simple um perhaps deceptively simple
 
02:27:33.670 --> 02:27:33.680 align:start position:0%
because I'm sure there are many Lively
 
02:27:36.710 --> 02:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
debate topics that could be uh pulled
 
02:27:39.630 --> 02:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
out from this bill but uh in essence all
 
02:27:41.429 --> 02:27:41.439 align:start position:0%
this bill does is
 
02:27:44.429 --> 02:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
decouple legislator pay from the New
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Constitution it pulls it
 
02:27:51.830 --> 02:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
out um and so as you already know uh
 
02:27:53.790 --> 02:27:53.800 align:start position:0%
other key government officials such as
 
02:27:58.190 --> 02:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
our governor um have their pay as an RSA
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
um it falls under RSA
 
02:28:04.830 --> 02:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
94 um and it is managed uh through a
 
02:28:08.990 --> 02:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
series of uh brackets for uh how the pay
 
02:28:12.550 --> 02:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
is in uh highest and lowest numbers they
 
02:28:13.990 --> 02:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
get updated from time to time for
 
02:28:16.030 --> 02:28:16.040 align:start position:0%
inflation but are appropriately
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
addressed uh for what our changing
 
02:28:20.870 --> 02:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
economy and needs have happen in the
 
02:28:24.910 --> 02:28:24.920 align:start position:0%
state um so there are plenty of reasons
 
02:28:27.190 --> 02:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
why legislator compensation should be
 
02:28:30.070 --> 02:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
taken out of the Constitution um and as
 
02:28:31.070 --> 02:28:31.080 align:start position:0%
I said there are plenty of other
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
arguments that could happen ancillary to
 
02:28:34.830 --> 02:28:34.840 align:start position:0%
this uh but I just want to give some
 
02:28:37.110 --> 02:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
personal testimony as to what that means
 
02:28:40.309 --> 02:28:40.319 align:start position:0%
to me as a legislator and representative
 
02:28:44.670 --> 02:28:44.680 align:start position:0%
um so I'm 38 years old I'm under 40 so
 
02:28:47.309 --> 02:28:47.319 align:start position:0%
I'm considered one of those young reps
 
02:28:48.910 --> 02:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
that was mentioned in the prior Bill
 
02:28:53.550 --> 02:28:53.560 align:start position:0%
testimony um um I have three children um
 
02:28:55.830 --> 02:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
my husband and I run a family business
 
02:28:58.790 --> 02:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
we run a farm um and I also work off
 
02:29:00.429 --> 02:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
Farm as an
 
02:29:03.710 --> 02:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
attorney uh I'm able to serve as a
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
legislator because I am fortunate enough
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
to be self-employed and to be able to
 
02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:13.120 align:start position:0%
structure my time in order to uh serve
 
02:29:15.910 --> 02:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
remotely this year uh but when we don't
 
02:29:18.590 --> 02:29:18.600 align:start position:0%
have covid going on uh actually attend
 
02:29:20.429 --> 02:29:20.439 align:start position:0%
things at the state house and and
 
02:29:23.349 --> 02:29:23.359 align:start position:0%
involved uh for many of my peers that is
 
02:29:27.349 --> 02:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
not possible um and if I were to take a
 
02:29:30.349 --> 02:29:30.359 align:start position:0%
40-hour a week job um which considering
 
02:29:34.030 --> 02:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
covid and financial issues Could Happen
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
um it would be unlikely that I could
 
02:29:38.389 --> 02:29:38.399 align:start position:0%
both work 40 hours a week as a
 
02:29:40.910 --> 02:29:40.920 align:start position:0%
38-year-old and also serve as a
 
02:29:44.630 --> 02:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative so um realistically I'm
 
02:29:46.510 --> 02:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
probably considered to be in my Prime
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
earning years right now this is the time
 
02:29:51.630 --> 02:29:51.640 align:start position:0%
when I should be investing in an IRA for
 
02:29:55.389 --> 02:29:55.399 align:start position:0%
a 1K saving for retirement and the
 
02:29:57.710 --> 02:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
reality is it's a huge time commitment
 
02:29:59.830 --> 02:29:59.840 align:start position:0%
for me to do what I do at the state
 
02:30:02.230 --> 02:30:02.240 align:start position:0%
house and I love it and I do it because
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
I care about my constituents but there
 
02:30:06.710 --> 02:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
is certainly a cost because that time
 
02:30:08.870 --> 02:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
that I spend could be time that I'm
 
02:30:10.870 --> 02:30:10.880 align:start position:0%
spending elsewhere putting away money
 
02:30:14.349 --> 02:30:14.359 align:start position:0%
for the future so understanding that and
 
02:30:15.670 --> 02:30:15.680 align:start position:0%
understanding that the work that we all
 
02:30:17.870 --> 02:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
do as Representatives should be
 
02:30:19.990 --> 02:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
compensated and of course our
 
02:30:21.590 --> 02:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
forefathers also thought that it should
 
02:30:25.429 --> 02:30:25.439 align:start position:0%
be compensated they put $200 in the
 
02:30:27.790 --> 02:30:27.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution uh so there was this intent
 
02:30:30.910 --> 02:30:30.920 align:start position:0%
to compensate it's just it's been so
 
02:30:33.269 --> 02:30:33.279 align:start position:0%
difficult for us to change that um it's
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
become a bit of a tradition that we're
 
02:30:38.429 --> 02:30:38.439 align:start position:0%
semi volunteer we're proud to serve and
 
02:30:41.590 --> 02:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
the $200 it's not about the money well
 
02:30:43.750 --> 02:30:43.760 align:start position:0%
I'm here to say that because it's not
 
02:30:46.389 --> 02:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
about the money there is an avoided cost
 
02:30:49.389 --> 02:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
um meaning I'm not putting away my time
 
02:30:50.990 --> 02:30:51.000 align:start position:0%
is not being put towards putting money
 
02:30:53.429 --> 02:30:53.439 align:start position:0%
away for retirement and that's true for
 
02:30:55.150 --> 02:30:55.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of reps who have to make that
 
02:30:58.110 --> 02:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
decision between working a day job or
 
02:31:00.309 --> 02:31:00.319 align:start position:0%
structuring their time and and serving
 
02:31:02.710 --> 02:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
in the legislature and I'm not here to
 
02:31:05.070 --> 02:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
insult anyone who is retired and serving
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
on the legislature I mean if I were
 
02:31:09.110 --> 02:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
retired I probably would serve on the
 
02:31:11.830 --> 02:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
legislature too because I love it um but
 
02:31:13.830 --> 02:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's not of course the situation for
 
02:31:15.349 --> 02:31:15.359 align:start position:0%
every single person who would like to
 
02:31:17.910 --> 02:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
serve in the state so this bill is
 
02:31:20.510 --> 02:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
really intended to provide the means by
 
02:31:23.590 --> 02:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
decoupling pay from the Constitution to
 
02:31:25.389 --> 02:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
at some point bring up a bill to
 
02:31:27.950 --> 02:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
actually compensate legislators
 
02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
appropriately under chapter 94 for what
 
02:31:33.230 --> 02:31:33.240 align:start position:0%
they're doing that's not what this bill
 
02:31:35.910 --> 02:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
does all it does is take out $200 it's
 
02:31:38.670 --> 02:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
simply taking a knife and striking that
 
02:31:40.110 --> 02:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
I also want to be very clear because
 
02:31:41.870 --> 02:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
I've had plenty of questions about this
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
it does not touch mileage mileage
 
02:31:46.870 --> 02:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
remains enshrined in the Constitution
 
02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
and so if someone is an elected senator
 
02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
representative and is driving to conquer
 
02:31:53.870 --> 02:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
they still get their mileage so I'm
 
02:31:55.550 --> 02:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
happy to take
 
02:32:01.269 --> 02:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:04.429 --> 02:32:04.439 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
02:32:07.070 --> 02:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
testimony uh chair will call
 
02:32:21.510 --> 02:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:23.469 --> 02:32:23.479 align:start position:0%
there he
 
02:32:25.790 --> 02:32:25.800 align:start position:0%
is thank you very much Mr chair it's
 
02:32:29.110 --> 02:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
good to see you again um I not much has
 
02:32:30.469 --> 02:32:30.479 align:start position:0%
changed in the last 10 minutes I
 
02:32:31.950 --> 02:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
continue to be representative Timothy
 
02:32:34.389 --> 02:32:34.399 align:start position:0%
Horan I continue to represent uh raford
 
02:32:38.910 --> 02:32:38.920 align:start position:0%
County 6 towns of uh Durham and Madbury
 
02:32:40.550 --> 02:32:40.560 align:start position:0%
home of home of your distinguished
 
02:32:44.349 --> 02:32:44.359 align:start position:0%
ranking uh ranking minority member um
 
02:32:47.230 --> 02:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
and U representative MC Williams yeah
 
02:32:50.030 --> 02:32:50.040 align:start position:0%
she explained it perfectly it just takes
 
02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:52.640 align:start position:0%
out the part about um setting the comp
 
02:32:55.349 --> 02:32:55.359 align:start position:0%
the compensation in the uh in the
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
Constitution that would enable us to uh
 
02:33:00.190 --> 02:33:00.200 align:start position:0%
it uh to use an expression which our
 
02:33:02.550 --> 02:33:02.560 align:start position:0%
predecessors in the mid 18 mid 1880s
 
02:33:03.630 --> 02:33:03.640 align:start position:0%
would have understood because it
 
02:33:05.630 --> 02:33:05.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be coined until the 1960s but
 
02:33:07.870 --> 02:33:07.880 align:start position:0%
anyway legislative heart salaries were
 
02:33:10.590 --> 02:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
hardwired at $100 a year as we know all
 
02:33:13.070 --> 02:33:13.080 align:start position:0%
too well into the state constitution in
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
1887 and um actually ironically in 1887
 
02:33:19.030 --> 02:33:19.040 align:start position:0%
throughout the 188 there actually was no
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
inflation but so this seemed like
 
02:33:24.349 --> 02:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
probably a less ridiculous idea back
 
02:33:26.590 --> 02:33:26.600 align:start position:0%
then uh back then than it does now but
 
02:33:28.510 --> 02:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
even then that was not really a smart
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
idea and there was not much money even
 
02:33:30.560 --> 02:33:31.510 align:start position:0%
idea and there was not much money even
in

02:33:31.510 --> 02:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
19887 we made um the uh governor
 
02:33:37.510 --> 02:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
governor Charles Sawyer the governor at
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
the time made uh $2,000 a year which is
 
02:33:43.269 --> 02:33:43.279 align:start position:0%
equivalent about 55,000 in today's uh
 
02:33:45.870 --> 02:33:45.880 align:start position:0%
dollars so if we were paid 120th of
 
02:33:48.710 --> 02:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
Chu's salary we making
 
02:33:48.720 --> 02:33:50.349 align:start position:0%
Chu's salary we making
7,185

02:33:50.349 --> 02:33:50.359 align:start position:0%
7,185
 
02:33:54.230 --> 02:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
$522 per year which uh still isn't much
 
02:33:55.550 --> 02:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
in fact that's less than half of what
 
02:33:57.349 --> 02:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
the executive counselors make and that's
 
02:34:01.429 --> 02:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
also uh that that's a job that's
 
02:34:03.990 --> 02:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
probably not uh twice as difficult as
 
02:34:04.000 --> 02:34:05.389 align:start position:0%
probably not uh twice as difficult as
ours

02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
ours
 
02:34:08.550 --> 02:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
um and it we uh doesn't mean we can't
 
02:34:10.150 --> 02:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
pay ourselves a salary we do it in
 
02:34:13.230 --> 02:34:13.240 align:start position:0%
statute law and actually uh in RSA 24 we
 
02:34:14.910 --> 02:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
already set our own compensation for our
 
02:34:16.510 --> 02:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
service with the county with our
 
02:34:18.070 --> 02:34:18.080 align:start position:0%
respective County delegations and
 
02:34:20.670 --> 02:34:20.680 align:start position:0%
there's actually a rather using floor
 
02:34:23.710 --> 02:34:23.720 align:start position:0%
fight I saw and I was here in 2015 and I
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
actually don't remember it I was
 
02:34:26.309 --> 02:34:26.319 align:start position:0%
probably hanging around the anti room or
 
02:34:27.469 --> 02:34:27.479 align:start position:0%
something but there was like a long
 
02:34:28.990 --> 02:34:29.000 align:start position:0%
floor fight because there was a bill to
 
02:34:32.389 --> 02:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
raise Coos County to $50 which finally
 
02:34:34.630 --> 02:34:34.640 align:start position:0%
finally passed but it it it took several
 
02:34:36.630 --> 02:34:36.640 align:start position:0%
reconsiderations and all kinds of things
 
02:34:38.190 --> 02:34:38.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of people were very incensed
 
02:34:40.830 --> 02:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
by the idea of like paying even the 10
 
02:34:42.429 --> 02:34:42.439 align:start position:0%
members from Coos County more than
 
02:34:44.870 --> 02:34:44.880 align:start position:0%
they're making already um but I think
 
02:34:47.269 --> 02:34:47.279 align:start position:0%
it's a good idea we actually I'm not a
 
02:34:49.070 --> 02:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
lawyer unlike rent MC Williams but the
 
02:34:50.950 --> 02:34:50.960 align:start position:0%
way I read the law is if we did nothing
 
02:34:54.230 --> 02:34:54.240 align:start position:0%
just cacr passed it was approved by the
 
02:34:55.710 --> 02:34:55.720 align:start position:0%
voters and if we did nothing at all I
 
02:34:57.429 --> 02:34:57.439 align:start position:0%
think we'd still get our $100 a year
 
02:35:00.269 --> 02:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
because there's uh provisions and
 
02:35:01.469 --> 02:35:01.479 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly there' probably be some
 
02:35:03.030 --> 02:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
lawsuit from somebody who wanted to take
 
02:35:04.870 --> 02:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
away our $100 a year but I think there's
 
02:35:09.190 --> 02:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
revision we can't lower um we uh we have
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
to like say what the salary for position
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
is um in advance we can't can't
 
02:35:17.590 --> 02:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
arbitrarily lower it um but anyway so be
 
02:35:20.670 --> 02:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
controversial um you know I
 
02:35:22.429 --> 02:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
but it's better than the status quo you
 
02:35:24.230 --> 02:35:24.240 align:start position:0%
know it's it's absurdly low and it's
 
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
makes impossible for most citizens to
 
02:35:28.750 --> 02:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
serve it's uh I mean although I usually
 
02:35:31.590 --> 02:35:31.600 align:start position:0%
tell people uh people often call me $100
 
02:35:34.030 --> 02:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
here silly I'm worth every penny of it
 
02:35:36.630 --> 02:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
although I um pres company excluded I do
 
02:35:37.950 --> 02:35:37.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes say like I'm not sure if all
 
02:35:39.830 --> 02:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
my colleagues are but all of you are
 
02:35:41.710 --> 02:35:41.720 align:start position:0%
worth well more than $100 a year so you
 
02:35:44.469 --> 02:35:44.479 align:start position:0%
all do great work so um one thing about
 
02:35:46.269 --> 02:35:46.279 align:start position:0%
mileage it doesn't change anything to do
 
02:35:50.070 --> 02:35:50.080 align:start position:0%
with mileage and uh before looking the
 
02:35:51.950 --> 02:35:51.960 align:start position:0%
old journals I've only seen a few of
 
02:35:54.110 --> 02:35:54.120 align:start position:0%
them but uh mileage formul were much
 
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
more complicated and adjusted for
 
02:35:57.389 --> 02:35:57.399 align:start position:0%
inflation apparently much more generous
 
02:35:59.630 --> 02:35:59.640 align:start position:0%
than we are now and the the previous
 
02:36:01.309 --> 02:36:01.319 align:start position:0%
Bill somebody mentioned like having to
 
02:36:02.670 --> 02:36:02.680 align:start position:0%
they an Uber to the state house to
 
02:36:05.670 --> 02:36:05.680 align:start position:0%
testify we actually had something to the
 
02:36:07.429 --> 02:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
equivalent to a free Uber account we
 
02:36:09.750 --> 02:36:09.760 align:start position:0%
used to get in 1909 apparently we had
 
02:36:13.070 --> 02:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
passes that would uh allow us to ride
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
well the steam railroads so I guess you
 
02:36:16.830 --> 02:36:16.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't ride the trolleys the street
 
02:36:18.309 --> 02:36:18.319 align:start position:0%
cars they had back then so we could ride
 
02:36:19.950 --> 02:36:19.960 align:start position:0%
the railroads that conquered for free
 
02:36:23.469 --> 02:36:23.479 align:start position:0%
and we got 20 cents a mile if we had to
 
02:36:25.269 --> 02:36:25.279 align:start position:0%
walk more than two miles to the train
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
station which uh big that'd be a very
 
02:36:30.230 --> 02:36:30.240 align:start position:0%
sweet deal if we all got a free Uber
 
02:36:31.990 --> 02:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
pass to go to conquer but that's not how
 
02:36:34.389 --> 02:36:34.399 align:start position:0%
it works anyway and um there were
 
02:36:36.349 --> 02:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
Landmark Supreme Court decisions for
 
02:36:39.110 --> 02:36:39.120 align:start position:0%
1949 and 1961 which established that
 
02:36:40.750 --> 02:36:40.760 align:start position:0%
legislative mileage payments must have a
 
02:36:42.590 --> 02:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable relation to cost of travel so
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
that's why it's uh since 1963 I think
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
the law is pretty much the same it is
 
02:36:50.550 --> 02:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
now that we we Peg it to the Federal
 
02:36:52.590 --> 02:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
Federal mileage rate and even then both
 
02:36:55.510 --> 02:36:55.520 align:start position:0%
those actually there one decision 49
 
02:36:56.510 --> 02:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
they're actually two different ones in
 
02:36:59.790 --> 02:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
1961 Supreme Court Justices all observed
 
02:37:01.910 --> 02:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
that the $100 a year salary was
 
02:37:03.590 --> 02:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily low and that it also
 
02:37:06.190 --> 02:37:06.200 align:start position:0%
made it hard for many citizens to serve
 
02:37:09.070 --> 02:37:09.080 align:start position:0%
so that was like uh this has seemed
 
02:37:12.389 --> 02:37:12.399 align:start position:0%
ridiculously low for for decades um so
 
02:37:14.469 --> 02:37:14.479 align:start position:0%
as as I mentioned before is not even
 
02:37:16.950 --> 02:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
that tremendously High even back then in
 
02:37:20.990 --> 02:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
1987 so that's uh so I think this so I
 
02:37:22.710 --> 02:37:22.720 align:start position:0%
think we should do this CA I think we
 
02:37:24.990 --> 02:37:25.000 align:start position:0%
should pass this cacr and then we should
 
02:37:26.830 --> 02:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh and that would be a very difficult
 
02:37:28.269 --> 02:37:28.279 align:start position:0%
debate um lots of people would be
 
02:37:33.309 --> 02:37:33.319 align:start position:0%
opposed to it but we we in uh 2023 when
 
02:37:36.990 --> 02:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
we reconvene um I I hope to be part of
 
02:37:40.070 --> 02:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
the debate in 2023 but we don't know no
 
02:37:40.990 --> 02:37:41.000 align:start position:0%
none of us know what's goinging to the
 
02:37:44.710 --> 02:37:44.720 align:start position:0%
Future in 2023 we should uh you know set
 
02:37:46.590 --> 02:37:46.600 align:start position:0%
some sort of legislation that uh sets
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
our salary at a realistic level um even
 
02:37:51.910 --> 02:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
if even if we paid 120 what Su makes a
 
02:37:53.070 --> 02:37:53.080 align:start position:0%
little over
 
02:37:56.030 --> 02:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
$7,000 a year we would still be one of
 
02:37:57.670 --> 02:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
the lowest paid legislates in the
 
02:38:00.469 --> 02:38:00.479 align:start position:0%
country so uh we would our tradition
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
that would not uh so our tradition would
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
still continue if we did what they if we
 
02:38:07.990 --> 02:38:08.000 align:start position:0%
pegged it to the level that we did back
 
02:38:12.670 --> 02:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
in 201 1887 but um so that's uh that's
 
02:38:15.110 --> 02:38:15.120 align:start position:0%
why I I favor this this is makes just
 
02:38:17.030 --> 02:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
one change to how our legislature
 
02:38:19.190 --> 02:38:19.200 align:start position:0%
structured it's uh which I think is a I
 
02:38:20.830 --> 02:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
think would be a crucial change and if
 
02:38:22.150 --> 02:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
anybody doesn't want to take the higher
 
02:38:24.230 --> 02:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
salary they're free to uh they're free
 
02:38:27.389 --> 02:38:27.399 align:start position:0%
to donate at a charity so um I certainly
 
02:38:30.429 --> 02:38:30.439 align:start position:0%
happily cast $200 check
 
02:38:33.230 --> 02:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
every every January every even numbered
 
02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
year like I did I don't I'm not ashamed
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
of it but some people may be they can do
 
02:38:38.950 --> 02:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
what they want but I think we should I
 
02:38:40.510 --> 02:38:40.520 align:start position:0%
think we should pay ourselves a uh
 
02:38:42.590 --> 02:38:42.600 align:start position:0%

02:40:31.110 --> 02:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
morning Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
committee um some members of this
 
02:40:34.710 --> 02:40:34.720 align:start position:0%
committee are lawyers and have more
 
02:40:36.230 --> 02:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
trust for the court than those of us who
 
02:40:38.309 --> 02:40:38.319 align:start position:0%
come from different backgrounds I ask
 
02:40:39.830 --> 02:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
all of you to listen with an open mind
 
02:40:41.550 --> 02:40:41.560 align:start position:0%
and consider the clear language of the
 
02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:43.840 align:start position:0%
people's Constitution that's the supreme
 
02:40:45.309 --> 02:40:45.319 align:start position:0%
law we've been given and have one an
 
02:40:48.110 --> 02:40:48.120 align:start position:0%
note to as legislators we have no Duty
 
02:40:50.950 --> 02:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
or allegiance to decision of the courts
 
02:40:53.070 --> 02:40:53.080 align:start position:0%
I come from an engineering background in
 
02:40:54.550 --> 02:40:54.560 align:start position:0%
my business if you have to fix something
 
02:40:56.269 --> 02:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
repeatedly it's an indication there's a
 
02:40:59.070 --> 02:40:59.080 align:start position:0%
flaw in the design something is broken
 
02:41:00.550 --> 02:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
in a system where we keep passing
 
02:41:02.110 --> 02:41:02.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendments to restore
 
02:41:04.830 --> 02:41:04.840 align:start position:0%
what we already had to begin I'll read
 
02:41:07.110 --> 02:41:07.120 align:start position:0%
article 7 of our Constitution State
 
02:41:09.269 --> 02:41:09.279 align:start position:0%
sovereignty the people of the state
 
02:41:10.950 --> 02:41:10.960 align:start position:0%
shall have sole and exclusive right of
 
02:41:12.750 --> 02:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
governing themselves as a free Sovereign
 
02:41:14.910 --> 02:41:14.920 align:start position:0%
and independent state and do forever and
 
02:41:18.269 --> 02:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
here Hereafter shall exercise and enjoy
 
02:41:20.429 --> 02:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
every Power Juris and right pertaining
 
02:41:22.070 --> 02:41:22.080 align:start position:0%
there to which is not or may not
 
02:41:24.429 --> 02:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
Hereafter be by them expressly delegated
 
02:41:26.510 --> 02:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the United States of America in
 
02:41:26.520 --> 02:41:27.630 align:start position:0%
to the United States of America in
Congress

02:41:27.630 --> 02:41:27.640 align:start position:0%
Congress
 
02:41:30.030 --> 02:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
assembled over recent decades we've had
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
to amend our constitution numerous times
 
02:41:34.070 --> 02:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
rather than changing the Constitution
 
02:41:35.550 --> 02:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
most of these recent amendments simply
 
02:41:37.070 --> 02:41:37.080 align:start position:0%
restored what had been the status quo
 
02:41:39.429 --> 02:41:39.439 align:start position:0%
before a decision of the courts these
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
include taxpayer standing the right to
 
02:41:44.910 --> 02:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
privacy articles 2 a 2B Etc there's an
 
02:41:47.110 --> 02:41:47.120 align:start position:0%
inherent conflict between an activist
 
02:41:50.510 --> 02:41:50.520 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and uh State sovereignty is
 
02:41:53.349 --> 02:41:53.359 align:start position:0%
defined in article 7 a Fickle Judiciary
 
02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:54.720 align:start position:0%
that welcomed taxpayers standing in
 
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
clamont and then denied it when
 
02:41:58.349 --> 02:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
taxpayers suited over a city's tax cap
 
02:41:59.950 --> 02:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
is not the kind of enduring and
 
02:42:01.269 --> 02:42:01.279 align:start position:0%
predictable institution that should
 
02:42:03.630 --> 02:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
govern New Hampshire citizens although
 
02:42:05.269 --> 02:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
the clutch claimed to be using precedent
 
02:42:07.710 --> 02:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
as basis for their decisions the real
 
02:42:09.469 --> 02:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
reality is that they pick and choose
 
02:42:11.469 --> 02:42:11.479 align:start position:0%
their precedents in the present state of
 
02:42:13.469 --> 02:42:13.479 align:start position:0%
the world it's unrealistic to expect the
 
02:42:15.670 --> 02:42:15.680 align:start position:0%
courts not to be politicized presently
 
02:42:17.070 --> 02:42:17.080 align:start position:0%
the people and their representatives
 
02:42:18.510 --> 02:42:18.520 align:start position:0%
have two ways of dealing with courts
 
02:42:20.030 --> 02:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
when they go astray in constitutional
 
02:42:23.150 --> 02:42:23.160 align:start position:0%
matters Amendment and impeachment what
 
02:42:25.910 --> 02:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
I'm proposing in article 11 or cacr 11
 
02:42:27.309 --> 02:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
is a less laborious method for the
 
02:42:29.429 --> 02:42:29.439 align:start position:0%
people to restore the constitution in
 
02:42:30.950 --> 02:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
cases where the courts have made a wrong
 
02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:33.600 align:start position:0%
decision on a constitutional
 
02:42:36.349 --> 02:42:36.359 align:start position:0%
matter um article seven cited above is
 
02:42:37.990 --> 02:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
the plain English of our constitution
 
02:42:39.269 --> 02:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
words that aren't found in our
 
02:42:41.630 --> 02:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
Constitution are precedent stereid
 
02:42:43.990 --> 02:42:44.000 align:start position:0%
deceases and co-equal these are legal
 
02:42:46.349 --> 02:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
constructs created by courts they may be
 
02:42:47.750 --> 02:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
useful to the courts but they are
 
02:42:49.590 --> 02:42:49.600 align:start position:0%
clearly inferior to the people's
 
02:42:51.510 --> 02:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
Constitution when they are used by the
 
02:42:53.269 --> 02:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
courts to subvert the plain language of
 
02:42:55.150 --> 02:42:55.160 align:start position:0%
the Constitution they are
 
02:42:57.990 --> 02:42:58.000 align:start position:0%
anathema uh from quoting from Wikipedia
 
02:42:59.469 --> 02:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
one of the most important roles of
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
precedent is to resolve ambigu
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
ambiguities in other legal texts such as
 
02:43:07.910 --> 02:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
Constitution statutes and regulations
 
02:43:10.070 --> 02:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
the process involves first and foremost
 
02:43:11.670 --> 02:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
consultation of the plain language of
 
02:43:14.349 --> 02:43:14.359 align:start position:0%
the text once again plain language of
 
02:43:15.670 --> 02:43:15.680 align:start position:0%
the text as enlightened by the
 
02:43:17.790 --> 02:43:17.800 align:start position:0%
Legislative history of enactment
 
02:43:19.630 --> 02:43:19.640 align:start position:0%
subsequent precedent and experience with
 
02:43:22.469 --> 02:43:22.479 align:start position:0%
new interpretations of similar text it's
 
02:43:23.870 --> 02:43:23.880 align:start position:0%
said that precedents make the law
 
02:43:26.150 --> 02:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
predictable and knowable to lay people
 
02:43:28.349 --> 02:43:28.359 align:start position:0%
however the converse is often true if
 
02:43:29.750 --> 02:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
the courts are free to pick and choose
 
02:43:31.630 --> 02:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
among precedents and to ignore pieces of
 
02:43:33.510 --> 02:43:33.520 align:start position:0%
the Constitution and statutes that don't
 
02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
suit their whim then the use of
 
02:43:37.510 --> 02:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
precedents to justify their position is
 
02:43:38.950 --> 02:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
essentially an overturning of the
 
02:43:41.790 --> 02:43:41.800 align:start position:0%
Constitution and elected government the
 
02:43:43.309 --> 02:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
Court's addicts full of precedents
 
02:43:44.790 --> 02:43:44.800 align:start position:0%
aren't limited to those created by New
 
02:43:47.190 --> 02:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire courts in deciding Clairmont
 
02:43:48.389 --> 02:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
the court looked to our neighbor to the
 
02:43:49.950 --> 02:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
South to find a precedent that suited
 
02:43:52.590 --> 02:43:52.600 align:start position:0%
their wi by that standard when any Court
 
02:43:54.429 --> 02:43:54.439 align:start position:0%
anywhere creates a precedent then any
 
02:43:55.870 --> 02:43:55.880 align:start position:0%
other court may use the invented
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
precedent to overturn their State's
 
02:44:00.309 --> 02:44:00.319 align:start position:0%
Constitution when our constitutions were
 
02:44:04.070 --> 02:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
first enacted in 1784 and 1789 they were
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
the philosophy of freedom and
 
02:44:07.950 --> 02:44:07.960 align:start position:0%
self-government put into words to quote
 
02:44:10.150 --> 02:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
Thomas Payne one of the philosophers of
 
02:44:12.190 --> 02:44:12.200 align:start position:0%
that time precedent law is one of the
 
02:44:14.510 --> 02:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
viol systems that can be set up here we
 
02:44:17.309 --> 02:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
are 237 years later and our constitution
 
02:44:19.830 --> 02:44:19.840 align:start position:0%
has been supplanted by President law
 
02:44:21.349 --> 02:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
people's Representatives have become
 
02:44:23.830 --> 02:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
inferior to unelected judges I ask the
 
02:44:25.389 --> 02:44:25.399 align:start position:0%
committee to vote off to pass on the
 
02:44:27.510 --> 02:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
cacr and take one step toward ruring
 
02:44:29.070 --> 02:44:29.080 align:start position:0%
self-government and the people's
 
02:44:30.990 --> 02:44:31.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution I ask the members of the
 
02:44:32.389 --> 02:44:32.399 align:start position:0%
committee to work with me toward this
 
02:44:34.469 --> 02:44:34.479 align:start position:0%
end although it may not happen this year
 
02:44:36.190 --> 02:44:36.200 align:start position:0%
or this session it's a goal that we need
 
02:44:38.870 --> 02:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
to achieve to return to self-government
 
02:44:40.510 --> 02:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
02:44:41.990 --> 02:44:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee that's all I
 
02:44:49.389 --> 02:44:49.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:52.150 --> 02:44:52.160 align:start position:0%
to us yes I did I emailed it to the
 
02:44:55.750 --> 02:44:55.760 align:start position:0%
committee an hour or so ago
 
02:44:58.710 --> 02:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
actually we I'll quickly scrambling I
 
02:45:00.910 --> 02:45:00.920 align:start position:0%
didn't see it in my email I didn't know
 
02:45:03.190 --> 02:45:03.200 align:start position:0%
if anyone else did
 
02:45:05.950 --> 02:45:05.960 align:start position:0%
um but at any rate thank you are you
 
02:45:08.110 --> 02:45:08.120 align:start position:0%
willing to take questions
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
certainly are there any questions for
 
02:45:13.389 --> 02:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
the representative in the committee
 
02:45:19.150 --> 02:45:19.160 align:start position:0%

02:45:49.910 --> 02:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:54.269 --> 02:45:54.279 align:start position:0%

02:46:03.550 --> 02:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
minute to unmute yes my name is John
 
02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
Tobin thank you very much for
 
02:46:06.590 --> 02:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
recognizing me and giving me this
 
02:46:09.030 --> 02:46:09.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity um I'm a retired lawyer I
 
02:46:12.349 --> 02:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
was also a volunteer Court mediator um
 
02:46:15.630 --> 02:46:15.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm I submitted some testimony to uh
 
02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
all of you an hour or so ago by email um
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
and I won't repeat all of that I hope
 
02:46:26.070 --> 02:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:29.429 --> 02:46:29.439 align:start position:0%
uh and um I want to speak briefly about
 
02:46:31.230 --> 02:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
the separation of powers problems with
 
02:46:33.230 --> 02:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
this proposal but more importantly the
 
02:46:36.469 --> 02:46:36.479 align:start position:0%
Practical problems um we have a system
 
02:46:38.230 --> 02:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
of separation of powers and system of
 
02:46:40.389 --> 02:46:40.399 align:start position:0%
checks and balances which has worked
 
02:46:43.710 --> 02:46:43.720 align:start position:0%
well and it inevit there's inevitably
 
02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:46.439 align:start position:0%
some tension um and competition between
 
02:46:48.550 --> 02:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch and the judicial
 
02:46:51.510 --> 02:46:51.520 align:start position:0%
branch and the executive branch um but
 
02:46:54.510 --> 02:46:54.520 align:start position:0%
your role as uh the legislature is
 
02:46:57.070 --> 02:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
really in lots of ways the the largest
 
02:46:59.389 --> 02:46:59.399 align:start position:0%
and most expansive one you set policy
 
02:47:02.349 --> 02:47:02.359 align:start position:0%
you create law um you create the budget
 
02:47:04.990 --> 02:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
you determine the structure of state
 
02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
government the court role is is much
 
02:47:10.750 --> 02:47:10.760 align:start position:0%
more circumscribed it decides specific
 
02:47:12.990 --> 02:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
disputes between parties in particular
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
cases by determining the facts and then
 
02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
applying the law um and in
 
02:47:23.110 --> 02:47:23.120 align:start position:0%
many many cases all the time the courts
 
02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
apply the Constitution they apply it in
 
02:47:29.230 --> 02:47:29.240 align:start position:0%
criminal cases in zoning cases in tax
 
02:47:32.830 --> 02:47:32.840 align:start position:0%
cases in cases governing the powers and
 
02:47:35.349 --> 02:47:35.359 align:start position:0%
the authority of state governments so
 
02:47:38.710 --> 02:47:38.720 align:start position:0%
they're doing that all the time um and
 
02:47:42.110 --> 02:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
this proposal would essentially turn the
 
02:47:45.190 --> 02:47:45.200 align:start position:0%
legislature into a an appeals court
 
02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
anytime anybody was unhappy with a
 
02:47:48.080 --> 02:47:49.630 align:start position:0%
anytime anybody was unhappy with a
decision

02:47:49.630 --> 02:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:47:53.550 --> 02:47:53.560 align:start position:0%
in their cases involving zoning or their
 
02:47:56.429 --> 02:47:56.439 align:start position:0%
conviction um in a criminal case or some
 
02:47:58.349 --> 02:47:58.359 align:start position:0%
other dispute and they didn't like the
 
02:48:00.349 --> 02:48:00.359 align:start position:0%
outcome they would then be able to turn
 
02:48:03.590 --> 02:48:03.600 align:start position:0%
to the legislature hire a lobbyist and
 
02:48:05.990 --> 02:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
try to persuade you to undo the court
 
02:48:08.389 --> 02:48:08.399 align:start position:0%
decision you would be creating an end
 
02:48:12.870 --> 02:48:12.880 align:start position:0%
run in particular cases for parties in a
 
02:48:16.150 --> 02:48:16.160 align:start position:0%
court case and while one party might
 
02:48:18.790 --> 02:48:18.800 align:start position:0%
very much be eager to try that end run
 
02:48:20.670 --> 02:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
it would mean a delay for the other
 
02:48:22.710 --> 02:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
party and that other party might be a
 
02:48:24.469 --> 02:48:24.479 align:start position:0%
state government it might be a private
 
02:48:28.910 --> 02:48:28.920 align:start position:0%
business it might be um an individual uh
 
02:48:31.269 --> 02:48:31.279 align:start position:0%
it might be a local town they are going
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
to have to wait um until this new super
 
02:48:37.070 --> 02:48:37.080 align:start position:0%
appeals process and the legislature goes
 
02:48:39.950 --> 02:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
forward and then under this proposal
 
02:48:43.269 --> 02:48:43.279 align:start position:0%
even I if the lobbyist or whomever
 
02:48:45.910 --> 02:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
persuades both houses of the legislature
 
02:48:48.550 --> 02:48:48.560 align:start position:0%
to um do this end run around the appeals
 
02:48:51.870 --> 02:48:51.880 align:start position:0%
to decision then it goes to a referendum
 
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
to the whole state which I'm assuming
 
02:49:00.309 --> 02:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
would be um once every two years when um
 
02:49:02.190 --> 02:49:02.200 align:start position:0%
State elections are held which means
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
again another delay in the outcome of
 
02:49:08.110 --> 02:49:08.120 align:start position:0%
this case which one party may like but
 
02:49:10.309 --> 02:49:10.319 align:start position:0%
would be very unfair to the other
 
02:49:13.429 --> 02:49:13.439 align:start position:0%
parties so and you have plenty of things
 
02:49:16.590 --> 02:49:16.600 align:start position:0%
to do you have laws to write a budget to
 
02:49:19.389 --> 02:49:19.399 align:start position:0%
to construct um you don't really need to
 
02:49:21.389 --> 02:49:21.399 align:start position:0%
become an appeals court because one
 
02:49:23.950 --> 02:49:23.960 align:start position:0%
party is unhappy with the decision and
 
02:49:27.190 --> 02:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
most importantly you have ample power to
 
02:49:30.349 --> 02:49:30.359 align:start position:0%
address Court decisions you don't like
 
02:49:32.110 --> 02:49:32.120 align:start position:0%
if you think they've misinterpreted the
 
02:49:34.550 --> 02:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
statute you can rewrite the statute if
 
02:49:36.150 --> 02:49:36.160 align:start position:0%
you think they've misinterpreted the
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
Constitution you can propose a
 
02:49:40.229 --> 02:49:40.239 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment that's how the
 
02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
system was designed to work that's
 
02:49:45.710 --> 02:49:45.720 align:start position:0%
checks and balances in its Essence and
 
02:49:47.950 --> 02:49:47.960 align:start position:0%
this proposal would make you into an
 
02:49:50.150 --> 02:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
appeals court it would delay things for
 
02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:54.160 align:start position:0%
many people in many cases um it would
 
02:49:56.790 --> 02:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
really uh usurp the Court's role so for
 
02:49:59.269 --> 02:49:59.279 align:start position:0%
all those reasons I respectfully urge
 
02:50:02.590 --> 02:50:02.600 align:start position:0%
you to um designate this as inexpedient
 
02:50:04.510 --> 02:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
to legislate thank
 
02:50:07.309 --> 02:50:07.319 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chairman I couldn't quite
 
04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
hear everything there I don't know if
 
04:04:50.229 --> 04:04:50.239 align:start position:0%
the the sound is not quite working very
 
04:04:53.590 --> 04:04:53.600 align:start position:0%
well um I would say that I oppose uh the
 
04:04:56.750 --> 04:04:56.760 align:start position:0%
itl I will oppose the itl um I have
 
04:04:59.309 --> 04:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
already been in hearings this session
 
04:05:01.750 --> 04:05:01.760 align:start position:0%
where a major Amendment uh transforming
 
04:05:04.469 --> 04:05:04.479 align:start position:0%
a bill is presented um even in the
 
04:05:07.269 --> 04:05:07.279 align:start position:0%
public hearing uh and the public has no
 
04:05:09.389 --> 04:05:09.399 align:start position:0%
access to it the committee just gets it
 
04:05:11.070 --> 04:05:11.080 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 minutes in advance and the
 
04:05:13.030 --> 04:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
public has no access that includes the
 
04:05:15.990 --> 04:05:16.000 align:start position:0%
public who are scheduled to testify on
 
04:05:18.469 --> 04:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
that very bill um which is now about to
 
04:05:22.110 --> 04:05:22.120 align:start position:0%
be transformed so um I don't accept that
 
04:05:23.750 --> 04:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh the clerk's I know the clerk is
 
04:05:25.309 --> 04:05:25.319 align:start position:0%
working hard but I do not think that
 
04:05:27.389 --> 04:05:27.399 align:start position:0%
this system that he currently has up and
 
04:05:29.950 --> 04:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
running uh meets that need I am all for
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
as much transparency as possible um and
 
04:05:35.389 --> 04:05:35.399 align:start position:0%
I think that um I also would point out
 
04:05:37.950 --> 04:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
that as the clerk himself said rules can
 
04:05:41.189 --> 04:05:41.199 align:start position:0%
be changed um and procedures can be
 
04:05:42.950 --> 04:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
changed and I prefer to see this in
 
04:05:46.229 --> 04:05:46.239 align:start position:0%
statute um to maximize uh public
 
04:05:48.469 --> 04:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
transparency uh of the workings of the
 
04:05:52.030 --> 04:05:52.040 align:start position:0%

04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
during the break and I have been taking
 
04:06:08.830 --> 04:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
this as being a work product that really
 
04:06:10.670 --> 04:06:10.680 align:start position:0%
didn't need to be put out there as a
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
work product but looking over the bill
 
04:06:15.990 --> 04:06:16.000 align:start position:0%

04:06:18.269 --> 04:06:18.279 align:start position:0%

sure of the outcome this time I can be
 
04:10:21.870 --> 04:10:21.880 align:start position:0%
really sure yeah let's hope the rest of
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:34.109 --> 04:10:34.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:36.510 --> 04:10:36.520 align:start position:0%
Frost would you like to speak to your
 
04:10:39.910 --> 04:10:39.920 align:start position:0%
motion I this bill was put in on behalf
 
04:10:42.550 --> 04:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
of the Ethics Committee um it's been a
 
04:10:44.550 --> 04:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
long time coming it's a burden on the
 
04:10:47.389 --> 04:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
staff to have to have us do these forms
 
04:10:49.750 --> 04:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
every single year it's a burden on the
 
04:10:52.790 --> 04:10:52.800 align:start position:0%
legislators to do it every single year
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
notification so that people will know if
 
04:10:57.550 --> 04:10:57.560 align:start position:0%
there's a change in their uh financial
 
04:10:59.510 --> 04:10:59.520 align:start position:0%
situation in some way that they need to
 
04:11:01.830 --> 04:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
disclose information that they should do
 
04:11:05.149 --> 04:11:05.159 align:start position:0%
that which they should now anytime so um
 
04:11:08.030 --> 04:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
this will just be a good clean measure
 
04:11:10.990 --> 04:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
for us it's hous keing essentially long
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:22.630 --> 04:11:22.640 align:start position:0%
anyone else like to speak on y to pass
 
04:11:24.910 --> 04:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
motion seeing
 
04:11:28.790 --> 04:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
none Smith has his hand oh thank you
 
04:11:31.109 --> 04:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
sorry Mr uh Mr chairman I I'll try and
 
04:11:33.590 --> 04:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
chime in verbally uh in the future um
 
04:11:36.309 --> 04:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
I'd just say that I I oppose the bill um
 
04:11:38.710 --> 04:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
because I generally oppose anything that
 
04:11:41.630 --> 04:11:41.640 align:start position:0%
rolls back uh transparency and financial
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
reporting um but it it'll probably end
 
04:11:46.309 --> 04:11:46.319 align:start position:0%
up like 16 to1 and I don't need a
 
04:11:49.349 --> 04:11:49.359 align:start position:0%
Minority Report um but I I just think
 
04:11:52.269 --> 04:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
that you know we need to be very careful
 
04:11:53.830 --> 04:11:53.840 align:start position:0%
anytime we
 
04:11:57.309 --> 04:11:57.319 align:start position:0%
reduce um Financial disclosures and
 
04:12:02.670 --> 04:12:02.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:06.389 --> 04:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
officials uh W without getting into
 
04:12:10.550 --> 04:12:10.560 align:start position:0%
debate um my friends um we are not
 
04:12:13.590 --> 04:12:13.600 align:start position:0%
rolling back transparency all of the
 
04:12:16.550 --> 04:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
goes online as you all know it's all
 
04:12:20.149 --> 04:12:20.159 align:start position:0%
right out there for the world to see and
 
04:12:21.710 --> 04:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
the only
 
04:12:25.189 --> 04:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
thing report someone chooses not to
 
04:12:27.269 --> 04:12:27.279 align:start position:0%
report something that's violating
 
04:12:29.670 --> 04:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
transparency but it it's absolutely
 
04:12:31.070 --> 04:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
transparent when we fill out our
 
04:12:33.630 --> 04:12:33.640 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure forms at all times
 
04:12:36.189 --> 04:12:36.199 align:start position:0%
for everybody and I'm the last person
 
04:12:38.349 --> 04:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
who would want to violate transparency
 
04:12:44.710 --> 04:12:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:47.309 --> 04:12:47.319 align:start position:0%
being not I will ask the clerk call a
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
roll on House Bill 190 relative to
 
04:12:52.910 --> 04:12:52.920 align:start position:0%

04:15:30.710 --> 04:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
apparently all right turn around sit in
 
04:15:33.189 --> 04:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
a corner or
 
04:15:35.830 --> 04:15:35.840 align:start position:0%
something the question I don't know the
 
04:15:37.030 --> 04:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
specific question so if you could
 
04:15:38.349 --> 04:15:38.359 align:start position:0%

Terry Terry pth I'm the Chief Operating
 
04:15:42.389 --> 04:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
Officer currently for the general court
 
04:15:44.109 --> 04:15:44.119 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire
 
04:15:46.269 --> 04:15:46.279 align:start position:0%
um and have an office here in the state
 
04:15:53.790 --> 04:15:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:57.149 --> 04:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
represent certainly repres when I saw
 
04:15:57.159 --> 04:15:58.710 align:start position:0%
represent certainly repres when I saw
the

04:15:58.710 --> 04:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:16:02.469 --> 04:16:02.479 align:start position:0%
b or not ter had been involved with this
 
04:16:04.950 --> 04:16:04.960 align:start position:0%
yes and was supportive of the bill very
 
04:16:04.960 --> 04:16:05.830 align:start position:0%
yes and was supportive of the bill very
much

04:16:05.830 --> 04:16:05.840 align:start position:0%
much
 
04:16:08.710 --> 04:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
so specifically with regard to the flag
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
issue right and that's what we needed to
 
04:16:12.590 --> 04:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
know so would you tell us certainly I'm
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
very much in support of this I think it
 
04:16:16.349 --> 04:16:16.359 align:start position:0%
gives the authority back to the
 
04:16:18.269 --> 04:16:18.279 align:start position:0%
legislative branch where it belongs with
 
04:16:21.389 --> 04:16:21.399 align:start position:0%
us uh it is in consultation with the uh
 
04:16:23.469 --> 04:16:23.479 align:start position:0%
historical folks and the executive
 
04:16:25.630 --> 04:16:25.640 align:start position:0%
branch but all this brings the control
 
04:16:28.349 --> 04:16:28.359 align:start position:0%
back and well clarifies the control
 
04:16:31.030 --> 04:16:31.040 align:start position:0%
actually for uh the spaces in the L the
 
04:16:32.710 --> 04:16:32.720 align:start position:0%
up and Walker house and in the State
 
04:16:34.389 --> 04:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
House itself anything under legislative
 
04:16:36.550 --> 04:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
control is currently um under
 
04:16:37.990 --> 04:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
legislative control but there's always
 
04:16:39.229 --> 04:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
been a little question between the
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
executive and a little friction between
 
04:16:42.990 --> 04:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
the executive and the legislative this
 
04:16:45.189 --> 04:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
clarifies that the legislative branch is
 
04:16:47.070 --> 04:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
in fact in charge of those spaces and
 
04:16:50.229 --> 04:16:50.239 align:start position:0%
the flags in particular they were the
 
04:16:52.670 --> 04:16:52.680 align:start position:0%
flags were gifted to the legislative
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
branch and brought here for display in
 
04:16:57.750 --> 04:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
that Hall of flags and that's uh that's
 
04:16:59.550 --> 04:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
where they've been uh they they've gone
 
04:17:02.189 --> 04:17:02.199 align:start position:0%
through several iterations they've been
 
04:17:04.389 --> 04:17:04.399 align:start position:0%
posted and they've got some cases built
 
04:17:05.469 --> 04:17:05.479 align:start position:0%
in the late
 
04:17:08.070 --> 04:17:08.080 align:start position:0%
1800s uh they've been in there there's
 
04:17:11.070 --> 04:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
currently a longstanding debate on how
 
04:17:13.429 --> 04:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
to tend to those flags how to best
 
04:17:15.710 --> 04:17:15.720 align:start position:0%
preserve those flags I've been involved
 
04:17:18.910 --> 04:17:18.920 align:start position:0%
with that as uh as representative wall
 
04:17:18.920 --> 04:17:19.750 align:start position:0%
with that as uh as representative wall
and

04:17:19.750 --> 04:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:17:23.229 --> 04:17:23.239 align:start position:0%
others um representative Welch and many
 
04:17:25.070 --> 04:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
many members long serving members of
 
04:17:26.510 --> 04:17:26.520 align:start position:0%
this legislature that are very very
 
04:17:28.389 --> 04:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
concerned about the condition of the
 
04:17:30.670 --> 04:17:30.680 align:start position:0%
flags and how they're being treated
 
04:17:33.389 --> 04:17:33.399 align:start position:0%
we've went out and U talked with other
 
04:17:35.349 --> 04:17:35.359 align:start position:0%
states who have had preservation efforts
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
go forward with those they've had mixed
 
04:17:40.710 --> 04:17:40.720 align:start position:0%
results in them with them these flags
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
show no fabric debris at all on the
 
04:17:46.389 --> 04:17:46.399 align:start position:0%
basis of the cases or anything uh in
 
04:17:49.429 --> 04:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
that area but um
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
textile experts do say there there
 
04:17:54.189 --> 04:17:54.199 align:start position:0%
should be some sort
 
04:17:57.510 --> 04:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
of preservation those but the fact of
 
04:17:59.349 --> 04:17:59.359 align:start position:0%
the matter is that they were given to us
 
04:18:02.389 --> 04:18:02.399 align:start position:0%
to have them played and so that the
 
04:18:04.550 --> 04:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
remembrance of what happened in those
 
04:18:06.790 --> 04:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
battles and the stories that those flags
 
04:18:08.950 --> 04:18:08.960 align:start position:0%
tell could be seen by the general public
 
04:18:10.630 --> 04:18:10.640 align:start position:0%
in almost every fourth grade class that
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
comes through here um so it's very
 
04:18:15.469 --> 04:18:15.479 align:start position:0%
important I think to this legislature to
 
04:18:18.070 --> 04:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
this General Court those flags stay in
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
the cases the way they are with with
 
04:18:24.030 --> 04:18:24.040 align:start position:0%
monitoring like it's happening now to to
 
04:18:25.750 --> 04:18:25.760 align:start position:0%
see what the best preservation and in
 
04:18:26.990 --> 04:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
the future hopefully there's something
 
04:18:30.109 --> 04:18:30.119 align:start position:0%
that can treat those flags without
 
04:18:32.550 --> 04:18:32.560 align:start position:0%
taking away or backing them or hiding
 
04:18:34.229 --> 04:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
them in a closet somewhere or hiding
 
04:18:36.149 --> 04:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
them in an archive somewhere because
 
04:18:38.349 --> 04:18:38.359 align:start position:0%
those those were active
 
04:18:42.429 --> 04:18:42.439 align:start position:0%
flags and so this bill brings it back so
 
04:18:44.189 --> 04:18:44.199 align:start position:0%
that the controlers with our own
 
04:18:47.309 --> 04:18:47.319 align:start position:0%

is dead it's an issue that will come up
 
04:20:43.229 --> 04:20:43.239 align:start position:0%
year after year until some decision is
 
04:20:46.870 --> 04:20:46.880 align:start position:0%
finally made um other states have done
 
04:20:49.109 --> 04:20:49.119 align:start position:0%
things such as taking their Flags out of
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
display putting them in drawers you know
 
04:20:54.030 --> 04:20:54.040 align:start position:0%
flat out one at a time and putting
 
04:20:57.389 --> 04:20:57.399 align:start position:0%
replicas up it's not quite the same uh
 
04:20:59.269 --> 04:20:59.279 align:start position:0%
the flags that we have in the hall flags
 
04:21:01.309 --> 04:21:01.319 align:start position:0%

these PL that really went into battle

and what happened to them and um so I I
 
04:21:13.790 --> 04:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
could go on and on about the flags but
 
04:21:15.790 --> 04:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
this whole bill is very very important
 
04:21:17.710 --> 04:21:17.720 align:start position:0%

04:23:16.189 --> 04:23:16.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would like to make
 
04:23:20.429 --> 04:23:20.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:24.550 --> 04:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
call second for represent LE has
 
04:23:27.349 --> 04:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
something he wants to say might want to
 
04:23:27.359 --> 04:23:28.990 align:start position:0%
something he wants to say might want to
representative

04:23:28.990 --> 04:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
Le uh well thank you Mr chair so the
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
motion is to retain yes yeah we're
 
04:23:37.309 --> 04:23:37.319 align:start position:0%
looking for I mean the only thing I was
 
04:23:38.910 --> 04:23:38.920 align:start position:0%
going to say is there were a couple of
 
04:23:41.109 --> 04:23:41.119 align:start position:0%
small a number of small technical things
 
04:23:42.429 --> 04:23:42.439 align:start position:0%
that we wanted to see about having
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
having time to amend uh the bill on um
 
04:23:48.149 --> 04:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
so I guess by retaining we certainly
 
04:23:52.429 --> 04:23:52.439 align:start position:0%
would have that time uh so okay I'll
 
04:23:54.670 --> 04:23:54.680 align:start position:0%
leave it at that thank you was that a
 
04:23:57.469 --> 04:23:57.479 align:start position:0%

04:24:17.550 --> 04:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
green uh any discussion represent uh I
 
04:24:19.630 --> 04:24:19.640 align:start position:0%
think representative Le basically said
 
04:24:21.109 --> 04:24:21.119 align:start position:0%
what I was going to say there are a few
 
04:24:23.189 --> 04:24:23.199 align:start position:0%
minor issues on this bill that uh we'd
 
04:24:25.750 --> 04:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
like to address uh potentially with
 
04:24:27.710 --> 04:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment so uh we wanted to keep it in
 
04:24:29.149 --> 04:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
house so that we
 
04:24:31.670 --> 04:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
would thank
 
04:24:31.680 --> 04:24:34.309 align:start position:0%
would thank
you

04:24:34.309 --> 04:24:34.319 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:24:37.510 --> 04:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay retain it understand what represent
 
04:24:45.109 --> 04:24:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:48.450 --> 04:24:48.460 align:start position:0%
a subit or how El this go in
 
04:24:48.460 --> 04:24:50.550 align:start position:0%
a subit or how El this go in
[Music]

04:24:50.550 --> 04:24:50.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:24:53.510 --> 04:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
terms um I would anticipate that we
 
04:24:57.550 --> 04:24:57.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:00.790 --> 04:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and fix fix those issues
 
04:25:02.590 --> 04:25:02.600 align:start position:0%
there were some that were listed that
 
04:25:03.990 --> 04:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
were talked about actually I think it
 
04:25:06.469 --> 04:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
was representative Le that mentioned um
 
04:25:09.429 --> 04:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
one County being being
 
04:25:12.710 --> 04:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned not others um some question
 
04:25:15.070 --> 04:25:15.080 align:start position:0%
about remote remoteness I have something
 
04:25:18.229 --> 04:25:18.239 align:start position:0%
to say he first please I might not speak
 
04:25:21.429 --> 04:25:21.439 align:start position:0%
yes hand yes I see that I was finishing
 
04:25:23.510 --> 04:25:23.520 align:start position:0%
the answer to the question I'm sorry
 
04:25:26.189 --> 04:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
thank you there was um there was also
 
04:25:28.030 --> 04:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
some question about whether they had
 
04:25:30.189 --> 04:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
House and Senate was listed in there
 
04:25:32.590 --> 04:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
there were a number of things that uh
 
04:25:36.870 --> 04:25:36.880 align:start position:0%
that seemed to need um additional review
 
04:25:39.469 --> 04:25:39.479 align:start position:0%
so that was the purpose representative
 
04:25:42.750 --> 04:25:42.760 align:start position:0%
Le thank you Mr chair I would suggest
 
04:25:44.910 --> 04:25:44.920 align:start position:0%
actually um if you want to work on the
 
04:25:47.269 --> 04:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
bill that we not retain it at this point
 
04:25:50.309 --> 04:25:50.319 align:start position:0%
that um we just not make any motion for
 
04:25:53.830 --> 04:25:53.840 align:start position:0%
the moment and um you know you can go
 
04:25:56.070 --> 04:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
ahead and uh appoint a subcommittee and
 
04:25:57.670 --> 04:25:57.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we could make the adjustments to
 
04:25:59.149 --> 04:25:59.159 align:start position:0%
it that would meet everybody's
 
04:26:01.510 --> 04:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
satisfaction because I correct me if I'm
 
04:26:03.670 --> 04:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
wrong if we retain at this point
 
04:26:06.109 --> 04:26:06.119 align:start position:0%
formally um are we retaining it then for
 
04:26:07.950 --> 04:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
this entire year and it cannot be
 
04:26:10.109 --> 04:26:10.119 align:start position:0%
reported back until
 
04:26:13.990 --> 04:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
2022 um thanks question as far as I'm
 
04:26:15.790 --> 04:26:15.800 align:start position:0%
concerned it would come back in the in
 
04:26:18.269 --> 04:26:18.279 align:start position:0%
the second year of this bi any so it
 
04:26:21.990 --> 04:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
would come back uh in November so if I
 
04:26:24.189 --> 04:26:24.199 align:start position:0%
may continue I I I would suggest I think
 
04:26:26.429 --> 04:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
the issue is important enough that um I
 
04:26:29.149 --> 04:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily think we should push
 
04:26:31.750 --> 04:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
it off for a year but I do think that
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
the bill needs some some some amending
 
04:26:35.830 --> 04:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
some technical amendments I would say
 
04:26:37.269 --> 04:26:37.279 align:start position:0%
and maybe even a little more than
 
04:26:40.109 --> 04:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
technical um I would hope that we would
 
04:26:41.670 --> 04:26:41.680 align:start position:0%
be willing to at least give it a little
 
04:26:44.070 --> 04:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
more time take a deeper look at it and
 
04:26:45.389 --> 04:26:45.399 align:start position:0%
see whether or not there's anything we
 
04:26:47.830 --> 04:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
can do with it that might um allow it to
 
04:26:50.229 --> 04:26:50.239 align:start position:0%
pass this year um and get underway this
 
04:26:51.990 --> 04:26:52.000 align:start position:0%
year just simply because the issue is a
 
04:26:53.630 --> 04:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
live issue and continues to be an
 
04:26:58.429 --> 04:26:58.439 align:start position:0%
important issue thank you thank you for
 
04:27:02.349 --> 04:27:02.359 align:start position:0%
your anyone else yeah hand Mr
 
04:27:08.030 --> 04:27:08.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um yes representative Smith yep
 
04:27:10.590 --> 04:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
um I would I would sort of echo what
 
04:27:12.950 --> 04:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
representative Le said um I agree I
 
04:27:15.269 --> 04:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
think there's a few uh commas that need
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
to be moved in the in the text um but
 
04:27:21.349 --> 04:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
nothing that that can't be resolved with
 
04:27:22.830 --> 04:27:22.840 align:start position:0%
what's probably going to be a fairly
 
04:27:25.510 --> 04:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
simple committee Amendment um I don't
 
04:27:27.750 --> 04:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
see any need to push this off for an
 
04:27:30.269 --> 04:27:30.279 align:start position:0%
entire year um it's something that we
 
04:27:33.389 --> 04:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
could resolve just by closing the exec
 
04:27:36.149 --> 04:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
session on it and reecting it you know a
 
04:27:38.030 --> 04:27:38.040 align:start position:0%
week or two from now at our at our next
 
04:27:41.790 --> 04:27:41.800 align:start position:0%
exec session um and and I would point
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
out that even if we ourselves do not
 
04:27:47.149 --> 04:27:47.159 align:start position:0%
find ourselves in a hurry on this
 
04:27:49.870 --> 04:27:49.880 align:start position:0%
particular bill um the public support
 
04:27:54.070 --> 04:27:54.080 align:start position:0%
was 106 to one so it's definitely a
 
04:27:56.590 --> 04:27:56.600 align:start position:0%
priority for the public thank you Mr
 
04:28:01.670 --> 04:28:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:04.189 --> 04:28:04.199 align:start position:0%
comments wall thank you Mr chairman
 
04:28:06.990 --> 04:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for your patience um the only
 
04:28:09.510 --> 04:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
thing I would say is we're it's one of
 
04:28:11.790 --> 04:28:11.800 align:start position:0%
the first bills we're hearing so rather
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
than retain it if it's one of the first
 
04:28:15.630 --> 04:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
bills we're hearing so rather than
 
04:28:17.950 --> 04:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
retain it if we do take a few weeks or a
 
04:28:20.469 --> 04:28:20.479 align:start position:0%
few days to work on it with the sub
 
04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
commmittee then come back perhaps we
 
04:28:24.950 --> 04:28:24.960 align:start position:0%
could want get it out of
 
04:28:29.630 --> 04:28:29.640 align:start position:0%
here thank you um my only comment is
 
04:28:29.640 --> 04:28:31.189 align:start position:0%
here thank you um my only comment is
that

04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:28:34.030 --> 04:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
um as noted in the beginning of the of
 
04:28:37.109 --> 04:28:37.119 align:start position:0%
the hearing we we've already been behind
 
04:28:40.070 --> 04:28:40.080 align:start position:0%
on on scheduling here we've uh because
 
04:28:43.229 --> 04:28:43.239 align:start position:0%
we had no early bills we were asked to
 
04:28:46.870 --> 04:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh put aside our hearings until um after
 
04:28:48.910 --> 04:28:48.920 align:start position:0%
those early bills and the rooms were
 
04:28:53.070 --> 04:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
available so um as far as finding
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
additional time and additional space I'm
 
04:28:56.159 --> 04:28:56.950 align:start position:0%
additional time and additional space I'm
not

04:28:56.950 --> 04:28:56.960 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:29:00.710 --> 04:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
sure um whether that is possible and as
 
04:29:04.189 --> 04:29:04.199 align:start position:0%
and as I say you know it it may have
 
04:29:07.349 --> 04:29:07.359 align:start position:0%
been um or maybe I said this in in our
 
04:29:11.229 --> 04:29:11.239 align:start position:0%
own caucus but um a retain means that we
 
04:29:12.670 --> 04:29:12.680 align:start position:0%
can bring it back
 
04:29:15.109 --> 04:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
um and that we can work on it uh in the
 
04:29:17.670 --> 04:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
time frame that we have uh for the
 
04:29:20.269 --> 04:29:20.279 align:start position:0%
committee over the summer um or even
 
04:29:24.229 --> 04:29:24.239 align:start position:0%
before that um so that would be that
 
04:29:28.269 --> 04:29:28.279 align:start position:0%
would be my comment um and I'm perfectly
 
04:29:30.229 --> 04:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
willing to listen to others if anyone
 
04:29:35.710 --> 04:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:39.590 --> 04:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
make no up representative
 
04:29:42.070 --> 04:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
Le thank you Mr chairman yeah again
 
04:29:43.990 --> 04:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
again I I don't think this will take
 
04:29:46.269 --> 04:29:46.279 align:start position:0%
much time I understand what you're and I
 
04:29:47.870 --> 04:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
I recognize what you're saying in terms
 
04:29:51.229 --> 04:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
of a uh a bit of a time crunch um but I
 
04:29:52.790 --> 04:29:52.800 align:start position:0%
believe we have a number of bills
 
04:29:54.510 --> 04:29:54.520 align:start position:0%
scheduled next week which I think will
 
04:29:56.189 --> 04:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
take a little bit longer and I expect
 
04:29:58.389 --> 04:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
that to be a a bit more of a length a
 
04:30:00.830 --> 04:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
lengthier day than today was um but
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
beyond that I don't believe we have
 
04:30:05.469 --> 04:30:05.479 align:start position:0%
anything maybe one bill the statutory uh
 
04:30:09.149 --> 04:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
committees bill um and so this would
 
04:30:10.910 --> 04:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
just simply be a brief meeting of a
 
04:30:15.109 --> 04:30:15.119 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um and construction of a uh
 
04:30:16.910 --> 04:30:16.920 align:start position:0%
what I see is really just technical
 
04:30:20.189 --> 04:30:20.199 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh to the bill um so I again I
 
04:30:22.550 --> 04:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
would I would ask that the that you
 
04:30:24.950 --> 04:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
consider with a withdrawal of the second
 
04:30:27.149 --> 04:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
and a withdrawal of the retain motion um
 
04:30:28.790 --> 04:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
if it is not withdrawn I will say I will
 
04:30:30.870 --> 04:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
vote against retaining I believe we
 
04:30:32.389 --> 04:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
should have a chance to act on it this
 
04:30:34.389 --> 04:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
thank you representative any other
 
04:30:36.950 --> 04:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
question comment just just a question of
 
04:30:38.389 --> 04:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
clarification actually for
 
04:30:41.710 --> 04:30:41.720 align:start position:0%
representative Le um just looking at
 
04:30:45.070 --> 04:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
this as a um establishing a committee
 
04:30:46.670 --> 04:30:46.680 align:start position:0%
even if it were to pass even if we were
 
04:30:49.469 --> 04:30:49.479 align:start position:0%
to get this exec quickly and passed
 
04:30:52.429 --> 04:30:52.439 align:start position:0%
through um what practical manifestation
 
04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
would that have for this year I mean
 
04:30:57.030 --> 04:30:57.040 align:start position:0%
presently we're able to um operate this
 
04:30:59.229 --> 04:30:59.239 align:start position:0%
way under the emergency orders um
 
04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
assuming that those change before the
 
04:31:03.309 --> 04:31:03.319 align:start position:0%
end of this session would there actually
 
04:31:05.109 --> 04:31:05.119 align:start position:0%
be time for there to be a meaningful
 
04:31:06.630 --> 04:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
adjustment to the way that we operate
 
04:31:08.510 --> 04:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
this year even if we got this study
 
04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
committee through it so would that is
 
04:31:13.109 --> 04:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
that addressing your thoughts or do you
 
04:31:14.790 --> 04:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
have things that I'm just
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
missing if I may respond Mr
 
04:31:21.149 --> 04:31:21.159 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um no I don't I don't
 
04:31:22.910 --> 04:31:22.920 align:start position:0%
expect that this study committee would
 
04:31:26.590 --> 04:31:26.600 align:start position:0%
be um acting in such a way that it would
 
04:31:28.630 --> 04:31:28.640 align:start position:0%
be making changes that would take effect
 
04:31:31.830 --> 04:31:31.840 align:start position:0%
this year in 2021 I mean the report date
 
04:31:34.790 --> 04:31:34.800 align:start position:0%
itself I believe is November of 2021
 
04:31:37.389 --> 04:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
instead I just think that um since the
 
04:31:39.309 --> 04:31:39.319 align:start position:0%
state of emergency will come to an end
 
04:31:41.510 --> 04:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
at some point um I do believe that the
 
04:31:43.189 --> 04:31:43.199 align:start position:0%
soon we begin to address some of the
 
04:31:46.189 --> 04:31:46.199 align:start position:0%
larger long-term issues about remote
 
04:31:49.389 --> 04:31:49.399 align:start position:0%
access and Public Access um once we are
 
04:31:51.149 --> 04:31:51.159 align:start position:0%
beyond the state of emergency I think
 
04:31:52.429 --> 04:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
that's what this study committee would
 
04:31:54.710 --> 04:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
be attempting to do and putting it off
 
04:31:57.469 --> 04:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
for a year I think um just puts us into
 
04:31:59.510 --> 04:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
2022 when hopefully the state of
 
04:32:03.030 --> 04:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
emergency is no longer in effect um and
 
04:32:04.910 --> 04:32:04.920 align:start position:0%
you know I just think that we're we're
 
04:32:07.109 --> 04:32:07.119 align:start position:0%
just kicking the can down the road I do
 
04:32:09.429 --> 04:32:09.439 align:start position:0%
think that um this is this needs to be
 
04:32:12.550 --> 04:32:12.560 align:start position:0%
looked at by the the legislature
 
04:32:14.630 --> 04:32:14.640 align:start position:0%
um and so I just think it makes sense to
 
04:32:16.510 --> 04:32:16.520 align:start position:0%
at least begin the process now that's
 
04:32:18.469 --> 04:32:18.479 align:start position:0%

04:32:21.149 --> 04:32:21.159 align:start position:0%

about of it is our level
 
04:34:44.750 --> 04:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
that because of
 
04:34:47.429 --> 04:34:47.439 align:start position:0%
that really discourages career
 
04:34:55.590 --> 04:34:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:06.029 --> 04:35:06.039 align:start position:0%

BR

04:35:39.510 --> 04:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:41.990 --> 04:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
all we have a certain level of that
 
04:35:42.000 --> 04:35:43.551 align:start position:0%
all we have a certain level of that
enables

04:35:43.551 --> 04:35:43.561 align:start position:0%
enables
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
people all walks of life to serve in A
 
04:35:50.750 --> 04:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
legislature who don't have that would
 
04:35:52.310 --> 04:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
never have the wherewithal to give a
 
04:35:54.869 --> 04:35:54.879 align:start position:0%
fundraiser for example to serve in any
 
04:35:54.879 --> 04:35:57.470 align:start position:0%
fundraiser for example to serve in any
other

04:35:57.470 --> 04:35:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:01.189 --> 04:36:01.199 align:start position:0%
state our level of ha to we it
 
04:36:04.269 --> 04:36:04.279 align:start position:0%
discourages career politicians you know
 
04:36:07.150 --> 04:36:07.160 align:start position:0%
encourages people from all be part of
 
04:36:10.150 --> 04:36:10.160 align:start position:0%
this process represent the constituency
 
04:36:15.470 --> 04:36:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:17.830 --> 04:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
any other
 
04:36:20.349 --> 04:36:20.359 align:start position:0%
comments representative thank you Mr
 
04:36:23.109 --> 04:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm going to support itl the
 
04:36:25.709 --> 04:36:25.719 align:start position:0%
reason I'm doing it is because again the
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
citizens of New Hampshire are being well
 
04:36:29.750 --> 04:36:29.760 align:start position:0%
represented the way things are happening
 
04:36:31.830 --> 04:36:31.840 align:start position:0%
now and I do believe change may come at
 
04:36:34.189 --> 04:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
some point but if we're going to look at
 
04:36:35.670 --> 04:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
this it should be part of a whole
 
04:36:39.070 --> 04:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
package as to studying how many
 
04:36:41.830 --> 04:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
legislators we have what kind of compan
 
04:36:44.429 --> 04:36:44.439 align:start position:0%
ation of legislator's debt and put it
 
04:36:46.029 --> 04:36:46.039 align:start position:0%
all together and figure out what can
 
04:36:47.750 --> 04:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
work best for New Hampshire right now
 
04:36:49.310 --> 04:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
this is working and I don't believe we
 
04:36:51.670 --> 04:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
should withdraw anything from the good
 
04:36:53.910 --> 04:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
people who serve the state and I can't
 
04:36:55.470 --> 04:36:55.480 align:start position:0%
believe our citizens would really
 
04:36:58.910 --> 04:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
support that thank you thank you
 
04:37:03.510 --> 04:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent anyone else with comments yep
 
04:37:07.910 --> 04:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative Smith so um we
 
04:37:10.269 --> 04:37:10.279 align:start position:0%
have an an interesting institution you
 
04:37:13.670 --> 04:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
know with our our $100 a year pay set in
 
04:37:15.029 --> 04:37:15.039 align:start position:0%
our state
 
04:37:15.039 --> 04:37:17.150 align:start position:0%
our state
constitution

04:37:17.150 --> 04:37:17.160 align:start position:0%
constitution
 
04:37:20.869 --> 04:37:20.879 align:start position:0%
um you know what the net effect of that
 
04:37:23.551 --> 04:37:23.561 align:start position:0%
is that we're essentially volunteer
 
04:37:24.949 --> 04:37:24.959 align:start position:0%
legislature you know we're we're
 
04:37:27.990 --> 04:37:28.000 align:start position:0%
essentially unpaid um I don't I don't
 
04:37:30.150 --> 04:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
think anyone would would make a serious
 
04:37:32.750 --> 04:37:32.760 align:start position:0%
argument that our $200 a year you know
 
04:37:36.510 --> 04:37:36.520 align:start position:0%
is a is a serious salary I mean for I
 
04:37:38.910 --> 04:37:38.920 align:start position:0%
think most people in the
 
04:37:42.310 --> 04:37:42.320 align:start position:0%
legislature um that only serves to cover
 
04:37:45.189 --> 04:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
some of the expenses we incur by getting
 
04:37:47.070 --> 04:37:47.080 align:start position:0%
elected you know I mean if if we want a
 
04:37:49.310 --> 04:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
pad of paper with stationary with the
 
04:37:50.949 --> 04:37:50.959 align:start position:0%
State House letterhead we we have to buy
 
04:37:53.709 --> 04:37:53.719 align:start position:0%
it ourselves you know we don't we're not
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
a big dollar
 
04:37:59.310 --> 04:37:59.320 align:start position:0%
legislature um I would support this
 
04:38:01.910 --> 04:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
amendment just on the grounds that if
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay our legislature
 
04:38:06.590 --> 04:38:06.600 align:start position:0%
let's just not pay
 
04:38:09.910 --> 04:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
us rather than have you know all the
 
04:38:11.910 --> 04:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
administrative hassle it takes the state
 
04:38:13.269 --> 04:38:13.279 align:start position:0%
to to give us
 
04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
$200 um rather than have it enumerated
 
04:38:17.670 --> 04:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
you know in the state
 
04:38:20.830 --> 04:38:20.840 align:start position:0%
constitution as an anachronism to you
 
04:38:24.510 --> 04:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
know what 200 years ago when $200 was a
 
04:38:27.470 --> 04:38:27.480 align:start position:0%
real paycheck um you know we are we all
 
04:38:30.390 --> 04:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
got that report um from OS about the the
 
04:38:32.629 --> 04:38:32.639 align:start position:0%
history of the legislative pay issue I
 
04:38:34.109 --> 04:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
read through that I found it pretty
 
04:38:37.349 --> 04:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
interesting um so you know I think that
 
04:38:40.070 --> 04:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're not going to pay our
 
04:38:42.590 --> 04:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
legislators which I mean we're all here
 
04:38:45.070 --> 04:38:45.080 align:start position:0%
unpaid right now um let's just not pay
 
04:38:48.070 --> 04:38:48.080 align:start position:0%
us so on on that grounds alone I'm I'm
 
04:38:50.349 --> 04:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
happy with with passing this and and
 
04:38:52.830 --> 04:38:52.840 align:start position:0%
removing it from the state constitution
 
04:38:54.990 --> 04:38:55.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know if a future legislature
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
at some point wanted to to reexamine the
 
04:39:00.910 --> 04:39:00.920 align:start position:0%
issue of whether or not we pay the
 
04:39:04.349 --> 04:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
legislature um I I would find that to be
 
04:39:06.990 --> 04:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
unrelated to the question of whether or
 
04:39:09.789 --> 04:39:09.799 align:start position:0%
not we do this amendment because at that
 
04:39:11.590 --> 04:39:11.600 align:start position:0%
point it would require you know if this
 
04:39:14.189 --> 04:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass like even if we passed it
 
04:39:16.390 --> 04:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
if it didn't get ratified by the public
 
04:39:18.709 --> 04:39:18.719 align:start position:0%
and 10 years from now the state senate
 
04:39:20.390 --> 04:39:20.400 align:start position:0%
wanted to reexamine the issue for
 
04:39:22.150 --> 04:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
example um it would still take a
 
04:39:24.709 --> 04:39:24.719 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment so the net
 
04:39:26.590 --> 04:39:26.600 align:start position:0%
Effect one way or the other is that if
 
04:39:30.510 --> 04:39:30.520 align:start position:0%
this ever changes up down sideways at
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
some point there will have to be a
 
04:39:34.551 --> 04:39:34.561 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment about it I'm
 
04:39:36.709 --> 04:39:36.719 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to have this one in preference
 
04:39:39.750 --> 04:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
to something else that sets up
 
04:39:42.230 --> 04:39:42.240 align:start position:0%
complicated pay formulas you know and
 
04:39:45.390 --> 04:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
adds things to the Constitution like
 
04:39:47.390 --> 04:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
mathematical formulas and stuff that
 
04:39:51.948 --> 04:39:51.958 align:start position:0%
really don't belong there um and
 
04:39:55.510 --> 04:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
additionally I I would again mention
 
04:39:57.670 --> 04:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
that the support from the public that
 
04:40:01.150 --> 04:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
signed in was five to one in support of
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
this amendment um I didn't think that
 
04:40:07.150 --> 04:40:07.160 align:start position:0%
many people were going to notice or care
 
04:40:09.868 --> 04:40:09.878 align:start position:0%
that we had an amendment up uh to remove
 
04:40:13.190 --> 04:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
the $200 from our state constitution um
 
04:40:15.190 --> 04:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
but you know and I I was kind of neutral
 
04:40:17.350 --> 04:40:17.360 align:start position:0%
about it until I saw all those all those
 
04:40:19.670 --> 04:40:19.680 align:start position:0%
names um but that that kind of butress
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
is my position I I would I would support
 
04:40:24.190 --> 04:40:24.200 align:start position:0%
this you know on the grounds that if
 
04:40:25.670 --> 04:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pay our legislature
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
let's just not pay us and if the public
 
04:40:30.708 --> 04:40:30.718 align:start position:0%
wants it let's just let them vote and
 
04:40:33.868 --> 04:40:33.878 align:start position:0%
lastly I would take issue that the
 
04:40:36.470 --> 04:40:36.480 align:start position:0%
current institution encourages people
 
04:40:39.030 --> 04:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
from all walks of life the current
 
04:40:42.708 --> 04:40:42.718 align:start position:0%
institution actively discour enes people
 
04:40:46.430 --> 04:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
from a large number of walks of life it
 
04:40:50.310 --> 04:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
is beyond difficult for you know anyone
 
04:40:52.230 --> 04:40:52.240 align:start position:0%
who's working age to serve in the
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
legislature and hold down a job I mean
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
if you've got kids and stuff you got to
 
04:40:59.788 --> 04:40:59.798 align:start position:0%
arrange for child care I mean we do not
 
04:41:01.550 --> 04:41:01.560 align:start position:0%
encourage people from all walks of life
 
04:41:04.110 --> 04:41:04.120 align:start position:0%
to serve in our state legislature and if
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
that's how we want to have it that's
 
04:41:09.310 --> 04:41:09.320 align:start position:0%
fine but let's not act like they pay us
 
04:41:11.868 --> 04:41:11.878 align:start position:0%
you know we've all hold the um heard the
 
04:41:15.670 --> 04:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
joke about you know back in the Soviet
 
04:41:18.230 --> 04:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
Union they pretend to pay us we pretend
 
04:41:20.910 --> 04:41:20.920 align:start position:0%
to work well we do a lot of work and we
 
04:41:22.948 --> 04:41:22.958 align:start position:0%
don't get paid for it let's stop
 
04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
pretending to pay us thank you Mr
 
04:41:26.680 --> 04:41:30.310 align:start position:0%
pretending to pay us thank you Mr
chairman

04:41:30.310 --> 04:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:35.110 --> 04:41:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:39.030 --> 04:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
question do I see yes
 
04:41:41.590 --> 04:41:41.600 align:start position:0%
representa thank you Mr chair um I just
 
04:41:44.310 --> 04:41:44.320 align:start position:0%
I want to Echo the sentiments of our of
 
04:41:46.510 --> 04:41:46.520 align:start position:0%
my colleague representative Smith I I
 
04:41:51.030 --> 04:41:51.040 align:start position:0%
think um I think that the you know our
 
04:41:52.788 --> 04:41:52.798 align:start position:0%
unlike any other legislative body we we
 
04:41:54.910 --> 04:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
really have we really create some
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
obstacles for people to to serve um in
 
04:42:01.750 --> 04:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
this legislature and one of the um you
 
04:42:03.628 --> 04:42:03.638 align:start position:0%
know I I support the amendment because I
 
04:42:06.230 --> 04:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
think it would be it would make it just
 
04:42:08.350 --> 04:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
easier for all of us if we did want to
 
04:42:10.430 --> 04:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know change change certain things to
 
04:42:11.868 --> 04:42:11.878 align:start position:0%
just do it instead statute instead of
 
04:42:14.788 --> 04:42:14.798 align:start position:0%
within our own Constitution um if we
 
04:42:17.470 --> 04:42:17.480 align:start position:0%
wanted to continue to pay us $200 a for
 
04:42:19.470 --> 04:42:19.480 align:start position:0%
a term then we could do that in statute
 
04:42:22.868 --> 04:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
rather than in in in our constitution um
 
04:42:25.910 --> 04:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
and so just you know the actual just the
 
04:42:27.628 --> 04:42:27.638 align:start position:0%
technical workings of it would be easier
 
04:42:29.510 --> 04:42:29.520 align:start position:0%
but I you know I think one of the
 
04:42:31.430 --> 04:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
biggest issues that I see in my people
 
04:42:33.670 --> 04:42:33.680 align:start position:0%
in my generation currently serving it's
 
04:42:36.070 --> 04:42:36.080 align:start position:0%
it's tough um it's tough on so many of
 
04:42:38.190 --> 04:42:38.200 align:start position:0%
us who want to you know own a home and
 
04:42:40.910 --> 04:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
and and and have kids um and you know
 
04:42:42.628 --> 04:42:42.638 align:start position:0%
make that question do I want to serve my
 
04:42:44.270 --> 04:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
community or do I want to have or do I
 
04:42:48.310 --> 04:42:48.320 align:start position:0%
want to raise a family um so it's um
 
04:42:50.628 --> 04:42:50.638 align:start position:0%
speaking for people who are who are in
 
04:42:52.510 --> 04:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
their 20s and 30s who are making those
 
04:42:54.750 --> 04:42:54.760 align:start position:0%
life decisions of figuring out you know
 
04:42:56.670 --> 04:42:56.680 align:start position:0%
if I want to move I have to live in this
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
certain district and this these certain
 
04:43:01.788 --> 04:43:01.798 align:start position:0%
guidelines um and so and then to be and
 
04:43:03.430 --> 04:43:03.440 align:start position:0%
then to be so I could be compensated
 
04:43:06.708 --> 04:43:06.718 align:start position:0%
$200 the term um and so I think it's you
 
04:43:08.430 --> 04:43:08.440 align:start position:0%
know I think we set up a lot of issues
 
04:43:10.150 --> 04:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
and you know breaking down those
 
04:43:12.390 --> 04:43:12.400 align:start position:0%
barriers so that more our body could be
 
04:43:15.270 --> 04:43:15.280 align:start position:0%
truly more representative would be would
 
04:43:18.550 --> 04:43:18.560 align:start position:0%
be huge um as and I say this as one of
 
04:43:21.070 --> 04:43:21.080 align:start position:0%
the you know I think three Latinos who
 
04:43:23.990 --> 04:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
serve in the entire State out of 400
 
04:43:27.350 --> 04:43:27.360 align:start position:0%
state representatives um in so I think
 
04:43:29.948 --> 04:43:29.958 align:start position:0%
you know it's we have we have work we
 
04:43:31.470 --> 04:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
have to do to make sure that people that
 
04:43:32.708 --> 04:43:32.718 align:start position:0%
we are
 
04:43:35.150 --> 04:43:35.160 align:start position:0%
racially um representative and I think
 
04:43:37.350 --> 04:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
this would be an active step and even if
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
it wasn't this bill you know we could we
 
04:43:41.270 --> 04:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
could find ways to work through it to
 
04:43:44.628 --> 04:43:44.638 align:start position:0%
find Solutions so um while you know
 
04:43:46.510 --> 04:43:46.520 align:start position:0%
while it may not be out to pass I'd love
 
04:43:48.430 --> 04:43:48.440 align:start position:0%
to at least retain and think about how
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
we can actually make some changes but um
 
04:43:54.110 --> 04:43:54.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I think um I will be voting uh no
 
04:43:56.310 --> 04:43:56.320 align:start position:0%

04:43:59.030 --> 04:43:59.040 align:start position:0%

04:46:13.990 --> 04:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
was um we were we were looking for a
 
04:46:18.550 --> 04:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
motion on this um we
 
04:46:22.350 --> 04:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
have represent Sim easily forgotten I
 
04:46:23.390 --> 04:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
guess Mr
 
04:46:26.548 --> 04:46:26.558 align:start position:0%
chair thank you Mr
 
04:46:28.670 --> 04:46:28.680 align:start position:0%
chair I would uh I would like to make a
 
04:46:32.070 --> 04:46:32.080 align:start position:0%
motion to itl cacr
 
04:46:36.390 --> 04:46:36.400 align:start position:0%
11 second I'll second that Mr chairman
 
04:46:39.150 --> 04:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
representative Smith
 
04:46:41.708 --> 04:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
second um
 
04:46:44.030 --> 04:46:44.040 align:start position:0%
any discussion U there are just way too
 
04:46:46.270 --> 04:46:46.280 align:start position:0%
many problems with this bill to to
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
encapsulate in a short amount of time um
 
04:46:52.868 --> 04:46:52.878 align:start position:0%
but it um first off messes with our our
 
04:46:55.350 --> 04:46:55.360 align:start position:0%
balance of powers um it basically
 
04:46:57.110 --> 04:46:57.120 align:start position:0%
removes the responsibility that is
 
04:46:58.990 --> 04:46:59.000 align:start position:0%
already within the legislature uh where
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
we have systems in place already um to
 
04:47:03.430 --> 04:47:03.440 align:start position:0%
to check the Judiciary in this place and
 
04:47:05.628 --> 04:47:05.638 align:start position:0%
puts it back on the citizens uh and
 
04:47:08.708 --> 04:47:08.718 align:start position:0%
really just encourages us even more to
 
04:47:10.350 --> 04:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
um politicize Court decisions through
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
partisan ship rather than being
 
04:47:13.670 --> 04:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
concerned about the constitutionality
 
04:47:15.150 --> 04:47:15.160 align:start position:0%
and I would also add that the bill
 
04:47:17.948 --> 04:47:17.958 align:start position:0%
itself doesn't actually protect um from
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional measures a
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional measure that the court
 
04:47:23.190 --> 04:47:23.200 align:start position:0%
takes can still be overturned um and
 
04:47:25.868 --> 04:47:25.878 align:start position:0%
reversed so um for those reasons and
 
04:47:29.628 --> 04:47:29.638 align:start position:0%
many more uh I'm going it on this one
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments
 
04:47:34.990 --> 04:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith yeah I just um I'd
 
04:47:38.628 --> 04:47:38.638 align:start position:0%
point out that on on an entirely
 
04:47:41.470 --> 04:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
practical level you know even if we we
 
04:47:45.788 --> 04:47:45.798 align:start position:0%
all supported this um there's no time
 
04:47:48.910 --> 04:47:48.920 align:start position:0%
limit so there would be nothing stopping

nope
 
04:49:37.110 --> 04:49:37.120 align:start position:0%
none none we're good to go um so the
 
04:49:40.948 --> 04:49:40.958 align:start position:0%
idea of Clos the hearing on or the exec
 
04:49:45.270 --> 04:49:45.280 align:start position:0%
session um so the idea is next Monday um
 
04:49:48.830 --> 04:49:48.840 align:start position:0%
will be a much more difficult day than
 
04:49:52.270 --> 04:49:52.280 align:start position:0%
today um I think the idea will be that
 
04:49:54.670 --> 04:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
we'll have po hearings beginning at
 
04:49:57.070 --> 04:49:57.080 align:start position:0%
n9ine o'clock on all of the emergency
 
04:50:01.628 --> 04:50:01.638 align:start position:0%
power fill um I suspect there will be no
 
04:50:04.030 --> 04:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
time to EXA any of those so we'll have
 
04:50:07.030 --> 04:50:07.040 align:start position:0%
one more day um that should be a short
 
04:50:10.190 --> 04:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
day somewhere in there but um our
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
deadline is March 11th I think for all
 
04:50:17.750 --> 04:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
of those to be reported out so any
 
04:50:23.470 --> 04:50:23.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh on on next Monday 11 uh the
 
04:50:27.150 --> 04:50:27.160 align:start position:0%
1st of March we also and and I want to
 
04:50:30.150 --> 04:50:30.160 align:start position:0%

04:50:33.350 --> 04:50:33.360 align:start position:0%

04:50:36.430 --> 04:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
noon time and representative Le I start
 
04:50:39.548 --> 04:50:39.558 align:start position:0%
hand quickly yeah um so that one bill
 
04:50:41.590 --> 04:50:41.600 align:start position:0%
about statutory committees and all of
 
04:50:43.390 --> 04:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
that is that
 
04:50:47.750 --> 04:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:50.390 --> 04:50:50.400 align:start position:0%
get there's one bill about uh that that
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
eliminates uh abolishes certain
 
04:50:54.628 --> 04:50:54.638 align:start position:0%
statutory committees and commissions and
 
04:50:57.030 --> 04:50:57.040 align:start position:0%
just sort of cleans up I we we did it
 
04:50:59.430 --> 04:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
last uh session and it just got lost in
 
04:51:03.628 --> 04:51:03.638 align:start position:0%
the mix is that one scheduled for us to
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
hear the one on on you're right hold on
 
04:51:10.110 --> 04:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
on statutory committee that we are going
 
04:51:10.120 --> 04:51:14.470 align:start position:0%
on statutory committee that we are going
to

04:51:14.470 --> 04:51:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:16.990 --> 04:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
we can that one that we had last year
 
04:51:19.470 --> 04:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
that didn't go on yeah we can blend that
 
04:51:21.150 --> 04:51:21.160 align:start position:0%
with another bill at some point and if
 
04:51:22.990 --> 04:51:23.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have something before us I'll
 
04:51:25.548 --> 04:51:25.558 align:start position:0%
find a Senate bill to put it on want to
 
04:51:29.390 --> 04:51:29.400 align:start position:0%

one more day of an exact session we
 
04:51:41.910 --> 04:51:41.920 align:start position:0%

04:52:29.350 --> 04:52:29.360 align:start position:0%
that was good you're welome I have a
 
04:52:32.470 --> 04:52:32.480 align:start position:0%
quick question for you Mr chairman yes
 
04:52:35.510 --> 04:52:35.520 align:start position:0%
um when when do you imagine if you have
 
04:52:38.628 --> 04:52:38.638 align:start position:0%
a time in mind um that the exec sessions
 
04:52:40.230 --> 04:52:40.240 align:start position:0%
we next week are going to be and the
 
04:52:41.750 --> 04:52:41.760 align:start position:0%
reason I'm asking is I have a dentist
 
04:52:43.948 --> 04:52:43.958 align:start position:0%
appointment I need to plan around and
 
04:52:45.510 --> 04:52:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to figure out if I actually
 
04:52:47.948 --> 04:52:47.958 align:start position:0%
need to plan around it I commiserate
 
04:52:50.548 --> 04:52:50.558 align:start position:0%
with that but I also have no idea what
 
04:52:52.750 --> 04:52:52.760 align:start position:0%
the scheduling is for these rooms that's
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
the that's the key thing I don't
 
04:52:58.030 --> 04:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
think getting a head shake over on
 
04:53:01.110 --> 04:53:01.120 align:start position:0%
either side so uh as soon as I I'll
 
04:53:03.230 --> 04:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
leave it this way as soon as I know you
 
04:53:03.240 --> 04:53:04.110 align:start position:0%
leave it this way as soon as I know you
will

04:53:04.110 --> 04:53:04.120 align:start position:0%
