so I'd like to start this morning's
 
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
conference with a few remarks
 
00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 align:start position:0%
about compromise and bipartisanship
 
00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.650 align:start position:0%
about compromise and bipartisanship
yesterday

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
yesterday
 
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
Governor sununu signed
 
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
the state budget
 
00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
he Senator Bradley Senator Susie speaker
 
00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 align:start position:0%
Packard and representative Wilhelm made
 
00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
some comments during the course of the
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
signing ceremony and the governor in
 
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 align:start position:0%
particular talked about how this budget
 
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 align:start position:0%
was achieved with a lot of compromise
 
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
and a lot of bipartisan ship
 
00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley at one point even said
 
00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 align:start position:0%
compromise is not
 
00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
and I've been thinking about that
 
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.650 align:start position:0%
and I've been thinking about that
overnight

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
overnight
 
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 align:start position:0%
and realizing that
 
00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 align:start position:0%
compromises the art of
 
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
and there's no person that I have seen
 
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.949 align:start position:0%
and there's no person that I have seen
recently

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:18.959 align:start position:0%
recently
 
00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 align:start position:0%
in this legislature who is better at
 
00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 align:start position:0%
that than Senator David Waters he is a
 
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
and Senator Waters I know was
 
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 align:start position:0%
instrumental in helping to put together
 
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 align:start position:0%
the compromise that we have before
 
00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
and so I commend
 
00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 align:start position:0%
Senator waters for his work on this bill
 
00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 align:start position:0%
I have learned a lot about how to
 
00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:48.659 align:start position:0%
compromise by interacting with Senator
 
00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:49.910 align:start position:0%
compromise by interacting with Senator
Waters

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
Waters
 
00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 align:start position:0%
I respect him greatly and I appreciate
 
00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
all you do for your constituents and for
 
00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature
 
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
as a whole
 
00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'm embarrassed
 
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
and uh it's just it's a team you're
 
00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 align:start position:0%
seeing a senate team I know you have a
 
00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 align:start position:0%
house a house team and it's difficult
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
but that's the spirit of of why we're
 
00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 align:start position:0%
all here and um that's what this is a
 
00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
this is a different this is a difficult
 
00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:19.979 align:start position:0%
Bill well we thank you it has proven so
 
00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
and um but the Senate position is here
 
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 align:start position:0%
and I think it's because we worked very
 
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 align:start position:0%
hard to get to something that not just
 
00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we felt we could legislatively
 
00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:33.479 align:start position:0%
bring forward but that would have the
 
00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:34.670 align:start position:0%
bring forward but that would have the
support

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 align:start position:0%
of uh the agencies and the governor but
 
00:04:38.749 --> 00:04:38.759 align:start position:0%
but here we are but I appreciate your
 
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 align:start position:0%
words Mr chairman and we thank you for
 
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 align:start position:0%
the the hard work you've done
 
00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about
 
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.050 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of talk about
bipartisanship

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship
 
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
bipartisanship means both sides come
 
00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 align:start position:0%
and even though there's a lot of talk
 
00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 align:start position:0%
about it
 
00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 align:start position:0%
you don't see a lot of bipartisanship
 
00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 align:start position:0%
actually happening when the opportunity
 
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:08.040 align:start position:0%
but in my mind HB 281 is a great
 
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.650 align:start position:0%
but in my mind HB 281 is a great
opportunity

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
opportunity
 
00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:12.419 align:start position:0%
for us to show some bipartisanship
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
we each give a little and we each get a
 
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.550 align:start position:0%
we each give a little and we each get a
little

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
little
 
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
and that's the way legislation moves
 
00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:19.909 align:start position:0%
and that's the way legislation moves
forward

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
I've been in the house now for nine
 
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.730 align:start position:0%
I've been in the house now for nine
years

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:25.800 align:start position:0%
and I've watched the progression of
 
00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation
 
00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 align:start position:0%
obviously mostly in the energy sector
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
but in other parts of of Statute as well
 
00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
and nothing big typically happens in a
 
00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 align:start position:0%
given year
 
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 align:start position:0%
small steps year by year are what
 
00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
determine what good policy looks like
 
00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 align:start position:0%
it's a constant process of revision
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 281 I think is a bill
 
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 align:start position:0%
that implements several small steps that
 
00:06:04.129 --> 00:06:04.139 align:start position:0%
get us to a better policy position that
 
00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:10.919 align:start position:0%
now there were 23 members of the Senate
 
00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:13.080 align:start position:0%
who said they wanted this bill to pass
 
00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 align:start position:0%
and there were 176 members of the House
 
00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
who said they wanted this bill to pass
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
that's 199 legislators
 
00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 align:start position:0%
there was one member of the Senate at
 
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.580 align:start position:0%
180 members of the House who said they
 
00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 align:start position:0%
did not want it to pass that's 181
 
00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
which leaves us with a net of plus 18
 
00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:34.010 align:start position:0%
which leaves us with a net of plus 18
[Music]

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
people who wanted this bill to pass and
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 align:start position:0%
so here we sit with seven people who are
 
00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
making the wishes of those 199
 
00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:52.020 align:start position:0%
legislators who want this bill to pass
 
00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:59.330 --> 00:06:59.340 align:start position:0%
and so that's why we're here for this
 
00:07:03.469 --> 00:07:03.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
so those are my opening remarks about
 
00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:09.780 align:start position:0%
this Committee of conference I will make
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
one other remark
 
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
it was there was a misunderstanding
 
00:07:16.909 --> 00:07:16.919 align:start position:0%
about what this meeting was
 
00:07:18.469 --> 00:07:18.479 align:start position:0%
by some people
 
00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:20.880 align:start position:0%
apparently they didn't realize it was a
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
committee of conference they thought it
 
00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
was a a public meeting on House Bill 281
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
and so some people came prepared this
 
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:32.660 align:start position:0%
morning to offer testimony about
 
00:07:35.450 --> 00:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
hb281 which we cannot accept
 
00:07:39.129 --> 00:07:39.139 align:start position:0%
and I apologize to people for that
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding if there was such a
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding but it's it's just not
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
the nature of a committee of conference
 
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:47.880 align:start position:0%
that you accept testimony from from
 
00:07:51.469 --> 00:07:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:55.610 --> 00:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
so with that said I would uh open the
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
floor to members conferees to have a
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
discussion about how you want to move
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
forward with House Bill 281
 
00:08:07.309 --> 00:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
Senator avard I I'm just uh
 
00:08:09.529 --> 00:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
I'm in awe that we're at this this point
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
because I was listening to you on the
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
floor and uh I thought you spoke very
 
00:08:16.370 --> 00:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
eloquently about this particular Bill
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
and uh as you just spoke and
 
00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:24.060 align:start position:0%
the opportunity lies right here with a
 
00:08:26.869 --> 00:08:26.879 align:start position:0%
lot of people in agreement and hopefully
 
00:08:28.790 --> 00:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
the governor as well
 
00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:29.510 align:start position:0%
the governor as well
um

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:32.700 align:start position:0%
to expand that metering and Municipal
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
house I mean some one I don't know if
 
00:08:36.050 --> 00:08:36.060 align:start position:0%
we're going to get this opportunity
 
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.430 align:start position:0%
we're going to get this opportunity
again

00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:08:40.130 --> 00:08:40.140 align:start position:0%
uh I'm hoping if there is room for comp
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
if there is a room for complimize we can
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
do it but I
 
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:47.940 align:start position:0%
I thought we really laid a good
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
foundation here and
 
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:52.740 align:start position:0%
I was kind of floored that we're here
 
00:08:56.990 --> 00:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
but to be frank with you uh I'm hoping
 
00:08:59.449 --> 00:08:59.459 align:start position:0%
wickets to move forward and uh in a
 
00:09:00.889 --> 00:09:00.899 align:start position:0%
positive light and we've had a lot of
 
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
success in the last few days
 
00:09:06.769 --> 00:09:06.779 align:start position:0%
with that same spirit and uh
 
00:09:09.949 --> 00:09:09.959 align:start position:0%
I'm all ears
 
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:13.500 align:start position:0%
anybody else have comments that they'd
 
00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
like to make
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
representative McGee thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
um it's been very very fun to hear
 
00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
everybody speak on the bill it's it's a
 
00:09:29.329 --> 00:09:29.339 align:start position:0%
process going through I'm the person who
 
00:09:32.449 --> 00:09:32.459 align:start position:0%
um stood up in opposition to concurrence
 
00:09:36.050 --> 00:09:36.060 align:start position:0%
on 281 and so I brought an amendment
 
00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:37.620 align:start position:0%
this morning that I'd like to just
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
explain to folks about what the
 
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
exceptions were for the people who were
 
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
opposed in the house
 
00:09:47.210 --> 00:09:47.220 align:start position:0%
and just for consideration of whether or
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
not we can make it an even better bill I
 
00:09:52.490 --> 00:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
have copies here so I can send them
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
around the chairs got them on and can
 
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
send those that way
 
00:10:00.110 --> 00:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
here's another one for you Doug
 
00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:04.620 align:start position:0%
um so the two items that I would propose
 
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:07.140 align:start position:0%
that we remove from the bill are the
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
ones that are not not Central to I think
 
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:13.320 align:start position:0%
the original intent of the bill the
 
00:10:15.769 --> 00:10:15.779 align:start position:0%
sections section three
 
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
which is the which is representative
 
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:20.940 align:start position:0%
Thomas's Bill originally that asked us
 
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
to put the cost of the renewable
 
00:10:26.030 --> 00:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
portfolio standards on everyone's
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
electric bill on their December bill it
 
00:10:31.490 --> 00:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
would be a annual total
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
um the original point of the bill was to
 
00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:35.580 align:start position:0%
create transparency for the customers so
 
00:10:36.889 --> 00:10:36.899 align:start position:0%
they would have an understanding of what
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
the RPS charges were
 
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:41.160 align:start position:0%
and the way the bill worked out through
 
00:10:43.970 --> 00:10:43.980 align:start position:0%
the process is that it would have cost
 
00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
some money to create an individual uh
 
00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:50.760 align:start position:0%
summary for every every Bill and so the
 
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:53.100 align:start position:0%
utilities came back and said we'll take
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
an average user's Bill we'll average the
 
00:10:58.550 --> 00:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
RPS charge and we'll put that cumulative
 
00:11:01.009 --> 00:11:01.019 align:start position:0%
average charge on every bill
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
and the exception
 
00:11:05.630 --> 00:11:05.640 align:start position:0%
um that we had in the house was that
 
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:08.700 align:start position:0%
rather than lending transparency to the
 
00:11:11.329 --> 00:11:11.339 align:start position:0%
bill it would not be the actual charge
 
00:11:13.009 --> 00:11:13.019 align:start position:0%
that the customer was charged so
 
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:14.700 align:start position:0%
everyone's bill would have a cost on
 
00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:16.680 align:start position:0%
there but it could be higher or lower
 
00:11:19.130 --> 00:11:19.140 align:start position:0%
than what you actually paid and we
 
00:11:20.690 --> 00:11:20.700 align:start position:0%
thought that would be more confusing and
 
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:22.140 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't actually achieve the
 
00:11:24.889 --> 00:11:24.899 align:start position:0%
goal so that was the argument
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
that we made on the house floor and so
 
00:11:33.170 --> 00:11:33.180 align:start position:0%
that was HB 251 that was part of 281 so
 
00:11:35.449 --> 00:11:35.459 align:start position:0%
it was one-fifth of this bill but it
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
also was heard separately and it lost in
 
00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:40.980 align:start position:0%
the house when the argument was made
 
00:11:42.889 --> 00:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
that it would not contribute to
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
transparency that it might really
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
confuse confuse people further because
 
00:11:48.290 --> 00:11:48.300 align:start position:0%
the amount could be more or less than
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
what you were charged and how you know
 
00:11:52.850 --> 00:11:52.860 align:start position:0%
how well would the customer be able to
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
interpret that so we thought it was
 
00:11:57.590 --> 00:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
confusing so that's number three
 
00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:00.300 align:start position:0%
um in the amended analysis list of
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
what's in the bill
 
00:12:04.430 --> 00:12:04.440 align:start position:0%
and then number four is
 
00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
um the disillusion of the easy board the
 
00:12:09.170 --> 00:12:09.180 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and sustainable energy
 
00:12:12.050 --> 00:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
board and that's a board that chairman
 
00:12:13.790 --> 00:12:13.800 align:start position:0%
Vose and I both serve on as well as
 
00:12:18.650 --> 00:12:18.660 align:start position:0%
Senator avard the board has been uh
 
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
has been in service basically to the
 
00:12:24.290 --> 00:12:24.300 align:start position:0%
state for 15 years so it was instituted
 
00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600 align:start position:0%
in 2008 and
 
00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
um we had there were hearings on the
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
easy board I wasn't I was out on medical
 
00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
leave the time so I never really got to
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:40.200 align:start position:0%
um what I thought about the the easy
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
board but
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
um sort of the
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
the arguments against it seem to be that
 
00:12:49.190 --> 00:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
it's you know not needed and
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
um in a recent meeting a month ago
 
00:12:54.769 --> 00:12:54.779 align:start position:0%
one of our members Matt Cisco who's from
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
an engineering firm that does Energy
 
00:12:59.710 --> 00:12:59.720 align:start position:0%
Efficiency work did a presentation on
 
00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:03.180 align:start position:0%
the impediments to New Hampshire's clean
 
00:13:05.449 --> 00:13:05.459 align:start position:0%
energy Workforce and talked about how
 
00:13:06.530 --> 00:13:06.540 align:start position:0%
that's going to be something that's
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
going to be preventing us from being
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
able to move forward with plans that
 
00:13:12.650 --> 00:13:12.660 align:start position:0%
we're trying to implement so just like
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
everyone else is having Workforce issues
 
00:13:17.710 --> 00:13:17.720 align:start position:0%
the clean energy sector also has those
 
00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:20.459 align:start position:0%
so it was an incredible slide deck
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
everybody was very impressed with it he
 
00:13:24.069 --> 00:13:24.079 align:start position:0%
had been working on it for weeks
 
00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
and at the same time
 
00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
Doria Brown who's the energy manager for
 
00:13:34.430 --> 00:13:34.440 align:start position:0%
the city of Nashua had been heading up a
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that the House and Senate
 
00:13:39.530 --> 00:13:39.540 align:start position:0%
had asked with the passage of Senate
 
00:13:43.250 --> 00:13:43.260 align:start position:0%
Bill 549 the easy board to take on they
 
00:13:46.329 --> 00:13:46.339 align:start position:0%
asked us to stop doing the triennial
 
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:50.700 align:start position:0%
energy report that recommended what we
 
00:13:52.190 --> 00:13:52.200 align:start position:0%
should be investing in the New Hampshire
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
saves program they so they put into
 
00:13:56.930 --> 00:13:56.940 align:start position:0%
statute that that would now be handled
 
00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
by a calculation that was adopted with
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
um and they asked us to take a pot of
 
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.210 align:start position:0%
um and they asked us to take a pot of
money

00:14:05.210 --> 00:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:14:08.150 --> 00:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
that was funded by that bill and go
 
00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:11.180 align:start position:0%
forward and create an Energy Efficiency
 
00:14:14.750 --> 00:14:14.760 align:start position:0%
uh plan for reaching out to the public
 
00:14:17.210 --> 00:14:17.220 align:start position:0%
on the benefits of Energy Efficiency so
 
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
we had this subcommittee headed up again
 
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
by Doria Brown that was working on an
 
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.389 align:start position:0%
by Doria Brown that was working on an
RFP

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
RFP
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
and so the discussions recently in the
 
00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
easy board were that the doe was
 
00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
prepared to take over that RFP and move
 
00:14:33.290 --> 00:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
with it from there
 
00:14:35.870 --> 00:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
but what I would
 
00:14:38.569 --> 00:14:38.579 align:start position:0%
like to say on behalf of this particular
 
00:14:39.949 --> 00:14:39.959 align:start position:0%
change is
 
00:14:43.129 --> 00:14:43.139 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons that the house or the
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
the majority or the members that voted
 
00:14:47.930 --> 00:14:47.940 align:start position:0%
uh last Thursday
 
00:14:51.590 --> 00:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
uh were opposed to the way 281 came to
 
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
us is that two of the items in the bill
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
including the easy board change were
 
00:14:59.090 --> 00:14:59.100 align:start position:0%
bills that were retained in committee
 
00:15:00.829 --> 00:15:00.839 align:start position:0%
right so we made the argument to them
 
00:15:02.449 --> 00:15:02.459 align:start position:0%
these bills never got through the house
 
00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
they didn't have a full vote through the
 
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
house so they were kind of plucked out
 
00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
of retained committee status and put
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%
into 281. so that was an objection that
 
00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:16.500 align:start position:0%
that we made and that I guess worked by
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
a couple of votes
 
00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:18.949 align:start position:0%
a couple of votes
um

00:15:18.949 --> 00:15:18.959 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:23.779 align:start position:0%
so where we're at is that we are
 
00:15:28.069 --> 00:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
eliminating a vibrant Board of experts
 
00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
who bring
 
00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:30.769 align:start position:0%
who bring
um

00:15:30.769 --> 00:15:30.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:33.829 --> 00:15:33.839 align:start position:0%
you know incredibly relevant experience
 
00:15:36.530 --> 00:15:36.540 align:start position:0%
to the table in Folsom conversation
 
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
around energy issues which are not any
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
less complex today than they were in
 
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:43.610 align:start position:0%
less complex today than they were in
2008.

00:15:43.610 --> 00:15:43.620 align:start position:0%
2008.
 
00:15:45.889 --> 00:15:45.899 align:start position:0%
um and in our last meeting Kate Peterson
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry Kate Peters from eversource
 
00:15:50.569 --> 00:15:50.579 align:start position:0%
who has been on the board the entire
 
00:15:53.090 --> 00:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
time and has taken various leadership
 
00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:54.779 align:start position:0%
roles over the years
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
stated how valuable it is and how other
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
states don't do it this way that she has
 
00:16:01.790 --> 00:16:01.800 align:start position:0%
a place where she can have first-hand
 
00:16:04.629 --> 00:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
conversations with Community Action
 
00:16:08.750 --> 00:16:08.760 align:start position:0%
agencies and New Hampshire Builders and
 
00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:10.260 align:start position:0%
and all the other folks who are giving
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
of their time
 
00:16:16.370 --> 00:16:16.380 align:start position:0%
so what I want to propose is that we
 
00:16:19.430 --> 00:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
remove that section as well leave the
 
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill in its retained status in the house
 
00:16:26.870 --> 00:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
and allow us to try and determine
 
00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.370 align:start position:0%
and allow us to try and determine
um

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
in a bill that would be an early bill
 
00:16:32.449 --> 00:16:32.459 align:start position:0%
for January
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
what the new charge of the easy board
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
should be rather than disbanding them
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
when they're in the middle of working
 
00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:40.440 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
um you know perhaps they could morph
 
00:16:45.889 --> 00:16:45.899 align:start position:0%
into grid mod which I think was uh
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
suggested by one of our Watchers here
 
00:16:51.290 --> 00:16:51.300 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking to put together
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
other boards of experts to try and help
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
us with grid modernization perhaps that
 
00:16:58.910 --> 00:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
could be you know the new charge for
 
00:17:01.670 --> 00:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
this group of people rather than letting
 
00:17:03.949 --> 00:17:03.959 align:start position:0%
them go because it
 
00:17:03.959 --> 00:17:04.569 align:start position:0%
them go because it
um

00:17:04.569 --> 00:17:04.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:07.490 --> 00:17:07.500 align:start position:0%
implied in dissolving that board is that
 
00:17:10.069 --> 00:17:10.079 align:start position:0%
they're not needed and I would propose
 
00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
that they still are
 
00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.189 align:start position:0%
that they still are
so

00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:15.540 align:start position:0%
um so that would leave
 
00:17:17.449 --> 00:17:17.459 align:start position:0%
us with
 
00:17:17.459 --> 00:17:18.230 align:start position:0%
us with
um

00:17:18.230 --> 00:17:18.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:20.569 --> 00:17:20.579 align:start position:0%
it would the least cost integrated
 
00:17:23.030 --> 00:17:23.040 align:start position:0%
resource planning repeal would be
 
00:17:26.169 --> 00:17:26.179 align:start position:0%
maintained and the municipal host
 
00:17:28.730 --> 00:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
expansion for municipalities would be
 
00:17:32.030 --> 00:17:32.040 align:start position:0%
maintained and the proposed SEC changes
 
00:17:33.650 --> 00:17:33.660 align:start position:0%
would be maintained
 
00:17:35.870 --> 00:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
so that the two
 
00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:37.860 align:start position:0%
things that are kind of not like the
 
00:17:43.190 --> 00:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:46.190 --> 00:17:46.200 align:start position:0%
I know it's a lot but okay that's that's
 
00:17:48.169 --> 00:17:48.179 align:start position:0%
my explanation thank you for explaining
 
00:17:51.890 --> 00:17:51.900 align:start position:0%
that is there any discussion of that
 
00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:54.900 align:start position:0%
proposal or is there a motion on that
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
proposal I noticed that the least cost
 
00:18:01.130 --> 00:18:01.140 align:start position:0%
integrated the resource planning
 
00:18:02.990 --> 00:18:03.000 align:start position:0%
planning yeah
 
00:18:04.130 --> 00:18:04.140 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if you were there in
 
00:18:05.450 --> 00:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
committee when we were talking about
 
00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
that and how that in some respects it is
 
00:18:12.230 --> 00:18:12.240 align:start position:0%
outdated and is not as effective and I
 
00:18:14.210 --> 00:18:14.220 align:start position:0%
believe we made a commitment uh both
 
00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
myself with Senator Waters and Senator
 
00:18:18.110 --> 00:18:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative Rose how that we would
 
00:18:20.930 --> 00:18:20.940 align:start position:0%
readdress this this particular issue
 
00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
next session yep uh
 
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.890 align:start position:0%
next session yep uh
uh

00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
uh that is unaffected by what I'm
 
00:18:29.990 --> 00:18:30.000 align:start position:0%
proposing right yeah right yeah removal
 
00:18:33.710 --> 00:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
of that yep yep okay
 
00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:34.610 align:start position:0%
of that yep yep okay
um

00:18:34.610 --> 00:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:36.409 --> 00:18:36.419 align:start position:0%
well I think I understand that that is
 
00:18:38.570 --> 00:18:38.580 align:start position:0%
the compromise right that is that that
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
is the goal yeah I'm curious have you
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
spoken with the executive branch at all
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
their disposition on this because no I
 
00:18:48.049 --> 00:18:48.059 align:start position:0%
don't get a lot of opportunity they're
 
00:18:51.130 --> 00:18:51.140 align:start position:0%
going to have to assign it or
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:18:55.970 --> 00:18:55.980 align:start position:0%
have you worked with them at all on this
 
00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.409 align:start position:0%
have you worked with them at all on this
no

00:18:57.409 --> 00:18:57.419 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:18:57.419 --> 00:18:59.330 align:start position:0%
no
no

00:18:59.330 --> 00:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:19:01.549 --> 00:19:01.559 align:start position:0%
so representative McGee do you want to
 
00:19:03.169 --> 00:19:03.179 align:start position:0%
make a motion about this uh sure
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
Amendment yeah I'd like to make a motion
 
00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
that we have a vote on whether or not to
 
00:19:07.260 --> 00:19:08.390 align:start position:0%
that we have a vote on whether or not to
accept

00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%

with them
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
Senator a bar and other members of enr
 
00:41:21.890 --> 00:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
that we are fully committed to doing the
 
00:41:23.750 --> 00:41:23.760 align:start position:0%
things to work together and quickly to
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
do some of the things we need to do
 
00:41:28.030 --> 00:41:28.040 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah
 
00:41:32.089 --> 00:41:32.099 align:start position:0%
excellent excellent and we have members
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
of the public who have submitted some
 
00:41:36.109 --> 00:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
good ideas and and we look forward to
 
00:41:38.810 --> 00:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
examining those uh
 
00:41:42.230 --> 00:41:42.240 align:start position:0%
in the coming months so we thank you for
 
00:41:43.730 --> 00:41:43.740 align:start position:0%
that Mr chairman I would just say one
 
00:41:45.530 --> 00:41:45.540 align:start position:0%
thing I think you know we've done a lot
 
00:41:47.150 --> 00:41:47.160 align:start position:0%
of work on the site evaluation committee
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
and just for for public dissertation I
 
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:52.260 align:start position:0%
was at the ferc meeting yesterday up in
 
00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:54.900 align:start position:0%
uh Portland and a lot of people up there
 
00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:56.760 align:start position:0%
expressed a lot of concern about citing
 
00:41:58.609 --> 00:41:58.619 align:start position:0%
in New England and New Hampshire
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
specifically as well and I'm not saying
 
00:42:02.450 --> 00:42:02.460 align:start position:0%
that this is the perfect fix to
 
00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
everything but I think it's a step in
 
00:42:05.329 --> 00:42:05.339 align:start position:0%
the right direction and I'd certainly
 
00:42:07.190 --> 00:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
encourage everybody to look at is there
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
ways we can make it better because
 
00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:10.560 align:start position:0%
regardless of what you want to build
 
00:42:12.349 --> 00:42:12.359 align:start position:0%
citing is going to be and I think people
 
00:42:13.849 --> 00:42:13.859 align:start position:0%
are coming to this realization this is
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
going to be the big issue whether you're
 
00:42:17.569 --> 00:42:17.579 align:start position:0%
building offshore wind you still need to
 
00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:19.079 align:start position:0%
build transmission someplace people
 
00:42:20.690 --> 00:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
sometimes think oh we have all this
 
00:42:22.609 --> 00:42:22.619 align:start position:0%
offshore wind it'll just appear in our
 
00:42:25.190 --> 00:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
house somehow uh whether it's solar
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
whether it's natural gas or I don't know
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
what the project is it's all going to
 
00:42:30.230 --> 00:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
involve siding and we've got to make
 
00:42:31.970 --> 00:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
deciding so it protects our environment
 
00:42:33.650 --> 00:42:33.660 align:start position:0%
and our state but also makes things
 
00:42:35.870 --> 00:42:35.880 align:start position:0%
possible without taking years and years
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
and years to get it because that's just
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
skiers investors off and they want come
 
00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.450 align:start position:0%
skiers investors off and they want come
here

00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:44.700 align:start position:0%
well said and with that we'll adjourn
