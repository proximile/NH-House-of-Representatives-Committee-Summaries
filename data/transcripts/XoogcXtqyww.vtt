00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we felt we could legislatively
 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.469 align:start position:0%
that we felt we could legislatively
bring<00:04:32.280><c> forward</c><00:04:32.460><c> but</c><00:04:32.759><c> that</c><00:04:32.880><c> would</c><00:04:33.180><c> have</c><00:04:33.300><c> the</c>
