00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 align:start position:0%

I'm here today to speak in favor of
 
00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 1 as amended by the Senate

as it came over to you
 
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
um many children in the Juvenile Justice
 
00:06:53.029 --> 00:06:53.039 align:start position:0%
System I know you've heard a lot of
 
00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:54.479 align:start position:0%
testimony in the senior centers I'll
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
keep this brief for you this morning
 
00:06:58.670 --> 00:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
many children in the juvenile justice
 
00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:00.419 align:start position:0%
system are inapprop are there
 
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
inappropriately as a result of mental
 
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
health needs and the majority of
 
00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
children in the Juvenile Justice System
 
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
have a diagnosable mental illness that
 
00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 align:start position:0%
is the reason that Nami New Hampshire
 
00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
has a strong interest in this bill
 
00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 align:start position:0%
um this past earlier this week I would
 
00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:18.960 align:start position:0%
was able to listen in on um division
 
00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:21.539 align:start position:0%
three as they discussed other some new
 
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
new center bills and I just want to
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
bring forward as a result of listening
 
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:28.400 align:start position:0%
to those discussions
 
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:34.860 align:start position:0%
if this committee does opt to delay the
 
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:37.740 align:start position:0%
closure of this new new center which is
 
00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
you know Senate bill one
 
00:07:41.629 --> 00:07:41.639 align:start position:0%
um kicks the can down the road a few
 
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
months but really you know looks at
 
00:07:45.170 --> 00:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
getting the new building
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
um up and running as quickly as possible
 
00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
and I know that there are discussions
 
00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
about maybe delaying that even further
 
00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:53.340 align:start position:0%
if this committee does ought to look at
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
delaying it for a couple of years Nami
 
00:07:58.189 --> 00:07:58.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire strongly urges the
 
00:08:00.409 --> 00:08:00.419 align:start position:0%
committee to look at the provision of
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one that starts the services
 
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:06.120 align:start position:0%
the trauma-informed care and the mental
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
health services for these kids to get
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
those started in the existing facility
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
as soon as possible
 
00:08:14.510 --> 00:08:14.520 align:start position:0%
um you know it's something that's been
 
00:08:16.490 --> 00:08:16.500 align:start position:0%
lacking in that facility and it's
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
something that's really in Need You Know
 
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one is a comprehensive
 
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:23.580 align:start position:0%
package and so we would prefer to see
 
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:27.180 align:start position:0%
this bill go forward as is but again you
 
00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
know if this committee has other plans
 
00:08:32.329 --> 00:08:32.339 align:start position:0%
just urge you to really consider getting
 
00:08:35.149 --> 00:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
those Services into place I'm happy to
 
00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:37.200 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
that's the end of my testimony
 
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.120 align:start position:0%
thank you questions from the committee
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
members from Miss Stevens
 
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.100 align:start position:0%
chair since Senator Carson brought it up
 
00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
and it's being brought up by Nami uh I
 
00:08:55.509 --> 00:08:55.519 align:start position:0%
the Senate Bill won on the closure date
 
00:08:59.030 --> 00:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
has language that leaves it dependent
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
upon Tran the transfer of of the
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
residents out of there it's online two
 
00:09:10.090 --> 00:09:10.100 align:start position:0%
of page two uh to line five it reads the
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
sysc shall immediately be closed for
 
00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:15.300 align:start position:0%
detention or admission of any child when
 
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
the secure treatment facility authorized
 
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:20.220 align:start position:0%
by this chapter is sufficiently
 
00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:22.320 align:start position:0%
completed the children can be legally
 
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
and safely housed there that that
 
00:09:28.329 --> 00:09:28.339 align:start position:0%
language I think removes the the the
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
guillotine of a suspense date and
 
00:09:33.889 --> 00:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
instead puts us on the path to finding
 
00:09:36.410 --> 00:09:36.420 align:start position:0%
an appropriate replacement would nimi
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
does nimi support that that approach yes
 
00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
because I mean sorry and Nami would
 
00:09:44.269 --> 00:09:44.279 align:start position:0%
support that approach you know would be
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
obviously after the department to
 
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
determine when that facility was safe
 
00:09:50.329 --> 00:09:50.339 align:start position:0%
for transfer so we would you know put
 
00:09:51.769 --> 00:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
our trust in the department to be able
 
00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.889 --> 00:09:57.899 align:start position:0%

00:09:57.899 --> 00:10:01.670 align:start position:0%

right now in terms of treatment of

children who because of the danger they
 
00:10:39.829 --> 00:10:39.839 align:start position:0%

00:10:42.530 --> 00:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
own trauma and mental health issues have
 
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:45.660 align:start position:0%
ended up ordered to secure detention or
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%
secure commitment for a brief period of
 
00:10:52.069 --> 00:10:52.079 align:start position:0%
time and what this body and the
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
legislature figured out a couple years
 
00:10:56.389 --> 00:10:56.399 align:start position:0%
ago is that the current sununu Center is
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
really not appropriate to meet the needs
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
of those children and what we really
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
need is for children to receive
 
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
treatment and for the community to be
 
00:11:06.769 --> 00:11:06.779 align:start position:0%
safe but also for them to come out
 
00:11:10.009 --> 00:11:10.019 align:start position:0%
better when than when they went in and
 
00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
so after years of consideration well at
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
least a year
 
00:11:16.610 --> 00:11:16.620 align:start position:0%
my understanding was that the consensus
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
was that what needed to happen was we
 
00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:22.260 align:start position:0%
needed to have a small therapeutic
 
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
facility that would be staffed by people
 
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
who are trained in trauma-informed care
 
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
and that it would be able to provide the
 
00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120 align:start position:0%
education and therapy that children need
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
in order to be successful when they
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
leave and there's urgency around that
 
00:11:40.610 --> 00:11:40.620 align:start position:0%
right because we know that right now the
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
facility is supposed to close in just a
 
00:11:45.050 --> 00:11:45.060 align:start position:0%
few weeks but it's something that you
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
all have thought about for a really long
 
00:11:50.569 --> 00:11:50.579 align:start position:0%
time and and I want and it's important
 
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:52.740 align:start position:0%
that this happened and that
 
00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
the facility be able to appropriately
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
staff to maintain the safety of the kids
 
00:11:59.509 --> 00:11:59.519 align:start position:0%
there and also the staff that are still
 
00:12:02.269 --> 00:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
there it's not something that really can
 
00:12:05.210 --> 00:12:05.220 align:start position:0%
be delayed I know I mean in my perfect
 
00:12:07.670 --> 00:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
world we have no children locked up
 
00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.290 align:start position:0%
world we have no children locked up
right

00:12:09.290 --> 00:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:10.740 align:start position:0%
um I am that bleeding hard right I don't
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
want to put any kids in jail but I
 
00:12:14.090 --> 00:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
realized that day is probably not going
 
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:16.380 align:start position:0%
to come and I know there's some hope
 
00:12:20.329 --> 00:12:20.339 align:start position:0%
that a bill can be worked on to tighten
 
00:12:22.670 --> 00:12:22.680 align:start position:0%
the circumstances even further that
 
00:12:26.090 --> 00:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
would enable a court to order a kiddo to
 
00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
secure detention or secure commitment
 
00:12:31.730 --> 00:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
but um I think that's something that
 
00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
needs to be done in a thoughtful way our
 
00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
former Chief Justice of the Supreme
 
00:12:37.310 --> 00:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
Court noticed some issues when we tried
 
00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:38.640 align:start position:0%
to rework that language I think that
 
00:12:40.970 --> 00:12:40.980 align:start position:0%
could be done but I don't know that
 
00:12:43.250 --> 00:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
that's going to solve the problem and at
 
00:12:46.250 --> 00:12:46.260 align:start position:0%
this point it's really about treatment I
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of squabbling about
 
00:12:50.269 --> 00:12:50.279 align:start position:0%
size of this facility I think we're
 
00:12:52.490 --> 00:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
talking about a really small facility I
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
don't believe in that if you build it
 
00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:55.560 align:start position:0%
they will come
 
00:12:57.650 --> 00:12:57.660 align:start position:0%
um you know Field of Dreams analogy
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
because we build 144 so bed facility at
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
the sununu center and we know that the
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
census there is generally around 12 to
 
00:13:10.310 --> 00:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
upwards of 18 at the most kids so again
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
I encourage you to do the right thing
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
for kids and thank you so much I'm
 
00:13:15.650 --> 00:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions you might
 
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:17.810 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions you might
have

00:13:17.810 --> 00:13:17.820 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members
 
00:13:22.970 --> 00:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
first representative leishman and
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
hi and thank you for taking my question
 
00:13:28.970 --> 00:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
and you may not be the right person and
 
00:13:31.430 --> 00:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
not knowing who's coming to put the
 
00:13:32.690 --> 00:13:32.700 align:start position:0%
question out there
 
00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
so in the amendment on page four on line
 
00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.329 align:start position:0%
so in the amendment on page four on line
three

00:13:38.329 --> 00:13:38.339 align:start position:0%
three
 
00:13:41.090 --> 00:13:41.100 align:start position:0%
it says that in no event the new secure
 
00:13:43.730 --> 00:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
Youth Development Center or facility
 
00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:46.740 align:start position:0%
exceeds 15 million dollars
 
00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:48.290 align:start position:0%
exceeds 15 million dollars
however

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:48.300 align:start position:0%
however
 
00:13:51.170 --> 00:13:51.180 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note the department of
 
00:13:54.829 --> 00:13:54.839 align:start position:0%
administrative Services says it will at
 
00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:56.300 align:start position:0%
least be I think
 
00:14:00.170 --> 00:14:00.180 align:start position:0%
21.6 million dollars regardless of the
 
00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
time frame you wouldn't
 
00:14:04.069 --> 00:14:04.079 align:start position:0%
probably not the right person I've
 
00:14:05.569 --> 00:14:05.579 align:start position:0%
listened to a lot of testimony about
 
00:14:08.449 --> 00:14:08.459 align:start position:0%
this I think that director ribsum is is
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
your guy for those answers
 
00:14:13.910 --> 00:14:13.920 align:start position:0%
um I mean so I'll put it out there
 
00:14:15.829 --> 00:14:15.839 align:start position:0%
anyway yeah I mean I could just tell you
 
00:14:17.629 --> 00:14:17.639 align:start position:0%
what I've heard but I think he's really
 
00:14:20.030 --> 00:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
the go-to person or perhaps um Charlie
 
00:14:22.430 --> 00:14:22.440 align:start position:0%
arlinghaus thank you very much thank you
 
00:14:23.690 --> 00:14:23.700 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire for question
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
coming I want to ask a little more you
 
00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
said that children should never be
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
locked up oh no in my perfect world
 
00:14:37.129 --> 00:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
children would never need to be locked
 
00:14:39.490 --> 00:14:39.500 align:start position:0%
up sorry
 
00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
man yeah so
 
00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
I would assume that a number of these
 
00:14:44.699 --> 00:14:46.009 align:start position:0%
I would assume that a number of these
children

00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
and the definition of children as being
 
00:14:52.069 --> 00:14:52.079 align:start position:0%
under 18 yes have committed murder
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
and so is it is it makes sense that
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
if you commit murder under 18 no lock up
 
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
if you commit murder over 18 life in
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
prison or something like that that
 
00:15:05.689 --> 00:15:05.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't like like I said I mean that's
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
you know in the we're not going to have
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
my ideal world right where no one
 
00:15:11.689 --> 00:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
commits terrible crimes and no one needs
 
00:15:14.569 --> 00:15:14.579 align:start position:0%
to be locked up but certainly I I don't
 
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
dispute what you're where you're going
 
00:15:18.650 --> 00:15:18.660 align:start position:0%
with this if someone commits murder and
 
00:15:21.069 --> 00:15:21.079 align:start position:0%
they're dangerous they're going to be
 
00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily removed from society because
 
00:15:25.970 --> 00:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
they're dangerous right but in the
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
meantime they are children they need to
 
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:33.180 align:start position:0%
have educational opportunities and you
 
00:15:34.850 --> 00:15:34.860 align:start position:0%
know opportunities to live their lives
 
00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
it may not be the life that their
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
parents or they would have envisioned
 
00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:41.220 align:start position:0%
for themselves but we want to make sure
 
00:15:42.769 --> 00:15:42.779 align:start position:0%
that we're treating them appropriately
 
00:15:46.430 --> 00:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:49.009 --> 00:15:49.019 align:start position:0%
and committee members I have the
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
director ribsom here I'm saving him for
 
00:15:54.050 --> 00:15:54.060 align:start position:0%
last kind of the cleanup guy on all the
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
all this uh testimony so that he can
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
answer the the detailed questions so
 
00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
uh if some of those things you can say
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
for them uh represent whole you have a
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
question Ms Rosenberg you as the chair
 
00:16:10.370 --> 00:16:10.380 align:start position:0%
right and maybe director ripson is the
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
right person asking stuff can we find a
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
list of the crimes that those that are
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
being detained right now have committed
 
00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
just generically
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
perhaps the director will be able to
 
00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:23.459 align:start position:0%
furnish that
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
representative Murray
 
00:16:27.530 --> 00:16:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair following up with
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire at a sort of a
 
00:16:31.250 --> 00:16:31.260 align:start position:0%
similar question but I'd like since
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
you're from Nami to go a little bit
 
00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:35.459 align:start position:0%
further disability disability rights
 
00:16:37.670 --> 00:16:37.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for correcting me
 
00:16:39.530 --> 00:16:39.540 align:start position:0%
um in your perfect world or what is your
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
vision for dealing with students who
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
have some mental health issues dealing
 
00:16:45.410 --> 00:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
with mental health issues and have
 
00:16:48.530 --> 00:16:48.540 align:start position:0%
committed a violent crime what is what
 
00:16:50.030 --> 00:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
do you see as the best way of treating
 
00:16:53.329 --> 00:16:53.339 align:start position:0%
this the best way would be to help those
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
those children who most of them will be
 
00:16:59.870 --> 00:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
returning to the community right so it's
 
00:17:02.210 --> 00:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
to give them the skills that they need
 
00:17:06.289 --> 00:17:06.299 align:start position:0%
to be able to manage their emotions and
 
00:17:08.929 --> 00:17:08.939 align:start position:0%
behaviors and a lot of these students
 
00:17:10.669 --> 00:17:10.679 align:start position:0%
and I think you'll hear this from
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
director ripson have experienced their
 
00:17:15.770 --> 00:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
own trauma or abuse as young children
 
00:17:17.929 --> 00:17:17.939 align:start position:0%
and what needs to happen is we need to
 
00:17:21.429 --> 00:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
break that cycle and by implementing
 
00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
evidence-based therapies making sure
 
00:17:26.329 --> 00:17:26.339 align:start position:0%
they get their education that they need
 
00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:27.360 align:start position:0%
um some of these kids a lot of these
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
kids have IEPs so they may not have
 
00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:31.500 align:start position:0%
really strong reading skills these are
 
00:17:32.930 --> 00:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
the kinds of things that we could start
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
accomplishing with children in an
 
00:17:37.010 --> 00:17:37.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate facility so that they will
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
earn their High School diplomas learn
 
00:17:40.490 --> 00:17:40.500 align:start position:0%
those coping skills and be able to
 
00:17:44.810 --> 00:17:44.820 align:start position:0%
manage their anxiety and anger maybe but
 
00:17:50.330 --> 00:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
any other member have any question
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Ms Rose thank you
 
00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:57.350 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you Ms Rose thank you
all

00:17:57.350 --> 00:17:57.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
the next call on Cassandra Sanchez from
 
00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:10.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
welcome to finance good morning thank
 
00:18:15.289 --> 00:18:15.299 align:start position:0%
you for having me
 
00:18:16.669 --> 00:18:16.679 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Cassandra
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
Sanchez child advocate for the State of
 
00:18:19.669 --> 00:18:19.679 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
I am here in support of Senate Bill 1 as
 
00:18:24.409 --> 00:18:24.419 align:start position:0%
amended by the Senate
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
I agree with much of the testimony
 
00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:28.020 align:start position:0%
Before Me by Karen Rosenberg from the
 
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
DRC the focus does need to remain on the
 
00:18:33.529 --> 00:18:33.539 align:start position:0%
children that access the facility and
 
00:18:34.909 --> 00:18:34.919 align:start position:0%
the children that are currently in the
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
facility as Miss Rosenberg noted a lot
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
of these children have complex trauma
 
00:18:43.310 --> 00:18:43.320 align:start position:0%
which means they need a setting that is
 
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:45.720 align:start position:0%
a treatment focused setting which means
 
00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:48.140 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care intensive
 
00:18:51.230 --> 00:18:51.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic services and opportunities
 
00:18:52.370 --> 00:18:52.380 align:start position:0%
to learn
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
how to regulate their emotions on their
 
00:18:56.390 --> 00:18:56.400 align:start position:0%
own so children who experience complex
 
00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:57.590 align:start position:0%
own so children who experience complex
trauma

00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
trauma
 
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfortunately do not have the ability to
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
learn regulation through attachment as
 
00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:05.580 align:start position:0%
normal developing children have the
 
00:19:07.669 --> 00:19:07.679 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do and so in a setting
 
00:19:09.350 --> 00:19:09.360 align:start position:0%
where they have therapy available to
 
00:19:12.549 --> 00:19:12.559 align:start position:0%
them and the staff who are trained to
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
work with co-regulation they have the
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
ability to form those relationships with
 
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
the children and to teach them those
 
00:19:21.049 --> 00:19:21.059 align:start position:0%
skills so that in the future they are
 
00:19:22.789 --> 00:19:22.799 align:start position:0%
able to regulate on their own they're
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
able to manage their anger and they have
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to be more successful in
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
the community as adults that is what we
 
00:19:30.409 --> 00:19:30.419 align:start position:0%
want to see for our children of New
 
00:19:32.630 --> 00:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and although this is a large
 
00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
cost now we see that if we invest in our
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
children now we will save in the long
 
00:19:39.950 --> 00:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
run when they are adults and they are
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
able to be successful members of the
 
00:19:41.820 --> 00:19:43.010 align:start position:0%
able to be successful members of the
community

00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
community
 
00:19:45.529 --> 00:19:45.539 align:start position:0%
I also would like to address the comment
 
00:19:48.289 --> 00:19:48.299 align:start position:0%
about children within the center that
 
00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:50.100 align:start position:0%
may be in there for charges
 
00:19:52.909 --> 00:19:52.919 align:start position:0%
such as murder or or seriously violent
 
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:55.380 align:start position:0%
crimes and I want to clarify that those
 
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
numbers are very very low maybe one or
 
00:20:00.770 --> 00:20:00.780 align:start position:0%
two children but that is extremely rare
 
00:20:02.810 --> 00:20:02.820 align:start position:0%
and they are low numbers in our state so
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
we are not building a facility for
 
00:20:07.070 --> 00:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
that we're expecting to fill with
 
00:20:10.130 --> 00:20:10.140 align:start position:0%
children who engage in extremely violent
 
00:20:13.010 --> 00:20:13.020 align:start position:0%
crimes it is a chance for children to go
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
and rehabilitate and return to the
 
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:17.640 align:start position:0%
community and hopefully to not return
 
00:20:19.669 --> 00:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
back to the facility if the if the care
 
00:20:21.710 --> 00:20:21.720 align:start position:0%
that they need and the therapies are
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.490 --> 00:20:28.500 align:start position:0%
please let me know if you have any
 
00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
questions thank you
 
00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:31.740 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony any
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
Committee Member have a question
 
00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
Miss Sanchez
 
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:37.980 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:44.570 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

00:20:44.570 --> 00:20:44.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:47.090 --> 00:20:47.100 align:start position:0%
all right the next next card I have I
 
00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:48.660 align:start position:0%
guess the others that have wanted to
 
00:20:51.289 --> 00:20:51.299 align:start position:0%
speak have turned in their pink cards I
 
00:20:52.549 --> 00:20:52.559 align:start position:0%
see some
 
00:20:54.710 --> 00:20:54.720 align:start position:0%
alumni here that might want to speak but
 
00:20:57.289 --> 00:20:57.299 align:start position:0%
they haven't turned in a card
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
so I will next call on director Joe
 
00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.310 align:start position:0%
so I will next call on director Joe
ribson

00:21:01.310 --> 00:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
ribson
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
director of the Department of Children
 
00:21:39.230 --> 00:21:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:53.570 --> 00:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:56.330 --> 00:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
good morning director welcome back good
 
00:21:58.549 --> 00:21:58.559 align:start position:0%
morning thank you for having me uh for
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
the record Joe ribson director of dcyf
 
00:22:03.409 --> 00:22:03.419 align:start position:0%
um being passed around right now is some
 
00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
data I know some of this data has been
 
00:22:06.890 --> 00:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
shared with all of you at least the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
first front page or with the whole the
 
00:22:11.090 --> 00:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
entire committee at a prior hearing the
 
00:22:12.590 --> 00:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
next two pages is data that had only
 
00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980 align:start position:0%
been previously shared with division
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
three so I thought it would be useful to
 
00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
share that here as well
 
00:22:19.490 --> 00:22:19.500 align:start position:0%
um before I get into that
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
uh there's a few things that I'd like to
 
00:22:24.289 --> 00:22:24.299 align:start position:0%
talk about one we do fully support sb1
 
00:22:26.390 --> 00:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
and we think it's time for us to move
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
forward from the history of what we've
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
seen at sysc we think that sb1 sets
 
00:22:33.710 --> 00:22:33.720 align:start position:0%
forth an appropriate plan both in terms
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
of physical structure security also
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
though programming treatment integration
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
into the broader system of care that
 
00:22:42.470 --> 00:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
we've built for children into the state
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to spend time hopefully if
 
00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:46.260 align:start position:0%
if you'll indulge me going through the
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
aspects of the bill that do that because
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
I know when Senator Carson introduced it
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
she didn't have the opportunity to kind
 
00:22:54.470 --> 00:22:54.480 align:start position:0%
of walk folks through that before we get
 
00:22:55.549 --> 00:22:55.559 align:start position:0%
into that though there's just a couple
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
things I want to kind of Orient folks to
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
looking at the data so has this come
 
00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460 align:start position:0%
around to everybody
 
00:23:05.810 --> 00:23:05.820 align:start position:0%
okay so the very front page there what
 
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:07.260 align:start position:0%
you're looking at here is the average
 
00:23:08.750 --> 00:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
daily population not even the average
 
00:23:11.049 --> 00:23:11.059 align:start position:0%
the actual daily population of every day
 
00:23:18.350 --> 00:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
from July 1 2016 until January 1 2023.
 
00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:20.580 align:start position:0%
and you see that in 2016 which is
 
00:23:23.330 --> 00:23:23.340 align:start position:0%
shortly before I came here and um you
 
00:23:24.770 --> 00:23:24.780 align:start position:0%
know before we made a lot of big changes
 
00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:26.640 align:start position:0%
to the system we were sometimes peaking
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
up around 75 kids at the facility at a
 
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.409 align:start position:0%
up around 75 kids at the facility at a
time

00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
and you see that for really the past
 
00:23:34.730 --> 00:23:34.740 align:start position:0%
almost three years since the early 2020
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
we've been kind of hovering in this the
 
00:23:39.169 --> 00:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
average daily census has been 12 but
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's kind of bounced around the absolute
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
bottom that we've gotten to was five
 
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
kids and that actually was only in
 
00:23:48.049 --> 00:23:48.059 align:start position:0%
November of this year and the absolute
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
Peak was 18 kids and that was actually
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
only a few weeks ago
 
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:54.360 align:start position:0%
so the census can move rather
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
dramatically rather quickly
 
00:23:59.090 --> 00:23:59.100 align:start position:0%
and you know for clarification purposes
 
00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:02.400 align:start position:0%
too right dcyf Juvenile Justice and sysc
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
don't decide who goes to sysc that's the
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
decision that courts make that's a
 
00:24:08.930 --> 00:24:08.940 align:start position:0%
decision the judges make
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
right we have influence on some of that
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
but we don't make those decisions so we
 
00:24:14.270 --> 00:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
don't have control over who comes and
 
00:24:16.370 --> 00:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
goes from sysc we have influence but not
 
00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
control so from the EXT from the extent
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
that the idea is that um somehow you
 
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
know we dcyf or we sysc can can limit
 
00:24:27.470 --> 00:24:27.480 align:start position:0%
the senses ourselves we really can't do
 
00:24:30.049 --> 00:24:30.059 align:start position:0%
that what does that and what has done
 
00:24:31.490 --> 00:24:31.500 align:start position:0%
that successfully in the state are two
 
00:24:34.190 --> 00:24:34.200 align:start position:0%
different things one changing the laws
 
00:24:37.190 --> 00:24:37.200 align:start position:0%
about who gets in and two changing the
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
system to better support kids so they
 
00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:41.100 align:start position:0%
don't need to come in and part of me I'm
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
fighting a cold I don't have covet I've
 
00:24:50.090 --> 00:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:52.490 --> 00:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
so when you look at this data you see
 
00:24:56.210 --> 00:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
really a big rapid decrease starting in
 
00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.890 align:start position:0%
really a big rapid decrease starting in
2018

00:24:57.890 --> 00:24:57.900 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:25:00.350 --> 00:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
and two things happened around that time
 
00:25:02.570 --> 00:25:02.580 align:start position:0%
number one the laws were changed as to
 
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
who could be detained and committed
 
00:25:06.529 --> 00:25:06.539 align:start position:0%
limiting who you know the types of
 
00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:07.740 align:start position:0%
offenses that could go there in the
 
00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:10.380 align:start position:0%
first instance to serious serious
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
offenses and also
 
00:25:14.810 --> 00:25:14.820 align:start position:0%
um misdemeanor offenses for repeated
 
00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:17.220 align:start position:0%
instances right so the typical repeated
 
00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor offense that you would see
 
00:25:20.930 --> 00:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
go into sysc under the new Under the
 
00:25:24.529 --> 00:25:24.539 align:start position:0%
current law is repeated simple assaults
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
and repeated domestic violence incidents
 
00:25:28.490 --> 00:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
so incidences where there's violence in
 
00:25:30.890 --> 00:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
the household between a child and their
 
00:25:33.289 --> 00:25:33.299 align:start position:0%
parent or a child and another child you
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
know or sometimes they'll get charged
 
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
with simple assaults or it might be
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
charged as a simple assault coming out
 
00:25:39.850 --> 00:25:39.860 align:start position:0%
of a residential program
 
00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:42.779 align:start position:0%
towards staff and then coming into syc
 
00:25:44.930 --> 00:25:44.940 align:start position:0%
those are the typical misdemeanors that
 
00:25:46.850 --> 00:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
you see coming into sysa otherwise it's
 
00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:48.470 align:start position:0%
you see coming into sysa otherwise it's
typically

00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
typically
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
um you know your higher level offenses
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
that are coming in
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
the chart the green line is the total at
 
00:25:55.970 --> 00:25:55.980 align:start position:0%
any given time
 
00:25:59.390 --> 00:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
the orange line or the red line is the
 
00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:01.740 align:start position:0%
number of detained youth and the purple
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
line is the number of committed youth
 
00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
just to orient folks detained means for
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
the most part that your pending
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
adjudication you're waiting for the
 
00:26:11.690 --> 00:26:11.700 align:start position:0%
court to determine whether or not the
 
00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
offense has been committed and whether
 
00:26:14.510 --> 00:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
or not you should be committed to the
 
00:26:15.890 --> 00:26:15.900 align:start position:0%
facility or some other disposition
 
00:26:17.810 --> 00:26:17.820 align:start position:0%
should be rendered there are some other
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
youth that fall into that category
 
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
within our system
 
00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.769 align:start position:0%
within our system
um

00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:23.630 --> 00:26:23.640 align:start position:0%
a regular detained youth that I just
 
00:26:25.130 --> 00:26:25.140 align:start position:0%
described will typically be there for
 
00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
maybe a matter of days or weeks at most
 
00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:31.200 align:start position:0%
um but there are some longer term
 
00:26:32.810 --> 00:26:32.820 align:start position:0%
detained Youth and those would be young
 
00:26:34.789 --> 00:26:34.799 align:start position:0%
people who do commit extremely serious
 
00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
offenses and are charged as adults we
 
00:26:38.810 --> 00:26:38.820 align:start position:0%
don't see that over utilized in New
 
00:26:40.490 --> 00:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I've only seen it happen a few
 
00:26:41.810 --> 00:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
times and it happens around really
 
00:26:43.850 --> 00:26:43.860 align:start position:0%
serious crimes like murder
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
um and some other very serious offenses
 
00:26:48.230 --> 00:26:48.240 align:start position:0%
and when a young person is charged with
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
a crime like that they do remain with us
 
00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:52.200 align:start position:0%
on detained status pending that entire
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
stay right so they could often stay with
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
us for years on a detained status
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
and again that's depending on how the
 
00:27:00.890 --> 00:27:00.900 align:start position:0%
court processes work the other
 
00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:02.400 align:start position:0%
population that can come in on a short
 
00:27:04.190 --> 00:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
term like that is what you call the icj
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
interstate compact for juveniles we only
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
get about
 
00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.220 align:start position:0%
really about five kids a year and under
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
the interstate compact for juveniles
 
00:27:15.890 --> 00:27:15.900 align:start position:0%
um they can only be here for about five
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
days and what that is is if a child from
 
00:27:20.390 --> 00:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
another state commits a defense here and
 
00:27:21.890 --> 00:27:21.900 align:start position:0%
they get arrested and detained and then
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
sent back to their home state and their
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
home state has to come pick them up it's
 
00:27:27.470 --> 00:27:27.480 align:start position:0%
reciprocal we have to do the same if one
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
of our kids do something in another
 
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:31.320 align:start position:0%
state or if a kid gets picked up here
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
and it turns out they have a warrant for
 
00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:34.320 align:start position:0%
a serious arrests at another state and
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
then they could be sent to sysc and
 
00:27:37.490 --> 00:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
detained their pending the other state
 
00:27:39.950 --> 00:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
coming up to pick up that kid so those
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
are kind of the populations that make up
 
00:27:43.549 --> 00:27:43.559 align:start position:0%
that detained group and then the
 
00:27:44.870 --> 00:27:44.880 align:start position:0%
committed group or the group that
 
00:27:46.130 --> 00:27:46.140 align:start position:0%
there's been an adjudication that
 
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
they've committed a serious offense and
 
00:27:49.430 --> 00:27:49.440 align:start position:0%
the court believes that uh commitment at
 
00:27:51.610 --> 00:27:51.620 align:start position:0%
sysc is the appropriate disposition
 
00:27:55.610 --> 00:27:55.620 align:start position:0%
under current law for most defenses
 
00:27:57.470 --> 00:27:57.480 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for parole after three
 
00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.490 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for parole after three
months

00:27:58.490 --> 00:27:58.500 align:start position:0%
months
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
and for some more serious offenses
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
they're eligible for parole after six
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
months most of the time they are granted
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
parole at that point
 
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:08.700 align:start position:0%
so the average length of stay for a
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
committed youth is actually closer to
 
00:28:11.870 --> 00:28:11.880 align:start position:0%
three months since the six month term
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't get implemented too
 
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:14.810 align:start position:0%
doesn't doesn't get implemented too
often

00:28:14.810 --> 00:28:14.820 align:start position:0%
often
 
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
um but so that's why our census is low
 
00:28:19.130 --> 00:28:19.140 align:start position:0%
from the legal perspective the other
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
reason why the census has gotten down so
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
low and before I get into that something
 
00:28:25.070 --> 00:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
I should have mentioned earlier is that
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
the lowest combined rate of detained and
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
committed kids in the entire country
 
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:34.620 align:start position:0%
there is one state that has
 
00:28:36.470 --> 00:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
fewer detained kids according to the
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
data in this report which I shared with
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
division three I didn't print out a
 
00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:41.460 align:start position:0%
million copies for everybody today
 
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140 align:start position:0%
the state that has fewer detained kids
 
00:28:45.049 --> 00:28:45.059 align:start position:0%
is mean they claim to have zero detained
 
00:28:46.730 --> 00:28:46.740 align:start position:0%
kids which I don't really believe
 
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:48.360 align:start position:0%
because I also have a program that they
 
00:28:50.210 --> 00:28:50.220 align:start position:0%
call shock incarceration which I think
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
is just a different word for detention
 
00:28:53.630 --> 00:28:53.640 align:start position:0%
so I think it's a semantics issue
 
00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
and when you add up their committed
 
00:28:57.950 --> 00:28:57.960 align:start position:0%
population versus our detained and
 
00:28:59.810 --> 00:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
committed combined were lower
 
00:29:01.430 --> 00:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
the state that has fewer committed kids
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
is Connecticut they probably do have
 
00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:04.740 align:start position:0%
fewer committed kids actually but when
 
00:29:06.230 --> 00:29:06.240 align:start position:0%
you add their detained population to
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
their committed population we're lower
 
00:29:10.070 --> 00:29:10.080 align:start position:0%
so when I say combined population is the
 
00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:11.220 align:start position:0%
lowest in the country that's what I'm
 
00:29:12.590 --> 00:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
talking about if you go through the data
 
00:29:13.789 --> 00:29:13.799 align:start position:0%
in this report you will see there are
 
00:29:15.289 --> 00:29:15.299 align:start position:0%
two states that on those individual
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
measures are better but as a combined
 
00:29:19.070 --> 00:29:19.080 align:start position:0%
measure we're the lowest
 
00:29:21.889 --> 00:29:21.899 align:start position:0%
that's to say that you know as much hope
 
00:29:23.570 --> 00:29:23.580 align:start position:0%
as I have to continue to drive this
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
number down there's not a lot of
 
00:29:27.830 --> 00:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
national precedence for doing so
 
00:29:29.330 --> 00:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
and I think you know we have to keep
 
00:29:30.409 --> 00:29:30.419 align:start position:0%
that in mind when we're thinking about
 
00:29:32.269 --> 00:29:32.279 align:start position:0%
how we're moving the system forward and
 
00:29:34.370 --> 00:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
how aggressive we want to be and moving
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
um you know the the size of the facility
 
00:29:38.450 --> 00:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
and capacity of facility
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
so if we turn to the next page this
 
00:29:51.950 --> 00:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:54.049 --> 00:29:54.059 align:start position:0%
so this is the daily count of Juvenile
 
00:29:55.730 --> 00:29:55.740 align:start position:0%
Justice service youth involved in
 
00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
residential placement settings
 
00:29:58.500 --> 00:29:59.990 align:start position:0%
residential placement settings
now

00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:30:01.610 --> 00:30:01.620 align:start position:0%
if the only thing that happened was the
 
00:30:03.409 --> 00:30:03.419 align:start position:0%
laws changed and we couldn't keep kids
 
00:30:05.750 --> 00:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
in a secured setting you would
 
00:30:07.490 --> 00:30:07.500 align:start position:0%
anticipate I would anticipate that what
 
00:30:08.750 --> 00:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
you would see was those kids would move
 
00:30:10.669 --> 00:30:10.679 align:start position:0%
from a secured setting to a non-secured
 
00:30:10.679 --> 00:30:11.870 align:start position:0%
from a secured setting to a non-secured
setting

00:30:11.870 --> 00:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
setting
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the data and you look
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
at this data here you do see in 2018
 
00:30:18.529 --> 00:30:18.539 align:start position:0%
when that law first changed you see it
 
00:30:20.330 --> 00:30:20.340 align:start position:0%
starts to climb right you see the system
 
00:30:21.889 --> 00:30:21.899 align:start position:0%
immediately react by sending more kids
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
to Residential Care
 
00:30:25.130 --> 00:30:25.140 align:start position:0%
and then it very quickly starts to go
 
00:30:27.289 --> 00:30:27.299 align:start position:0%
down and what what's happening there
 
00:30:28.730 --> 00:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
where it's going down is the system of
 
00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
care that we've all been talking about
 
00:30:31.130 --> 00:30:31.140 align:start position:0%
and building
 
00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:33.299 align:start position:0%
both parties everybody agreeing that we
 
00:30:34.370 --> 00:30:34.380 align:start position:0%
need to meet children's Behavioral
 
00:30:36.350 --> 00:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
Health Care needs in the community is
 
00:30:38.090 --> 00:30:38.100 align:start position:0%
starting to serve kids and starting to
 
00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
work with kids and keeping kids from
 
00:30:41.450 --> 00:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
having to be in
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
out of home placements whether it's sysc
 
00:30:46.490 --> 00:30:46.500 align:start position:0%
or Residential Care
 
00:30:48.409 --> 00:30:48.419 align:start position:0%
um I will say when you look further down
 
00:30:50.029 --> 00:30:50.039 align:start position:0%
this data you want to be careful when
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
you get into
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
into the kind of 2020 leader because
 
00:30:56.450 --> 00:30:56.460 align:start position:0%
what you see here is a big collapse at
 
00:30:57.830 --> 00:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
the start of covid
 
00:30:59.570 --> 00:30:59.580 align:start position:0%
and right now we're in a place where
 
00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:01.500 align:start position:0%
Workforce is really suppressing our
 
00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:03.840 align:start position:0%
capacity so there's probably more demand
 
00:31:05.269 --> 00:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
than where than we're accessing right
 
00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
now so I don't want to claim that what
 
00:31:08.810 --> 00:31:08.820 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here at the end of 2022 is
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
is where the system would be if
 
00:31:12.110 --> 00:31:12.120 align:start position:0%
everything was functioning well it
 
00:31:13.370 --> 00:31:13.380 align:start position:0%
probably is a little higher than that
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
but in any instance the trajectory on
 
00:31:17.570 --> 00:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
the residential side is also steeply
 
00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:18.590 align:start position:0%
the residential side is also steeply
down

00:31:18.590 --> 00:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:19.789 align:start position:0%
down
so

00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:28.010 --> 00:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards wants to question
 
00:31:33.049 --> 00:31:33.059 align:start position:0%
something on you sure thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:34.970 --> 00:31:34.980 align:start position:0%
I think the question is relevant to this
 
00:31:37.490 --> 00:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
particular graph and you've shared this
 
00:31:39.710 --> 00:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
with the division three before so I've
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
some people have
 
00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:53.100 align:start position:0%
posited that if we build a facility a
 
00:31:56.389 --> 00:31:56.399 align:start position:0%
replacement facility with a capacity of
 
00:31:56.399 --> 00:31:57.529 align:start position:0%
replacement facility with a capacity of
x

00:31:57.529 --> 00:31:57.539 align:start position:0%
x
 
00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:01.860 align:start position:0%
that when that kid if that kid shows up
 
00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
that makes it X plus one shows up to to
 
00:32:07.010 --> 00:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
where we're no longer within our
 
00:32:10.669 --> 00:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
capacity what that would trigger would
 
00:32:13.549 --> 00:32:13.559 align:start position:0%
would be kind of a two-step process one
 
00:32:17.330 --> 00:32:17.340 align:start position:0%
the least dangerous kid in in that's
 
00:32:19.730 --> 00:32:19.740 align:start position:0%
already in the facility could basically
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
be discharged and moved into one of
 
00:32:25.549 --> 00:32:25.559 align:start position:0%
these residential facilities and and I'm
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm just curious about two aspects
 
00:32:30.110 --> 00:32:30.120 align:start position:0%
of that you know what what is our what
 
00:32:32.330 --> 00:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
is our legal flexibility for moving
 
00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:36.419 align:start position:0%
somebody out of the facility and and
 
00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:39.299 align:start position:0%
what is the capacity you think in the
 
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:41.820 align:start position:0%
residential setting to take those kinds
 
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:45.360 align:start position:0%
of kids that that maybe need the Sue new
 
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:47.340 align:start position:0%
new security but we're moving them into
 
00:32:50.210 --> 00:32:50.220 align:start position:0%
a less secure environment so there's two
 
00:32:51.649 --> 00:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
components of that if you wouldn't mind
 
00:32:53.810 --> 00:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
yeah so there is there's historical
 
00:32:56.149 --> 00:32:56.159 align:start position:0%
precedent at the facility prior to my
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
time there
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
um for the old facility actually
 
00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
reaching Max Capacity not even the new
 
00:33:04.850 --> 00:33:04.860 align:start position:0%
sysc building but the prior campus
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
setting reaching Max Capacity and
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's a provision in law for something
 
00:33:10.909 --> 00:33:10.919 align:start position:0%
called administrative release which is
 
00:33:14.029 --> 00:33:14.039 align:start position:0%
allowable and that's utilized and we
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
still utilize that today but not to
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
manage capacity what it's used for is
 
00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
when you have a kid who's actually
 
00:33:21.289 --> 00:33:21.299 align:start position:0%
clinically ready to step down and you
 
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
don't want to make them wait around for
 
00:33:24.710 --> 00:33:24.720 align:start position:0%
parole for that purpose so you have them
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
step down and then clinically
 
00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:29.580 align:start position:0%
um you know they're assessed they're
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
managed they're stepping down they come
 
00:33:33.169 --> 00:33:33.179 align:start position:0%
back for parole and parole will will
 
00:33:35.690 --> 00:33:35.700 align:start position:0%
bless that decision at the time that the
 
00:33:37.490 --> 00:33:37.500 align:start position:0%
parole hearing is held that's the
 
00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:39.659 align:start position:0%
process that was used historically when
 
00:33:42.289 --> 00:33:42.299 align:start position:0%
the facility reached capacity
 
00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:43.009 align:start position:0%
the facility reached capacity
um

00:33:43.009 --> 00:33:43.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:44.990 --> 00:33:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's a process that we currently only
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
use for committed kids not detained kids
 
00:33:49.130 --> 00:33:49.140 align:start position:0%
you know advice that I've gotten in the
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
past was that that process really is
 
00:33:52.370 --> 00:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
only authorized for committed kids not
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
detained kids I have heard lawyers tell
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
me that they think that's not accurate
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
advice and that you could use it for
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
detained kids I
 
00:34:04.190 --> 00:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
I want to be careful not to misstep on
 
00:34:05.870 --> 00:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
that and not to interpret that right but
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
that's I have heard debate from lawyers
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
on on that on that issue
 
00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179 align:start position:0%
that being said right this is a process
 
00:34:14.210 --> 00:34:14.220 align:start position:0%
that's safely used when you've gone
 
00:34:16.010 --> 00:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
through an assessment and you've
 
00:34:17.690 --> 00:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
determined that that a kid's clinically
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
ready to step down we don't want to keep
 
00:34:20.869 --> 00:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
a kid locked up any longer than we have
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
to right
 
00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:23.149 align:start position:0%
to right
um

00:34:23.149 --> 00:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
you'd hope not to use it just because
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
you don't have space to just because you
 
00:34:29.510 --> 00:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't have space but there is a process
 
00:34:31.129 --> 00:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
for that now in the second part of your
 
00:34:33.109 --> 00:34:33.119 align:start position:0%
question around the residential system
 
00:34:34.849 --> 00:34:34.859 align:start position:0%
the residential systems undergoing a
 
00:34:36.369 --> 00:34:36.379 align:start position:0%
massive redesign in the past few years
 
00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:39.119 align:start position:0%
and I this is I could talk for hours
 
00:34:40.430 --> 00:34:40.440 align:start position:0%
about this stuff
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
um the the way that we redesigned the
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
system the old system was
 
00:34:47.389 --> 00:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
um was a vendored system right where we
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
had a basic standards Medicaid rule
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
providers could prove demonstrate that
 
00:34:52.310 --> 00:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
they're meeting that basic standards
 
00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:54.540 align:start position:0%
rule we certified them as meeting that
 
00:34:57.050 --> 00:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
rule and a rate was established for them
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
there was actually in the budget bills
 
00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:02.280 align:start position:0%
for 10 years up until a few years ago
 
00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599 align:start position:0%
there was actually language saying that
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
a provider resident provider could not
 
00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:07.020 align:start position:0%
have their rate increased so you had
 
00:35:09.650 --> 00:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
providers who had their rates struck 15
 
00:35:11.690 --> 00:35:11.700 align:start position:0%
years ago who had their rates Frozen for
 
00:35:13.190 --> 00:35:13.200 align:start position:0%
that whole period of time
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
and they were only required to kind of
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
meet these minimum basic standard rules
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
under Medicaid to fix this we decided to
 
00:35:21.710 --> 00:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
procure the whole system put it out for
 
00:35:23.750 --> 00:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
a competitive bid and then Implement new
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
standards and new requirements for those
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
providers so new standards around
 
00:35:29.390 --> 00:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
clinical ratios the types of care that's
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
provided creating different levels of
 
00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
care different levels of intensity
 
00:35:34.450 --> 00:35:34.460 align:start position:0%
depending on the needs of the kids
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
something called six core strategies to
 
00:35:38.450 --> 00:35:38.460 align:start position:0%
reduce restraint and seclusion which is
 
00:35:39.950 --> 00:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
a model that I used back when I was in
 
00:35:41.450 --> 00:35:41.460 align:start position:0%
New Jersey to help reduce the use of
 
00:35:43.270 --> 00:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion in facilities
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
requiring them all to become accredited
 
00:35:45.300 --> 00:35:46.510 align:start position:0%
requiring them all to become accredited
agencies

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:46.520 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:35:48.589 --> 00:35:48.599 align:start position:0%
a host of other things that I'm not
 
00:35:50.210 --> 00:35:50.220 align:start position:0%
remembering right now but we put the
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
whole system out to bid and then kind of
 
00:35:53.930 --> 00:35:53.940 align:start position:0%
redesigned the system around this
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
the structure and this idea of different
 
00:35:58.190 --> 00:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
levels of Care at the same time we
 
00:35:59.329 --> 00:35:59.339 align:start position:0%
started something called the cat
 
00:36:01.010 --> 00:36:01.020 align:start position:0%
assessment the comprehensive assessment
 
00:36:02.990 --> 00:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
for treatment where you have a clinician
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
an independent clinician come in and
 
00:36:05.870 --> 00:36:05.880 align:start position:0%
actually assess what the kids needs are
 
00:36:07.670 --> 00:36:07.680 align:start position:0%
and tell us you know where on these
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
levels will this kid have their need met
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
believe it or not we never did anything
 
00:36:13.250 --> 00:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
like that before people were using their
 
00:36:14.810 --> 00:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
professional judgment and trying to just
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
do the best they could with the system
 
00:36:18.770 --> 00:36:18.780 align:start position:0%
we had right it was a bit of a it was a
 
00:36:20.150 --> 00:36:20.160 align:start position:0%
bit of a messy system right because you
 
00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:20.990 align:start position:0%
bit of a messy system right because you
had

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:21.000 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
all these providers meeting minimum
 
00:36:24.050 --> 00:36:24.060 align:start position:0%
basic standard rules providing the type
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
of care that they wanted serving only
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
who they wanted to serve and staff just
 
00:36:29.690 --> 00:36:29.700 align:start position:0%
doing their best to try to manage within
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
that so there's now some structure
 
00:36:32.089 --> 00:36:32.099 align:start position:0%
around all of this that's that's
 
00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:33.599 align:start position:0%
starting to work and starting to
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
transform that system
 
00:36:38.510 --> 00:36:38.520 align:start position:0%
um so we have contract capacity which is
 
00:36:40.609 --> 00:36:40.619 align:start position:0%
plenty adequate but we do not have
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
actual capacity that's adequate at this
 
00:36:43.490 --> 00:36:43.500 align:start position:0%
moment and that's because of the
 
00:36:46.010 --> 00:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
workforce issues so right now at this
 
00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
exact moment the residential system and
 
00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
that's why I said I'd be careful
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
interpreting the data
 
00:36:52.849 --> 00:36:52.859 align:start position:0%
in these later years as being kind of
 
00:36:54.950 --> 00:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
the ceiling because there's kind of an
 
00:36:57.170 --> 00:36:57.180 align:start position:0%
artificial cap on capacity because
 
00:36:58.730 --> 00:36:58.740 align:start position:0%
there's not enough work for us so a lot
 
00:37:00.109 --> 00:37:00.119 align:start position:0%
of these facilities have units that are
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
closed down and beds that are not open
 
00:37:03.650 --> 00:37:03.660 align:start position:0%
because I can't hire enough people to to
 
00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
fill the beds that's one of the key
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
things contributing to the Ed you know
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
wait list and all those types of things
 
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
on a Hampstead wait list too it was kids
 
00:37:11.930 --> 00:37:11.940 align:start position:0%
getting backed up waiting for these
 
00:37:16.010 --> 00:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
types of programs so the answer is
 
00:37:18.050 --> 00:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
structurally for a committed kid there's
 
00:37:20.270 --> 00:37:20.280 align:start position:0%
a process for that the system itself at
 
00:37:21.829 --> 00:37:21.839 align:start position:0%
this exact moment probably can't handle
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
it if the workforce issues are someday
 
00:37:26.270 --> 00:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
resolved for you know there's there's a
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
little more flexibility and hope to be
 
00:37:33.710 --> 00:37:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:34.970 --> 00:37:34.980 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
representative papovichi Muller
 
00:37:39.290 --> 00:37:39.300 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
director for taking the question
 
00:37:45.230 --> 00:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
one of the points that was made I was uh
 
00:37:47.510 --> 00:37:47.520 align:start position:0%
taking uh you know this back seat when
 
00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh Finance three was meeting was that
 
00:37:51.829 --> 00:37:51.839 align:start position:0%
points would have made that there are
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
alternatives to building our own
 
00:37:55.790 --> 00:37:55.800 align:start position:0%
facility that there are facilities
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
outside the state or you know private
 
00:37:59.810 --> 00:37:59.820 align:start position:0%
facilities that we could use for
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
situations like that that was mostly
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
referred to in terms of align concerns
 
00:38:07.190 --> 00:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
over the capacity of the facility but of
 
00:38:09.410 --> 00:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
course one could see that as a temporary
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
placement for the facility if the
 
00:38:14.089 --> 00:38:14.099 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't uh you know provide
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
a replacement could you comment on that
 
00:38:17.270 --> 00:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
and talk more about the topic so we
 
00:38:19.310 --> 00:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
understand your perspective on it I'm
 
00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:20.640 align:start position:0%
happy to comment on that there's also a
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
little more I wanted to walk through on
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
on the data and on the actual bill so
 
00:38:25.430 --> 00:38:25.440 align:start position:0%
that's kind of moving into a new topic
 
00:38:27.170 --> 00:38:27.180 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to wait
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
which way you'd like me to go
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll proceed for you to finish
 
00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:35.820 align:start position:0%
up page three okay so again going to the
 
00:38:37.490 --> 00:38:37.500 align:start position:0%
this issue around right you've seen
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
reduced utilization of sysc at the same
 
00:38:41.329 --> 00:38:41.339 align:start position:0%
time contrary to what people would
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
naturally assume that these kids would
 
00:38:44.210 --> 00:38:44.220 align:start position:0%
all show up in residential care you're
 
00:38:45.470 --> 00:38:45.480 align:start position:0%
seeing reduced utilization of
 
00:38:47.270 --> 00:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
residential where they're showing up
 
00:38:48.950 --> 00:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
instead is actually in the system of
 
00:38:50.450 --> 00:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
care so what you're seeing here is the
 
00:38:52.030 --> 00:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
data for a program called fast forward
 
00:38:55.609 --> 00:38:55.619 align:start position:0%
this is the flagship program of the New
 
00:38:57.710 --> 00:38:57.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children's system of care and
 
00:38:59.089 --> 00:38:59.099 align:start position:0%
what this program does is it provides
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
High Fidelity wraparound services and
 
00:39:02.089 --> 00:39:02.099 align:start position:0%
what that is is you have a clinical
 
00:39:04.250 --> 00:39:04.260 align:start position:0%
person who provides Care Management
 
00:39:05.930 --> 00:39:05.940 align:start position:0%
and it's not just Care Management in the
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
way where you think about where you're
 
00:39:08.990 --> 00:39:09.000 align:start position:0%
calling your you know your insurance
 
00:39:10.490 --> 00:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
company and they're trying to direct you
 
00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
to the providers right they actually
 
00:39:13.910 --> 00:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
hold meetings on a monthly at least
 
00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:16.200 align:start position:0%
monthly basis and they pull together all
 
00:39:17.630 --> 00:39:17.640 align:start position:0%
the people who are important in a kid's
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
life right the parents of course the kid
 
00:39:21.710 --> 00:39:21.720 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:39:22.849 --> 00:39:22.859 align:start position:0%
if they're involved with child
 
00:39:24.290 --> 00:39:24.300 align:start position:0%
protection Child Protection workers
 
00:39:25.190 --> 00:39:25.200 align:start position:0%
should be there if they're involve a
 
00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:26.760 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice Juvenile Justice should
 
00:39:28.370 --> 00:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
be there any clinicians that are working
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
with the kids the schools anybody else
 
00:39:31.970 --> 00:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
who's important to the kid right
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
grandparents if they're important
 
00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
members of their faith community whoever
 
00:39:37.069 --> 00:39:37.079 align:start position:0%
it is it's important you want to create
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
this team of natural supports to wrap
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
around a kid that's what the words wrap
 
00:39:42.890 --> 00:39:42.900 align:start position:0%
around really talk about and it also has
 
00:39:44.810 --> 00:39:44.820 align:start position:0%
components to have in-home Clinical
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
Services for the kids and peer support
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
through Nami New Hampshire who we heard
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
from this morning and peer support for
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
the both for the parents through Nami
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and then also for the
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
Youth and what you see with a program
 
00:39:57.310 --> 00:39:57.320 align:start position:0%
like that it was the same exact model
 
00:39:59.569 --> 00:39:59.579 align:start position:0%
slightly slight variations with the same
 
00:40:02.569 --> 00:40:02.579 align:start position:0%
service package in New Jersey is that
 
00:40:04.550 --> 00:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
the need for having kids out of home and
 
00:40:05.810 --> 00:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
away from their communities goes down
 
00:40:07.849 --> 00:40:07.859 align:start position:0%
over time and when it really gets
 
00:40:09.170 --> 00:40:09.180 align:start position:0%
exciting is when you start getting to
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
these kids when they're eight nine ten
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
and they never become these 16 17 year
 
00:40:15.349 --> 00:40:15.359 align:start position:0%
olds who end up going to places like
 
00:40:17.990 --> 00:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
sysc at all right so what we're seeing
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
here today is one the system of care is
 
00:40:22.130 --> 00:40:22.140 align:start position:0%
already removing pressure from the
 
00:40:24.410 --> 00:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system and I would say
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
that in the future you would expect it
 
00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:26.820 align:start position:0%
to remove more pressure from the
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
juvenile justice system that being said
 
00:40:31.550 --> 00:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
the idea that you know that I'm ready to
 
00:40:34.310 --> 00:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
bank on or commit to the idea that a
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
much smaller facility than 18 is
 
00:40:38.270 --> 00:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
something that we could than an 18
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
capacity with the idea that you're
 
00:40:42.290 --> 00:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
serving 12 kids you know is something
 
00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:43.740 align:start position:0%
that I do get nervous about given that
 
00:40:44.870 --> 00:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
there is not a state in the country
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's proven that that's possible yet
 
00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:49.550 align:start position:0%
that's proven that that's possible yet
so

00:40:49.550 --> 00:40:49.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
with that on the data I'm happy to take
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
questions on that or I'm happy to walk
 
00:40:55.849 --> 00:40:55.859 align:start position:0%
through the bill chairman or I'm happy
 
00:40:59.030 --> 00:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
to answer the question that was asked
 
00:41:00.650 --> 00:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
thank you I have a couple of questions
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
first representative Petrie then
 
00:41:03.829 --> 00:41:03.839 align:start position:0%
representative buco
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
oh thank you Mr chairman and uh thank
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and uh
 
00:41:10.250 --> 00:41:10.260 align:start position:0%
on this uh
 
00:41:13.430 --> 00:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
I bet uh how many kids are subject to a
 
00:41:16.310 --> 00:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
visual offender if there are any because
 
00:41:20.089 --> 00:41:20.099 align:start position:0%
at some point you know enough is enough
 
00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
so under current law
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
as I said before
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
they could be committed to sysc for a
 
00:41:29.329 --> 00:41:29.339 align:start position:0%
single felony a higher level serious
 
00:41:31.430 --> 00:41:31.440 align:start position:0%
felony offense or for multiple lower
 
00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:33.240 align:start position:0%
level offenses that include some
 
00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
violence including things like simple
 
00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:38.339 align:start position:0%
assault and domestic violence those are
 
00:41:39.950 --> 00:41:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually the types of situations that we
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
see more of than anything else our young
 
00:41:44.329 --> 00:41:44.339 align:start position:0%
folks that have repeated instances of
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
violence within the household or within
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
you know other types of settings
 
00:41:51.589 --> 00:41:51.599 align:start position:0%
so it is you know it's typical to have
 
00:41:55.730 --> 00:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
multiple instances I do have some data
 
00:41:57.770 --> 00:41:57.780 align:start position:0%
similar to what representative who asked
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
about because representative erf asked
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
me a question similar question a couple
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
it'll be hard for me to read on my phone
 
00:42:05.210 --> 00:42:05.220 align:start position:0%
but I can pull it up and walk through a
 
00:42:06.829 --> 00:42:06.839 align:start position:0%
sample of that for folks if you would
 
00:42:06.839 --> 00:42:07.730 align:start position:0%
sample of that for folks if you would
like

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:07.740 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:42:10.069 --> 00:42:10.079 align:start position:0%
but it is very common for the young
 
00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:11.700 align:start position:0%
people who end up there to have to have
 
00:42:13.190 --> 00:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
had multiple offenses before they go
 
00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:16.310 align:start position:0%
had multiple offenses before they go
there

00:42:16.310 --> 00:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:18.470 --> 00:42:18.480 align:start position:0%
right I heard you mentioned shock and
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
incarceration in Maine
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
and uh I heard or I I listened and you
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
said you're from New Jersey or you
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
worked in New Jersey which they have a
 
00:42:30.290 --> 00:42:30.300 align:start position:0%
Scared Straight program how effective is
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
the Scared Straight program and do we
 
00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.230 align:start position:0%
the Scared Straight program and do we
still

00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:42:35.750 --> 00:42:35.760 align:start position:0%
I I know that uh I think we've shied
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
away from that but uh yeah it was quite
 
00:42:41.210 --> 00:42:41.220 align:start position:0%
and and and of course we got Abbott
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
districts in New Jersey which you know I
 
00:42:46.310 --> 00:42:46.320 align:start position:0%
mean they're struggling to try to get
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
these kids in school and get an
 
00:42:49.130 --> 00:42:49.140 align:start position:0%
education yep
 
00:42:51.470 --> 00:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
yeah you know I think I think what we've
 
00:42:53.210 --> 00:42:53.220 align:start position:0%
seen you know New Jersey's seen a rapid
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
decline as well not as much as we've
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
seen here already
 
00:42:57.650 --> 00:42:57.660 align:start position:0%
um of course there's also different
 
00:42:59.510 --> 00:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
challenges in New Jersey around you know
 
00:43:00.950 --> 00:43:00.960 align:start position:0%
really ingrained intergenerational
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
poverty and things that while it occurs
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
here it's not at the same rate that you
 
00:43:06.829 --> 00:43:06.839 align:start position:0%
see in some of these other places
 
00:43:06.839 --> 00:43:07.790 align:start position:0%
see in some of these other places
um

00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:09.589 --> 00:43:09.599 align:start position:0%
what I would say is I think what we saw
 
00:43:11.329 --> 00:43:11.339 align:start position:0%
there and what we're seeing here is that
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
one of the things that makes the biggest
 
00:43:15.349 --> 00:43:15.359 align:start position:0%
difference is actually providing
 
00:43:17.870 --> 00:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
early easy needs-based access to
 
00:43:19.550 --> 00:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
Children's Behavioral Health Care and
 
00:43:21.309 --> 00:43:21.319 align:start position:0%
supporting parents through that process
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
that makes the biggest difference the
 
00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:25.980 align:start position:0%
other things that make big differences I
 
00:43:27.470 --> 00:43:27.480 align:start position:0%
think are really finding ways to support
 
00:43:29.270 --> 00:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
those households where parents are
 
00:43:30.530 --> 00:43:30.540 align:start position:0%
struggling because a lot of what you see
 
00:43:33.410 --> 00:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
is young people living a really unstable
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
situations and then you know that's kind
 
00:43:36.890 --> 00:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
of what you're seeing playing out you
 
00:43:37.910 --> 00:43:37.920 align:start position:0%
know it's the trauma that they've
 
00:43:40.370 --> 00:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
experienced as young people programs
 
00:43:41.510 --> 00:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
like scared straight and stuff like that
 
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:43.740 align:start position:0%
I think they they could work for certain
 
00:43:45.589 --> 00:43:45.599 align:start position:0%
populations of kids
 
00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:47.640 align:start position:0%
um you know a young person who really
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
already has a very stable home
 
00:43:51.470 --> 00:43:51.480 align:start position:0%
environment and really isn't struggling
 
00:43:53.329 --> 00:43:53.339 align:start position:0%
with these other external factors and
 
00:43:54.890 --> 00:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
you know they did they made a stupid
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
mistake and it's the kind of thing that
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
they're like oh wait I'm not going to
 
00:43:59.510 --> 00:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
make that mistake again
 
00:44:00.770 --> 00:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
um honestly for a lot of those young
 
00:44:02.450 --> 00:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
people I think just the process of being
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
arrested one time is probably enough to
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
scare them straight I don't know that
 
00:44:06.650 --> 00:44:06.660 align:start position:0%
those programs have been terribly
 
00:44:07.849 --> 00:44:07.859 align:start position:0%
effective when you're really working
 
00:44:10.849 --> 00:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
with kids who have long histories of
 
00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
trauma Behavioral Health needs
 
00:44:13.730 --> 00:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
challenges around intergenerational
 
00:44:16.970 --> 00:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
representative bucco for a question
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you director
 
00:44:25.010 --> 00:44:25.020 align:start position:0%
for coming today I'd like to move to the
 
00:44:27.290 --> 00:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
uh fiscal note down at the bottom here
 
00:44:29.569 --> 00:44:29.579 align:start position:0%
it says that this appropriation will be
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
funded by federal funds Opera funds are
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
those still available
 
00:44:38.150 --> 00:44:38.160 align:start position:0%
yes so and what and how how much is that
 
00:44:40.970 --> 00:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
you know included
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.089 --> 00:44:47.099 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget director came to
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate was was asked to come to the
 
00:44:50.690 --> 00:44:50.700 align:start position:0%
Senate finance committee hearing and
 
00:44:51.710 --> 00:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
talked about this so I'm just going to
 
00:44:53.329 --> 00:44:53.339 align:start position:0%
repeat what I heard them say because I'm
 
00:44:55.250 --> 00:44:55.260 align:start position:0%
not the expert on the arpa funds or on
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
any of those things right that's outside
 
00:44:59.750 --> 00:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
of my my world but what was testified to
 
00:45:01.550 --> 00:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
then was that there was 15 million
 
00:45:03.170 --> 00:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
dollars of arpa funds put in reserved
 
00:45:05.210 --> 00:45:05.220 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
um and that those funds are available
 
00:45:12.670 --> 00:45:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.690 --> 00:45:14.700 align:start position:0%
excuse me there's an additional figure
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
here of 20 21.6 what what kind of
 
00:45:19.849 --> 00:45:19.859 align:start position:0%
estimate are you guys working with yeah
 
00:45:21.890 --> 00:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
so you know that is a complication so
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
this there's a long tortured history
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
here that some people in the room are
 
00:45:25.970 --> 00:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
familiar with and some are not but this
 
00:45:27.530 --> 00:45:27.540 align:start position:0%
is a process that's been happening for
 
00:45:29.990 --> 00:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
well some might say decades but at least
 
00:45:32.089 --> 00:45:32.099 align:start position:0%
a few years and
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
um so last year there was a commission
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
our committee put together specifically
 
00:45:37.970 --> 00:45:37.980 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of looking at this
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
problem and coming up with a
 
00:45:42.050 --> 00:45:42.060 align:start position:0%
recommendation the only remaining member
 
00:45:43.970 --> 00:45:43.980 align:start position:0%
of that Committee in the legislature is
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh sitting down down for me
 
00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards the other four
 
00:45:49.370 --> 00:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
members are no longer in the legislature
 
00:45:52.010 --> 00:45:52.020 align:start position:0%
anymore and that was last uh last fall
 
00:45:54.410 --> 00:45:54.420 align:start position:0%
or you know fall before last so about 18
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
months ago at that time the estimates
 
00:45:58.490 --> 00:45:58.500 align:start position:0%
for building the new facility were
 
00:46:00.290 --> 00:46:00.300 align:start position:0%
brought in by
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
um division or department so the the net
 
00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:04.200 align:start position:0%
difference there you know is probably
 
00:46:06.109 --> 00:46:06.119 align:start position:0%
represented by that although again the
 
00:46:07.670 --> 00:46:07.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal note was completed by Department
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
of administrative services division
 
00:46:10.670 --> 00:46:10.680 align:start position:0%
Public Works and they would be the
 
00:46:12.829 --> 00:46:12.839 align:start position:0%
experts on on that
 
00:46:15.770 --> 00:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:17.569 --> 00:46:17.579 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for
 
00:46:19.849 --> 00:46:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this is sort of a
 
00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:22.740 align:start position:0%
follow-up to the previous question as I
 
00:46:24.010 --> 00:46:24.020 align:start position:0%
heard you
 
00:46:26.809 --> 00:46:26.819 align:start position:0%
uh we we've got this administrative
 
00:46:31.010 --> 00:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
release process for we know it's for
 
00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:34.260 align:start position:0%
kids that are committed and it if they
 
00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
have achieved sort of a clinical
 
00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:40.680 align:start position:0%
Readiness then they may qualify for the
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
administrative relief or release and
 
00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
they go through a judicial review and
 
00:46:46.190 --> 00:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
parole process
 
00:46:48.710 --> 00:46:48.720 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm just I'm just wondering
 
00:46:51.770 --> 00:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
about a couple of the other scenarios
 
00:46:56.270 --> 00:46:56.280 align:start position:0%
there where let's say the facility is
 
00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.170 align:start position:0%
there where let's say the facility is
full

00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
full
 
00:47:00.109 --> 00:47:00.119 align:start position:0%
none of the kids in there are clinically
 
00:47:00.119 --> 00:47:01.130 align:start position:0%
none of the kids in there are clinically
ready

00:47:01.130 --> 00:47:01.140 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:47:03.890 --> 00:47:03.900 align:start position:0%
you know what what what what could we do
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
with them it doesn't sound like the
 
00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
administrative release process is
 
00:47:09.349 --> 00:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate to them
 
00:47:12.950 --> 00:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh we would we would we ship them out of
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
state to secure facility would we what
 
00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
what what happens for that X plus one
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
kid when all acts need to stay in the
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
facility it would be a real real
 
00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.809 align:start position:0%
facility it would be a real real
challenge

00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
00:47:28.370 --> 00:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
um you know there is not at this moment
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
another state that's willing to take
 
00:47:31.490 --> 00:47:31.500 align:start position:0%
these kids you could ask our neighbors
 
00:47:33.230 --> 00:47:33.240 align:start position:0%
in Vermont about their experience when
 
00:47:34.609 --> 00:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
they chose to close their facility
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
without a plan or a new building in
 
00:47:36.900 --> 00:47:37.630 align:start position:0%
without a plan or a new building in
place

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:37.640 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
we agreed to take their kids for a
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
period of time and entered into a
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
contract to do the same and eventually
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
our own Workforce issues were such that
 
00:47:45.770 --> 00:47:45.780 align:start position:0%
we couldn't do that anymore and we had
 
00:47:48.109 --> 00:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
to terminate that contract
 
00:47:50.690 --> 00:47:50.700 align:start position:0%
um and I still get calls cut every
 
00:47:52.370 --> 00:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
couple weeks asking if I'm willing to
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
change my mind and you know we're just
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
not in a position to do that
 
00:47:57.950 --> 00:47:57.960 align:start position:0%
um but Maine is also not in a position
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
to do that in nor is Massachusetts at
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
least at this juncture so there's not
 
00:48:03.230 --> 00:48:03.240 align:start position:0%
another state with a secured facility
 
00:48:05.089 --> 00:48:05.099 align:start position:0%
that's really willing to step into that
 
00:48:08.329 --> 00:48:08.339 align:start position:0%
space right now so it would be it would
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
be a real problem I think you know we'd
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
be stuck scrambling trying to figure out
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
what's the safest next best thing for
 
00:48:18.109 --> 00:48:18.119 align:start position:0%
that for that scenario
 
00:48:21.410 --> 00:48:21.420 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up but but what I'm hearing
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
I think is is that there is no standard
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
operating procedure of how that would
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
happen that that would in fact be a
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
break glass situation where we've got a
 
00:48:34.130 --> 00:48:34.140 align:start position:0%
a kid in need and we've got public
 
00:48:37.370 --> 00:48:37.380 align:start position:0%
safety issues with no pre-planned way of
 
00:48:40.370 --> 00:48:40.380 align:start position:0%
handling it either legally or clinically
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
yep at this point at this point there's
 
00:48:44.450 --> 00:48:44.460 align:start position:0%
not a process for for that scenario
 
00:48:45.770 --> 00:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
other than the like I said the
 
00:48:47.089 --> 00:48:47.099 align:start position:0%
administrative release process which
 
00:48:49.790 --> 00:48:49.800 align:start position:0%
really is ideally used for kids who are
 
00:48:52.010 --> 00:48:52.020 align:start position:0%
clinically ready it was like I said
 
00:48:55.069 --> 00:48:55.079 align:start position:0%
years ago maybe a decade ago used to
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
manage capacity but you have to remember
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
a decade ago they were housing kids
 
00:49:00.829 --> 00:49:00.839 align:start position:0%
there that were quite different than
 
00:49:03.170 --> 00:49:03.180 align:start position:0%
today right when they had well over 100
 
00:49:05.329 --> 00:49:05.339 align:start position:0%
kids on that campus you know that there
 
00:49:06.770 --> 00:49:06.780 align:start position:0%
were lots of kids there that frankly by
 
00:49:08.270 --> 00:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
today's standards had no business being
 
00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.670 align:start position:0%
today's standards had no business being
there

00:49:10.670 --> 00:49:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:12.540 align:start position:0%
representative Sweeney has a question
 
00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:14.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:49:16.130 --> 00:49:16.140 align:start position:0%
being here and taking our questions so
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
back to the fiscal note of 21.6 million
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
for the design and construction of the
 
00:49:23.270 --> 00:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
new facility uh for 18 beds that's about
 
00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
1.2 million per bed obviously we've
 
00:49:28.190 --> 00:49:28.200 align:start position:0%
heard testimony about small therapeutic
 
00:49:31.730 --> 00:49:31.740 align:start position:0%
spaces for this facility can you sort of
 
00:49:33.410 --> 00:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
go into detail about what the vision is
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
for the design elements or or what how
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
are we getting to 1.2 million dollars
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
per bed that we're constructing here so
 
00:49:43.250 --> 00:49:43.260 align:start position:0%
if you actually look in in the bill
 
00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:45.650 align:start position:0%
if you actually look in in the bill
section

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:49:48.410 --> 00:49:48.420 align:start position:0%
the inspection two Roman three it kind
 
00:49:49.670 --> 00:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
of goes through all the things that are
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
expected to be in this building and one
 
00:49:53.690 --> 00:49:53.700 align:start position:0%
of the things that you know
 
00:49:55.730 --> 00:49:55.740 align:start position:0%
that I think was even though I think
 
00:49:58.370 --> 00:49:58.380 align:start position:0%
sysc has designed has a lot of flaws in
 
00:50:00.770 --> 00:50:00.780 align:start position:0%
terms of being really really leaning too
 
00:50:02.150 --> 00:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
far Correctional not having the
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
therapeutic components that we need one
 
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
thing that it did do was it actually was
 
00:50:08.870 --> 00:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
a fully secured building which was not
 
00:50:10.730 --> 00:50:10.740 align:start position:0%
the case of the old campus right the old
 
00:50:12.589 --> 00:50:12.599 align:start position:0%
campus prior we're not all secured
 
00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
buildings there was lots of issues
 
00:50:16.190 --> 00:50:16.200 align:start position:0%
around Youth absconding and all types of
 
00:50:17.510 --> 00:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know things happening in the
 
00:50:19.849 --> 00:50:19.859 align:start position:0%
community and at this point right the
 
00:50:21.710 --> 00:50:21.720 align:start position:0%
concentrated population of Youth that
 
00:50:23.450 --> 00:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
are there I think you do want to have a
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
fully architecturally secured building
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
and to manage that you really have to
 
00:50:28.870 --> 00:50:28.880 align:start position:0%
have your building be kind of self
 
00:50:31.069 --> 00:50:31.079 align:start position:0%
self-sufficient self-contained so a lot
 
00:50:32.930 --> 00:50:32.940 align:start position:0%
of the components it's not just about 18
 
00:50:34.250 --> 00:50:34.260 align:start position:0%
bedrooms not like a house with 18
 
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:36.180 align:start position:0%
bedrooms but it's kind of all the
 
00:50:37.370 --> 00:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
components that you'd have to imagine
 
00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:39.780 align:start position:0%
that a young person needs access to have
 
00:50:41.150 --> 00:50:41.160 align:start position:0%
to be built into that so that's kind of
 
00:50:43.370 --> 00:50:43.380 align:start position:0%
why that that inflates that number grows
 
00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
but if you look through Roman 3 on page
 
00:50:50.150 --> 00:50:50.160 align:start position:0%
two right a talks about the design being
 
00:50:52.430 --> 00:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
therapeutic trauma-reformed home-like
 
00:50:54.290 --> 00:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
interior exterior to the maximum extent
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
practicable talks about setting it up in
 
00:50:58.069 --> 00:50:58.079 align:start position:0%
a way that there's staff visibility to
 
00:50:59.510 --> 00:50:59.520 align:start position:0%
ensure safety so you're not talking
 
00:51:01.069 --> 00:51:01.079 align:start position:0%
about multiple floors and kids all over
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
the place but rather lots of glass lots
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
of ability for staff to see what's
 
00:51:07.309 --> 00:51:07.319 align:start position:0%
happening to be able to respond you're
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
talking about having space for medical
 
00:51:10.730 --> 00:51:10.740 align:start position:0%
needs to be met for kids
 
00:51:12.170 --> 00:51:12.180 align:start position:0%
physical and behavioral health care
 
00:51:13.730 --> 00:51:13.740 align:start position:0%
needs to be met so physical you're
 
00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:15.420 align:start position:0%
really talking about both indoor and
 
00:51:17.210 --> 00:51:17.220 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreational space these kids
 
00:51:18.770 --> 00:51:18.780 align:start position:0%
need opportunities for large muscle
 
00:51:20.510 --> 00:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
movement and we're living in New
 
00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:21.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we can't really count on
 
00:51:24.410 --> 00:51:24.420 align:start position:0%
outdoor large muscle movement all year
 
00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:25.730 align:start position:0%
outdoor large muscle movement all year
round

00:51:25.730 --> 00:51:25.740 align:start position:0%
round
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
adequate space for educational needs so
 
00:51:28.849 --> 00:51:28.859 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about a big massive
 
00:51:30.470 --> 00:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
school but you need some classroom space
 
00:51:32.510 --> 00:51:32.520 align:start position:0%
some computer space for educational
 
00:51:34.150 --> 00:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
needs to be met
 
00:51:36.829 --> 00:51:36.839 align:start position:0%
itional needs now
 
00:51:38.750 --> 00:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
the current facility has a big
 
00:51:40.549 --> 00:51:40.559 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen if we were say to
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
co-locate this facility near another
 
00:51:43.609 --> 00:51:43.619 align:start position:0%
facility where we could get the food
 
00:51:45.290 --> 00:51:45.300 align:start position:0%
brought over we wouldn't need to build a
 
00:51:46.670 --> 00:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
commercial kitchen so that would end up
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
being some savings I think the current
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is anticipating we would
 
00:51:52.130 --> 00:51:52.140 align:start position:0%
build a full commercial kitchen because
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
that's what the current facility has
 
00:51:55.549 --> 00:51:55.559 align:start position:0%
that being said we will still need the
 
00:51:57.290 --> 00:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
cafeteria space right for the kids to
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
have their food but we wouldn't need the
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
full commercial kitchen
 
00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.910 align:start position:0%
full commercial kitchen
um

00:52:01.910 --> 00:52:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:03.410 --> 00:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
things around you know being
 
00:52:04.730 --> 00:52:04.740 align:start position:0%
architecturally secure equipped with
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
video surveillance
 
00:52:08.690 --> 00:52:08.700 align:start position:0%
um but really that kind of sets forth
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
the different components but I think
 
00:52:11.390 --> 00:52:11.400 align:start position:0%
what's really critical here is just the
 
00:52:13.309 --> 00:52:13.319 align:start position:0%
idea that you kind of have to build
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
everything in one space in One Secured
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
space that a kid would need unlike you
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
know in the real world where where we
 
00:52:22.010 --> 00:52:22.020 align:start position:0%
have people coming and going to get
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
their needs met in all different places
 
00:52:25.970 --> 00:52:25.980 align:start position:0%
one follow-up
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
follow-up thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:52:30.230 --> 00:52:30.240 align:start position:0%
you for for detailing that
 
00:52:31.549 --> 00:52:31.559 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
00:52:34.490 --> 00:52:34.500 align:start position:0%
in the broader picture of providing the
 
00:52:36.170 --> 00:52:36.180 align:start position:0%
rehabilitation services that we're
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%
seeking to provide to these children if
 
00:52:40.370 --> 00:52:40.380 align:start position:0%
you were to have a scale in front of you
 
00:52:43.130 --> 00:52:43.140 align:start position:0%
and one half of the scale was facility
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
needs and the other half were Personnel
 
00:52:48.349 --> 00:52:48.359 align:start position:0%
therapeutic professional needs to
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
actually provide the Staffing and
 
00:52:52.670 --> 00:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
retaining the staff to provide the
 
00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:54.119 align:start position:0%
therapeutic care that is going to
 
00:52:55.750 --> 00:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
actually make a difference an impact
 
00:52:58.010 --> 00:52:58.020 align:start position:0%
which would you weigh is more important
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
is it the facility or is it the
 
00:53:02.569 --> 00:53:02.579 align:start position:0%
Personnel staff that were able to hire
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
and retain to treat the children yeah I
 
00:53:07.309 --> 00:53:07.319 align:start position:0%
mean honestly I think it's it's really
 
00:53:09.970 --> 00:53:09.980 align:start position:0%
both in that a well-designed facility
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
complements the latter right and that's
 
00:53:13.250 --> 00:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
again something that the current
 
00:53:15.829 --> 00:53:15.839 align:start position:0%
facility doesn't do but when this when
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
this bill on um in Roman 3A talks about
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
complementing the therapeutic and
 
00:53:21.950 --> 00:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed care of children really
 
00:53:23.569 --> 00:53:23.579 align:start position:0%
talks about designing these spaces in a
 
00:53:24.530 --> 00:53:24.540 align:start position:0%
way that don't feel and look
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
Correctional and that actually have you
 
00:53:30.109 --> 00:53:30.119 align:start position:0%
know adequate spaces for for clinical
 
00:53:31.490 --> 00:53:31.500 align:start position:0%
interventions for group sessions for
 
00:53:33.410 --> 00:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
therapists to work with their kids and
 
00:53:36.410 --> 00:53:36.420 align:start position:0%
such so I do think it's it's it's a it's
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
really about doing both of these things
 
00:53:40.010 --> 00:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
well and doing it in a way that that
 
00:53:41.690 --> 00:53:41.700 align:start position:0%
complements both but the programming is
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely key and that's really what
 
00:53:45.349 --> 00:53:45.359 align:start position:0%
the next part of this Bill gets into if
 
00:53:47.630 --> 00:53:47.640 align:start position:0%
you look at Roman 4 on that same page
 
00:53:49.609 --> 00:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
you know really talks about Shifting the
 
00:53:51.230 --> 00:53:51.240 align:start position:0%
staff qualifications and the things that
 
00:53:53.750 --> 00:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
we're looking for in our staff and our
 
00:53:55.309 --> 00:53:55.319 align:start position:0%
training up our current staff to help
 
00:53:56.750 --> 00:53:56.760 align:start position:0%
get them to the point that we want them
 
00:53:58.130 --> 00:53:58.140 align:start position:0%
to get to to be able to do this work
 
00:53:59.930 --> 00:53:59.940 align:start position:0%
talks about bringing in evidence-based
 
00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:02.460 align:start position:0%
practices for these kids which is
 
00:54:04.609 --> 00:54:04.619 align:start position:0%
critical and which frankly we cannot do
 
00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:06.300 align:start position:0%
today because our Workforce issues are
 
00:54:08.270 --> 00:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
the way that they are right these
 
00:54:09.530 --> 00:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
evidence-based models and these
 
00:54:11.809 --> 00:54:11.819 align:start position:0%
trauma-informed models require that you
 
00:54:14.270 --> 00:54:14.280 align:start position:0%
have a stable Frontline milieu Workforce
 
00:54:15.650 --> 00:54:15.660 align:start position:0%
who are
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
seeing these kids and interacting with
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
these kids on a daily basis because
 
00:54:20.390 --> 00:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
that's where the interaction happens
 
00:54:22.010 --> 00:54:22.020 align:start position:0%
it's not just your clinician seeing your
 
00:54:24.049 --> 00:54:24.059 align:start position:0%
kid a few times a week it's the it's the
 
00:54:25.790 --> 00:54:25.800 align:start position:0%
micro interactions that happen between
 
00:54:28.250 --> 00:54:28.260 align:start position:0%
kids and and their staff
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
um and right now we're in a place where
 
00:54:32.150 --> 00:54:32.160 align:start position:0%
we have so few full-time staff because
 
00:54:34.370 --> 00:54:34.380 align:start position:0%
of you know because of one the fear of
 
00:54:36.530 --> 00:54:36.540 align:start position:0%
this building closing in three weeks and
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
two some challenges around around salary
 
00:54:39.890 --> 00:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
which I'm hopefully are going to be
 
00:54:41.150 --> 00:54:41.160 align:start position:0%
addressed through the collective
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
bargaining process that's happening
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:54:46.069 --> 00:54:46.079 align:start position:0%
um that it's just not possible to
 
00:54:47.450 --> 00:54:47.460 align:start position:0%
implement those programs and I think
 
00:54:49.490 --> 00:54:49.500 align:start position:0%
getting to the other side of this bill
 
00:54:51.230 --> 00:54:51.240 align:start position:0%
and having a vision for the future is
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
going to help us get to the point of
 
00:54:53.809 --> 00:54:53.819 align:start position:0%
being able to do those those programs
 
00:54:56.750 --> 00:54:56.760 align:start position:0%
with the kids it talks about something
 
00:54:58.849 --> 00:54:58.859 align:start position:0%
that we've not done
 
00:55:00.710 --> 00:55:00.720 align:start position:0%
um until recently which is actually
 
00:55:02.750 --> 00:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
stopped treating sysc like some kind of
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
Island unto itself and bring it into the
 
00:55:06.829 --> 00:55:06.839 align:start position:0%
broader system of care for children so
 
00:55:09.049 --> 00:55:09.059 align:start position:0%
and that's what C is about C talks about
 
00:55:10.910 --> 00:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
using the same uniform assessment when I
 
00:55:12.230 --> 00:55:12.240 align:start position:0%
talked about the assessment that's used
 
00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:14.579 align:start position:0%
for residential care that's what C is
 
00:55:15.470 --> 00:55:15.480 align:start position:0%
talking about here we're going to use
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
that exact same assessment it
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
cross-references the exact same statute
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
for the kids at sysc so that when a kid
 
00:55:23.270 --> 00:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
goes to sysc we can do an assessment and
 
00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:24.540 align:start position:0%
if we see this kid actually would
 
00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
benefit from a level three residential
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
program and they're safe to do that then
 
00:55:29.210 --> 00:55:29.220 align:start position:0%
we can start working towards that
 
00:55:30.890 --> 00:55:30.900 align:start position:0%
immediately and not necessarily keep
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
them in a locked facility
 
00:55:35.089 --> 00:55:35.099 align:start position:0%
um Dee talks about provision of Care
 
00:55:36.890 --> 00:55:36.900 align:start position:0%
Management Services so when I talked
 
00:55:38.569 --> 00:55:38.579 align:start position:0%
about fast forward before that's the
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
Care Management entity for the state
 
00:55:42.530 --> 00:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
there's a different sub-component of
 
00:55:44.089 --> 00:55:44.099 align:start position:0%
that Care Management called track and
 
00:55:45.290 --> 00:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not remembering what that acronym
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
stands for right now but what Trek is
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
it's the same exact High Fidelity
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
wraparound model but it's for kids in
 
00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:53.819 align:start position:0%
residential care including sysc for the
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
purpose of working with that team to
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
figure out how do you safely discharge
 
00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:58.920 align:start position:0%
that kid back to the community or to a
 
00:56:00.589 --> 00:56:00.599 align:start position:0%
step down program and get them out of
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
the higher level care that they're in so
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's what D is about it's about
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
building that piece for sysc kids so
 
00:56:08.870 --> 00:56:08.880 align:start position:0%
that they're also crossed over with the
 
00:56:11.230 --> 00:56:11.240 align:start position:0%
children's system of care
 
00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:13.030 align:start position:0%
children's system of care
foreign

00:56:13.030 --> 00:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:56:15.290 --> 00:56:15.300 align:start position:0%
e really talks about making sure that
 
00:56:17.089 --> 00:56:17.099 align:start position:0%
kids have frequent opportunities with
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
their families which is another key
 
00:56:20.630 --> 00:56:20.640 align:start position:0%
piece educational programming and F
 
00:56:23.210 --> 00:56:23.220 align:start position:0%
another key piece clinical work and
 
00:56:25.010 --> 00:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
large muscle movements another key piece
 
00:56:27.290 --> 00:56:27.300 align:start position:0%
so really this piece of it really gets
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
into all those key programmatic parts of
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
the facility so that's what's really
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
great about this bill is it's not just
 
00:56:36.710 --> 00:56:36.720 align:start position:0%
about building a building and it's not
 
00:56:38.210 --> 00:56:38.220 align:start position:0%
just about a number of beds it actually
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
sets forth the plan for
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
what do you want this to look like how
 
00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:43.619 align:start position:0%
do you integrate it into the rest of
 
00:56:45.650 --> 00:56:45.660 align:start position:0%
your system as a whole and what type of
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
programming do we want within the
 
00:56:48.410 --> 00:56:48.420 align:start position:0%
facility to make sure that these kids
 
00:56:50.089 --> 00:56:50.099 align:start position:0%
get the best care that we can give them
 
00:56:50.099 --> 00:56:54.069 align:start position:0%
get the best care that we can give them
so

00:56:54.069 --> 00:56:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.530 --> 00:56:56.540 align:start position:0%
members I have two more with questions
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
uh we're coming up on we're delaying the
 
00:57:05.450 --> 00:57:05.460 align:start position:0%
review for House Bill 527 the plan is to
 
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
have a recess from this division three
 
00:57:10.730 --> 00:57:10.740 align:start position:0%
has a an amendment they want to review
 
00:57:13.430 --> 00:57:13.440 align:start position:0%
that they worked on yesterday so we'll
 
00:57:16.130 --> 00:57:16.140 align:start position:0%
be recessing this and coming back again
 
00:57:20.089 --> 00:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
at 1 30. uh or one yeah I think we have
 
00:57:22.609 --> 00:57:22.619 align:start position:0%
it at 130. we'll be coming back again so
 
00:57:22.619 --> 00:57:23.450 align:start position:0%
it at 130. we'll be coming back again so
we'll

00:57:23.450 --> 00:57:23.460 align:start position:0%
we'll
 
00:57:26.210 --> 00:57:26.220 align:start position:0%
hoping we can finish up some of this we
 
00:57:28.309 --> 00:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
have another card from representative
 
00:57:30.950 --> 00:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
Kirk it hasn't come in yet so
 
00:57:33.170 --> 00:57:33.180 align:start position:0%
representative uh McGuire for a question
 
00:57:35.510 --> 00:57:35.520 align:start position:0%
then representative walner thank you
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
very much Mr chairman
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
um take a look at your first page in
 
00:57:43.690 --> 00:57:43.700 align:start position:0%
February of 20. there was a peak of 25
 
00:57:47.510 --> 00:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
individuals and that's because the the
 
00:57:50.210 --> 00:57:50.220 align:start position:0%
peak is the sum of two sort of random
 
00:57:52.490 --> 00:57:52.500 align:start position:0%
numbers and the and the if you look at
 
00:57:54.049 --> 00:57:54.059 align:start position:0%
the Blue Line in the orange line they
 
00:57:56.930 --> 00:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
they both peaked at the same time right
 
00:57:58.849 --> 00:57:58.859 align:start position:0%
and I don't see any particular reason
 
00:58:02.089 --> 00:58:02.099 align:start position:0%
why later on they couldn't also Peak at
 
00:58:03.950 --> 00:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
the same time and you'd have you'd want
 
00:58:07.010 --> 00:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
25 but only have 18 is that right it's
 
00:58:10.250 --> 00:58:10.260 align:start position:0%
so it's a possible risk right I think
 
00:58:11.329 --> 00:58:11.339 align:start position:0%
right when you look at this you're
 
00:58:12.950 --> 00:58:12.960 align:start position:0%
looking at three three years worth of
 
00:58:15.290 --> 00:58:15.300 align:start position:0%
data and that's kind of early on in the
 
00:58:18.170 --> 00:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
system of care intervention so I would
 
00:58:21.470 --> 00:58:21.480 align:start position:0%
hope but again that is that is a
 
00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:23.220 align:start position:0%
possible risk
 
00:58:25.250 --> 00:58:25.260 align:start position:0%
um at the same time we have days where
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
we got down to five right so I think you
 
00:58:31.370 --> 00:58:31.380 align:start position:0%
know the the the data tells us that 18
 
00:58:33.290 --> 00:58:33.300 align:start position:0%
is a safe
 
00:58:34.910 --> 00:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
ceiling even though we're really
 
00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
designing this building and this program
 
00:58:39.770 --> 00:58:39.780 align:start position:0%
to work for 12 kids because that's what
 
00:58:41.930 --> 00:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
our average daily census has been for
 
00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
the past you know close to three years
 
00:58:48.230 --> 00:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
well the the past three years may have
 
00:58:51.049 --> 00:58:51.059 align:start position:0%
been a little weird right so
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
um but let me ask you a different thing
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
on page five of the bill there's
 
00:58:56.450 --> 00:58:56.460 align:start position:0%
established a commission to study the
 
00:58:59.210 --> 00:58:59.220 align:start position:0%
situation is this a case of you know
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
we're doing something and then figuring
 
00:59:03.770 --> 00:59:03.780 align:start position:0%
out later what we should be doing so my
 
00:59:05.089 --> 00:59:05.099 align:start position:0%
opinion on this and I'm sure there are
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
people sitting around this table that
 
00:59:09.109 --> 00:59:09.119 align:start position:0%
disagree with me my opinion on this is
 
00:59:11.349 --> 00:59:11.359 align:start position:0%
that this issue has been studied
 
00:59:13.849 --> 00:59:13.859 align:start position:0%
extensively over a very long period of
 
00:59:16.609 --> 00:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
time about what we should do there is a
 
00:59:18.410 --> 00:59:18.420 align:start position:0%
committee report that that
 
00:59:20.210 --> 00:59:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards was on a couple
 
00:59:22.430 --> 00:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
years ago there's a report a couple
 
00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:24.180 align:start position:0%
years prior than that shortly after I
 
00:59:25.430 --> 00:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
got to the state that another committee
 
00:59:27.289 --> 00:59:27.299 align:start position:0%
put out which admonishes the legislature
 
00:59:28.910 --> 00:59:28.920 align:start position:0%
and the administration for not making a
 
00:59:30.410 --> 00:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
decision on this issue yet and that was
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
back in 2018.
 
00:59:35.150 --> 00:59:35.160 align:start position:0%
um I think I think we kind of know where
 
00:59:36.950 --> 00:59:36.960 align:start position:0%
the right direction is in my opinion
 
00:59:40.069 --> 00:59:40.079 align:start position:0%
what this was about was um within the
 
00:59:41.750 --> 00:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
Senate there was a lot of concern when
 
00:59:43.670 --> 00:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
the idea of where this facility could be
 
00:59:46.430 --> 00:59:46.440 align:start position:0%
located came up particularly the idea
 
00:59:48.049 --> 00:59:48.059 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about three possible
 
00:59:50.030 --> 00:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
sites and we haven't done yet the work
 
00:59:52.250 --> 00:59:52.260 align:start position:0%
with the Architects
 
00:59:55.370 --> 00:59:55.380 align:start position:0%
um to to do the to do kind of the the
 
00:59:57.829 --> 00:59:57.839 align:start position:0%
um forgetting the words but the
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
the assessment of the actual locations
 
01:00:01.609 --> 01:00:01.619 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they're appropriate
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
to build the building so there's three
 
01:00:04.370 --> 01:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
possible locations that you could do
 
01:00:07.010 --> 01:00:07.020 align:start position:0%
this that are being thought of today one
 
01:00:08.470 --> 01:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
would be near New Hampshire hospital
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
reason for that would be that you could
 
01:00:12.650 --> 01:00:12.660 align:start position:0%
co-locate and have some shared services
 
01:00:14.030 --> 01:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
which would allow you to drive down
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
operational costs over time
 
01:00:18.589 --> 01:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
substantially right now sysc operates in
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
a bubble so we run our own medical
 
01:00:23.030 --> 01:00:23.040 align:start position:0%
program our own nutrition program we
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
manage this whole campus we have all
 
01:00:27.049 --> 01:00:27.059 align:start position:0%
these folks who are working on on all
 
01:00:29.390 --> 01:00:29.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of stuff that could be shared with
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
another facility if we were next to
 
01:00:31.970 --> 01:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
another facility that would drive down
 
01:00:33.829 --> 01:00:33.839 align:start position:0%
operational costs year after year over
 
01:00:35.690 --> 01:00:35.700 align:start position:0%
time and these are all general fund
 
01:00:37.490 --> 01:00:37.500 align:start position:0%
costs this is not right now funds that
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
the feds contribute to
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
um so near New Hampshire hospital is one
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
site near Hampstead Hospital is another
 
01:00:44.870 --> 01:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
site again another opportunity to
 
01:00:47.089 --> 01:00:47.099 align:start position:0%
co-locate have shared services over time
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
achieve some economies of scale
 
01:00:51.289 --> 01:00:51.299 align:start position:0%
um and then the last option you know
 
01:00:53.450 --> 01:00:53.460 align:start position:0%
which which my personal opinion would be
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
the least favorite option would be to
 
01:00:56.210 --> 01:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
remain somewhere on the current campus
 
01:00:57.829 --> 01:00:57.839 align:start position:0%
uh that would be my least favorite
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
option for two reasons one you wouldn't
 
01:01:01.250 --> 01:01:01.260 align:start position:0%
have the shared services cost so you'd
 
01:01:02.990 --> 01:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
still kind of be operating on an island
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
and two right we're all familiar with
 
01:01:06.650 --> 01:01:06.660 align:start position:0%
the history of that property and I do
 
01:01:08.150 --> 01:01:08.160 align:start position:0%
think it's I think there's value in
 
01:01:10.010 --> 01:01:10.020 align:start position:0%
having a clean break and and getting
 
01:01:11.930 --> 01:01:11.940 align:start position:0%
away from that
 
01:01:14.450 --> 01:01:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so what this really was about was was
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for the legislators and
 
01:01:18.250 --> 01:01:18.260 align:start position:0%
community members in whatever Community
 
01:01:20.450 --> 01:01:20.460 align:start position:0%
this is cited in to be able to
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
participate in a process to figure out
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
like how are we going to make sure that
 
01:01:25.069 --> 01:01:25.079 align:start position:0%
this is not going to have an adverse
 
01:01:26.750 --> 01:01:26.760 align:start position:0%
impact on the community in which it's
 
01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
situated and that they can have a voice
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
into what the security structures and
 
01:01:32.089 --> 01:01:32.099 align:start position:0%
things look like so this wasn't really
 
01:01:34.430 --> 01:01:34.440 align:start position:0%
about figuring out the entirety of
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
what's next but really that sub issue of
 
01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:43.250 --> 01:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative wellner for
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
location was the question I was going to
 
01:01:49.069 --> 01:01:49.079 align:start position:0%
ask and I think you just outlined the
 
01:01:50.809 --> 01:01:50.819 align:start position:0%
three locations you're looking at thank
 
01:01:52.490 --> 01:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
you thank you
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
represent Edwards last question and then
 
01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm going to hear from representative
 
01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
Kirk and then I'm going to go into
 
01:02:01.069 --> 01:02:01.079 align:start position:0%
recess so we can get to the next bill uh
 
01:02:03.770 --> 01:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the Indulgence I
 
01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:06.900 align:start position:0%
on the question about the purpose of the
 
01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.069 align:start position:0%
on the question about the purpose of the
commission

01:02:09.069 --> 01:02:09.079 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:02:11.750 --> 01:02:11.760 align:start position:0%
is it right that the last few things
 
01:02:13.309 --> 01:02:13.319 align:start position:0%
that you said are really the major
 
01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:15.240 align:start position:0%
points of this commission that this
 
01:02:17.569 --> 01:02:17.579 align:start position:0%
commission doesn't have any uh
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
decision-making Authority its Authority
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
is limited to writing a report
 
01:02:26.049 --> 01:02:26.059 align:start position:0%
and proposing legislation
 
01:02:30.170 --> 01:02:30.180 align:start position:0%
and that its key function is to begin
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
the conversations in a deep level with
 
01:02:35.569 --> 01:02:35.579 align:start position:0%
each of the potential affected
 
01:02:35.579 --> 01:02:36.789 align:start position:0%
each of the potential affected
communities

01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:40.200 align:start position:0%
and and that because that hadn't been
 
01:02:43.609 --> 01:02:43.619 align:start position:0%
taking place the greatest anxiety in the
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
senate about this bill was over the
 
01:02:48.770 --> 01:02:48.780 align:start position:0%
select the site selection and the lack
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
of community involvement so so it wasn't
 
01:02:53.750 --> 01:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
wasn't it in fact the purpose of this
 
01:02:56.210 --> 01:02:56.220 align:start position:0%
commission to to deal with the
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
socialization issue of of how we pick a
 
01:03:03.650 --> 01:03:03.660 align:start position:0%
site and what we do to respect our
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to that location yes
 
01:03:08.210 --> 01:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
yeah that's accurate thank you for that
 
01:03:10.130 --> 01:03:10.140 align:start position:0%
um and also on the very first page of
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
the bill I think it's in the third
 
01:03:13.010 --> 01:03:13.020 align:start position:0%
paragraph there is language in there
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
around you know the department
 
01:03:16.490 --> 01:03:16.500 align:start position:0%
accommodating the reasonable requests of
 
01:03:17.930 --> 01:03:17.940 align:start position:0%
the community within which this is
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
ultimately placed in language and
 
01:03:21.470 --> 01:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
they're about implementing a payment in
 
01:03:23.690 --> 01:03:23.700 align:start position:0%
lieu of taxes to try to offset so
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
there's not an adverse Community impact
 
01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:28.619 align:start position:0%
to wherever this ends up being placed
 
01:03:28.619 --> 01:03:34.130 align:start position:0%
to wherever this ends up being placed
foreign

01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.530 --> 01:03:36.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Kirk is
 
01:03:42.349 --> 01:03:42.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh
 
01:03:53.270 --> 01:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
good morning to you and to members of
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
the committee for the record I'm Neil
 
01:03:57.230 --> 01:03:57.240 align:start position:0%
Kirk I live in Ware and today I'm
 
01:04:00.410 --> 01:04:00.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
um I appreciate the opportunity to speak
 
01:04:03.950 --> 01:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
to you because I have a different take
 
01:04:06.289 --> 01:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
on this bill
 
01:04:08.270 --> 01:04:08.280 align:start position:0%
um I think the bill as it came before
 
01:04:11.750 --> 01:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
you uh is should not be adopted by the
 
01:04:13.250 --> 01:04:13.260 align:start position:0%
committee but it should be substantially
 
01:04:15.650 --> 01:04:15.660 align:start position:0%
amendment to do amended to do two very
 
01:04:17.089 --> 01:04:17.099 align:start position:0%
important things
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
number one deal with the cutoff date of
 
01:04:21.650 --> 01:04:21.660 align:start position:0%
March 1st that has to be extended and
 
01:04:23.510 --> 01:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
number two to the extent it's necessary
 
01:04:25.250 --> 01:04:25.260 align:start position:0%
provide additional funds for the
 
01:04:27.609 --> 01:04:27.619 align:start position:0%
Department to operate the facility
 
01:04:30.650 --> 01:04:30.660 align:start position:0%
for the next four months from March 1st
 
01:04:32.990 --> 01:04:33.000 align:start position:0%
through the end of the fiscal year
 
01:04:35.450 --> 01:04:35.460 align:start position:0%
everything else that's in this bill
 
01:04:38.510 --> 01:04:38.520 align:start position:0%
can be done at a later time by the
 
01:04:42.589 --> 01:04:42.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:44.750 --> 01:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
more time to do it either through the
 
01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
budget process or through the retained
 
01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:49.140 align:start position:0%
Bill process
 
01:04:51.650 --> 01:04:51.660 align:start position:0%
and let me explain why I think this is
 
01:04:53.809 --> 01:04:53.819 align:start position:0%
the right thing to do
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
I've been working on this problem since
 
01:04:59.450 --> 01:04:59.460 align:start position:0%
at least 2015.
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
and you can see things move at glacial
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
Pace in this legislature
 
01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:05.589 align:start position:0%
Pace in this legislature
uh

01:05:05.589 --> 01:05:05.599 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
the issue today facing us is primarily
 
01:05:11.150 --> 01:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
the question of size and to some extent
 
01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:13.730 align:start position:0%
the question of size and to some extent

01:05:15.890 --> 01:05:15.900 align:start position:0%
the bill before you is the Senate
 
01:05:15.900 --> 01:05:17.390 align:start position:0%
the bill before you is the Senate
version

01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
version
 
01:05:19.609 --> 01:05:19.619 align:start position:0%
of the solution to this problem
 
01:05:21.410 --> 01:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
the house version
 
01:05:23.870 --> 01:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
to the solution to this problem which
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
went through a number of iterations and
 
01:05:29.569 --> 01:05:29.579 align:start position:0%
collapsed in a conference committee last
 
01:05:29.579 --> 01:05:30.849 align:start position:0%
collapsed in a conference committee last
year

01:05:30.849 --> 01:05:30.859 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:05:33.829 --> 01:05:33.839 align:start position:0%
has a very different take
 
01:05:36.109 --> 01:05:36.119 align:start position:0%
children and family law wanted a six bed
 
01:05:36.119 --> 01:05:38.809 align:start position:0%
children and family law wanted a six bed
facility

01:05:38.809 --> 01:05:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:41.569 --> 01:05:41.579 align:start position:0%
um with a whole variety of changes to
 
01:05:44.089 --> 01:05:44.099 align:start position:0%
the kinds of children who could be
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
either detained or committed to sununu
 
01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.250 align:start position:0%
either detained or committed to sununu
and

01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
that's there been their position for a
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
number of years three or four times this
 
01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
has happened so what you see before you
 
01:05:57.349 --> 01:05:57.359 align:start position:0%
is an effort by the Senate
 
01:05:59.450 --> 01:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
to do what they were unable to do in
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
conference committee
 
01:06:11.030 --> 01:06:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
we know that we've put in a system of
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
care for these children and that system
 
01:06:18.109 --> 01:06:18.119 align:start position:0%
of care is very effective and even the
 
01:06:21.349 --> 01:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
department agrees that over time
 
01:06:23.390 --> 01:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
we are going to reduce the population
 
01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:26.460 align:start position:0%
still further of the sununu center
 
01:06:28.430 --> 01:06:28.440 align:start position:0%
we don't know exactly how low it will go
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
and we don't know when it will occur but
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
it will occur because the system of care
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
is dealing with the younger children now
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
so that they will not
 
01:06:39.170 --> 01:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
become eligible for sununu they will not
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
be engaged in the kinds of activities
 
01:06:42.890 --> 01:06:42.900 align:start position:0%
which the sununu center is an
 
01:06:45.289 --> 01:06:45.299 align:start position:0%
appropriate place
 
01:06:48.589 --> 01:06:48.599 align:start position:0%
if you act now to build a facility of 12
 
01:06:51.049 --> 01:06:51.059 align:start position:0%
to 18 beds
 
01:06:53.809 --> 01:06:53.819 align:start position:0%
which is what the bill requires and it
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
turns out over the next couple of years
 
01:06:57.109 --> 01:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
and remember Das says this building
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:03.900 align:start position:0%
um you may be building a facility for 12
 
01:07:05.809 --> 01:07:05.819 align:start position:0%
to 8 with 12 to 18 beds when the
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.870 --> 01:07:14.880 align:start position:0%
let's slow it down before we go in that
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
direction of of the Senate bill
 
01:07:20.450 --> 01:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
we have other opportunities and you've
 
01:07:22.069 --> 01:07:22.079 align:start position:0%
seen how complex this issue is you've
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
heard uh Mr ribson's testimony this is a
 
01:07:27.049 --> 01:07:27.059 align:start position:0%
very complicated area and for the
 
01:07:28.789 --> 01:07:28.799 align:start position:0%
finance committee which is supposed to
 
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
deal only with Finance issues to get
 
01:07:32.750 --> 01:07:32.760 align:start position:0%
involved with all of these Children and
 
01:07:35.990 --> 01:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
Youth and Family Law positions might be
 
01:07:38.029 --> 01:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
inappropriate sometimes you have to do
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
it we've done it in the budget but it's
 
01:07:42.289 --> 01:07:42.299 align:start position:0%
not a desirable thing to do and since
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 120 which is the clone of of
 
01:07:48.109 --> 01:07:48.119 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one is already retained in
 
01:07:50.930 --> 01:07:50.940 align:start position:0%
children and family law we have an
 
01:07:52.730 --> 01:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity for that committee to do its
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
job and decide what they want to do
 
01:07:56.630 --> 01:07:56.640 align:start position:0%
rather than Finance taking the Senate
 
01:07:56.640 --> 01:07:57.710 align:start position:0%
rather than Finance taking the Senate
position

01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
and not doing what the house really
 
01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:01.260 align:start position:0%
wants or at least children and family
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.029 --> 01:08:08.039 align:start position:0%
some of you know that YDC which the
 
01:08:10.849 --> 01:08:10.859 align:start position:0%
predecessor Youth Development Center
 
01:08:13.789 --> 01:08:13.799 align:start position:0%
detention or Development Center
 
01:08:16.370 --> 01:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
Development Center uh the predecessor of
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
the sununu center also had the same
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
kinds of
 
01:08:20.339 --> 01:08:21.349 align:start position:0%
kinds of
um

01:08:21.349 --> 01:08:21.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
legal problems at the sununu center now
 
01:08:23.759 --> 01:08:25.490 align:start position:0%
legal problems at the sununu center now
has

01:08:25.490 --> 01:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:08:27.890 --> 01:08:27.900 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that I think both
 
01:08:29.630 --> 01:08:29.640 align:start position:0%
children and family law and this
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
committee should ask is whether or not
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
we want to create a mini sununu Center
 
01:08:37.130 --> 01:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
which might have the same problems
 
01:08:38.749 --> 01:08:38.759 align:start position:0%
because it might carry over the same
 
01:08:38.759 --> 01:08:40.070 align:start position:0%
because it might carry over the same
culture

01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
culture
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
and what is the definition of insanity
 
01:08:46.010 --> 01:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing again and expecting
 
01:08:49.189 --> 01:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:49.199 --> 01:08:51.650 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:08:51.650 --> 01:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
let me conclude by asking the committee
 
01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:55.980 align:start position:0%
to change the spill to deal with the
 
01:08:57.530 --> 01:08:57.540 align:start position:0%
immediate problem
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
extend the date or eliminate the date
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
and put in some funding if necessary
 
01:09:04.490 --> 01:09:04.500 align:start position:0%
and leave the rest of the issues to the
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and or
 
01:09:07.849 --> 01:09:07.859 align:start position:0%
the budget depending upon what the
 
01:09:10.309 --> 01:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
circumstances are
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
but this committee I don't think should
 
01:09:14.510 --> 01:09:14.520 align:start position:0%
abandon the house position in the face
 
01:09:16.070 --> 01:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
of a Senate bill
 
01:09:17.809 --> 01:09:17.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I'd be pleased to
 
01:09:20.030 --> 01:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
ask answer any questions if there are
 
01:09:22.269 --> 01:09:22.279 align:start position:0%
any I hope there's only one
 
01:09:24.829 --> 01:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman nice to
 
01:09:29.450 --> 01:09:29.460 align:start position:0%
see the former chair of the finance
 
01:09:32.090 --> 01:09:32.100 align:start position:0%
committee you were probably sitting on
 
01:09:34.010 --> 01:09:34.020 align:start position:0%
finance at the time or was in the house
 
01:09:36.769 --> 01:09:36.779 align:start position:0%
when the sununu center was built and I
 
01:09:38.749 --> 01:09:38.759 align:start position:0%
know a substantial amount of federal
 
01:09:41.709 --> 01:09:41.719 align:start position:0%
funds were used to build that facility
 
01:09:44.090 --> 01:09:44.100 align:start position:0%
do you know where that would stand would
 
01:09:46.490 --> 01:09:46.500 align:start position:0%
we get a federal claw back if we close
 
01:09:49.669 --> 01:09:49.679 align:start position:0%
that facility or are those funds given
 
01:09:52.070 --> 01:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
free and there is no potential for a
 
01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:54.600 align:start position:0%
clawback I personally don't know because
 
01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:56.160 align:start position:0%
at the time that I was in the house
 
01:09:58.310 --> 01:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
there was going to be a claw back but I
 
01:10:01.250 --> 01:10:01.260 align:start position:0%
attended a work session of a division
 
01:10:04.070 --> 01:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
three a few days ago well last week and
 
01:10:06.650 --> 01:10:06.660 align:start position:0%
Mr ribson at that time indicated that
 
01:10:09.370 --> 01:10:09.380 align:start position:0%
there had been a change in the Federal
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
Regulation so as a practical matter
 
01:10:15.650 --> 01:10:15.660 align:start position:0%
there would be no clawback at all but I
 
01:10:17.150 --> 01:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
think you need to verify that with Mr
 
01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:18.530 align:start position:0%
think you need to verify that with Mr
ribson

01:10:18.530 --> 01:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
ribson
 
01:10:21.470 --> 01:10:21.480 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thanks Mr chairman
 
01:10:23.090 --> 01:10:23.100 align:start position:0%
I hope this is a short question
 
01:10:25.370 --> 01:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
representative Hall it is thank you
 
01:10:27.470 --> 01:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
would you please summarize your comments
 
01:10:29.450 --> 01:10:29.460 align:start position:0%
in a letter to the committee for written
 
01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.610 align:start position:0%
in a letter to the committee for written
testimony

01:10:31.610 --> 01:10:31.620 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:10:34.310 --> 01:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'll do my best but your time frame
 
01:10:37.090 --> 01:10:37.100 align:start position:0%
makes that rather difficult I understand
 
01:10:39.470 --> 01:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we can have it added to the folder
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
all right I'm going to recess this this
 
01:10:53.930 --> 01:10:53.940 align:start position:0%

um go and work on an amendment during
 
01:11:03.290 --> 01:11:03.300 align:start position:0%
the interim and maybe we would we will
 
01:11:05.990 --> 01:11:06.000 align:start position:0%
be back at 1 30. we are recessed in
 
01:11:10.010 --> 01:11:10.020 align:start position:0%

01:12:07.010 --> 01:12:07.020 align:start position:0%
of uh constituent The Honorable Mr
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
Campbell who's with us today
 
01:12:12.410 --> 01:12:12.420 align:start position:0%
uh in a Mad Dash we
 
01:12:15.470 --> 01:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
ran over to uh legal services to request
 
01:12:18.050 --> 01:12:18.060 align:start position:0%
an amendment to this uh to basically
 
01:12:19.729 --> 01:12:19.739 align:start position:0%
replace what we have here for
 
01:12:19.739 --> 01:12:21.110 align:start position:0%
replace what we have here for
clarification

01:12:21.110 --> 01:12:21.120 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:12:23.630 --> 01:12:23.640 align:start position:0%
uh looking at the amount of the
 
01:12:25.250 --> 01:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
expenditures we think that's a little
 
01:12:28.850 --> 01:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
bit High uh we're narrowing the bill
 
01:14:59.570 --> 01:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:11.030 --> 01:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie my real secret
 
01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
name is Wayne it's Wayne Campbell
 
01:15:16.189 --> 01:15:16.199 align:start position:0%
so now the secret is out
 
01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
um but I had the opportunity to serve
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
and then Hampshire legislature with the
 
01:15:23.090 --> 01:15:23.100 align:start position:0%
chairman Weiler and we had a lot so long
 
01:15:25.970 --> 01:15:25.980 align:start position:0%
I don't recognize you but I
 
01:15:27.590 --> 01:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
you know it's scary
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
I do recognize you and it was 20 years
 
01:15:33.410 --> 01:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
ago and you haven't changed a bit
 
01:15:33.420 --> 01:15:35.209 align:start position:0%
ago and you haven't changed a bit
congratulations

01:15:35.209 --> 01:15:35.219 align:start position:0%
congratulations
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to follow my mother's lead
 
01:15:39.050 --> 01:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
she looked the same at a hundred as she
 
01:15:42.770 --> 01:15:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
I won't ask whether you were 70 then or
 
01:15:47.270 --> 01:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
70 now
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
I gotta get this button thing down
 
01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
hit it once I'm good okay so my name is
 
01:15:59.750 --> 01:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh Wayne Campbell and my sister Ann
 
01:16:02.810 --> 01:16:02.820 align:start position:0%
and I started a assisted living facility
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
and I think that's the first thing that
 
01:16:06.950 --> 01:16:06.960 align:start position:0%
we'll explain is it's licensed just a
 
01:16:08.930 --> 01:16:08.940 align:start position:0%
504 license and we have a copy of that
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
license so when I asked representative
 
01:16:12.950 --> 01:16:12.960 align:start position:0%
Horgan and representative Petrie if they
 
01:16:15.590 --> 01:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
would sponsor this legislation we put in
 
01:16:18.169 --> 01:16:18.179 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility up to 16 beds
 
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
and that has a very uh important import
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
that means an 804 license
 
01:16:26.390 --> 01:16:26.400 align:start position:0%
um in the methodology from Health and
 
01:16:27.709 --> 01:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
Human Services I think there was a
 
01:16:29.810 --> 01:16:29.820 align:start position:0%
little miscommunication in that they
 
01:16:32.930 --> 01:16:32.940 align:start position:0%
included all licensed facilities and
 
01:16:34.189 --> 01:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
that was not the intent of the
 
01:16:37.370 --> 01:16:37.380 align:start position:0%
legislation so as a former legislator I
 
01:16:39.470 --> 01:16:39.480 align:start position:0%
I agree that there's some clarity that's
 
01:16:42.110 --> 01:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
that's perhaps warranted and that would
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
be that instead of saying a an assisted
 
01:16:47.570 --> 01:16:47.580 align:start position:0%
living facility up to 16 beds who just
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
say a 60 living facility with an 804
 
01:16:53.330 --> 01:16:53.340 align:start position:0%
Residential Care license and what that
 
01:16:55.250 --> 01:16:55.260 align:start position:0%
does is really narrow the scope of what
 
01:16:57.770 --> 01:16:57.780 align:start position:0%
we're talking about today and I don't
 
01:16:59.510 --> 01:16:59.520 align:start position:0%
mean to put Health and Human Services on
 
01:17:01.490 --> 01:17:01.500 align:start position:0%
on the spot and I wish I had let them
 
01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:04.020 align:start position:0%
know ahead of time but I would hope that
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
in division three or later when you look
 
01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:07.860 align:start position:0%
at that Amendment they could give you an
 
01:17:10.850 --> 01:17:10.860 align:start position:0%
updated fiscal note that would address
 
01:17:12.709 --> 01:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
The Limited number of beds in the state
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and quite honestly I
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't know how many there are but I know
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
that the 805 license which is more of a
 
01:17:23.630 --> 01:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
Continuum of Care license more nursing
 
01:17:26.169 --> 01:17:26.179 align:start position:0%
care are a higher level of
 
01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
in room services for lack of a better
 
01:17:31.610 --> 01:17:31.620 align:start position:0%
term it's different
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless an 804 facility as an
 
01:17:35.270 --> 01:17:35.280 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility is a
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
residential care facility provides even
 
01:17:40.130 --> 01:17:40.140 align:start position:0%
more services in my opinion than an 805
 
01:17:42.350 --> 01:17:42.360 align:start position:0%
and what I mean is and my sister will
 
01:17:44.570 --> 01:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
speak to this a little bit more is they
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
take you to the hairdresser they take
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
you to activities you're you're getting
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
assistance with your living you're
 
01:17:53.270 --> 01:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
getting Med management so all the all
 
01:17:56.090 --> 01:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
the staff are Med certified you have one
 
01:17:58.310 --> 01:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
RN instead of necessarily RNs going in
 
01:17:59.689 --> 01:17:59.699 align:start position:0%
and given the service at the same time
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
but you really have in my opinion a
 
01:18:05.149 --> 01:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
higher level of service so again the 804
 
01:18:08.030 --> 01:18:08.040 align:start position:0%
clarification is important because one
 
01:18:09.530 --> 01:18:09.540 align:start position:0%
of the notes in the fiscal note is that
 
01:18:10.850 --> 01:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
oh we don't know how to pay different
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
rates to different facilities when in
 
01:18:15.050 --> 01:18:15.060 align:start position:0%
fact when you look at the fiscal note
 
01:18:17.330 --> 01:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
they pay 58 dollars a night for some
 
01:18:21.169 --> 01:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
facilities 804s and they pay 95 a night
 
01:18:23.030 --> 01:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming for 805s or other
 
01:18:26.270 --> 01:18:26.280 align:start position:0%
facilities so there is a precedent that
 
01:18:27.649 --> 01:18:27.659 align:start position:0%
you would pay facilities at different
 
01:18:30.350 --> 01:18:30.360 align:start position:0%
rates and I'm asking you to do that for
 
01:18:32.390 --> 01:18:32.400 align:start position:0%
a couple of reasons one I'm partners
 
01:18:34.910 --> 01:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
with my three sisters so anybody who
 
01:18:35.930 --> 01:18:35.940 align:start position:0%
votes against this they're voting
 
01:18:38.030 --> 01:18:38.040 align:start position:0%
against my sisters that's not no
 
01:18:40.490 --> 01:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
you know not a good idea so
 
01:18:42.110 --> 01:18:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so when we opened this facility it
 
01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:43.980 align:start position:0%
was right when covet hit it took over a
 
01:18:45.649 --> 01:18:45.659 align:start position:0%
year to get the approval and I will tell
 
01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:48.300 align:start position:0%
you there was a a substantial amount of
 
01:18:50.930 --> 01:18:50.940 align:start position:0%
confusion on the requirements and just
 
01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:54.300 align:start position:0%
for a visual aid uh Mr chairman
 
01:18:57.050 --> 01:18:57.060 align:start position:0%
in this packet you have 804 license
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
administrative rules different than 805
 
01:19:02.290 --> 01:19:02.300 align:start position:0%
license administrative rules
 
01:19:04.390 --> 01:19:04.400 align:start position:0%
definitionally they're very similar
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
requirements are very similar just to
 
01:19:10.490 --> 01:19:10.500 align:start position:0%
give you one example 805 is NFP 101
 
01:19:13.970 --> 01:19:13.980 align:start position:0%
where 804 is a different fire Life
 
01:19:15.950 --> 01:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
Safety Code a little bit less
 
01:19:17.930 --> 01:19:17.940 align:start position:0%
so there's lots of little nuances like
 
01:19:19.189 --> 01:19:19.199 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to get into it I just
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
want to make the point that they are
 
01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:23.400 align:start position:0%
different levels of almost like a
 
01:19:24.890 --> 01:19:24.900 align:start position:0%
private school versus a public school
 
01:19:26.570 --> 01:19:26.580 align:start position:0%
just a different set of rules but
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
they're both licensed schools different
 
01:19:30.110 --> 01:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
set of rules they're both licensed care
 
01:19:32.630 --> 01:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
facilities one is specifically an
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility and that's what
 
01:19:36.169 --> 01:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
this bill is about
 
01:19:38.930 --> 01:19:38.940 align:start position:0%
um that right now for a small facility
 
01:19:41.090 --> 01:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
to exist in New Hampshire if you get
 
01:19:43.610 --> 01:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
paid the Medicare rate it's just not
 
01:19:44.930 --> 01:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
enough because you don't know what
 
01:19:46.130 --> 01:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
you're going to get in matching Social
 
01:19:48.649 --> 01:19:48.659 align:start position:0%
Security funds or matching funds from
 
01:19:52.130 --> 01:19:52.140 align:start position:0%
their retirement if they had one and
 
01:19:54.169 --> 01:19:54.179 align:start position:0%
this bill not only will help this very
 
01:19:56.090 --> 01:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
limited number of facilities but I want
 
01:19:57.290 --> 01:19:57.300 align:start position:0%
to point out it's really going to help
 
01:20:00.410 --> 01:20:00.420 align:start position:0%
patients in the facility if you end up
 
01:20:02.689 --> 01:20:02.699 align:start position:0%
and I look around this room no reference
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
to the earlier comments but if you're
 
01:20:07.370 --> 01:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
nearing that time frame where you might
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
be in an assisted living facility you
 
01:20:11.209 --> 01:20:11.219 align:start position:0%
might want to support this bill because
 
01:20:13.850 --> 01:20:13.860 align:start position:0%
what this bill would do is if you're not
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
quite out of you know you're still
 
01:20:17.810 --> 01:20:17.820 align:start position:0%
driving maybe you can still self-shower
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
there's rules that that you have to be
 
01:20:20.750 --> 01:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
able to do to be in one of these
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
facilities so if you're in that
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
situation you can only keep 72 dollars a
 
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:27.950 align:start position:0%
situation you can only keep 72 dollars a
month

01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:20:30.290 --> 01:20:30.300 align:start position:0%
so if it costs 4 500 a month to be in
 
01:20:31.370 --> 01:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
one of these facilities one of the
 
01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
cheapest rates in the state
 
01:20:36.229 --> 01:20:36.239 align:start position:0%
and your Social Security is only seven
 
01:20:37.729 --> 01:20:37.739 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
that's not going to even be the average
 
01:20:40.970 --> 01:20:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's not going to get you to 4 500 so
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
I'm going to get you close with the
 
01:20:44.810 --> 01:20:44.820 align:start position:0%
current rate of 59 a month
 
01:20:47.030 --> 01:20:47.040 align:start position:0%
matter of fact if you increase the rate
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
to 115 dollars a day it only gets you to
 
01:20:52.370 --> 01:20:52.380 align:start position:0%
3 200 from the Medicare reimbursement
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
rate and then you're still going to
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
probably have to pay on average it's
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
about eight hundred dollars and when
 
01:20:59.570 --> 01:20:59.580 align:start position:0%
they accept a client they don't get to
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
know what their social security is they
 
01:21:03.890 --> 01:21:03.900 align:start position:0%
don't get to know what their retirement
 
01:21:06.350 --> 01:21:06.360 align:start position:0%
money might may or may not be so here
 
01:21:07.790 --> 01:21:07.800 align:start position:0%
they have these people in desperate need
 
01:21:09.470 --> 01:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
that a lot of times are homeless this
 
01:21:12.110 --> 01:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
bill will address head on the elderly
 
01:21:14.030 --> 01:21:14.040 align:start position:0%
homelessness population in a very
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
positive way by providing beds for these
 
01:21:18.649 --> 01:21:18.659 align:start position:0%
people that are high functioning enough
 
01:21:19.850 --> 01:21:19.860 align:start position:0%
that they can almost take care of
 
01:21:21.950 --> 01:21:21.960 align:start position:0%
themselves but not quite
 
01:21:23.330 --> 01:21:23.340 align:start position:0%
and when they're faced with the decision
 
01:21:25.370 --> 01:21:25.380 align:start position:0%
of moving into a facility and know that
 
01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
the only funds they're going to have
 
01:21:28.310 --> 01:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
available to them is 72 dollars a month
 
01:21:29.870 --> 01:21:29.880 align:start position:0%
that's a problem
 
01:21:32.570 --> 01:21:32.580 align:start position:0%
so if you increase it to 115 someone
 
01:21:34.070 --> 01:21:34.080 align:start position:0%
who's making more than a thousand
 
01:21:36.110 --> 01:21:36.120 align:start position:0%
dollars a month in their retirement or
 
01:21:37.430 --> 01:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
more than a thousand dollars a month in
 
01:21:38.810 --> 01:21:38.820 align:start position:0%
their social security or whatever those
 
01:21:40.910 --> 01:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
different levels of income is they'd be
 
01:21:42.110 --> 01:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
able to keep that money over the
 
01:21:44.750 --> 01:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars not just the 72 bucks
 
01:21:46.910 --> 01:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
so this bill is important not just for
 
01:21:48.910 --> 01:21:48.920 align:start position:0%
the facilities but for this population
 
01:21:52.189 --> 01:21:52.199 align:start position:0%
try living on 72 dollars a month
 
01:21:54.709 --> 01:21:54.719 align:start position:0%
I know I'm happy that my mother is a
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
client in this facility
 
01:21:58.130 --> 01:21:58.140 align:start position:0%
um and I'm probably not supposed to say
 
01:22:00.110 --> 01:22:00.120 align:start position:0%
and I give her 200 you know I give her
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
money because she can't live on 72
 
01:22:03.770 --> 01:22:03.780 align:start position:0%
dollars a month and if she didn't have
 
01:22:06.229 --> 01:22:06.239 align:start position:0%
me as her son that's what the state
 
01:22:08.930 --> 01:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
requires her to do so that's one of the
 
01:22:10.250 --> 01:22:10.260 align:start position:0%
biggest problems I want to help these
 
01:22:12.709 --> 01:22:12.719 align:start position:0%
individuals I want to make sure that if
 
01:22:14.630 --> 01:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
if you understand if you're a person who
 
01:22:16.550 --> 01:22:16.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a payee and we made the
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
mistake early on we accepted some
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
clients who didn't have a state payee
 
01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:21.900 align:start position:0%
okay if you don't have a state payee and
 
01:22:23.209 --> 01:22:23.219 align:start position:0%
someone's getting a thousand bucks a
 
01:22:24.770 --> 01:22:24.780 align:start position:0%
month and they're being told they got to
 
01:22:29.810 --> 01:22:29.820 align:start position:0%
give you 918 of that money good luck
 
01:22:31.310 --> 01:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
I mean desperate people do desperate
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
things so then all of a sudden all we're
 
01:22:34.910 --> 01:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
getting is this reduced Medicare rate
 
01:22:38.090 --> 01:22:38.100 align:start position:0%
and we have a 72 year old borderline
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
homeless person in our facility paying a
 
01:22:43.550 --> 01:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
third of the money they should be paying
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
it's a problem and it will bankrupt
 
01:22:47.990 --> 01:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
these smaller facilities and I would say
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
to you that the data I'd like you to
 
01:22:51.770 --> 01:22:51.780 align:start position:0%
look at is what where the 804 license
 
01:22:54.709 --> 01:22:54.719 align:start position:0%
facilities post covid what are the 804
 
01:22:57.050 --> 01:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
license facility after covid
 
01:22:58.990 --> 01:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie from Farmington
 
01:23:01.490 --> 01:23:01.500 align:start position:0%
Horgan from Farmington we have a place
 
01:23:03.229 --> 01:23:03.239 align:start position:0%
called Hattie's place that was
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
demolished turned back on they were
 
01:23:07.729 --> 01:23:07.739 align:start position:0%
trying to get an 804 license three years
 
01:23:09.530 --> 01:23:09.540 align:start position:0%
ago when we were trying to get the 804
 
01:23:12.050 --> 01:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
license and the state repeatedly wanted
 
01:23:15.050 --> 01:23:15.060 align:start position:0%
them to be to an assisted care license
 
01:23:18.350 --> 01:23:18.360 align:start position:0%
criteria to the 805 or that and they
 
01:23:20.930 --> 01:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
claimed it was a miscommunication I
 
01:23:22.550 --> 01:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
would boldly say that the state would
 
01:23:24.649 --> 01:23:24.659 align:start position:0%
rather have Continuum of Care facilities
 
01:23:26.810 --> 01:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
and that's fine if that's their policy
 
01:23:29.630 --> 01:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
change the law right now the law is
 
01:23:32.149 --> 01:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
licensed for 804 facilities and they
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
serve a vital and important role for
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
assisted living and there's a lot of
 
01:23:38.090 --> 01:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
people that will be in that level of
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
care for a long period of time the
 
01:23:42.410 --> 01:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
public policy problem is when they
 
01:23:44.510 --> 01:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
transition to a nursing home there's a
 
01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
transition that has to happen that's a
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
negative I can't disagree with that if
 
01:23:49.790 --> 01:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
you're in a facility that does every
 
01:23:52.010 --> 01:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
level of care you can stay in that
 
01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
facility but you're really not you're
 
01:23:55.010 --> 01:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
moving to a different section or you
 
01:23:56.450 --> 01:23:56.460 align:start position:0%
move into a different thing and my last
 
01:23:59.390 --> 01:23:59.400 align:start position:0%
point that I'll make is that that this
 
01:24:01.070 --> 01:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
bill favors small businesses
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
entrepreneurs like us from New Hampshire
 
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
it supports the North Country it
 
01:24:08.149 --> 01:24:08.159 align:start position:0%
supports entrepreneurs opening up small
 
01:24:10.970 --> 01:24:10.980 align:start position:0%
businesses and instead we have higher
 
01:24:13.250 --> 01:24:13.260 align:start position:0%
levels of pay for facilities that are
 
01:24:15.470 --> 01:24:15.480 align:start position:0%
owned by hedge funds or large companies
 
01:24:17.450 --> 01:24:17.460 align:start position:0%
and I think in New Hampshire being a
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
small state with a lot of small
 
01:24:21.169 --> 01:24:21.179 align:start position:0%
businesses being the backbone of our
 
01:24:23.810 --> 01:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
economy and our employment whenever the
 
01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
and I know this is a fiscal committee
 
01:24:27.890 --> 01:24:27.900 align:start position:0%
but whenever there's a an opportunity to
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
fiscally support small businesses we
 
01:24:31.430 --> 01:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
should lean heavily in that direction
 
01:24:34.130 --> 01:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
because it's very important that we have
 
01:24:36.110 --> 01:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
more of these small businesses because I
 
01:24:37.370 --> 01:24:37.380 align:start position:0%
hope that's my sister will tell you
 
01:24:40.030 --> 01:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
briefly I know I talk too much I'm sorry
 
01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we are able to provide a level of
 
01:24:43.850 --> 01:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
care that you're not going to get in a
 
01:24:45.709 --> 01:24:45.719 align:start position:0%
hunter bed facility we're able to
 
01:24:49.010 --> 01:24:49.020 align:start position:0%
provide a level of care that it's her my
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
sister Elaine in the kitchen my sister
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
Sharon who's an RN and my mom doing
 
01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
activities while she's living there it's
 
01:24:56.930 --> 01:24:56.940 align:start position:0%
a wonderful facility and when we looked
 
01:24:59.209 --> 01:24:59.219 align:start position:0%
at all the facilities of buying an
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
existing location I saw a lot of
 
01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
family-run small businesses that these
 
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:05.219 align:start position:0%
people were connected in the lives of
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
their clients and they and and quite
 
01:25:10.070 --> 01:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
frankly I'm being asked to subsidize 11
 
01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:14.040 align:start position:0%
people in uh Charlestown New Hampshire
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
and I do that because one of them is my
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
mother but I I if we don't have a
 
01:25:22.130 --> 01:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
fiscally reasonable payment plan 58
 
01:25:24.950 --> 01:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
dollars isn't it 115 is a reasonable
 
01:25:26.930 --> 01:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
plan where maybe the people get to keep
 
01:25:28.669 --> 01:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
a little bit of their money maybe we can
 
01:25:30.649 --> 01:25:30.659 align:start position:0%
have a profitable business model and
 
01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we can you know not continue to go
 
01:25:35.930 --> 01:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
into debt but to pay down debt and with
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
that I'll let my sister answer any
 
01:25:39.649 --> 01:25:39.659 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have about the
 
01:25:41.750 --> 01:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
day-to-days of the facility and and how
 
01:25:43.010 --> 01:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
important this would be to improve the
 
01:25:44.750 --> 01:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
lives of their clients there
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
I think I kept track between what you
 
01:25:48.890 --> 01:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
were talking about monthly payments and
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
daily payments but you seem to use
 
01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:53.159 align:start position:0%
monthly for all of them but I have it
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
all written out and have turned a copy
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
over to your LBA staff very good
 
01:25:58.250 --> 01:25:58.260 align:start position:0%
questions from the committee members
 
01:26:01.250 --> 01:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards thank you Mr
 
01:26:04.250 --> 01:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
chair I for the sake of the question
 
01:26:06.229 --> 01:26:06.239 align:start position:0%
just assume that everything you said
 
01:26:09.290 --> 01:26:09.300 align:start position:0%
sounds good to me uh this is strictly a
 
01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
process question do you do you do you
 
01:26:15.169 --> 01:26:15.179 align:start position:0%
have somebody in working for a DHHS like
 
01:26:17.990 --> 01:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
for Henry lippman or somebody we're
 
01:26:19.970 --> 01:26:19.980 align:start position:0%
we're one we're less than one week away
 
01:26:23.810 --> 01:26:23.820 align:start position:0%
from having uh the budget provided to us
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
to start working on and this this is one
 
01:26:30.169 --> 01:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
issue of multiple issues that we have to
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
deal with in Medicaid and so rather than
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
dealing with this as a separate bill I'm
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
just asking you if you have support in
 
01:26:41.090 --> 01:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
the department to where we could just
 
01:26:44.149 --> 01:26:44.159 align:start position:0%
roll this into our budget process and
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
take a look at all all of the moving
 
01:26:49.810 --> 01:26:49.820 align:start position:0%
parts and not just one piece at a time
 
01:26:52.129 --> 01:26:52.139 align:start position:0%
I hope that I have support of the
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
department I think it's a good idea and
 
01:26:55.490 --> 01:26:55.500 align:start position:0%
I think but do you know I'm not talking
 
01:26:58.010 --> 01:26:58.020 align:start position:0%
about Hope unfortunately not being
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
connected in here every day like you are
 
01:27:01.370 --> 01:27:01.380 align:start position:0%
I do not have a relationship with DHS
 
01:27:02.750 --> 01:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
and I don't know what their position is
 
01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:04.560 align:start position:0%
on the bill but I'd be happy to meet
 
01:27:06.290 --> 01:27:06.300 align:start position:0%
with them get back to you before the
 
01:27:08.570 --> 01:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
work session and I'd also just to answer
 
01:27:09.410 --> 01:27:09.420 align:start position:0%
what I think is your question
 
01:27:11.149 --> 01:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards if you want to
 
01:27:12.770 --> 01:27:12.780 align:start position:0%
handle this as part of the budget and
 
01:27:14.689 --> 01:27:14.699 align:start position:0%
honest a separate bill and I know that
 
01:27:16.010 --> 01:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
this committee is going to look at those
 
01:27:18.410 --> 01:27:18.420 align:start position:0%
rate pays for 804 and put it in the
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
budget however we skin the cat I'm fine
 
01:27:22.430 --> 01:27:22.440 align:start position:0%
with that as long as we accomplish
 
01:27:25.250 --> 01:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
getting 804 facilities a reasonable pay
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
58 isn't it so if you want to put that
 
01:27:29.510 --> 01:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
in the budget I would welcome that I
 
01:27:30.770 --> 01:27:30.780 align:start position:0%
don't think that we need a separate bill
 
01:27:32.930 --> 01:27:32.940 align:start position:0%
I just think we need to accomplish the
 
01:27:35.570 --> 01:27:35.580 align:start position:0%
additional payment level
 
01:27:37.490 --> 01:27:37.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you Mr
 
01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.629 align:start position:0%
thank you for the answer thank you Mr
chair

01:27:41.629 --> 01:27:41.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:44.629 --> 01:27:44.639 align:start position:0%
representative for a question
 
01:27:46.310 --> 01:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
01:27:50.270 --> 01:27:50.280 align:start position:0%
two quick questions do you have any idea
 
01:27:52.729 --> 01:27:52.739 align:start position:0%
how many 804 facilities there are on the
 
01:27:54.770 --> 01:27:54.780 align:start position:0%
state and how many total beds do they
 
01:27:56.810 --> 01:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
contain actually what I know is that
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
seven have closed in the last couple of
 
01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:00.470 align:start position:0%
seven have closed in the last couple of
years

01:28:00.470 --> 01:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:28:02.330 --> 01:28:02.340 align:start position:0%
um those were all small businesses
 
01:28:05.090 --> 01:28:05.100 align:start position:0%
Hattie's Place horseshoe Pines Freedom
 
01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:07.310 align:start position:0%
Hattie's Place horseshoe Pines Freedom
Manor

01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
Manor
 
01:28:10.729 --> 01:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
um it's it's been a steady role of
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
places not being able to make it
 
01:28:15.169 --> 01:28:15.179 align:start position:0%
financially between trying to pay their
 
01:28:17.330 --> 01:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
staff a living wage
 
01:28:19.970 --> 01:28:19.980 align:start position:0%
um we raised our wage to 15 an hour in
 
01:28:22.729 --> 01:28:22.739 align:start position:0%
November of 21 and thanks to a state
 
01:28:24.290 --> 01:28:24.300 align:start position:0%
Grant we're able to maintain that
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
throughout this year and give our
 
01:28:28.550 --> 01:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
employees a small you know Christmas
 
01:28:31.610 --> 01:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
bonus that they really appreciated
 
01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:32.930 align:start position:0%
bonus that they really appreciated
but

01:28:32.930 --> 01:28:32.940 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:28:35.209 --> 01:28:35.219 align:start position:0%
the 15 an hour in Sullivan County
 
01:28:37.669 --> 01:28:37.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't get you an apartment on your own
 
01:28:39.590 --> 01:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know if they're not a two income
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
family in New Hampshire they have a
 
01:28:44.570 --> 01:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
problem with housing we have lost people
 
01:28:48.110 --> 01:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
to South Carolina because of the housing
 
01:28:52.490 --> 01:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
rates in here and pay the wage situation
 
01:28:55.250 --> 01:28:55.260 align:start position:0%
um so we really really need to be able
 
01:28:58.070 --> 01:28:58.080 align:start position:0%
to increase our wages increase our staff
 
01:29:00.110 --> 01:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
right now we're running at nine beds
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
because adding two more people in which
 
01:29:05.450 --> 01:29:05.460 align:start position:0%
we'd love to do puts us at a staffing
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
level that we can't support
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
um the 515 an hour would allow us to add
 
01:29:15.050 --> 01:29:15.060 align:start position:0%
two more Medicaid beds would allow us to
 
01:29:16.490 --> 01:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
add staff to
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
apply that support we do have people
 
01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:20.699 align:start position:0%
that as mentioned shower
 
01:29:23.629 --> 01:29:23.639 align:start position:0%
independently still drive their cars but
 
01:29:25.310 --> 01:29:25.320 align:start position:0%
we also have people that are full help
 
01:29:28.010 --> 01:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
they don't get their socks on by
 
01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:29.149 align:start position:0%
they don't get their socks on by
themselves

01:29:29.149 --> 01:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
we use both the underserved senior adult
 
01:29:33.950 --> 01:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
population and we have mental health
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
members in our facility we used the
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
program that the state ran two years ago
 
01:29:42.530 --> 01:29:42.540 align:start position:0%
for moving elderly patients from New
 
01:29:45.290 --> 01:29:45.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire hospital and Glencliff into
 
01:29:47.209 --> 01:29:47.219 align:start position:0%
appropriate Assisted Living prop
 
01:29:50.090 --> 01:29:50.100 align:start position:0%
population house homes so that they
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
could have the least restrictive
 
01:29:54.530 --> 01:29:54.540 align:start position:0%
environment one of them it's worked out
 
01:29:56.810 --> 01:29:56.820 align:start position:0%
beautifully Another one not so much
 
01:29:59.950 --> 01:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
but we're struggling along with her and
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
that bonus that was given to us and the
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
pay rate that was given to us for that
 
01:30:10.070 --> 01:30:10.080 align:start position:0%
year were both godsends that program did
 
01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
a great support for us it's over now and
 
01:30:15.050 --> 01:30:15.060 align:start position:0%
we're back to trying to live on our
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
budget and 58.66 a day is a budget
 
01:30:20.990 --> 01:30:21.000 align:start position:0%
number that
 
01:30:23.570 --> 01:30:23.580 align:start position:0%
is really difficult to support
 
01:30:25.910 --> 01:30:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it is 74 by the way but they get to
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
keep but that's not enough to buy our
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
One smoker a carton of cigarettes on any
 
01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
given month
 
01:30:33.709 --> 01:30:33.719 align:start position:0%
um we end up supplementing his smoking
 
01:30:36.890 --> 01:30:36.900 align:start position:0%
habit but you know we like to keep him
 
01:30:39.709 --> 01:30:39.719 align:start position:0%
happy oops outside did we just testify
 
01:30:41.750 --> 01:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
we encourage smoking in the elderly yeah
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
yeah he's been smoking for 60 years 60
 
01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
years the chances of our breaking it
 
01:30:49.790 --> 01:30:49.800 align:start position:0%
aren't good we do get him routine chest
 
01:30:51.530 --> 01:30:51.540 align:start position:0%
x-rays and make sure he's not doing any
 
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
damage so far so good he'll be 80 in a
 
01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:54.770 align:start position:0%
damage so far so good he'll be 80 in a
year

01:30:54.770 --> 01:30:54.780 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:30:56.209 --> 01:30:56.219 align:start position:0%
you know it's not a point that we're
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
going to take away from him at this
 
01:31:00.169 --> 01:31:00.179 align:start position:0%
point we because we're a small facility
 
01:31:03.110 --> 01:31:03.120 align:start position:0%
we can individualize the person that
 
01:31:05.390 --> 01:31:05.400 align:start position:0%
likes to go to museums can go to museums
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
the people that like to go to the Animal
 
01:31:10.610 --> 01:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
Farm can go to the Animal Farm we want
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
to support their individual growth their
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
activities of daily living and their
 
01:31:17.330 --> 01:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
enjoyment of life
 
01:31:19.310 --> 01:31:19.320 align:start position:0%
excellent uh representative I'll take a
 
01:31:20.870 --> 01:31:20.880 align:start position:0%
crack at answering your question I did
 
01:31:23.570 --> 01:31:23.580 align:start position:0%
go over with representative Horgan to
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
um legislative research and I asked them
 
01:31:27.649 --> 01:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
specifically how many 804 facilities we
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
have how many beds we have in it and I
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
asked them how many 805 facilities we
 
01:31:32.990 --> 01:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
had and how many beds we had in it so
 
01:31:35.330 --> 01:31:35.340 align:start position:0%
the committee would be able to see the
 
01:31:36.470 --> 01:31:36.480 align:start position:0%
difference in the type of facilities
 
01:31:38.270 --> 01:31:38.280 align:start position:0%
that are out there but I think Ann did
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
an excellent job of saying we know of
 
01:31:41.570 --> 01:31:41.580 align:start position:0%
seven facilities that have closed as a
 
01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
result of the disparity in the payment
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
system from the state and if if they're
 
01:31:48.110 --> 01:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
getting 95 a day I think we should get
 
01:31:51.950 --> 01:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
20 more because we provide more services
 
01:31:54.649 --> 01:31:54.659 align:start position:0%
do you have that number yeah uh the
 
01:31:56.330 --> 01:31:56.340 align:start position:0%
research has not provided that to me yet
 
01:31:58.070 --> 01:31:58.080 align:start position:0%
but I think we can have it by your work
 
01:32:00.050 --> 01:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
session this afternoon
 
01:32:04.189 --> 01:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:04.199 --> 01:32:06.590 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:32:06.590 --> 01:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:32:08.270 --> 01:32:08.280 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
Papa Vichy Miller thank you Mr chair and
 
01:32:12.890 --> 01:32:12.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking the question
 
01:32:15.350 --> 01:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
I heard your testimony that basically
 
01:32:17.689 --> 01:32:17.699 align:start position:0%
the you know lower investment rate is a
 
01:32:20.390 --> 01:32:20.400 align:start position:0%
continuous Financial challenge but you
 
01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
mentioned a lot of closings during the
 
01:32:24.470 --> 01:32:24.480 align:start position:0%
last couple of years and we are all very
 
01:32:26.510 --> 01:32:26.520 align:start position:0%
aware of the huge impact that was added
 
01:32:29.209 --> 01:32:29.219 align:start position:0%
by covid and all those challenges
 
01:32:32.209 --> 01:32:32.219 align:start position:0%
can you get us an idea of you know were
 
01:32:34.790 --> 01:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
those businesses that may have been
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
maybe barely viable without kovid and
 
01:32:39.950 --> 01:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
kovid put them under or is this you know
 
01:32:41.570 --> 01:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
have you seen stuff like this happening
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
before covet hit I I just need to you
 
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
know understand a little bit how to
 
01:32:47.990 --> 01:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
separate those two if you can offer any
 
01:32:49.370 --> 01:32:49.380 align:start position:0%
information to that I know it's a
 
01:32:51.229 --> 01:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
complicated question it is complicated
 
01:32:53.810 --> 01:32:53.820 align:start position:0%
and covet hasn't helped because it has
 
01:32:56.510 --> 01:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
decreased our available Staffing and
 
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
that has been an ongoing problem for all
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
804s because they make less money they
 
01:33:03.229 --> 01:33:03.239 align:start position:0%
pay less wages but covet wasn't
 
01:33:05.990 --> 01:33:06.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily the death now of any of
 
01:33:08.689 --> 01:33:08.699 align:start position:0%
those places aging out and not having
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
people to take over the business uh you
 
01:33:13.669 --> 01:33:13.679 align:start position:0%
know the ownership aging out
 
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
um these were all small family-run
 
01:33:19.510 --> 01:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
operations privately owned they weren't
 
01:33:22.010 --> 01:33:22.020 align:start position:0%
conglomerates like some of the other
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
places some of the larger places are
 
01:33:26.990 --> 01:33:27.000 align:start position:0%
they were small business owners and
 
01:33:29.810 --> 01:33:29.820 align:start position:0%
without the support of the state they
 
01:33:32.270 --> 01:33:32.280 align:start position:0%
were running on too thin and Edge to
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
survive covet and at the 58.60 cents
 
01:33:38.330 --> 01:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
point mark
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
it's incredible I mean we are one of the
 
01:33:42.649 --> 01:33:42.659 align:start position:0%
more reasonably priced assisted livings
 
01:33:45.290 --> 01:33:45.300 align:start position:0%
in the area has told to me by members
 
01:33:48.470 --> 01:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
that have been looking for housing we do
 
01:33:50.870 --> 01:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
take patients with challenges that are
 
01:33:54.590 --> 01:33:54.600 align:start position:0%
slightly Beyond 804 level of care in
 
01:33:58.129 --> 01:33:58.139 align:start position:0%
only because we have staff capable of
 
01:34:00.110 --> 01:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
supporting those members with their
 
01:34:02.149 --> 01:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
mental health needs we do a lot of
 
01:34:02.159 --> 01:34:04.090 align:start position:0%
mental health needs we do a lot of
transportation

01:34:04.090 --> 01:34:04.100 align:start position:0%
transportation
 
01:34:07.250 --> 01:34:07.260 align:start position:0%
and most places don't they use the
 
01:34:09.530 --> 01:34:09.540 align:start position:0%
transportation service companies which
 
01:34:12.110 --> 01:34:12.120 align:start position:0%
our members aren't capable of doing on
 
01:34:14.330 --> 01:34:14.340 align:start position:0%
their own I mean it's like putting your
 
01:34:16.850 --> 01:34:16.860 align:start position:0%
mother in a taxi cab to Boston you
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.950 --> 01:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
definitely not my late mother was in
 
01:34:24.169 --> 01:34:24.179 align:start position:0%
Romania but no seriously I really want
 
01:34:25.729 --> 01:34:25.739 align:start position:0%
to thank you for a very insightful
 
01:34:27.410 --> 01:34:27.420 align:start position:0%
answer and for sharing your perspective
 
01:34:29.870 --> 01:34:29.880 align:start position:0%
I find it very very valuable because you
 
01:34:31.669 --> 01:34:31.679 align:start position:0%
know I'm a freshman I'm learning a lot
 
01:34:33.770 --> 01:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
so thank you for contributing to that
 
01:34:33.780 --> 01:34:35.930 align:start position:0%
so thank you for contributing to that
thanks

01:34:35.930 --> 01:34:35.940 align:start position:0%
thanks
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:42.290 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:34:42.290 --> 01:34:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.990 --> 01:34:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman representative
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
Stringham I want to make sure I
 
01:34:49.970 --> 01:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
understand your bill as amended
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
um the uh as revised the special rate
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
would would apply only to 804 registered
 
01:35:01.370 --> 01:35:01.380 align:start position:0%
and also be restricted to those who have
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
a greater than 50 percent
 
01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
Medicaid occupancy so in your case if
 
01:35:10.669 --> 01:35:10.679 align:start position:0%
you have you have I think 11 beds in um
 
01:35:13.250 --> 01:35:13.260 align:start position:0%
in your facility if five or fewer of
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
them were Medicaid uh as proposed it
 
01:35:19.430 --> 01:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
would revert to the existing rate
 
01:35:22.189 --> 01:35:22.199 align:start position:0%
um and just just to kind of get an idea
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
if if instead of uh providing this in
 
01:35:27.890 --> 01:35:27.900 align:start position:0%
terms of an increased uh per diem rate
 
01:35:29.570 --> 01:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
if it was just a straight Grant if
 
01:35:33.050 --> 01:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
you're looking at uh uh six people a day
 
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:35.760 align:start position:0%
for it for a year and an extra 60 bucks
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
it's about a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:35:40.310 --> 01:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars a year for year one facility
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
do those numbers are they in line with
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
um kind of what you're you're here
 
01:35:48.290 --> 01:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
asking for today yes sir
 
01:35:52.610 --> 01:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
um the 50 Mark is to try and encourage
 
01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
additional Medicaid bed rates because
 
01:35:56.570 --> 01:35:56.580 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:35:59.450 --> 01:35:59.460 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid bed rate of some of the
 
01:36:01.250 --> 01:36:01.260 align:start position:0%
privately owned facilities can be
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 10 to zero they have a
 
01:36:06.229 --> 01:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
choice they don't have to take
 
01:36:08.990 --> 01:36:09.000 align:start position:0%
especially private facilities don't have
 
01:36:11.270 --> 01:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
to take a Medicaid bed rate if they
 
01:36:14.090 --> 01:36:14.100 align:start position:0%
don't have a bed available at the time
 
01:36:17.149 --> 01:36:17.159 align:start position:0%
and I want to encourage those kind of
 
01:36:18.890 --> 01:36:18.900 align:start position:0%
places the the
 
01:36:22.310 --> 01:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
804 section of a larger Continuum home
 
01:36:24.229 --> 01:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
first per se
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
to take that 50 of Medicaid bed rates
 
01:36:30.290 --> 01:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
just to get
 
01:36:32.149 --> 01:36:32.159 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
seniors that are living in homeless
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
shelters that comes automatically to
 
01:36:37.370 --> 01:36:37.380 align:start position:0%
mind because we're taking someone from a
 
01:36:39.830 --> 01:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter this week
 
01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
homeless shelter this week
um

01:36:40.550 --> 01:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
because the encouragement of and the
 
01:36:46.490 --> 01:36:46.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity for small business owners to
 
01:36:49.129 --> 01:36:49.139 align:start position:0%
open more of these facilities is there
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
and is viable at 115 a night
 
01:36:54.649 --> 01:36:54.659 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a crack at answering
 
01:36:54.659 --> 01:36:55.430 align:start position:0%
I'd like to take a crack at answering
that

01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:36:56.990 --> 01:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
um that is definitely the original
 
01:36:59.270 --> 01:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill was that you'd have
 
01:37:01.790 --> 01:37:01.800 align:start position:0%
this critical level I would submit to
 
01:37:03.350 --> 01:37:03.360 align:start position:0%
the committee that if you're going to
 
01:37:04.669 --> 01:37:04.679 align:start position:0%
look at the amendment that we're
 
01:37:07.490 --> 01:37:07.500 align:start position:0%
writting writing I did simplify it to
 
01:37:09.830 --> 01:37:09.840 align:start position:0%
just be an 804 facility the original
 
01:37:13.070 --> 01:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
reason I said 50 is because these bigger
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
facilities can have one or two Medicare
 
01:37:17.090 --> 01:37:17.100 align:start position:0%
beds and I didn't know if there was a
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to do that and
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
they're able to average that lower cost
 
01:37:24.590 --> 01:37:24.600 align:start position:0%
out over 100 beds so originally the 50
 
01:37:26.330 --> 01:37:26.340 align:start position:0%
was the idea that if you're a small
 
01:37:28.610 --> 01:37:28.620 align:start position:0%
facility it's kind of like if you're a
 
01:37:29.570 --> 01:37:29.580 align:start position:0%
private care facility and you're
 
01:37:31.129 --> 01:37:31.139 align:start position:0%
charging nine thousand dollars a month
 
01:37:32.689 --> 01:37:32.699 align:start position:0%
it's just a different facility that's
 
01:37:34.189 --> 01:37:34.199 align:start position:0%
charging forty five hundred dollars a
 
01:37:35.870 --> 01:37:35.880 align:start position:0%
month it's just a different type of
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
arrangement and that social economic
 
01:37:41.390 --> 01:37:41.400 align:start position:0%
payment class usually doesn't mix but I
 
01:37:42.590 --> 01:37:42.600 align:start position:0%
would say to you that if you're going to
 
01:37:44.990 --> 01:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
narrow it with the amendment I I believe
 
01:37:47.209 --> 01:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
the bill only addressed 804 facilities
 
01:37:48.350 --> 01:37:48.360 align:start position:0%
because it said assisted living
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
facilities up to 16 Beds which is
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
definitionally what a NATO force
 
01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:54.659 align:start position:0%
facility is so I don't think there's any
 
01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:56.699 align:start position:0%
change in what the intent or what we
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
filed it just makes it clarify that it's
 
01:38:01.070 --> 01:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
an 804 and in the amendment the way we
 
01:38:04.430 --> 01:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
drafted it it left out the 50 stuff and
 
01:38:06.770 --> 01:38:06.780 align:start position:0%
again we live in this fluid world so
 
01:38:09.169 --> 01:38:09.179 align:start position:0%
it's like what's better the 50 criteria
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
or if you pay 804 facilities that accept
 
01:38:14.750 --> 01:38:14.760 align:start position:0%
a Medicare bed and they said well I
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to accept any but if I get
 
01:38:19.010 --> 01:38:19.020 align:start position:0%
this right I'll accept one or two or
 
01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
three I would say to you that that might
 
01:38:23.629 --> 01:38:23.639 align:start position:0%
be better than the 50 criteria I don't
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
know which which would drive up more
 
01:38:27.950 --> 01:38:27.960 align:start position:0%
beds and I would say to you that if you
 
01:38:31.010 --> 01:38:31.020 align:start position:0%
limit it to 804 it eliminates the huge
 
01:38:33.229 --> 01:38:33.239 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact and I would submit to you
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
that if you pass this bill that the
 
01:38:37.669 --> 01:38:37.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact is so minor it's not going
 
01:38:39.950 --> 01:38:39.960 align:start position:0%
to throw off the whole state budget or
 
01:38:41.990 --> 01:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps even be anything that we'd have
 
01:38:44.270 --> 01:38:44.280 align:start position:0%
to really consider us a big issue in the
 
01:38:46.910 --> 01:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
budget because it's limited to the 804
 
01:38:48.950 --> 01:38:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then if it's limited to whether it's
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
one bed or fifty percent of the beds it
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't make a big difference But to
 
01:38:56.390 --> 01:38:56.400 align:start position:0%
answer your question five beds a year I
 
01:38:58.490 --> 01:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
think that 150 number sounds about right
 
01:39:00.709 --> 01:39:00.719 align:start position:0%
to what the impact would be on an
 
01:39:02.209 --> 01:39:02.219 align:start position:0%
individual facility that had six
 
01:39:04.010 --> 01:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
Medicare beds and that's the difference
 
01:39:06.649 --> 01:39:06.659 align:start position:0%
between us you know losing 50 Grand a
 
01:39:08.390 --> 01:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
year and maybe you know for the four
 
01:39:10.490 --> 01:39:10.500 align:start position:0%
Partners oh my gosh they might make 20
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
grand for the the economic risk and what
 
01:39:16.910 --> 01:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
we did this is not it is a money making
 
01:39:18.229 --> 01:39:18.239 align:start position:0%
proposition and I believe in the
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
for-profit business but my sisters are
 
01:39:23.510 --> 01:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
Saints they're Saints with what they do
 
01:39:25.189 --> 01:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
every day
 
01:39:27.350 --> 01:39:27.360 align:start position:0%
um I was a landlord for 25 years I can't
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
imagine the level of care that they're
 
01:39:31.790 --> 01:39:31.800 align:start position:0%
giving these individuals and I mean to
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
go up there and have a drunk 72 year old
 
01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.810 align:start position:0%
go up there and have a drunk 72 year old
man

01:39:35.810 --> 01:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
man
 
01:39:37.610 --> 01:39:37.620 align:start position:0%
assaulting your sister
 
01:39:39.470 --> 01:39:39.480 align:start position:0%
and having to deal with that
 
01:39:43.850 --> 01:39:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:48.590 --> 01:39:48.600 align:start position:0%
we um would also like to mention that uh
 
01:39:50.450 --> 01:39:50.460 align:start position:0%
my brother God bless them is using
 
01:39:52.310 --> 01:39:52.320 align:start position:0%
Medicare and Medicare Cade
 
01:39:55.450 --> 01:39:55.460 align:start position:0%
interchangeably this is a Medicaid Bill
 
01:39:58.970 --> 01:39:58.980 align:start position:0%
Medicare does not cover 804 facilities
 
01:40:01.850 --> 01:40:01.860 align:start position:0%
at in any way shape or form our clients
 
01:40:03.649 --> 01:40:03.659 align:start position:0%
do have Medicare to pay for their doctor
 
01:40:06.530 --> 01:40:06.540 align:start position:0%
bills the majority of them have Medicaid
 
01:40:10.370 --> 01:40:10.380 align:start position:0%
to cover the cost that Medicare doesn't
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
cover but Medicare will not pay for 804.
 
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:16.860 align:start position:0%

thank you Mr chair and members of the
 
01:41:27.649 --> 01:41:27.659 align:start position:0%
committee uh I'm handing out a list of
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
all of the 804 and 805 facilities which
 
01:41:32.689 --> 01:41:32.699 align:start position:0%
is a question that's come up uh we are
 
01:41:34.910 --> 01:41:34.920 align:start position:0%
here uh in support of the bill however
 
01:41:37.729 --> 01:41:37.739 align:start position:0%
we were not consulted or involved with
 
01:41:40.370 --> 01:41:40.380 align:start position:0%
the drafting uh we represent New
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Arts which is the assisted
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
living facility Assisted Living Care
 
01:41:46.850 --> 01:41:46.860 align:start position:0%
Facility Association in the state I did
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
reach out to the sponsor to try and
 
01:41:50.830 --> 01:41:50.840 align:start position:0%
coordinate I wasn't terribly successful
 
01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh but right now there are as you can
 
01:41:56.930 --> 01:41:56.940 align:start position:0%
see on the final page of the spreadsheet
 
01:41:59.090 --> 01:41:59.100 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple is handing out currently
 
01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.010 align:start position:0%
that Mr Ripple is handing out currently
there's

01:42:00.010 --> 01:42:00.020 align:start position:0%
there's
 
01:42:04.010 --> 01:42:04.020 align:start position:0%
6534 licensed beds for assisted living
 
01:42:07.669 --> 01:42:07.679 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire 65 34.
 
01:42:08.870 --> 01:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
that comes it's right on the Department
 
01:42:10.910 --> 01:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services website we
 
01:42:12.350 --> 01:42:12.360 align:start position:0%
don't have to go to house research it's
 
01:42:13.790 --> 01:42:13.800 align:start position:0%
it's right there on the web for everyone
 
01:42:15.050 --> 01:42:15.060 align:start position:0%
to see
 
01:42:20.570 --> 01:42:20.580 align:start position:0%
of those 65 34 beds only 500 of them are
 
01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:23.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid beds and that information comes
 
01:42:25.550 --> 01:42:25.560 align:start position:0%
from the Department dashboard that's
 
01:42:26.930 --> 01:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
presented to the fiscal committee
 
01:42:28.910 --> 01:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
generally every fiscal committee meeting
 
01:42:35.510 --> 01:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
so 606 6500 total beds 500 are Medicaid
 
01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
beds eligible for reimbursement under
 
01:42:40.609 --> 01:42:40.619 align:start position:0%
the CFI program I know that you're
 
01:42:43.430 --> 01:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
really behind on the uh the timing here
 
01:42:46.729 --> 01:42:46.739 align:start position:0%
so Mr Cahoon is a former owner operator
 
01:42:49.430 --> 01:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
of Friendship Manor and new web switch
 
01:42:52.070 --> 01:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
he's an expert on assisted living in the
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
CFI program he has Decades of experience
 
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to suspend uh thank
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
the sponsor for bringing it forward but
 
01:43:00.350 --> 01:43:00.360 align:start position:0%
again we didn't have anything to do with
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
the drafting or the coordination and I
 
01:43:04.310 --> 01:43:04.320 align:start position:0%
think that might have uh solved some of
 
01:43:05.570 --> 01:43:05.580 align:start position:0%
the issues that you've talked about this
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
morning and I just want to finally say
 
01:43:08.570 --> 01:43:08.580 align:start position:0%
that I completely agree with
 
01:43:10.609 --> 01:43:10.619 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards we need to look
 
01:43:12.290 --> 01:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
at all of the Medicaid rates we have
 
01:43:15.109 --> 01:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
issues with DD substance abuse mental
 
01:43:18.709 --> 01:43:18.719 align:start position:0%
health uh all of the Medicaid rates need
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
to be looked at in in this budget not
 
01:43:22.609 --> 01:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
just assisted living nursing homes
 
01:43:24.950 --> 01:43:24.960 align:start position:0%
all of the providers are under an
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
immense Healthcare Workforce crisis
 
01:43:29.149 --> 01:43:29.159 align:start position:0%
Meals on Wheels I I could go on so we
 
01:43:30.950 --> 01:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
need to look at it in the budget process
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
so whether you retain this bill however
 
01:43:35.390 --> 01:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
you want to go about it procedurally but
 
01:43:36.709 --> 01:43:36.719 align:start position:0%
we need to look at all the Medicaid
 
01:43:38.750 --> 01:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
rates going forward so I'll turn it over
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
to Mr Cohen thank you Mr chair
 
01:43:43.970 --> 01:43:43.980 align:start position:0%
thank you for the data you're welcome
 
01:43:46.310 --> 01:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh Mr chairman members of the committee
 
01:43:47.810 --> 01:43:47.820 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to address
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
you on House Bill 527.
 
01:43:52.850 --> 01:43:52.860 align:start position:0%
um my wife and I own friendship manner
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
in New Ipswich New Hampshire for uh 37
 
01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:56.450 align:start position:0%
in New Ipswich New Hampshire for uh 37
years

01:43:56.450 --> 01:43:56.460 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh we closed in May of 2022.
 
01:44:04.189 --> 01:44:04.199 align:start position:0%
largely for Workforce issues okay I if
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
you to the extent that Workforce issues
 
01:44:07.790 --> 01:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
were caused by code I suppose covet
 
01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
might have been a factor but really it
 
01:44:11.930 --> 01:44:11.940 align:start position:0%
was Workforce we simply could not hire
 
01:44:14.030 --> 01:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
enough people to keep going
 
01:44:16.970 --> 01:44:16.980 align:start position:0%
obviously part of a Workforce Solution
 
01:44:19.669 --> 01:44:19.679 align:start position:0%
would be an increased rate allowing us
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
to pay a higher rate of pay to our
 
01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.629 align:start position:0%
to pay a higher rate of pay to our
employees

01:44:23.629 --> 01:44:23.639 align:start position:0%
employees
 
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
it is I will admit it is only part of
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
the solution there are other demographic
 
01:44:30.830 --> 01:44:30.840 align:start position:0%
reasons that the workforce is in trouble
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
um but certainly making rates higher
 
01:44:34.609 --> 01:44:34.619 align:start position:0%
would help
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
um before I continue I did hand out some
 
01:44:39.669 --> 01:44:39.679 align:start position:0%
written testimony there is a typo in it
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
in the last paragraph I talk about the
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
cost of building new facilities
 
01:44:48.290 --> 01:44:48.300 align:start position:0%
and I it says 10 up to upwards of 10
 
01:44:49.790 --> 01:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars that actually should be
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.410 --> 01:44:57.420 align:start position:0%
so that's a big typo yes all right
 
01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
so that's a big typo yes all right
um

01:44:58.790 --> 01:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:58.800 --> 01:44:59.990 align:start position:0%
um
anyway

01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:45:01.370 --> 01:45:01.380 align:start position:0%
um there's no question that an increase
 
01:45:04.010 --> 01:45:04.020 align:start position:0%
in rates is needed uh and essentially
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
for two reasons the first is that
 
01:45:07.790 --> 01:45:07.800 align:start position:0%
there's a tremendous unmet need
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
and the second reason would be
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:17.030 --> 01:45:17.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to the unmet unmet need many
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
of you may be aware that the CFI budget
 
01:45:21.950 --> 01:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
if you look at that closely you're
 
01:45:25.250 --> 01:45:25.260 align:start position:0%
somewhat misleading year after year CFI
 
01:45:26.750 --> 01:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
does not expend All the Monies
 
01:45:28.490 --> 01:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
appropriated to it
 
01:45:30.770 --> 01:45:30.780 align:start position:0%
and year after year they don't fill all
 
01:45:33.050 --> 01:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
this authorized slots for clients that
 
01:45:35.090 --> 01:45:35.100 align:start position:0%
are that are authorized
 
01:45:37.790 --> 01:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
by agreement with the federal government
 
01:45:40.370 --> 01:45:40.380 align:start position:0%
this leads some people to conclude that
 
01:45:42.169 --> 01:45:42.179 align:start position:0%
this that the CFI need is therefore
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
being met that is not the case the
 
01:45:46.850 --> 01:45:46.860 align:start position:0%
reason they can't expend the funds and
 
01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:48.719 align:start position:0%
fill the slots is that the reimbursement
 
01:45:51.109 --> 01:45:51.119 align:start position:0%
rates are so low that many providers
 
01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:53.219 align:start position:0%
providers refuse to participate in the
 
01:45:53.219 --> 01:45:54.649 align:start position:0%
providers refuse to participate in the
program

01:45:54.649 --> 01:45:54.659 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.360 align:start position:0%
now CFI is the overall umbrella that
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
covers it's actually the the wafer that
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
covers Residential Care
 
01:46:04.550 --> 01:46:04.560 align:start position:0%
with Residential Care the situation is
 
01:46:06.050 --> 01:46:06.060 align:start position:0%
actually a little bit more complicated
 
01:46:08.990 --> 01:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh it's difficult to determine what the
 
01:46:11.209 --> 01:46:11.219 align:start position:0%
unmet need in residential care is
 
01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.219 align:start position:0%
compared to the whole CFI program with
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
the CFI program
 
01:46:19.070 --> 01:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
we know how many units of service were
 
01:46:22.669 --> 01:46:22.679 align:start position:0%
authorized to fill the slots that are
 
01:46:25.790 --> 01:46:25.800 align:start position:0%
that are open but we don't know how many
 
01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:28.860 align:start position:0%
units excuse me and we do know how many
 
01:46:31.189 --> 01:46:31.199 align:start position:0%
units were actually provided so the gap
 
01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:33.360 align:start position:0%
between those two is at least one
 
01:46:35.149 --> 01:46:35.159 align:start position:0%
indication of what the unmet need might
 
01:46:37.370 --> 01:46:37.380 align:start position:0%
be unfortunately in residential care
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
Residential Care isn't authorized for a
 
01:46:42.410 --> 01:46:42.420 align:start position:0%
client until the client finds a bed
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
and it's almost impossible to find a Bed
 
01:46:47.870 --> 01:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:46:49.790 --> 01:46:49.800 align:start position:0%
what what appears to be the case if you
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
look at the numbers is that virtually a
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of the approved need for
 
01:46:55.970 --> 01:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
residential care services is met but
 
01:46:58.189 --> 01:46:58.199 align:start position:0%
that's only that's because of this
 
01:47:00.530 --> 01:47:00.540 align:start position:0%
technical way in which that's it's it's
 
01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh figured
 
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
um friendship manner is was an 804 home
 
01:47:09.169 --> 01:47:09.179 align:start position:0%
um just to correct one thing that was
 
01:47:11.270 --> 01:47:11.280 align:start position:0%
said before we were not a 16-bed home we
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
had 22 beds
 
01:47:16.310 --> 01:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
804 homes are not limited to
 
01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:17.209 align:start position:0%
804 homes are not limited to
um

01:47:17.209 --> 01:47:17.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
16 beds
 
01:47:21.530 --> 01:47:21.540 align:start position:0%
many of the 804 homes were sheltered
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
care homes in the past and the sheltered
 
01:47:25.970 --> 01:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
Care Homes are limited to 25 beds but
 
01:47:27.350 --> 01:47:27.360 align:start position:0%
they were in fact shelter care homes
 
01:47:29.930 --> 01:47:29.940 align:start position:0%
that were 100 bits
 
01:47:29.940 --> 01:47:30.770 align:start position:0%
that were 100 bits
um

01:47:30.770 --> 01:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:33.950 --> 01:47:33.960 align:start position:0%
now as as to cost avoidance when
 
01:47:35.930 --> 01:47:35.940 align:start position:0%
friendship men are closed we were down
 
01:47:38.390 --> 01:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
to 18 residents we had not admitted
 
01:47:39.709 --> 01:47:39.719 align:start position:0%
residents for a couple of months because
 
01:47:42.050 --> 01:47:42.060 align:start position:0%
we knew we might be closing so instead
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
of the 20 or 21 residents we normally
 
01:47:48.169 --> 01:47:48.179 align:start position:0%
had we had 18. of those 18 11 were moved
 
01:47:49.729 --> 01:47:49.739 align:start position:0%
to nursing homes
 
01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
of those 11. only one of them actually
 
01:47:54.649 --> 01:47:54.659 align:start position:0%
needed a nursing home bed the other ten
 
01:47:56.510 --> 01:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
went to nursing homes simply because we
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't find a CFI ResCare bed
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
uh in addition there were seven
 
01:48:04.430 --> 01:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
residents who went to CFI beds
 
01:48:05.930 --> 01:48:05.940 align:start position:0%
there are two problems with this the
 
01:48:07.370 --> 01:48:07.380 align:start position:0%
first is that the state and countyous
 
01:48:08.750 --> 01:48:08.760 align:start position:0%
are spending much more for a nursing
 
01:48:10.490 --> 01:48:10.500 align:start position:0%
home bed than they would be for a sea of
 
01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
ibed and secondly this means that at
 
01:48:15.350 --> 01:48:15.360 align:start position:0%
least 10 people were denied access to a
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
nursing home bed who badly needed one
 
01:48:21.649 --> 01:48:21.659 align:start position:0%
so these are the reasons in a very brief
 
01:48:24.729 --> 01:48:24.739 align:start position:0%
synopsis why the rates have to increase
 
01:48:26.930 --> 01:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
there was a question about the number of
 
01:48:28.189 --> 01:48:28.199 align:start position:0%
homes that had closed obviously
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
Friendship Manor was one of those and
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
representative Mueller asked if there
 
01:48:33.770 --> 01:48:33.780 align:start position:0%
were if homes were closing before the
 
01:48:37.129 --> 01:48:37.139 align:start position:0%
covert epidemic and in fact there were I
 
01:48:40.609 --> 01:48:40.619 align:start position:0%
testified in the budget hearings in 2018
 
01:48:44.209 --> 01:48:44.219 align:start position:0%
about the closure of actually three
 
01:48:47.750 --> 01:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
homes just before the budget process
 
01:48:50.090 --> 01:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:52.619 align:start position:0%
Gaffney home in Rochester which had been
 
01:48:56.090 --> 01:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
in business since 1902 and the carpenter
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
home in Swansea which was a town owned
 
01:49:02.689 --> 01:49:02.699 align:start position:0%
home and had been in business since 1937
 
01:49:03.890 --> 01:49:03.900 align:start position:0%
I believe
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
and the biggest reason that homes were
 
01:49:07.790 --> 01:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
closing then and they're closing now is
 
01:49:10.189 --> 01:49:10.199 align:start position:0%
Workforce homes for the most part have
 
01:49:11.930 --> 01:49:11.940 align:start position:0%
not been able to hire sufficient staff
 
01:49:13.129 --> 01:49:13.139 align:start position:0%
and that was certainly true of
 
01:49:14.810 --> 01:49:14.820 align:start position:0%
friendship manner
 
01:49:18.649 --> 01:49:18.659 align:start position:0%
in terms of limiting the
 
01:49:22.430 --> 01:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
increase to 804 homes I would submit
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
that doesn't really make a lot of sense
 
01:49:27.590 --> 01:49:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh there are in the list that
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
um Alex has handed out uh 136 licensed
 
01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.030 align:start position:0%
um Alex has handed out uh 136 licensed
homes

01:49:32.030 --> 01:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
homes
 
01:49:36.590 --> 01:49:36.600 align:start position:0%
of those 136 licensed homes only 53 are
 
01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
are enrolled as Medicaid CFI providers
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many of those 53 are
 
01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
actually providing Services less than 53
 
01:49:48.050 --> 01:49:48.060 align:start position:0%
I can tell you that I know that a few
 
01:49:50.689 --> 01:49:50.699 align:start position:0%
years ago this number was over 80 and
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
when there were 80 enrolled providers
 
01:49:54.169 --> 01:49:54.179 align:start position:0%
about 40 were actively providing
 
01:49:55.750 --> 01:49:55.760 align:start position:0%
services so
 
01:50:00.350 --> 01:50:00.360 align:start position:0%
uh the 53 homes account for all of the
 
01:50:03.470 --> 01:50:03.480 align:start position:0%
500 beds that are currently occupied but
 
01:50:05.570 --> 01:50:05.580 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small portion of those
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
homes that are probably accounting for
 
01:50:09.290 --> 01:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
most of them
 
01:50:12.169 --> 01:50:12.179 align:start position:0%
um of the 53 homes and again this
 
01:50:13.790 --> 01:50:13.800 align:start position:0%
statistic had to do with the original
 
01:50:15.890 --> 01:50:15.900 align:start position:0%
version of the bill only 12. are they
 
01:50:18.229 --> 01:50:18.239 align:start position:0%
the ones that are shaded
 
01:50:21.050 --> 01:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
shaded as the Medicaid homes
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
that accept CFI Medicaid okay I guess
 
01:50:27.050 --> 01:50:27.060 align:start position:0%
those are the 53 then thank you they're
 
01:50:30.830 --> 01:50:30.840 align:start position:0%
53 shaded that's right okay
 
01:50:33.410 --> 01:50:33.420 align:start position:0%
uh so it doesn't really make sense if we
 
01:50:35.629 --> 01:50:35.639 align:start position:0%
if it's in the public interest uh and
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
it's good public policy to increase the
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
utilization of CFI beds and I believe
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
strongly that that is the case limiting
 
01:50:43.970 --> 01:50:43.980 align:start position:0%
it to a very small number of the
 
01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
providers doesn't really make a lot of
 
01:50:45.540 --> 01:50:46.970 align:start position:0%
providers doesn't really make a lot of
sense

01:50:46.970 --> 01:50:46.980 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
um I also would submit that the 50
 
01:50:53.330 --> 01:50:53.340 align:start position:0%
um required participation doesn't make
 
01:50:53.340 --> 01:50:54.890 align:start position:0%
um required participation doesn't make
sense

01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:50:57.370 --> 01:50:57.380 align:start position:0%
um of the
 
01:51:00.830 --> 01:51:00.840 align:start position:0%
6534 license bed and beds in the state
 
01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:02.530 align:start position:0%
6534 license bed and beds in the state
uh

01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:02.540 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:51:06.290 --> 01:51:06.300 align:start position:0%
5192 are in facilities of 50 beds or
 
01:51:06.300 --> 01:51:07.490 align:start position:0%
5192 are in facilities of 50 beds or
greater

01:51:07.490 --> 01:51:07.500 align:start position:0%
greater
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
most of those larger facilities are new
 
01:51:11.750 --> 01:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
our new facilities have been built
 
01:51:13.550 --> 01:51:13.560 align:start position:0%
within the last 10 years or so
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
and as I said there was a typo in there
 
01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:16.739 align:start position:0%
I talked about a cost of up to 10
 
01:51:18.410 --> 01:51:18.420 align:start position:0%
million dollars that was a mistake it's
 
01:51:21.109 --> 01:51:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually up to 40 million dollars
 
01:51:23.149 --> 01:51:23.159 align:start position:0%
the majority of those homes if they were
 
01:51:25.490 --> 01:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
50 medicated anything like the current
 
01:51:27.410 --> 01:51:27.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate would go bankrupt within a
 
01:51:29.149 --> 01:51:29.159 align:start position:0%
matter of six months to a year
 
01:51:32.750 --> 01:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
the the larger newer homes simply cannot
 
01:51:35.510 --> 01:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
participate fully as it were in the
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
Medicaid Program but what they can do
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
and which many of them would be willing
 
01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:42.540 align:start position:0%
to do is to continue providing services
 
01:51:44.689 --> 01:51:44.699 align:start position:0%
for people who were there but have run
 
01:51:46.070 --> 01:51:46.080 align:start position:0%
out of money
 
01:51:48.709 --> 01:51:48.719 align:start position:0%
Mrs Jones moved into
 
01:51:50.930 --> 01:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
Happy Valley Assisted Living
 
01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:53.699 align:start position:0%
six years ago with a couple hundred
 
01:51:55.490 --> 01:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in the bank she has now
 
01:51:57.050 --> 01:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
spent that money
 
01:52:00.470 --> 01:52:00.480 align:start position:0%
and right now unless the home is willing
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
to basically give her a free ride she's
 
01:52:04.850 --> 01:52:04.860 align:start position:0%
probably going to be asked to go to a
 
01:52:07.490 --> 01:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
nursing home which again might be a very
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
poor utilization of a nursing home bed
 
01:52:13.070 --> 01:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
the homes would like to be able to allow
 
01:52:16.970 --> 01:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
Mrs Jones to start to continue but they
 
01:52:19.010 --> 01:52:19.020 align:start position:0%
need a somewhat higher rate of pay
 
01:52:21.070 --> 01:52:21.080 align:start position:0%
actually considerably higher rate of pay
 
01:52:24.470 --> 01:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
to do so they also need some statutory
 
01:52:26.810 --> 01:52:26.820 align:start position:0%
and Regulatory changes
 
01:52:30.770 --> 01:52:30.780 align:start position:0%
um but that's for another time
 
01:52:32.330 --> 01:52:32.340 align:start position:0%
um the last thing I guess I would say is
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
I had a conversation yesterday
 
01:52:37.570 --> 01:52:37.580 align:start position:0%
uh with a lady who was the largest CFI
 
01:52:41.270 --> 01:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
residential care provider in the state
 
01:52:43.129 --> 01:52:43.139 align:start position:0%
um she was talking about the increases
 
01:52:45.350 --> 01:52:45.360 align:start position:0%
in costs in the last year how she's had
 
01:52:48.649 --> 01:52:48.659 align:start position:0%
to increase her starting salary from
 
01:52:52.250 --> 01:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
12.50 an hour to 16 an hour how food has
 
01:52:53.930 --> 01:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
gone constantly up
 
01:52:56.629 --> 01:52:56.639 align:start position:0%
she altogether has 72 beds three
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
facilities one of six two of 16 and one
 
01:53:00.950 --> 01:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
of 40. and what she told me yesterday
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
was if the current Trend continues for
 
01:53:04.729 --> 01:53:04.739 align:start position:0%
another year or so I will be getting out
 
01:53:05.810 --> 01:53:05.820 align:start position:0%
of the business
 
01:53:09.530 --> 01:53:09.540 align:start position:0%
and my 72 beds will go with me
 
01:53:11.450 --> 01:53:11.460 align:start position:0%
and that's it thank you for your
 
01:53:13.250 --> 01:53:13.260 align:start position:0%
patience I will be happy to try any
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
all right I see at least three
 
01:53:20.930 --> 01:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
representative papavichi Mueller then
 
01:53:21.830 --> 01:53:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards and
 
01:53:23.390 --> 01:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
representative leishman

thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:53:28.070 --> 01:53:28.080 align:start position:0%
questions this is more of a request
 
01:53:30.709 --> 01:53:30.719 align:start position:0%
could we uh get this spreadsheets and to
 
01:53:32.570 --> 01:53:32.580 align:start position:0%
us in electronic Forum because honestly
 
01:53:34.550 --> 01:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
you know working off paper is not that
 
01:53:36.350 --> 01:53:36.360 align:start position:0%
effective and uh you know would
 
01:53:38.330 --> 01:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
appreciate that absolutely I have it in
 
01:53:40.609 --> 01:53:40.619 align:start position:0%
Excel and I'd be happy to send it to you
 
01:53:42.770 --> 01:53:42.780 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards for a
 
01:53:45.890 --> 01:53:45.900 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair I I we're
 
01:53:47.810 --> 01:53:47.820 align:start position:0%
going to have substantial conversations
 
01:53:51.290 --> 01:53:51.300 align:start position:0%
on all of this on Medicaid day in
 
01:53:54.709 --> 01:53:54.719 align:start position:0%
division three I invite you all to come
 
01:53:57.290 --> 01:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
in when that's on the calendar uh and
 
01:53:59.990 --> 01:54:00.000 align:start position:0%
then I'm horrible at your last name I
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
know Alex is your first name you you you
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
started to hit multiple different types
 
01:54:09.530 --> 01:54:09.540 align:start position:0%
of bed rates if you if you could maybe
 
01:54:11.330 --> 01:54:11.340 align:start position:0%
maybe I already have this information
 
01:54:13.430 --> 01:54:13.440 align:start position:0%
somewhere but if you if you to the
 
01:54:16.129 --> 01:54:16.139 align:start position:0%
extent that you're aware of varying bed
 
01:54:20.629 --> 01:54:20.639 align:start position:0%
rates what they are for how much they
 
01:54:23.109 --> 01:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
are and when they went into effect last
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
uh I I'd appreciate having division
 
01:54:28.010 --> 01:54:28.020 align:start position:0%
three use that as a reference document
 
01:54:30.770 --> 01:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely I will prepare that and
 
01:54:32.629 --> 01:54:32.639 align:start position:0%
presented to division three how can you
 
01:54:34.430 --> 01:54:34.440 align:start position:0%
do that yeah all right thank you sir the
 
01:54:37.510 --> 01:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
daily rate for um uh Residential Care is
 
01:54:40.910 --> 01:54:40.920 align:start position:0%
56.88 I I I I don't want to hear it I
 
01:54:43.310 --> 01:54:43.320 align:start position:0%
want to I just wanted to make one of it
 
01:54:45.109 --> 01:54:45.119 align:start position:0%
one of the comment there was a reference
 
01:54:47.570 --> 01:54:47.580 align:start position:0%
to a 95 rate which is a no you're
 
01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:48.430 align:start position:0%
to a 95 rate which is a no you're
talking

01:54:48.430 --> 01:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
talking
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.590 --> 01:54:54.600 align:start position:0%
which is inaccurate there is no 805
 
01:54:54.600 --> 01:54:55.669 align:start position:0%
which is inaccurate there is no 805
right

01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:54:58.129 --> 01:54:58.139 align:start position:0%
okay representative leishman for a
 
01:54:58.139 --> 01:54:59.270 align:start position:0%
okay representative leishman for a
question

01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:55:01.490 --> 01:55:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman and hope
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
this question is easy uh are most of
 
01:55:07.790 --> 01:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
these facilities tax exempt or not for
 
01:55:10.189 --> 01:55:10.199 align:start position:0%
profit I have no idea what between the
 
01:55:12.470 --> 01:55:12.480 align:start position:0%
difference between 805 or 804 at least
 
01:55:14.629 --> 01:55:14.639 align:start position:0%
that to my colleagues on division three
 
01:55:16.490 --> 01:55:16.500 align:start position:0%
but just curious
 
01:55:18.109 --> 01:55:18.119 align:start position:0%
many of them are organized as
 
01:55:20.330 --> 01:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
not-for-profits but not all of them the
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
smaller homes tend to be for-profit not
 
01:55:25.189 --> 01:55:25.199 align:start position:0%
that they make one uh Friendship Manor
 
01:55:26.510 --> 01:55:26.520 align:start position:0%
was a C Corp
 
01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:27.169 align:start position:0%
was a C Corp
um

01:55:27.169 --> 01:55:27.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:29.149 --> 01:55:29.159 align:start position:0%
technically for profit but again we
 
01:55:31.609 --> 01:55:31.619 align:start position:0%
didn't make one my wife and I can were
 
01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:33.960 align:start position:0%
able to do that for 37 years because we
 
01:55:36.169 --> 01:55:36.179 align:start position:0%
didn't depend upon it to live one of us
 
01:55:37.910 --> 01:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
always worked outside of the manner to
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
basically support our family
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Mr
 
01:55:41.400 --> 01:55:43.430 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you very much Mr
chairman

01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:55:45.290 --> 01:55:45.300 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
01:55:47.570 --> 01:55:47.580 align:start position:0%
members representative McGuire
 
01:55:49.490 --> 01:55:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm also not very familiar
 
01:55:52.609 --> 01:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
with this is so there are some assisted
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
living in the state that are not on this
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
list for example my County I think has
 
01:55:59.810 --> 01:55:59.820 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living no I'm sorry what I
 
01:56:01.790 --> 01:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
think my county has an assisted living
 
01:56:04.370 --> 01:56:04.380 align:start position:0%
facility is that right I mean some
 
01:56:05.689 --> 01:56:05.699 align:start position:0%
Communists have assisted livings yes
 
01:56:08.330 --> 01:56:08.340 align:start position:0%
there are three or four
 
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
is that it everything else that's
 
01:56:12.350 --> 01:56:12.360 align:start position:0%
private everything that's private would
 
01:56:14.090 --> 01:56:14.100 align:start position:0%
be on this list is that yeah
 
01:56:15.890 --> 01:56:15.900 align:start position:0%
um assisted living is not a licensure
 
01:56:17.570 --> 01:56:17.580 align:start position:0%
term the licensure term is is
 
01:56:19.970 --> 01:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
Residential Care
 
01:56:24.050 --> 01:56:24.060 align:start position:0%
um there is in RSA 161-j a stipulation
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
that someone who advertises as an
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
assisted living home must be licensed
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
but there is no Assisted Living license
 
01:56:32.810 --> 01:56:32.820 align:start position:0%
so assisted living homes are licensed as
 
01:56:34.550 --> 01:56:34.560 align:start position:0%
resident either residential care which
 
01:56:37.250 --> 01:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
is 804 or supported residential care
 
01:56:39.830 --> 01:56:39.840 align:start position:0%
which is 805.
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
may I follow up thank you and follow-up
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
I was going to mention there were two on
 
01:56:46.490 --> 01:56:46.500 align:start position:0%
here that I recognize when I was on the
 
01:56:48.709 --> 01:56:48.719 align:start position:0%
board of for a while that was run by the
 
01:56:51.290 --> 01:56:51.300 align:start position:0%
Masons and the Masons supported it and
 
01:56:53.629 --> 01:56:53.639 align:start position:0%
the one in Rockingham County the county
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
supports it so some of these are
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
supported by others than just the money
 
01:57:00.950 --> 01:57:00.960 align:start position:0%
that's coming in thank you yeah I looked
 
01:57:02.570 --> 01:57:02.580 align:start position:0%
for my county and I didn't see it so
 
01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:03.709 align:start position:0%
for my county and I didn't see it so
anyway

01:57:03.709 --> 01:57:03.719 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
01:57:05.090 --> 01:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:57:06.830 --> 01:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the basic difference
 
01:57:09.649 --> 01:57:09.659 align:start position:0%
between 804 and 805 is it simply 16 beds
 
01:57:12.649 --> 01:57:12.659 align:start position:0%
or more no 15 or less no because it has
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with with bed size it has
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
to do with the the level supposedly with
 
01:57:20.089 --> 01:57:20.099 align:start position:0%
the Acuity of the population served in
 
01:57:21.109 --> 01:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
other words
 
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
how sick are they how impaired are they
 
01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
what do they need in terms of nursing
 
01:57:28.729 --> 01:57:28.739 align:start position:0%
Services it is a very very on
 
01:57:32.770 --> 01:57:32.780 align:start position:0%
clearly defined in both law and
 
01:57:34.609 --> 01:57:34.619 align:start position:0%
regulation though
 
01:57:37.490 --> 01:57:37.500 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of overlap in other words
 
01:57:40.430 --> 01:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
okay one more tonight thank you
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
um the the fiscal note implies that
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
um 804s get get a one rate and 805s get
 
01:57:50.089 --> 01:57:50.099 align:start position:0%
a different rate but you said that's
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
incorrect that's incorrect there are
 
01:57:56.930 --> 01:57:56.940 align:start position:0%
there are two Acuity based rates which
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
came out of a pilot program and I
 
01:58:02.149 --> 01:58:02.159 align:start position:0%
believe was in 2002. okay
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
um it was they were intended largely for
 
01:58:07.010 --> 01:58:07.020 align:start position:0%
memory care or Alzheimer's care
 
01:58:09.530 --> 01:58:09.540 align:start position:0%
uh the pilot program was more or less
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
successful there were three homes that
 
01:58:13.189 --> 01:58:13.199 align:start position:0%
participated in it one of which no
 
01:58:14.629 --> 01:58:14.639 align:start position:0%
longer does
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
the pilot program was continued So
 
01:58:19.970 --> 01:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
currently there are two homes that
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
receive those rates but only two homes
 
01:58:25.430 --> 01:58:25.440 align:start position:0%
they are both 805s but it's not an 805
 
01:58:25.440 --> 01:58:26.209 align:start position:0%
they are both 805s but it's not an 805
rate

01:58:26.209 --> 01:58:26.219 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:58:27.830 --> 01:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
one of the things our association
 
01:58:30.350 --> 01:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
recently requested was could we
 
01:58:32.570 --> 01:58:32.580 align:start position:0%
go back to that concept go back to the
 
01:58:35.570 --> 01:58:35.580 align:start position:0%
successful pirate pilot and have Acuity
 
01:58:37.250 --> 01:58:37.260 align:start position:0%
based rates in other words open these
 
01:58:39.410 --> 01:58:39.420 align:start position:0%
rates up to something more than two
 
01:58:41.870 --> 01:58:41.880 align:start position:0%
homes out of 136. and that rate's about
 
01:58:44.270 --> 01:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
eighty dollars there are two rates one
 
01:58:46.850 --> 01:58:46.860 align:start position:0%
is about 85 the other's about 95. okay
 
01:58:49.729 --> 01:58:49.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
are the questions from committee members
 
01:58:55.790 --> 01:58:55.800 align:start position:0%
all right seeing uh now we'll hear the
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
from the counties and Kate Horgan from
 
01:59:00.530 --> 01:59:00.540 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
01:59:09.410 --> 01:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:11.270 --> 01:59:11.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman my name is Kate
 
01:59:12.709 --> 01:59:12.719 align:start position:0%
Horgan I represent the New Hampshire
 
01:59:14.930 --> 01:59:14.940 align:start position:0%
Association of counties which is all of
 
01:59:16.609 --> 01:59:16.619 align:start position:0%
you are elected and appointed officials
 
01:59:18.890 --> 01:59:18.900 align:start position:0%
at County government level uh the
 
01:59:20.750 --> 01:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
association does not have a formal
 
01:59:22.910 --> 01:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
position on this bill but to answer
 
01:59:25.129 --> 01:59:25.139 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's question there
 
01:59:27.830 --> 01:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
are three counties that also have an
 
01:59:29.510 --> 01:59:29.520 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility they are
 
01:59:32.510 --> 01:59:32.520 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Merrimack and Cheshire county
 
01:59:34.669 --> 01:59:34.679 align:start position:0%
um the association would ask that if you
 
01:59:37.790 --> 01:59:37.800 align:start position:0%
are to consider this to please do it for
 
01:59:41.209 --> 01:59:41.219 align:start position:0%
all rates doing it for a small subset
 
01:59:44.450 --> 01:59:44.460 align:start position:0%
doesn't make sense all facilities are
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
facing Workforce shortages small margins
 
01:59:48.589 --> 01:59:48.599 align:start position:0%
all of you are members of your county
 
01:59:50.450 --> 01:59:50.460 align:start position:0%
delegations you know your nursing homes
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
operated a deficit every single year so
 
01:59:55.430 --> 01:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
we would just ask that you if you're
 
01:59:56.930 --> 01:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
going to increasing rates you increase
 
01:59:59.149 --> 01:59:59.159 align:start position:0%
them for everyone and not a small subset
 
02:00:01.910 --> 02:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to take any questions that the
 
02:00:03.470 --> 02:00:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee has
 
02:00:05.330 --> 02:00:05.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire thank you Mr
 
02:00:07.250 --> 02:00:07.260 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for coming what is
 
02:00:09.470 --> 02:00:09.480 align:start position:0%
the total number of beds in these three
 
02:00:11.990 --> 02:00:12.000 align:start position:0%
facilities uh I would have to get back
 
02:00:13.609 --> 02:00:13.619 align:start position:0%
to you on that representative McGuire
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly get that number for
 
02:00:15.360 --> 02:00:18.229 align:start position:0%
but I can certainly get that number for
you

02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:21.050 --> 02:00:21.060 align:start position:0%
representative Heath thank you
 
02:00:22.910 --> 02:00:22.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question do
 
02:00:24.709 --> 02:00:24.719 align:start position:0%
you have any idea what the waiting list
 
02:00:28.550 --> 02:00:28.560 align:start position:0%
is Statewide for nursing homes I can Mt
 
02:00:29.810 --> 02:00:29.820 align:start position:0%
nursing homes thank you for the question
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
representative I can speak to the
 
02:00:35.030 --> 02:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
counties uh for the nursing homes uh I
 
02:00:36.890 --> 02:00:36.900 align:start position:0%
would the average is over a hundred
 
02:00:39.350 --> 02:00:39.360 align:start position:0%
people for every single County right now
 
02:00:42.169 --> 02:00:42.179 align:start position:0%
some counties are have more I know
 
02:00:44.209 --> 02:00:44.219 align:start position:0%
Cheshire county for example I think is
 
02:00:47.270 --> 02:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
at 120 right now and they just had to
 
02:00:49.609 --> 02:00:49.619 align:start position:0%
close an entire Wing because they cannot
 
02:00:58.990 --> 02:00:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:01.189 --> 02:01:01.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:01.199 --> 02:01:02.209 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:01:02.209 --> 02:01:02.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:01:02.219 --> 02:01:03.770 align:start position:0%
um
I

02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:01:07.609 --> 02:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
I'm I had a meeting with Jason Smith who
 
02:01:09.770 --> 02:01:09.780 align:start position:0%
is managing the Rockingham County homes
 
02:01:11.689 --> 02:01:11.699 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:01:13.970 --> 02:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
a lot of what we talked about were
 
02:01:16.490 --> 02:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
exactly those challenges about you know
 
02:01:18.649 --> 02:01:18.659 align:start position:0%
the rage being so low it makes it really
 
02:01:20.330 --> 02:01:20.340 align:start position:0%
hard for them to be able to pay the
 
02:01:21.830 --> 02:01:21.840 align:start position:0%
wages that would allow them to retain
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
the staff and that's where all the
 
02:01:24.649 --> 02:01:24.659 align:start position:0%
workforce but you know issues are
 
02:01:24.659 --> 02:01:25.850 align:start position:0%
workforce but you know issues are
starting

02:01:25.850 --> 02:01:25.860 align:start position:0%
starting
 
02:01:29.270 --> 02:01:29.280 align:start position:0%
does your Association have you know its
 
02:01:31.129 --> 02:01:31.139 align:start position:0%
own guideline I mean this this is a bill
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
proposed but do you have any uh
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
you know broad position from your
 
02:01:37.850 --> 02:01:37.860 align:start position:0%
associations in terms of what the rate
 
02:01:39.589 --> 02:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
should be and if so could you provide
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
that those suggestions to us we do not
 
02:01:44.810 --> 02:01:44.820 align:start position:0%
we are actually working on that Senator
 
02:01:46.850 --> 02:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
Rosenwald actually has a bill that would
 
02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:50.880 align:start position:0%
raise all Medicaid rates uh for all all
 
02:01:52.669 --> 02:01:52.679 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rates across the board and we
 
02:01:54.830 --> 02:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
are in the process of figuring out what
 
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
those numbers should be I believe it's
 
02:02:04.729 --> 02:02:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:09.770 --> 02:02:09.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.530 --> 02:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much we will
 
02:02:15.410 --> 02:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on Senate on House
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
Bill 527 and is there a list
 
02:02:25.689 --> 02:02:25.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.089 --> 02:02:28.099 align:start position:0%
yep it's coming
 
02:02:31.430 --> 02:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
oh we got one person wants to speak
 
02:02:38.209 --> 02:02:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:40.129 --> 02:02:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon Mr chairman my name is
 
02:02:41.750 --> 02:02:41.760 align:start position:0%
Rob Berry I'm with the Department of
 
02:02:43.310 --> 02:02:43.320 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services I thought I
 
02:02:44.750 --> 02:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
submitted a pink card apparently didn't
 
02:02:47.450 --> 02:02:47.460 align:start position:0%
get to you I apologize for that
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
um to my right I have Miss Christie Roy
 
02:02:51.649 --> 02:02:51.659 align:start position:0%
and she can explain what she does for
 
02:02:52.490 --> 02:02:52.500 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
02:02:54.649 --> 02:02:54.659 align:start position:0%
I'm Christy Roy and for the Department I
 
02:02:57.589 --> 02:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
work in the rate setting area for DHHS
 
02:02:59.689 --> 02:02:59.699 align:start position:0%
so we wanted to just provide a little
 
02:03:01.729 --> 02:03:01.739 align:start position:0%
bit of information prior to the work
 
02:03:03.169 --> 02:03:03.179 align:start position:0%
session we don't have a formal position
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
on the spill either but we did want to
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
give a little insight as to how we got
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
to our fiscal analysis so the department
 
02:03:14.750 --> 02:03:14.760 align:start position:0%
does not believe it's permissible to
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
Target rates as is contemplated by this
 
02:03:20.870 --> 02:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
legislation that being the size of a
 
02:03:23.270 --> 02:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
facility and the Medicaid utilization
 
02:03:26.330 --> 02:03:26.340 align:start position:0%
rate we base our rates on the Acuity
 
02:03:29.149 --> 02:03:29.159 align:start position:0%
level of individuals within the assisted
 
02:03:31.010 --> 02:03:31.020 align:start position:0%
living facilities so we have currently
 
02:03:33.589 --> 02:03:33.599 align:start position:0%
three different rates the lowest one
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
being the 58 and change in the highest
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
one being somewhere around
 
02:03:41.990 --> 02:03:42.000 align:start position:0%
it's 95 41 currently 41. um so we're
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
happy to work last one again
 
02:03:47.390 --> 02:03:47.400 align:start position:0%
95 41 so there are two dementia level
 
02:03:49.490 --> 02:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
rates so there's the standard
 
02:03:51.649 --> 02:03:51.659 align:start position:0%
Residential Care rate for CFI which is
 
02:03:53.209 --> 02:03:53.219 align:start position:0%
our choice for Independence which is the
 
02:03:53.219 --> 02:03:54.709 align:start position:0%
our choice for Independence which is the
56.88

02:03:54.709 --> 02:03:54.719 align:start position:0%
56.88
 
02:03:56.810 --> 02:03:56.820 align:start position:0%
the second rate is dementia level one
 
02:04:01.310 --> 02:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
which is 84.74 and the third rate is for
 
02:04:04.070 --> 02:04:04.080 align:start position:0%
dementia care level two which is 95.41
 
02:04:06.290 --> 02:04:06.300 align:start position:0%
they're service based rates we don't
 
02:04:08.870 --> 02:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
have a facility specific rate model for
 
02:04:11.330 --> 02:04:11.340 align:start position:0%
this so that's where the challenge comes
 
02:04:11.340 --> 02:04:12.470 align:start position:0%
this so that's where the challenge comes
in

02:04:12.470 --> 02:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
in
 
02:04:14.390 --> 02:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
um it's a service level rate so that's
 
02:04:16.129 --> 02:04:16.139 align:start position:0%
where the Acuity would be it's
 
02:04:19.310 --> 02:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
additional Acuity Services needed for
 
02:04:22.669 --> 02:04:22.679 align:start position:0%
those additional dementia levels
 
02:04:24.470 --> 02:04:24.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:04:28.850 --> 02:04:28.860 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards then
 
02:04:32.330 --> 02:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire I thank hey thank
 
02:04:34.010 --> 02:04:34.020 align:start position:0%
you to the department for coming to this
 
02:04:37.070 --> 02:04:37.080 align:start position:0%
I uh I look forward to doing a deep dive
 
02:04:40.070 --> 02:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
on all of this in in uh in division
 
02:04:43.070 --> 02:04:43.080 align:start position:0%
three and you heard me ask Alex a little
 
02:04:45.290 --> 02:04:45.300 align:start position:0%
while ago if he's got a sheet on all the
 
02:04:48.530 --> 02:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
different categories of uh of bed rates
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
and when they were established and how
 
02:04:53.089 --> 02:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
much they are I I think if we had a
 
02:04:55.729 --> 02:04:55.739 align:start position:0%
comprehensive document to look at that
 
02:04:57.530 --> 02:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
would help us go through and figure out
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
what we want to do to the big picture
 
02:05:02.990 --> 02:05:03.000 align:start position:0%
and not just one-offs sure and now we're
 
02:05:04.609 --> 02:05:04.619 align:start position:0%
trying to also have somebody from
 
02:05:07.010 --> 02:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
licensing uh come to the work session as
 
02:05:08.270 --> 02:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
well to explain the differences between
 
02:05:10.430 --> 02:05:10.440 align:start position:0%
hee 804 and 805 if that would help the
 
02:05:12.350 --> 02:05:12.360 align:start position:0%
committee as well all right and you know
 
02:05:14.209 --> 02:05:14.219 align:start position:0%
the way that works Mr Ripple schedules
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
with Nathan white and then you guys get
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
alerted okay all right thank you
 
02:05:21.890 --> 02:05:21.900 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire real quick thank
 
02:05:23.689 --> 02:05:23.699 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for coming so
 
02:05:26.990 --> 02:05:27.000 align:start position:0%
we heard earlier that um a total of 535
 
02:05:30.770 --> 02:05:30.780 align:start position:0%
beds are receiving these rate these
 
02:05:33.109 --> 02:05:33.119 align:start position:0%
three rates I guess is that true or is
 
02:05:36.850 --> 02:05:36.860 align:start position:0%
there there more that's likely go ahead
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
the for so for State fiscal year 22 the
 
02:05:42.830 --> 02:05:42.840 align:start position:0%
total days that I had pulled from our
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
mmis system which is our Medicaid
 
02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
management information system was just
 
02:05:49.370 --> 02:05:49.380 align:start position:0%
under 200 000.
 
02:05:52.430 --> 02:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:58.250 --> 02:05:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:00.589 --> 02:06:00.599 align:start position:0%
representative Prophet popovichi Mueller
 
02:06:02.390 --> 02:06:02.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
02:06:04.550 --> 02:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
being here and answering questions I
 
02:06:05.870 --> 02:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
mean you've been here when we were
 
02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:07.619 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony about the impact
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
of the uh you know lower rates uh to you
 
02:06:11.810 --> 02:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
know the ability of the centers to
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
provide service obviously that testimony
 
02:06:16.370 --> 02:06:16.380 align:start position:0%
is you know narrow in the sense that it
 
02:06:18.530 --> 02:06:18.540 align:start position:0%
reflects their experience for you as the
 
02:06:21.109 --> 02:06:21.119 align:start position:0%
department could you provide any color
 
02:06:23.990 --> 02:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
or information to us in terms of whether
 
02:06:26.870 --> 02:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
the current rates allow for the centers
 
02:06:29.930 --> 02:06:29.940 align:start position:0%
to sustainably operate or is there a
 
02:06:31.609 --> 02:06:31.619 align:start position:0%
concern at the department level over
 
02:06:34.010 --> 02:06:34.020 align:start position:0%
these Trends I just would like to hear
 
02:06:35.810 --> 02:06:35.820 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on this
 
02:06:37.430 --> 02:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
I believe we'd have to get back to you
 
02:06:39.050 --> 02:06:39.060 align:start position:0%
on that we have to speak to some people
 
02:06:40.490 --> 02:06:40.500 align:start position:0%
at the department to get their views on
 
02:06:40.500 --> 02:06:41.149 align:start position:0%
at the department to get their views on
it

02:06:41.149 --> 02:06:41.159 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:06:43.250 --> 02:06:43.260 align:start position:0%
um that's more of a finance three
 
02:06:45.050 --> 02:06:45.060 align:start position:0%
question anyway but I thought while we
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
were here you know if you could share
 
02:06:50.450 --> 02:06:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:52.550 --> 02:06:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative Petrie
 
02:06:54.470 --> 02:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh thank you for
 
02:06:57.709 --> 02:06:57.719 align:start position:0%
being here uh has these closings around
 
02:07:00.410 --> 02:07:00.420 align:start position:0%
the state has that put you know
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
additional uh pressure on these you know
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
on finding beds
 
02:07:08.270 --> 02:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
so I can't speak to that personally
 
02:07:09.890 --> 02:07:09.900 align:start position:0%
um I will try to get something from
 
02:07:13.070 --> 02:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
licensing here but I can say that I
 
02:07:14.810 --> 02:07:14.820 align:start position:0%
would expect that that would put
 
02:07:16.490 --> 02:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
additional pressure on
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
um on facilities and individuals who are
 
02:07:26.089 --> 02:07:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:26.099 --> 02:07:29.629 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.639 --> 02:07:31.970 align:start position:0%
 
Stringham

02:07:31.970 --> 02:07:31.980 align:start position:0%
Stringham
 
02:07:34.129 --> 02:07:34.139 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
02:07:36.010 --> 02:07:36.020 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:07:38.149 --> 02:07:38.159 align:start position:0%
the rates on
 
02:07:38.159 --> 02:07:39.010 align:start position:0%
the rates on
um

02:07:39.010 --> 02:07:39.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:41.689 --> 02:07:41.699 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that the the rates paid
 
02:07:44.870 --> 02:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
vary by the Acuity is there anything in
 
02:07:47.450 --> 02:07:47.460 align:start position:0%
the uh fee schedule that incorporates
 
02:07:49.850 --> 02:07:49.860 align:start position:0%
things like local wage index Indigent
 
02:07:52.609 --> 02:07:52.619 align:start position:0%
care factors or Capital issues or
 
02:07:54.470 --> 02:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
anything that would affect that and
 
02:07:57.290 --> 02:07:57.300 align:start position:0%
could you also comment on uh what you
 
02:08:00.589 --> 02:08:00.599 align:start position:0%
what restricts you from incorporating a
 
02:08:02.870 --> 02:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
percent Medicaid as a factor in setting
 
02:08:03.830 --> 02:08:03.840 align:start position:0%
the rate
 
02:08:06.649 --> 02:08:06.659 align:start position:0%
I'm going to differ to Christy in that
 
02:08:08.330 --> 02:08:08.340 align:start position:0%
um so again it's a service-based rate
 
02:08:10.370 --> 02:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
they were increased five percent from
 
02:08:14.089 --> 02:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
hb2 in July they're a CFI rates so any
 
02:08:17.209 --> 02:08:17.219 align:start position:0%
other CFI legislation would also affect
 
02:08:18.589 --> 02:08:18.599 align:start position:0%
this rate
 
02:08:20.629 --> 02:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
um in the rate methodology that was
 
02:08:23.450 --> 02:08:23.460 align:start position:0%
determined I when it was set there it
 
02:08:25.010 --> 02:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
was out there was an outsourced company
 
02:08:27.229 --> 02:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
I believe that worked with the
 
02:08:28.970 --> 02:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
Department to come up with those
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
original rates and then my understanding
 
02:08:34.189 --> 02:08:34.199 align:start position:0%
in the waivers there's uh information
 
02:08:37.970 --> 02:08:37.980 align:start position:0%
about updating annually based on the CMS
 
02:08:40.490 --> 02:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
Market Basket for CFI rates and then
 
02:08:42.770 --> 02:08:42.780 align:start position:0%
they are additionally
 
02:08:45.410 --> 02:08:45.420 align:start position:0%
held to a budget adjustment factor or a
 
02:08:47.810 --> 02:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
budget neutrality Factor so there's
 
02:08:49.250 --> 02:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
plenty of complexities in that rate
 
02:08:49.260 --> 02:08:50.629 align:start position:0%
plenty of complexities in that rate
methodology

02:08:50.629 --> 02:08:50.639 align:start position:0%
methodology
 
02:08:55.250 --> 02:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.050 align:start position:0%
 
it

02:08:56.050 --> 02:08:56.060 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:08:58.370 --> 02:08:58.380 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
02:09:01.910 --> 02:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
how many facilities uh have have waivers
 
02:09:05.689 --> 02:09:05.699 align:start position:0%
on on the base rate uh I thought you
 
02:09:07.250 --> 02:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
said some do
 
02:09:09.850 --> 02:09:09.860 align:start position:0%
waivers on the base rate meaning
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
waiver so they have an adjustment
 
02:09:12.719 --> 02:09:14.270 align:start position:0%
waiver so they have an adjustment
so

02:09:14.270 --> 02:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:14.280 --> 02:09:14.810 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:09:14.810 --> 02:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
the adjustment is service level based so
 
02:09:20.510 --> 02:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
it would depend on the qualifications
 
02:09:23.689 --> 02:09:23.699 align:start position:0%
within that service or the the need of
 
02:09:25.129 --> 02:09:25.139 align:start position:0%
this what's required for the service
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's not a facility specific adjustment
 
02:09:31.729 --> 02:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
so if there are only two facilities that
 
02:09:33.830 --> 02:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
would provide that additional level of
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
service or that additional level of care
 
02:09:37.370 --> 02:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
and what's required for that additional
 
02:09:39.050 --> 02:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
level care there are two facilities but
 
02:09:41.990 --> 02:09:42.000 align:start position:0%
there's no limitation to the quantity of
 
02:09:44.209 --> 02:09:44.219 align:start position:0%
facilities that could provide that
 
02:09:46.790 --> 02:09:46.800 align:start position:0%
additional level of care if they so
 
02:09:50.510 --> 02:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
choose they just have to I would assume
 
02:09:52.850 --> 02:09:52.860 align:start position:0%
apply for and prove that that's the
 
02:09:53.870 --> 02:09:53.880 align:start position:0%
additional level of care they're
 
02:09:57.050 --> 02:09:57.060 align:start position:0%
providing for that service
 
02:09:57.060 --> 02:09:58.609 align:start position:0%
providing for that service
foreign

02:09:58.609 --> 02:09:58.619 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
02:10:00.290 --> 02:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question
 
02:10:02.870 --> 02:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair this could just be a
 
02:10:04.790 --> 02:10:04.800 align:start position:0%
really short answer uh the five percent
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
that you mentioned in hb2 it's my
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that that expires at the
 
02:10:13.070 --> 02:10:13.080 align:start position:0%
end of this hb2 period and and rolls
 
02:10:15.050 --> 02:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
back to the previous level unless
 
02:10:19.490 --> 02:10:19.500 align:start position:0%
reauthorized in the next hb2 or or or is
 
02:10:22.010 --> 02:10:22.020 align:start position:0%
that was that a permanent increase to
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%
the Baseline
 
02:10:25.729 --> 02:10:25.739 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
02:10:28.609 --> 02:10:28.619 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it's permanent but I
 
02:10:30.830 --> 02:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
can we can look into that for you yeah
 
02:10:33.410 --> 02:10:33.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:10:36.470 --> 02:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
historically adjustments to rates when
 
02:10:37.970 --> 02:10:37.980 align:start position:0%
you're reducing it you have to prove
 
02:10:39.890 --> 02:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
that it's not affecting access to care
 
02:10:42.890 --> 02:10:42.900 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid so if there is an
 
02:10:45.470 --> 02:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
adjustment to that rate a decrease it
 
02:10:47.689 --> 02:10:47.699 align:start position:0%
would be a significant lift to prove
 
02:10:49.189 --> 02:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
access to care especially with what
 
02:10:52.010 --> 02:10:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
02:10:57.410 --> 02:10:57.420 align:start position:0%
seeing none we did find your card sorry
 
02:11:00.189 --> 02:11:00.199 align:start position:0%
we lost it that's all right
 
02:11:03.169 --> 02:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
anybody else that wishes to make
 
02:11:04.609 --> 02:11:04.619 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
02:11:07.490 --> 02:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 527
 
02:11:09.649 --> 02:11:09.659 align:start position:0%
seeing none I have on the blue sheet
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
just the two Campbells that have signed
 
02:11:14.089 --> 02:11:14.099 align:start position:0%
in and and pro both Ann Campbell and
 
02:11:16.970 --> 02:11:16.980 align:start position:0%
 Campbell uh no other signatures on
 
02:11:16.980 --> 02:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
 Campbell uh no other signatures on
there

02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
thank you all I'm going to close this
 
02:11:22.609 --> 02:11:22.619 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 527 you'll be
 
02:11:25.370 --> 02:11:25.380 align:start position:0%
hearing more from division three when it
 
02:11:28.209 --> 02:11:28.219 align:start position:0%
will be scheduled for probably
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
continued on with all the other Medicaid
 
02:11:32.450 --> 02:11:32.460 align:start position:0%
rate discussion
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
thank you all for your testimony thank
 
02:11:36.470 --> 02:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
you all for coming
 
02:11:39.709 --> 02:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
I'll close this hearing
 
02:11:41.750 --> 02:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
so with that I'd like to open division
 
02:11:44.330 --> 02:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
three uh where I'm going to meet
 
02:11:47.450 --> 02:11:47.460 align:start position:0%
immediately put us into recess uh until
 
02:11:51.410 --> 02:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
uh say 12 35 so that should give people
 
02:11:53.629 --> 02:11:53.639 align:start position:0%
time to go get something to eat and come
 
02:11:56.810 --> 02:11:56.820 align:start position:0%
back we'll be in here at 12 35 to deal
 
02:11:59.689 --> 02:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:35.110 --> 02:52:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:37.550 --> 02:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
all right uh we were supposed to start
 
02:52:41.030 --> 02:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
at 12 35 it's uh 12 50 15 minutes late
 
02:52:44.469 --> 02:52:44.479 align:start position:0%
uh that's on me uh we're out of recess
 
02:52:47.690 --> 02:52:47.700 align:start position:0%
uh we're uh here in a division three
 
02:52:50.090 --> 02:52:50.100 align:start position:0%
work session
 
02:52:53.450 --> 02:52:53.460 align:start position:0%
um on the calendar is to discuss House
 
02:52:56.510 --> 02:52:56.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 49 that we've had in division three
 
02:52:59.630 --> 02:52:59.640 align:start position:0%
for a little while House Bill 527 that
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
we just uh talked about in full Finance
 
02:53:04.670 --> 02:53:04.680 align:start position:0%
today and could talk about it a little
 
02:53:07.969 --> 02:53:07.979 align:start position:0%
bit today and the uh the star attraction
 
02:53:12.349 --> 02:53:12.359 align:start position:0%
of today is uh is sb1
 
02:53:12.359 --> 02:53:14.090 align:start position:0%
of today is uh is sb1
so

02:53:14.090 --> 02:53:14.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:53:14.100 --> 02:53:15.530 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:53:15.530 --> 02:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:19.070 --> 02:53:19.080 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with
 
02:53:19.080 --> 02:53:22.429 align:start position:0%
I'm going to start with
um

02:53:22.429 --> 02:53:22.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:53:24.469 --> 02:53:24.479 align:start position:0%
I think I think to get a sense of where
 
02:53:27.590 --> 02:53:27.600 align:start position:0%
we're at uh I I'd like to get a straw
 
02:53:33.530 --> 02:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
vote uh I have been a supporter of sb1
 
02:53:35.269 --> 02:53:35.279 align:start position:0%
um from the beginning we're going to
 
02:53:40.090 --> 02:53:40.100 align:start position:0%
take that up first I think sb1 and uh
 
02:53:43.790 --> 02:53:43.800 align:start position:0%
and I I would like us I would like
 
02:53:47.269 --> 02:53:47.279 align:start position:0%
everyone to tell us through a straw vote
 
02:53:50.870 --> 02:53:50.880 align:start position:0%
where they think they are on sb1 and
 
02:53:53.150 --> 02:53:53.160 align:start position:0%
then we can talk about an amendment to
 
02:53:55.070 --> 02:53:55.080 align:start position:0%
sb1 that's the same thing as the
 
02:53:57.769 --> 02:53:57.779 align:start position:0%
amendment to 49. so so those
 
02:54:00.530 --> 02:54:00.540 align:start position:0%
conversations will converge but to
 
02:54:03.349 --> 02:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
establish a baseline I think we need to
 
02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:06.479 align:start position:0%
make sure that there's absolute Clarity
 
02:54:11.210 --> 02:54:11.220 align:start position:0%
on where people are with sb1 so so I
 
02:54:14.570 --> 02:54:14.580 align:start position:0%
would I would take a motion to um
 
02:54:18.950 --> 02:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:20.809 --> 02:54:20.819 align:start position:0%
now where it's going to be it's not a
 
02:54:22.969 --> 02:54:22.979 align:start position:0%
real vote I'm taking a straw I want to
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
make sure I know where people are at I
 
02:54:26.630 --> 02:54:26.640 align:start position:0%
think I think the public needs to know
 
02:54:29.150 --> 02:54:29.160 align:start position:0%
where people are at on this
 
02:54:31.309 --> 02:54:31.319 align:start position:0%
okay so Mr chairman subject to our
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
conversations of yesterday it seems like
 
02:54:34.610 --> 02:54:34.620 align:start position:0%
we're formulating a good Amendment so I
 
02:54:36.469 --> 02:54:36.479 align:start position:0%
would make the motion to ought to pass
 
02:54:38.809 --> 02:54:38.819 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill one okay is there a
 
02:54:38.819 --> 02:54:40.130 align:start position:0%
on Senate bill one okay is there a
second

02:54:40.130 --> 02:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:54:42.349 --> 02:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
second okay
 
02:54:47.290 --> 02:54:47.300 align:start position:0%
um so uh is there the discussion on this
 
02:54:53.929 --> 02:54:53.939 align:start position:0%
is that the Senate passed sb1 24 to
 
02:54:53.939 --> 02:54:55.429 align:start position:0%
is that the Senate passed sb1 24 to
nothing

02:54:55.429 --> 02:54:55.439 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
02:54:57.889 --> 02:54:57.899 align:start position:0%
um this was an enormous high water mark
 
02:55:01.550 --> 02:55:01.560 align:start position:0%
in the past decade where people have
 
02:55:04.070 --> 02:55:04.080 align:start position:0%
often said that we needed to do
 
02:55:06.490 --> 02:55:06.500 align:start position:0%
something to replace the sununu center
 
02:55:09.969 --> 02:55:09.979 align:start position:0%
and the desire to do something
 
02:55:13.730 --> 02:55:13.740 align:start position:0%
reached kind of a boiling point two
 
02:55:17.889 --> 02:55:17.899 align:start position:0%
years ago when the legislature
 
02:55:20.870 --> 02:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
passed into law the closure of the
 
02:55:23.090 --> 02:55:23.100 align:start position:0%
sununu center on one March of this year
 
02:55:25.309 --> 02:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
that's just a few weeks from now
 
02:55:29.990 --> 02:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
the legislature had an opportunity to
 
02:55:33.469 --> 02:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
pass a committee conference report and
 
02:55:34.690 --> 02:55:34.700 align:start position:0%
did not
 
02:55:37.010 --> 02:55:37.020 align:start position:0%
the reason the committee conference
 
02:55:40.370 --> 02:55:40.380 align:start position:0%
report failed it was really I think
 
02:55:42.889 --> 02:55:42.899 align:start position:0%
predominantly a burnt around capacity
 
02:55:45.349 --> 02:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
there was there were different views on
 
02:55:48.050 --> 02:55:48.060 align:start position:0%
what the capacity ought to be there was
 
02:55:50.690 --> 02:55:50.700 align:start position:0%
a position that went with the house
 
02:55:54.590 --> 02:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
representatives of six the senate had a
 
02:55:58.670 --> 02:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
vision of 12 with a flexibility of up to
 
02:55:58.680 --> 02:56:00.010 align:start position:0%
vision of 12 with a flexibility of up to
18

02:56:00.010 --> 02:56:00.020 align:start position:0%
18
 
02:56:04.130 --> 02:56:04.140 align:start position:0%
and when that topic came up the
 
02:56:06.349 --> 02:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
conversations broke down and the
 
02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:09.300 align:start position:0%
committee conference uh
 
02:56:11.690 --> 02:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
broke up and didn't didn't complete any
 
02:56:11.700 --> 02:56:12.530 align:start position:0%
broke up and didn't didn't complete any
work

02:56:12.530 --> 02:56:12.540 align:start position:0%
work
 
02:56:14.630 --> 02:56:14.640 align:start position:0%
so here we are nobody introduced
 
02:56:16.490 --> 02:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
anything last year to fix this problem
 
02:56:18.790 --> 02:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
we creep into this year
 
02:56:22.309 --> 02:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
now about to begin our budget cycle with
 
02:56:26.110 --> 02:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
the sununu Center closing in a few days
 
02:56:29.929 --> 02:56:29.939 align:start position:0%
and the legislature still has not acted
 
02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
so sb1 is half of the legislature acting
 
02:56:37.550 --> 02:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
strongly and convincingly with a 24 to
 
02:56:39.170 --> 02:56:39.180 align:start position:0%
nothing vote
 
02:56:42.110 --> 02:56:42.120 align:start position:0%
it's hard to beat 24 to nothing in the
 
02:56:44.809 --> 02:56:44.819 align:start position:0%
Senate that bill came over to the house
 
02:56:48.290 --> 02:56:48.300 align:start position:0%
for us to consider the house has looked
 
02:56:50.690 --> 02:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
at this issue in multiple different ways
 
02:56:53.570 --> 02:56:53.580 align:start position:0%
children and family law saw a similar
 
02:56:56.630 --> 02:56:56.640 align:start position:0%
bill with House Bill 120 in which
 
02:56:59.290 --> 02:56:59.300 align:start position:0%
division three was invited to that
 
02:57:03.050 --> 02:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
then we had House Bill 49 where we've
 
02:57:06.170 --> 02:57:06.180 align:start position:0%
gone through a lot of discussion deep in
 
02:57:09.050 --> 02:57:09.060 align:start position:0%
discussion on amendments it started with
 
02:57:10.670 --> 02:57:10.680 align:start position:0%
the Waller Amendment and then division
 
02:57:13.730 --> 02:57:13.740 align:start position:0%
three came to a significant agreement
 
02:57:18.170 --> 02:57:18.180 align:start position:0%
yesterday and and so we've got that and
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
so we are on the cusp of success in
 
02:57:27.110 --> 02:57:27.120 align:start position:0%
doing our job and and so what I think a
 
02:57:29.330 --> 02:57:29.340 align:start position:0%
vote on sb1 will do
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
will be to bring us to concur with all
 
02:57:36.050 --> 02:57:36.060 align:start position:0%
of the hard work of the Senate that's
 
02:57:38.389 --> 02:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
been done and supported by the
 
02:57:38.399 --> 02:57:39.290 align:start position:0%
been done and supported by the
department

02:57:39.290 --> 02:57:39.300 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:57:43.550 --> 02:57:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's been done and supported by the
 
02:57:46.070 --> 02:57:46.080 align:start position:0%
advocacy group and the public that's
 
02:57:48.889 --> 02:57:48.899 align:start position:0%
been done and supported and we have a
 
02:57:50.510 --> 02:57:50.520 align:start position:0%
letter from the governor
 
02:57:53.210 --> 02:57:53.220 align:start position:0%
so out of respect for all of those
 
02:57:53.220 --> 02:57:54.170 align:start position:0%
so out of respect for all of those
people

02:57:54.170 --> 02:57:54.180 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:57:56.870 --> 02:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
that have looked at this and have
 
02:57:59.809 --> 02:57:59.819 align:start position:0%
delivered us sb1
 
02:58:04.429 --> 02:58:04.439 align:start position:0%
I would like us to vote do we think yes
 
02:58:07.550 --> 02:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
or no we can support sb1 or not
 
02:58:10.610 --> 02:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
so this is not a formal vote this is a
 
02:58:12.889 --> 02:58:12.899 align:start position:0%
sense of the committee
 
02:58:17.090 --> 02:58:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:19.849 --> 02:58:19.859 align:start position:0%
uh yes representative hole
 
02:58:21.290 --> 02:58:21.300 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
02:58:22.969 --> 02:58:22.979 align:start position:0%
um I think yesterday in division three
 
02:58:25.490 --> 02:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
we had a very productive session talked
 
02:58:28.150 --> 02:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
about a a number of things
 
02:58:31.309 --> 02:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
somehow along the way we ended up with
 
02:58:33.769 --> 02:58:33.779 align:start position:0%
this deadline of March 1st
 
02:58:35.690 --> 02:58:35.700 align:start position:0%
that in some ways is an artificially
 
02:58:38.710 --> 02:58:38.720 align:start position:0%
driven deadline by prior law
 
02:58:41.330 --> 02:58:41.340 align:start position:0%
it's not like the building stops working
 
02:58:44.389 --> 02:58:44.399 align:start position:0%
on on March 2nd
 
02:58:44.399 --> 02:58:46.309 align:start position:0%
on on March 2nd
the

02:58:46.309 --> 02:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:58:48.650 --> 02:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
the goal of of kind of figuring out what
 
02:58:50.750 --> 02:58:50.760 align:start position:0%
you want to do before you go do it is an
 
02:58:52.969 --> 02:58:52.979 align:start position:0%
important thing to me as an engineer and
 
02:58:55.250 --> 02:58:55.260 align:start position:0%
what I see now is we're trying to create
 
02:58:57.590 --> 02:58:57.600 align:start position:0%
and spend money but we haven't defined
 
02:58:59.990 --> 02:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
the location or what the facility is
 
02:59:01.790 --> 02:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
before we even get there we're saying go
 
02:59:05.450 --> 02:59:05.460 align:start position:0%
spend right 15 million dollars so
 
02:59:05.460 --> 02:59:06.050 align:start position:0%
spend right 15 million dollars so
um

02:59:06.050 --> 02:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:08.510 --> 02:59:08.520 align:start position:0%
uh hearing what you said there's a lot
 
02:59:10.190 --> 02:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
of people that say this is a good idea
 
02:59:12.110 --> 02:59:12.120 align:start position:0%
and it did pass out of the Senate 24-0
 
02:59:14.570 --> 02:59:14.580 align:start position:0%
but I think we're not quite ready there
 
02:59:14.580 --> 02:59:16.190 align:start position:0%
but I think we're not quite ready there
so

02:59:16.190 --> 02:59:16.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:59:18.110 --> 02:59:18.120 align:start position:0%
um as is amended by the Senate and
 
02:59:24.290 --> 02:59:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay I I I respect your conclusion I
 
02:59:29.389 --> 02:59:29.399 align:start position:0%
just I just want to bring some facts
 
02:59:31.849 --> 02:59:31.859 align:start position:0%
that we've heard in testimony and that
 
02:59:34.370 --> 02:59:34.380 align:start position:0%
that the we heard that the 15 million
 
02:59:37.370 --> 02:59:37.380 align:start position:0%
dollars that found its home in sb1 was
 
02:59:39.230 --> 02:59:39.240 align:start position:0%
the original estimate
 
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
um that we that came about as a result
 
02:59:43.490 --> 02:59:43.500 align:start position:0%
of there being a special committee on
 
02:59:46.250 --> 02:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
the sununu replacement Center uh and
 
02:59:48.050 --> 02:59:48.060 align:start position:0%
that what we have experienced in the
 
02:59:52.490 --> 02:59:52.500 align:start position:0%
past year or so of of delay is a very
 
02:59:54.769 --> 02:59:54.779 align:start position:0%
strong inflationary problem with with
 
02:59:57.950 --> 02:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
supply chain issues and that and that
 
03:00:01.610 --> 03:00:01.620 align:start position:0%
delay in this case probably contributed
 
03:00:03.830 --> 03:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
from going from a 15 million dollar
 
03:00:06.469 --> 03:00:06.479 align:start position:0%
estimate to a 21.6 million dollar
 
03:00:08.809 --> 03:00:08.819 align:start position:0%
estimate and I don't know what another
 
03:00:11.150 --> 03:00:11.160 align:start position:0%
delay would do if if this is still a
 
03:00:13.370 --> 03:00:13.380 align:start position:0%
good idea at the end of the day does it
 
03:00:15.710 --> 03:00:15.720 align:start position:0%
become a 25 million dollar good idea or
 
03:00:18.769 --> 03:00:18.779 align:start position:0%
not I I I do think we've been given some
 
03:00:21.650 --> 03:00:21.660 align:start position:0%
some numbers and I can understand that
 
03:00:24.710 --> 03:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
we've had bizarre inflation and the
 
03:00:27.710 --> 03:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
United States over the last two years so
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
so that that attributes the distinction
 
03:00:33.889 --> 03:00:33.899 align:start position:0%
between the 15 and the 21.6 I'm not I'm
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
not saying that to change your mind I'm
 
03:00:37.550 --> 03:00:37.560 align:start position:0%
just making sure that the record's
 
03:00:39.769 --> 03:00:39.779 align:start position:0%
complete right thank you
 
03:00:39.779 --> 03:00:40.670 align:start position:0%
complete right thank you
um

03:00:40.670 --> 03:00:40.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:43.429 --> 03:00:43.439 align:start position:0%
so I agree and this goes back to I think
 
03:00:45.590 --> 03:00:45.600 align:start position:0%
yesterday in our committee or
 
03:00:48.230 --> 03:00:48.240 align:start position:0%
division we had a a great work session
 
03:00:50.870 --> 03:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
to work out some of these issues
 
03:00:52.849 --> 03:00:52.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to bring come to page four
 
03:00:55.730 --> 03:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
lines 30 and 31.
 
03:00:57.590 --> 03:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
quote in no event shall the total
 
03:00:59.809 --> 03:00:59.819 align:start position:0%
expenditures from all sources for the
 
03:01:01.070 --> 03:01:01.080 align:start position:0%
design and construction of the new
 
03:01:02.570 --> 03:01:02.580 align:start position:0%
secured Youth Development facility
 
03:01:05.090 --> 03:01:05.100 align:start position:0%
exceed 15 million dollars end quote
 
03:01:07.610 --> 03:01:07.620 align:start position:0%
right that is in severe conflict to
 
03:01:10.490 --> 03:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
right and that bill was drafted this
 
03:01:11.929 --> 03:01:11.939 align:start position:0%
year we're not talking about something
 
03:01:15.170 --> 03:01:15.180 align:start position:0%
from two years ago the Senate could have
 
03:01:18.110 --> 03:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
in their in their due diligence put in a
 
03:01:19.730 --> 03:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
number that was more representative of
 
03:01:21.530 --> 03:01:21.540 align:start position:0%
the cost of a facility
 
03:01:24.349 --> 03:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
that's on top of where is it and whether
 
03:01:26.870 --> 03:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
it's for 6 to 12 or 12 to 18 and I think
 
03:01:28.250 --> 03:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
our amendment that was proposed
 
03:01:29.690 --> 03:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
yesterday to start looking at some of
 
03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
those issues was critical that's why I'm
 
03:01:34.670 --> 03:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
having trouble with what was passed out
 
03:01:35.990 --> 03:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
of the Senate
 
03:01:38.630 --> 03:01:38.640 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative
 
03:01:40.190 --> 03:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
Stringham you have anything to add to
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:46.730 --> 03:01:46.740 align:start position:0%
um well I'm against sb1 as written given
 
03:01:50.330 --> 03:01:50.340 align:start position:0%
our lengthy discussions yesterday and uh
 
03:01:52.730 --> 03:01:52.740 align:start position:0%
the direction we were taking things
 
03:01:56.990 --> 03:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh representative Weiler
 
03:01:58.670 --> 03:01:58.680 align:start position:0%
we have to pass something we're two
 
03:02:01.070 --> 03:02:01.080 align:start position:0%
years behind there's a date coming up
 
03:02:02.750 --> 03:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
within days
 
03:02:04.309 --> 03:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
we can't just say we're going to kill
 
03:02:05.809 --> 03:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
this and start over again there isn't
 
03:02:07.490 --> 03:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
enough time next week we're going to get
 
03:02:08.809 --> 03:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
the budget and we're going to be buried
 
03:02:11.450 --> 03:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
in it we got to do something now today
 
03:02:15.349 --> 03:02:15.359 align:start position:0%
to move this along if we pass sb1 even
 
03:02:17.330 --> 03:02:17.340 align:start position:0%
if this thing's in it you don't like
 
03:02:19.490 --> 03:02:19.500 align:start position:0%
the most important thing in it we've
 
03:02:20.990 --> 03:02:21.000 align:start position:0%
moved the date out
 
03:02:23.090 --> 03:02:23.100 align:start position:0%
then when we get to the spending and the
 
03:02:24.830 --> 03:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
rest of it
 
03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
03:02:28.429 --> 03:02:28.439 align:start position:0%
be able to adjust that within the budget
 
03:02:32.090 --> 03:02:32.100 align:start position:0%
process and put it in hb2 if need be any
 
03:02:33.950 --> 03:02:33.960 align:start position:0%
amendments to it that we decide needs to
 
03:02:36.290 --> 03:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
be in there but we've got to pass
 
03:02:39.710 --> 03:02:39.720 align:start position:0%
something to move the date away from
 
03:02:43.429 --> 03:02:43.439 align:start position:0%
March 1st so I I wasn't clear I I'm
 
03:02:45.349 --> 03:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
proud this is probably not exactly the
 
03:02:47.150 --> 03:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
way the parliamentarian would run this
 
03:02:50.150 --> 03:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
but we're talking about sb1 I still
 
03:02:54.110 --> 03:02:54.120 align:start position:0%
intend to have us discuss the Division
 
03:02:56.450 --> 03:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
III amendment that we came to agreement
 
03:03:00.889 --> 03:03:00.899 align:start position:0%
on last night so so so I I want to see
 
03:03:03.290 --> 03:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
where we are on sb1 before we begin to
 
03:03:05.450 --> 03:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
entertain The Division III Amendment and
 
03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:07.620 align:start position:0%
to find out if anyone else has brought
 
03:03:11.090 --> 03:03:11.100 align:start position:0%
an amendment forward for us so
 
03:03:13.969 --> 03:03:13.979 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh representative
 
03:03:13.979 --> 03:03:15.950 align:start position:0%
um all right so uh representative
Wallner

03:03:15.950 --> 03:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
03:03:18.050 --> 03:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
I would I would not
 
03:03:21.110 --> 03:03:21.120 align:start position:0%
um support Senate bill one as it's uh
 
03:03:23.929 --> 03:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
before us right now I would um take a
 
03:03:25.610 --> 03:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
look I want to take a look at
 
03:03:28.969 --> 03:03:28.979 align:start position:0%
um amendments to it and um I'm really
 
03:03:31.670 --> 03:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
concerned that we still do not know the
 
03:03:34.550 --> 03:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
location of this facility and I think
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
that that's one of the first things we
 
03:03:38.929 --> 03:03:38.939 align:start position:0%
need to do is try to figure out where it
 
03:03:40.730 --> 03:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
is going to be
 
03:03:44.090 --> 03:03:44.100 align:start position:0%
and work with the communities and then
 
03:03:46.670 --> 03:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
move forward from there and I think in
 
03:03:48.410 --> 03:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
the budget is the place that we need to
 
03:03:50.870 --> 03:03:50.880 align:start position:0%
be looking at the financial aspects of
 
03:03:54.830 --> 03:03:54.840 align:start position:0%
this I would I would support
 
03:03:57.590 --> 03:03:57.600 align:start position:0%
um the department has testified number
 
03:03:59.750 --> 03:03:59.760 align:start position:0%
of times that they need additional funds
 
03:04:02.870 --> 03:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
to get through this biennium and I would
 
03:04:02.880 --> 03:04:03.889 align:start position:0%
to get through this biennium and I would
support

03:04:03.889 --> 03:04:03.899 align:start position:0%
support
 
03:04:03.899 --> 03:04:04.490 align:start position:0%
support
um

03:04:04.490 --> 03:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:07.610 --> 03:04:07.620 align:start position:0%
allocation of additional funds for them
 
03:04:09.769 --> 03:04:09.779 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for that discussion
 
03:04:12.349 --> 03:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative tolerski
 
03:04:14.030 --> 03:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:04:16.790 --> 03:04:16.800 align:start position:0%
um sb1 is written I think as a division
 
03:04:19.490 --> 03:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
we've pinpointed some problems with and
 
03:04:21.830 --> 03:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
i would support discussion of the
 
03:04:23.389 --> 03:04:23.399 align:start position:0%
Amendments that we have reviewed in the
 
03:04:24.590 --> 03:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
past few days
 
03:04:27.950 --> 03:04:27.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative nordgren
 
03:04:32.090 --> 03:04:32.100 align:start position:0%
I agree with Mary Jane and Laura
 
03:04:35.929 --> 03:04:35.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
certainly we did spend a great session
 
03:04:41.330 --> 03:04:41.340 align:start position:0%
as representative hole said on amending
 
03:04:44.389 --> 03:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
it so I think to move forward I would
 
03:04:47.210 --> 03:04:47.220 align:start position:0%
suggest voting ought to pass on the bill
 
03:04:48.710 --> 03:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
and then take up the Amendments if
 
03:04:52.010 --> 03:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:53.990 --> 03:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
all right so I think we just took a
 
03:04:56.889 --> 03:04:56.899 align:start position:0%
Strava while we got the discussion I I
 
03:05:02.469 --> 03:05:02.479 align:start position:0%
recorded in my head is three yay OTP 5
 
03:05:07.250 --> 03:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
nay on passing sb1 or recommending a
 
03:05:09.469 --> 03:05:09.479 align:start position:0%
passage out of division three does
 
03:05:12.230 --> 03:05:12.240 align:start position:0%
anyone want to have me go around and do
 
03:05:14.269 --> 03:05:14.279 align:start position:0%
a more formal Vote or would you accept
 
03:05:16.969 --> 03:05:16.979 align:start position:0%
that it's probably three five
 
03:05:20.929 --> 03:05:20.939 align:start position:0%
oh okay so
 
03:05:23.870 --> 03:05:23.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you let's transition uh Mr
 
03:05:27.290 --> 03:05:27.300 align:start position:0%
Ripple have you laid out the the current
 
03:05:30.170 --> 03:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
amendment that we worked on last night
 
03:05:33.170 --> 03:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
03:05:36.830 --> 03:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh actually there was another change the
 
03:05:39.230 --> 03:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
Dinky Dinky little typo
 
03:05:41.750 --> 03:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
that uh that has since been fixed since
 
03:05:41.760 --> 03:05:42.650 align:start position:0%
that uh that has since been fixed since
you

03:05:42.650 --> 03:05:42.660 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:05:47.090 --> 03:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:49.969 --> 03:05:49.979 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman was the issue of Quorum
 
03:05:52.370 --> 03:05:52.380 align:start position:0%
addressed in that typo
 
03:05:54.050 --> 03:05:54.060 align:start position:0%
there was a question raised regarding
 
03:05:56.389 --> 03:05:56.399 align:start position:0%
yeah we can talk about that but but the
 
03:05:59.170 --> 03:05:59.180 align:start position:0%
short answer is yes we we we we we we
 
03:06:02.030 --> 03:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
changed the numbers of representatives
 
03:06:04.610 --> 03:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
from the local community from three to
 
03:06:07.370 --> 03:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
just being representatives to let the
 
03:06:10.370 --> 03:06:10.380 align:start position:0%
commission find its right size and then
 
03:06:12.769 --> 03:06:12.779 align:start position:0%
without a clear number of how many would
 
03:06:15.530 --> 03:06:15.540 align:start position:0%
be on the commission we we made it a
 
03:06:17.690 --> 03:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
majority of those appointed to the
 
03:06:20.750 --> 03:06:20.760 align:start position:0%
commission so so I think that resolved
 
03:06:23.650 --> 03:06:23.660 align:start position:0%
that issue and what we just talked about
 
03:06:27.530 --> 03:06:27.540 align:start position:0%
is on we're jumping around a little bit
 
03:06:29.990 --> 03:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
but since you brought it up on page two
 
03:06:30.000 --> 03:06:31.969 align:start position:0%
but since you brought it up on page two
line

03:06:31.969 --> 03:06:31.979 align:start position:0%
line
 
03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
15 and line 16 a version that you saw
 
03:06:39.469 --> 03:06:39.479 align:start position:0%
last night said three representatives
 
03:06:41.450 --> 03:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
and instead of saying three
 
03:06:43.809 --> 03:06:43.819 align:start position:0%
Representatives we made it generically
 
03:06:47.389 --> 03:06:47.399 align:start position:0%
representatives and and that was so that
 
03:06:49.849 --> 03:06:49.859 align:start position:0%
we didn't waste motion we've we've heard
 
03:06:51.889 --> 03:06:51.899 align:start position:0%
that there are three potential places we
 
03:06:53.030 --> 03:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
could go
 
03:06:56.269 --> 03:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
one of them doesn't sound like a it's
 
03:06:58.370 --> 03:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
going to pass the common sense test so
 
03:07:00.769 --> 03:07:00.779 align:start position:0%
why delay the commission looking for
 
03:07:03.230 --> 03:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
somebody to sit on the board that's
 
03:07:06.590 --> 03:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
irrelevant so so that's that's what that
 
03:07:09.950 --> 03:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
that's why that got changed and then
 
03:07:12.769 --> 03:07:12.779 align:start position:0%
um the other little typo
 
03:07:17.030 --> 03:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
from what you saw last night is on line
 
03:07:17.040 --> 03:07:18.710 align:start position:0%
from what you saw last night is on line
34.

03:07:18.710 --> 03:07:18.720 align:start position:0%
34.
 
03:07:21.349 --> 03:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
relative to a commission
 
03:07:25.070 --> 03:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
to study Community impacts uh that that
 
03:07:27.469 --> 03:07:27.479 align:start position:0%
phrase is consistent with the way we
 
03:07:28.910 --> 03:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
describe the commission and the
 
03:07:32.690 --> 03:07:32.700 align:start position:0%
amendment and and last night had the
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
previous title committee to study Public
 
03:07:37.910 --> 03:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
Safety so it's just internally making
 
03:07:39.889 --> 03:07:39.899 align:start position:0%
the document internally compatible
 
03:07:42.110 --> 03:07:42.120 align:start position:0%
there's no change
 
03:07:42.120 --> 03:07:43.610 align:start position:0%
there's no change
so

03:07:43.610 --> 03:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:07:43.620 --> 03:07:44.210 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:07:44.210 --> 03:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:07:48.429 --> 03:07:48.439 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at Amendment zero four
 
03:07:52.309 --> 03:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
five four Hotel
 
03:07:55.550 --> 03:07:55.560 align:start position:0%
um it basically on step nine I think
 
03:07:58.370 --> 03:07:58.380 align:start position:0%
we're unanimous that we want
 
03:08:02.630 --> 03:08:02.640 align:start position:0%
um the the repeal of the closure date
 
03:08:02.640 --> 03:08:03.349 align:start position:0%
um the the repeal of the closure date
um

03:08:03.349 --> 03:08:03.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:06.590 --> 03:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
I haven't heard any disagreement today
 
03:08:10.130 --> 03:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
about the appropriation of 1.5 million
 
03:08:11.630 --> 03:08:11.640 align:start position:0%
dollars so that they can continue
 
03:08:14.690 --> 03:08:14.700 align:start position:0%
operations through the balance of the
 
03:08:16.370 --> 03:08:16.380 align:start position:0%
year that's four months of operating
 
03:08:18.950 --> 03:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
expense anything that they don't spend
 
03:08:22.130 --> 03:08:22.140 align:start position:0%
would end up getting lapsed back anyways
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
so is there any discussion or we are we
 
03:08:28.849 --> 03:08:28.859 align:start position:0%
okay everyone's okay with that
 
03:08:28.859 --> 03:08:30.230 align:start position:0%
okay everyone's okay with that
appropriation

03:08:30.230 --> 03:08:30.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
okay so now we're down to line 15.
 
03:08:37.849 --> 03:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
there's now some contention on what was
 
03:08:41.690 --> 03:08:41.700 align:start position:0%
uh birthed in the walner amendment which
 
03:08:44.570 --> 03:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
was uh putting aside the sum of two
 
03:08:47.570 --> 03:08:47.580 align:start position:0%
million dollars uh so that they could
 
03:08:51.050 --> 03:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
begin the department could begin to
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
acquire services for site evaluation
 
03:08:56.090 --> 03:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
everyone says we need site evaluation so
 
03:08:58.309 --> 03:08:58.319 align:start position:0%
there's site evaluation and that two
 
03:08:59.710 --> 03:08:59.720 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
architect consultation and development
 
03:09:05.150 --> 03:09:05.160 align:start position:0%
of design options for any replacement
 
03:09:08.269 --> 03:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
facility we went on to say that we want
 
03:09:10.610 --> 03:09:10.620 align:start position:0%
two options considered we want an option
 
03:09:13.309 --> 03:09:13.319 align:start position:0%
for six to twelve and we wanted an
 
03:09:16.250 --> 03:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
option of 12 to 18. so that's that's
 
03:09:18.410 --> 03:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's in this version of the amendment
 
03:09:20.630 --> 03:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
that didn't come in initially but we
 
03:09:22.429 --> 03:09:22.439 align:start position:0%
added it in our conversations and
 
03:09:24.950 --> 03:09:24.960 align:start position:0%
agreements last night
 
03:09:26.690 --> 03:09:26.700 align:start position:0%
um Department shall present its
 
03:09:28.969 --> 03:09:28.979 align:start position:0%
recommended site for the facility no
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
later than the 30th of September I know
 
03:09:33.590 --> 03:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
that there's a lot of pressure to do it
 
03:09:36.650 --> 03:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
sooner than that I think if we just
 
03:09:39.410 --> 03:09:39.420 align:start position:0%
listen to what's in the wind it's
 
03:09:41.330 --> 03:09:41.340 align:start position:0%
already been determined where it's
 
03:09:44.110 --> 03:09:44.120 align:start position:0%
probably going to be and
 
03:09:49.510 --> 03:09:49.520 align:start position:0%
I I I I I I I I I I don't understand
 
03:09:52.490 --> 03:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
that being as contentious as it has
 
03:09:56.889 --> 03:09:56.899 align:start position:0%
become But but so be it
 
03:10:00.290 --> 03:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
line 22 the appropriation contained in
 
03:10:03.230 --> 03:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
the section shall not lapse in June of
 
03:10:05.510 --> 03:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
25 this is different than the operations
 
03:10:07.630 --> 03:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
money this is the
 
03:10:10.370 --> 03:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
architect money and then the governor
 
03:10:11.750 --> 03:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
can draw a warrant
 
03:10:16.130 --> 03:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
so that is what is in line 15. the first
 
03:10:17.929 --> 03:10:17.939 align:start position:0%
things first
 
03:10:20.750 --> 03:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
is this consistent with what you think
 
03:10:23.030 --> 03:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
we said last night this is a different
 
03:10:25.610 --> 03:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
question than whether or not you still
 
03:10:28.550 --> 03:10:28.560 align:start position:0%
support it today the first thing is is
 
03:10:31.130 --> 03:10:31.140 align:start position:0%
this accurate
 
03:10:33.650 --> 03:10:33.660 align:start position:0%
is anyone disputing the accuracy of what
 
03:10:35.450 --> 03:10:35.460 align:start position:0%
we did
 
03:10:38.990 --> 03:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
03:10:43.130 --> 03:10:43.140 align:start position:0%
um I I will say that I support
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
this from the walner amendment because
 
03:10:48.590 --> 03:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
it makes sense you you on a critical
 
03:10:53.030 --> 03:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
path we want a new facility so that we
 
03:10:56.150 --> 03:10:56.160 align:start position:0%
can transition to a fully therapeutic
 
03:10:58.130 --> 03:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
model that's in the benefit of best
 
03:11:00.950 --> 03:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
interests of the kids best interests of
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
03:11:04.670 --> 03:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
and on the critical path
 
03:11:08.170 --> 03:11:08.180 align:start position:0%
these Services site selection
 
03:11:11.690 --> 03:11:11.700 align:start position:0%
is kind of the first step and I'm
 
03:11:13.490 --> 03:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
hearing people say we got to do side
 
03:11:15.889 --> 03:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
evaluation but we don't need to
 
03:11:17.330 --> 03:11:17.340 align:start position:0%
appropriate the money to do site
 
03:11:19.550 --> 03:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
evaluation we just need to do site
 
03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
evaluation and so this is a do Loop in
 
03:11:24.469 --> 03:11:24.479 align:start position:0%
the software world that just has me
 
03:11:24.479 --> 03:11:25.550 align:start position:0%
the software world that just has me
boggled

03:11:25.550 --> 03:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
boggled
 
03:11:28.849 --> 03:11:28.859 align:start position:0%
so this is this is let's one step at a
 
03:11:30.769 --> 03:11:30.779 align:start position:0%
time let's go do the side evaluation
 
03:11:33.230 --> 03:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
let's go appropriate the money
 
03:11:36.830 --> 03:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
so that was my discussion of lines 25
 
03:11:39.110 --> 03:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
through 31.
 
03:11:41.929 --> 03:11:41.939 align:start position:0%
are there other points of view we'd love
 
03:11:44.210 --> 03:11:44.220 align:start position:0%
to hear other points of view
 
03:11:45.790 --> 03:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:11:47.990 --> 03:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
03:11:50.809 --> 03:11:50.819 align:start position:0%
well when I got home last night and
 
03:11:53.210 --> 03:11:53.220 align:start position:0%
um I started reading this
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
I always went back to it feels like
 
03:12:00.050 --> 03:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
we're putting the cart
 
03:12:02.750 --> 03:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the whole train before the horse
 
03:12:07.070 --> 03:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
it's just we need I think someone needs
 
03:12:10.849 --> 03:12:10.859 align:start position:0%
to make a decision about the site
 
03:12:14.090 --> 03:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
and I think one of the best ways to make
 
03:12:16.969 --> 03:12:16.979 align:start position:0%
that decision is for the Department to
 
03:12:19.910 --> 03:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
say where they think they would be
 
03:12:22.130 --> 03:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
most in favor of being co-located
 
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
because they say that there's a lot of
 
03:12:28.370 --> 03:12:28.380 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of efficiencies there's a
 
03:12:30.349 --> 03:12:30.359 align:start position:0%
lot of things to be gained by one site
 
03:12:31.730 --> 03:12:31.740 align:start position:0%
over another
 
03:12:35.269 --> 03:12:35.279 align:start position:0%
and so I think that would be the first
 
03:12:35.279 --> 03:12:36.290 align:start position:0%
and so I think that would be the first
thing

03:12:36.290 --> 03:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
thing
 
03:12:39.950 --> 03:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
that needs to happen is deciding where
 
03:12:42.710 --> 03:12:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to be and then the next part
 
03:12:45.950 --> 03:12:45.960 align:start position:0%
of that is working with the commission
 
03:12:49.010 --> 03:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
around that which is made up of people
 
03:12:52.130 --> 03:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
from the the communities
 
03:12:55.429 --> 03:12:55.439 align:start position:0%
and start working with them around
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
um the kinds of things that you think
 
03:13:01.150 --> 03:13:01.160 align:start position:0%
the community needs to have available
 
03:13:04.429 --> 03:13:04.439 align:start position:0%
needs to know about the um about the
 
03:13:07.570 --> 03:13:07.580 align:start position:0%
program before we move into
 
03:13:10.450 --> 03:13:10.460 align:start position:0%
architectural drawings
 
03:13:13.910 --> 03:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
design all of those other things let's
 
03:13:16.550 --> 03:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
decide where it is the sooner we do that
 
03:13:19.370 --> 03:13:19.380 align:start position:0%
I think the better equipped we will be
 
03:13:22.490 --> 03:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
to move forward and I also think that a
 
03:13:24.410 --> 03:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
lot of this is really budget work
 
03:13:26.750 --> 03:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
because there are
 
03:13:29.030 --> 03:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
um still
 
03:13:30.469 --> 03:13:30.479 align:start position:0%
sums of money that need to be
 
03:13:32.330 --> 03:13:32.340 align:start position:0%
appropriated in the budget
 
03:13:35.630 --> 03:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
so so the clerk for clarification would
 
03:13:38.450 --> 03:13:38.460 align:start position:0%
you strike that entire paragraph or
 
03:13:41.210 --> 03:13:41.220 align:start position:0%
would you perhaps reduce the amount of
 
03:13:43.730 --> 03:13:43.740 align:start position:0%
money appropriated and limit the work
 
03:13:47.150 --> 03:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
simply to site evaluation because we've
 
03:13:49.190 --> 03:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
not technically done a site evaluation
 
03:13:51.710 --> 03:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
which is the normal first step in
 
03:13:54.349 --> 03:13:54.359 align:start position:0%
project management before you select a
 
03:13:58.490 --> 03:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
site so so would you preserve the
 
03:14:01.550 --> 03:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph and limit it so that we put
 
03:14:04.610 --> 03:14:04.620 align:start position:0%
some money into site selection
 
03:14:06.710 --> 03:14:06.720 align:start position:0%
what I would do is I would direct the
 
03:14:08.090 --> 03:14:08.100 align:start position:0%
department to
 
03:14:11.570 --> 03:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
make the best choice from programmatic
 
03:14:11.580 --> 03:14:12.889 align:start position:0%
make the best choice from programmatic
reasons

03:14:12.889 --> 03:14:12.899 align:start position:0%
reasons
 
03:14:16.309 --> 03:14:16.319 align:start position:0%
which site they prefer
 
03:14:19.370 --> 03:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that would necessarily
 
03:14:19.380 --> 03:14:20.750 align:start position:0%
and I don't think that would necessarily
need

03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
need
 
03:14:23.870 --> 03:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
financial support
 
03:14:27.730 --> 03:14:27.740 align:start position:0%
if they were do that today would that be
 
03:14:30.530 --> 03:14:30.540 align:start position:0%
dispositive in your view I mean it seems
 
03:14:31.790 --> 03:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
to me like we would need something
 
03:14:34.210 --> 03:14:34.220 align:start position:0%
formal from the commissioner or somebody
 
03:14:36.830 --> 03:14:36.840 align:start position:0%
you I think we already know they want
 
03:14:39.469 --> 03:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
Hamstead everyone wants Hampstead and
 
03:14:41.210 --> 03:14:41.220 align:start position:0%
but the problem is if you live in
 
03:14:41.220 --> 03:14:42.429 align:start position:0%
but the problem is if you live in
Hampstead

03:14:42.429 --> 03:14:42.439 align:start position:0%
Hampstead
 
03:14:44.990 --> 03:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
you have not been respected yet we
 
03:14:48.410 --> 03:14:48.420 align:start position:0%
haven't gone to Hampstead to say hey
 
03:14:50.809 --> 03:14:50.819 align:start position:0%
this is what we're thinking what what's
 
03:14:53.630 --> 03:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
it going to involve well so what what
 
03:14:56.690 --> 03:14:56.700 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is say okay here's
 
03:14:59.210 --> 03:14:59.220 align:start position:0%
some money here's the commission go
 
03:15:01.490 --> 03:15:01.500 align:start position:0%
forward and start working with the
 
03:15:04.610 --> 03:15:04.620 align:start position:0%
various communities we we can't show up
 
03:15:07.490 --> 03:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
and say in my view we've already decided
 
03:15:09.830 --> 03:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
it's going to be in Hampstead now you
 
03:15:12.050 --> 03:15:12.060 align:start position:0%
tell us why that's not a good idea
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's that's not the way this should
 
03:15:16.250 --> 03:15:16.260 align:start position:0%
work this should be us coming to them
 
03:15:17.929 --> 03:15:17.939 align:start position:0%
saying hey look we're looking at three
 
03:15:21.530 --> 03:15:21.540 align:start position:0%
Alternatives and and this one's got
 
03:15:23.389 --> 03:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
these advantages these ones got those
 
03:15:26.630 --> 03:15:26.640 align:start position:0%
discipline advantages and You by God you
 
03:15:31.130 --> 03:15:31.140 align:start position:0%
are just right you know uh so so I I
 
03:15:33.530 --> 03:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
think I think you're asking we keep
 
03:15:36.290 --> 03:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
talking about process I think you your
 
03:15:40.969 --> 03:15:40.979 align:start position:0%
approach breaks a normal process we
 
03:15:43.309 --> 03:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
should do site evaluation and work
 
03:15:45.550 --> 03:15:45.560 align:start position:0%
respectfully with the three communities
 
03:15:50.330 --> 03:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
before we stick a pin in the na in the
 
03:15:53.210 --> 03:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
map and say this is where it shall be
 
03:15:54.830 --> 03:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
deal with it
 
03:15:57.769 --> 03:15:57.779 align:start position:0%
which which is my really rough
 
03:15:59.510 --> 03:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
translation of what I'm hearing you say
 
03:16:01.730 --> 03:16:01.740 align:start position:0%
representative and I apologize that was
 
03:16:03.910 --> 03:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
that was rude I don't mean it to be rude
 
03:16:07.130 --> 03:16:07.140 align:start position:0%
uh after two years I'm getting a little
 
03:16:07.140 --> 03:16:10.910 align:start position:0%
uh after two years I'm getting a little
surly

03:16:10.910 --> 03:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:15.110 --> 03:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
this I would have the department this is
 
03:16:17.290 --> 03:16:17.300 align:start position:0%
me talking I would have the department
 
03:16:21.050 --> 03:16:21.060 align:start position:0%
say where it is they feel is the best
 
03:16:24.349 --> 03:16:24.359 align:start position:0%
location for this facility
 
03:16:28.490 --> 03:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
from a standpoint of what is going to
 
03:16:31.969 --> 03:16:31.979 align:start position:0%
meet the needs of the kids the families
 
03:16:35.630 --> 03:16:35.640 align:start position:0%
and to start that conversation now with
 
03:16:37.190 --> 03:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
the community
 
03:16:40.849 --> 03:16:40.859 align:start position:0%
and there's no reason to be speaking to
 
03:16:42.650 --> 03:16:42.660 align:start position:0%
me there's no reason to be speaking with
 
03:16:44.630 --> 03:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
three different communities all at the
 
03:16:47.809 --> 03:16:47.819 align:start position:0%
same time when the department you may be
 
03:16:49.849 --> 03:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
right the department may already know
 
03:16:52.010 --> 03:16:52.020 align:start position:0%
where they want to go and now is the
 
03:16:53.990 --> 03:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
time to start talking with that
 
03:16:57.050 --> 03:16:57.060 align:start position:0%
community and start really understanding
 
03:16:59.349 --> 03:16:59.359 align:start position:0%
what this involves
 
03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:02.220 align:start position:0%
so Mr rips and I think I think we've
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
heard a lot from you and and picked up
 
03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
on your reluctance to just answer the
 
03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
question point blank is is this your is
 
03:17:11.150 --> 03:17:11.160 align:start position:0%
this your supervisor your manager your
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
director your your assistant
 
03:17:15.889 --> 03:17:15.899 align:start position:0%
commissioner in the audience
 
03:17:17.870 --> 03:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
because I'd love to hear from you I
 
03:17:19.610 --> 03:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from the person
 
03:17:22.190 --> 03:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
highest in the food chain on this
 
03:17:25.550 --> 03:17:25.560 align:start position:0%
because I I think poor Mr ribson is
 
03:17:27.889 --> 03:17:27.899 align:start position:0%
being put in a highly awkward spot where
 
03:17:30.230 --> 03:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
he doesn't have the authority to say
 
03:17:32.929 --> 03:17:32.939 align:start position:0%
that it's going to be in Hampstead and
 
03:17:35.210 --> 03:17:35.220 align:start position:0%
and if I were Mr Williams I'd advise him
 
03:17:37.190 --> 03:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
not to say that if it is his friend I
 
03:17:39.050 --> 03:17:39.060 align:start position:0%
would say I I don't think you should
 
03:17:42.769 --> 03:17:42.779 align:start position:0%
answer that question but you you you are
 
03:17:45.050 --> 03:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
a leader you you get paid The Big Box
 
03:17:47.030 --> 03:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
come on up and tell us what you think
 
03:17:49.969 --> 03:17:49.979 align:start position:0%
really think about Hampstead please I'll
 
03:17:51.889 --> 03:17:51.899 align:start position:0%
do all due respect I think I think I'm
 
03:17:56.750 --> 03:17:56.760 align:start position:0%
I'm a leader too and um and uh
 
03:17:58.849 --> 03:17:58.859 align:start position:0%
to be fair right
 
03:18:00.830 --> 03:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
there as I've shared there are three
 
03:18:02.510 --> 03:18:02.520 align:start position:0%
possible sites that are being considered
 
03:18:04.070 --> 03:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
I think it was pretty clear when we
 
03:18:05.690 --> 03:18:05.700 align:start position:0%
spoke yesterday of the three possible
 
03:18:07.969 --> 03:18:07.979 align:start position:0%
sites which one has the most is the most
 
03:18:10.550 --> 03:18:10.560 align:start position:0%
advantageous and that is Hampstead but
 
03:18:13.730 --> 03:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
until we actually do the work to do site
 
03:18:15.230 --> 03:18:15.240 align:start position:0%
evaluation determine if that's even
 
03:18:17.630 --> 03:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
feasible for us to say that that's the
 
03:18:19.490 --> 03:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
site would be irresponsible
 
03:18:22.730 --> 03:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
right so that's I I don't think we can
 
03:18:25.610 --> 03:18:25.620 align:start position:0%
give you the solid answer you won until
 
03:18:28.250 --> 03:18:28.260 align:start position:0%
the work is done to see and even then
 
03:18:29.630 --> 03:18:29.640 align:start position:0%
that might not be the final decision
 
03:18:32.090 --> 03:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
because right the department also is not
 
03:18:33.710 --> 03:18:33.720 align:start position:0%
the final decider on these things right
 
03:18:36.469 --> 03:18:36.479 align:start position:0%
you work in an executive branch that has
 
03:18:39.290 --> 03:18:39.300 align:start position:0%
a governor and executive Council so you
 
03:18:41.450 --> 03:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
know the opinion that I express is not
 
03:18:43.849 --> 03:18:43.859 align:start position:0%
necessarily what the final decision is
 
03:18:46.429 --> 03:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
so you know I I understand frustration
 
03:18:48.230 --> 03:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
and wanting an answer but at the same
 
03:18:50.570 --> 03:18:50.580 align:start position:0%
time you know if I give you an answer it
 
03:18:52.610 --> 03:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
it's an answer that I don't actually
 
03:18:54.830 --> 03:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
have the ability to provide
 
03:18:57.590 --> 03:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
and an answer that was an Army guy who
 
03:18:59.809 --> 03:18:59.819 align:start position:0%
trained Afghans how to shoot we we
 
03:19:01.969 --> 03:19:01.979 align:start position:0%
taught them ready aim fire we didn't
 
03:19:04.490 --> 03:19:04.500 align:start position:0%
teach them ready fire aim and that's
 
03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
what I I think I'm hearing is we want to
 
03:19:10.429 --> 03:19:10.439 align:start position:0%
just say okay we're ready go ahead and
 
03:19:12.710 --> 03:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
fire we're going to go to Hampstead and
 
03:19:14.210 --> 03:19:14.220 align:start position:0%
then later we'll keep figuring out
 
03:19:16.670 --> 03:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the aiming I don't
 
03:19:18.889 --> 03:19:18.899 align:start position:0%
want to do that I wanted us to get ready
 
03:19:21.650 --> 03:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
want us to aim at the three sites and
 
03:19:23.630 --> 03:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
then I want us to pull the trigger on
 
03:19:26.750 --> 03:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
the correct site there's a discipline
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
process here I'd love to follow it and
 
03:19:33.050 --> 03:19:33.060 align:start position:0%
Madam Deputy Commissioner would you read
 
03:19:35.990 --> 03:19:36.000 align:start position:0%
your name and I'll I'll concur with with
 
03:19:38.630 --> 03:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
Joe and I think there are many you know
 
03:19:40.010 --> 03:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
considerations that need to be put into
 
03:19:41.990 --> 03:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
this I think Joe presented yesterday to
 
03:19:43.670 --> 03:19:43.680 align:start position:0%
your committee on some of the shared
 
03:19:45.769 --> 03:19:45.779 align:start position:0%
saving possibilities
 
03:19:47.870 --> 03:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
um Joe and I work closely with Hampstead
 
03:19:49.250 --> 03:19:49.260 align:start position:0%
Hospital but there may be other
 
03:19:51.050 --> 03:19:51.060 align:start position:0%
considerations as well so we really are
 
03:19:54.050 --> 03:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
not in a position nor is it our role to
 
03:19:56.870 --> 03:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
be um to be stating what the site should
 
03:19:59.570 --> 03:19:59.580 align:start position:0%
be so we can't get there today
 
03:20:02.630 --> 03:20:02.640 align:start position:0%
okay I I hope the media is fair with you
 
03:20:05.630 --> 03:20:05.640 align:start position:0%
we've asked you to step into a very
 
03:20:08.870 --> 03:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
awkward situation and I apologize and I
 
03:20:10.870 --> 03:20:10.880 align:start position:0%
hope you're treated fairly
 
03:20:13.130 --> 03:20:13.140 align:start position:0%
representative Norton and then
 
03:20:16.130 --> 03:20:16.140 align:start position:0%
representative Poole thank you Mr chair
 
03:20:16.910 --> 03:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
um I
 
03:20:20.870 --> 03:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:24.230 --> 03:20:24.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:26.990 --> 03:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
we'll start today and I just was
 
03:20:28.849 --> 03:20:28.859 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had any comments about
 
03:20:28.859 --> 03:20:30.790 align:start position:0%
wondering if you had any comments about
it

03:20:30.790 --> 03:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:20:30.800 --> 03:20:32.330 align:start position:0%
it
so

03:20:32.330 --> 03:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:20:34.969 --> 03:20:34.979 align:start position:0%
um in general right I still support
 
03:20:37.969 --> 03:20:37.979 align:start position:0%
Senate bill one I think that the work
 
03:20:39.469 --> 03:20:39.479 align:start position:0%
has been done to know where we need to
 
03:20:41.150 --> 03:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
move this
 
03:20:42.349 --> 03:20:42.359 align:start position:0%
um yes there's some questions that
 
03:20:43.429 --> 03:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
aren't going to be answered until we
 
03:20:44.990 --> 03:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
move through the process and you know
 
03:20:46.370 --> 03:20:46.380 align:start position:0%
honestly I'd
 
03:20:48.889 --> 03:20:48.899 align:start position:0%
I'd wish that's what I think is the
 
03:20:50.389 --> 03:20:50.399 align:start position:0%
right path forward
 
03:20:52.490 --> 03:20:52.500 align:start position:0%
the amendment you know there's some very
 
03:20:53.809 --> 03:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
critical things that have to happen
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
right now the most critical thing that
 
03:20:58.730 --> 03:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
has to happen right now is that the
 
03:21:00.769 --> 03:21:00.779 align:start position:0%
facility doesn't close in three weeks
 
03:21:02.510 --> 03:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
that absolutely needs to happen
 
03:21:04.130 --> 03:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
hopefully by the end of the day today
 
03:21:06.290 --> 03:21:06.300 align:start position:0%
that there's agreement on that
 
03:21:08.389 --> 03:21:08.399 align:start position:0%
um and that there's movement on that I
 
03:21:09.769 --> 03:21:09.779 align:start position:0%
would like us to move forward with the
 
03:21:11.990 --> 03:21:12.000 align:start position:0%
rest of the package but that's the
 
03:21:14.269 --> 03:21:14.279 align:start position:0%
absolutely critical point
 
03:21:16.969 --> 03:21:16.979 align:start position:0%
you have a follow-up
 
03:21:19.010 --> 03:21:19.020 align:start position:0%
I represent a whole
 
03:21:20.809 --> 03:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:21:23.030 --> 03:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
coming at this from a technical
 
03:21:24.950 --> 03:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
background and thinking about process
 
03:21:26.990 --> 03:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
right there's three options that are
 
03:21:29.150 --> 03:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
currently in play I'm not aware of any
 
03:21:30.769 --> 03:21:30.779 align:start position:0%
others no one has discussed any others
 
03:21:33.050 --> 03:21:33.060 align:start position:0%
but typically you rank them relative to
 
03:21:34.610 --> 03:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
one another
 
03:21:37.250 --> 03:21:37.260 align:start position:0%
one another over a number of criteria
 
03:21:39.290 --> 03:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
when can the department have that
 
03:21:41.809 --> 03:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
information to us
 
03:21:44.269 --> 03:21:44.279 align:start position:0%
I I think I've already kind of assessed
 
03:21:46.010 --> 03:21:46.020 align:start position:0%
for everybody yesterday what what the
 
03:21:46.020 --> 03:21:47.269 align:start position:0%
for everybody yesterday what what the
Departments

03:21:47.269 --> 03:21:47.279 align:start position:0%
Departments
 
03:21:49.010 --> 03:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
position is on that
 
03:21:52.130 --> 03:21:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
all of them so
 
03:21:57.290 --> 03:21:57.300 align:start position:0%
um part of this also is getting some
 
03:21:58.969 --> 03:21:58.979 align:start position:0%
feedback from the various communities
 
03:22:01.429 --> 03:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
that are in play right so it's more than
 
03:22:03.290 --> 03:22:03.300 align:start position:0%
just correct what the how the department
 
03:22:05.389 --> 03:22:05.399 align:start position:0%
sees it one of the criteria on this list
 
03:22:07.309 --> 03:22:07.319 align:start position:0%
by which we will be making the decision
 
03:22:10.490 --> 03:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
right is how the community feels what
 
03:22:12.410 --> 03:22:12.420 align:start position:0%
the impact of the community will be in
 
03:22:14.269 --> 03:22:14.279 align:start position:0%
terms of Public Services a bunch of
 
03:22:15.230 --> 03:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
other things that were discussed
 
03:22:19.190 --> 03:22:19.200 align:start position:0%
yesterday in our division
 
03:22:21.950 --> 03:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
I'm used to seeing this as something
 
03:22:24.530 --> 03:22:24.540 align:start position:0%
called the Pew chart p-u-g-h which is a
 
03:22:26.269 --> 03:22:26.279 align:start position:0%
process by which you do this you rank
 
03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
your options on one to axis and you rank
 
03:22:30.469 --> 03:22:30.479 align:start position:0%
the criteria by which you're going to
 
03:22:32.150 --> 03:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
score those options on the other axis
 
03:22:35.030 --> 03:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
and then you just do do the analysis and
 
03:22:37.429 --> 03:22:37.439 align:start position:0%
go through this I would personally like
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
to see that as soon as possible I don't
 
03:22:40.730 --> 03:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
know how quickly we can do that that
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
might involve having a meeting over in
 
03:22:44.750 --> 03:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
Hampstead might have a meeting in
 
03:22:47.570 --> 03:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
Concord somewhere to find and get some
 
03:22:49.309 --> 03:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
feedback that may take a couple of days
 
03:22:51.710 --> 03:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
I hear you that we can't we need to
 
03:22:53.269 --> 03:22:53.279 align:start position:0%
address the issue of closure right away
 
03:22:56.330 --> 03:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
got it that's which is in my eyes at
 
03:22:58.610 --> 03:22:58.620 align:start position:0%
least lines nine and following at a
 
03:23:00.590 --> 03:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
minimum but I would like to see that the
 
03:23:02.150 --> 03:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
department takes lead
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
and starts to schedule public feedback
 
03:23:06.830 --> 03:23:06.840 align:start position:0%
sessions from these communities so we
 
03:23:08.210 --> 03:23:08.220 align:start position:0%
understand that because that's important
 
03:23:14.690 --> 03:23:14.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:16.309 --> 03:23:16.319 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if that was a question or
 
03:23:18.710 --> 03:23:18.720 align:start position:0%
not but I guess it's how if that is the
 
03:23:20.510 --> 03:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
request any idea how long it would take
 
03:23:23.090 --> 03:23:23.100 align:start position:0%
to schedule that and get back to us I
 
03:23:24.170 --> 03:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
don't know how long that would take I'd
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
have to look into that and talk to other
 
03:23:27.349 --> 03:23:27.359 align:start position:0%
folks so let me ask you about
 
03:23:30.530 --> 03:23:30.540 align:start position:0%
criticality I I know what the hot urgent
 
03:23:33.229 --> 03:23:33.239 align:start position:0%
burning issues are the the two we need
 
03:23:35.450 --> 03:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
more time we need some operations money
 
03:23:38.090 --> 03:23:38.100 align:start position:0%
got it okay
 
03:23:41.570 --> 03:23:41.580 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm pretty fired up on the idea that
 
03:23:44.990 --> 03:23:45.000 align:start position:0%
we have some arpa money out there
 
03:23:48.410 --> 03:23:48.420 align:start position:0%
that uh we have to hit some milestones
 
03:23:50.929 --> 03:23:50.939 align:start position:0%
in order to be able to use it I'm not a
 
03:23:53.090 --> 03:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
gopher expert but you know I think it's
 
03:23:55.790 --> 03:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
fairly clear that
 
03:23:59.929 --> 03:23:59.939 align:start position:0%
the longer we wait the more at risk I
 
03:24:02.030 --> 03:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
can't measure that risk I just think
 
03:24:03.590 --> 03:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
that that's there that the longer we
 
03:24:07.550 --> 03:24:07.560 align:start position:0%
wait the more there's risk so so
 
03:24:11.090 --> 03:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
is it critical that we go ahead and
 
03:24:14.750 --> 03:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
begin the site evaluation that's in this
 
03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
paragraph on the two million dollar
 
03:24:19.010 --> 03:24:19.020 align:start position:0%
appropriation is it critical that we
 
03:24:22.010 --> 03:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
begin that and fund that now or do you
 
03:24:25.490 --> 03:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
already have the money and ability to go
 
03:24:27.590 --> 03:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
ahead and begin that formal Society
 
03:24:31.010 --> 03:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
evaluation without legislative action we
 
03:24:32.809 --> 03:24:32.819 align:start position:0%
do not have the resources to do any of
 
03:24:35.210 --> 03:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
that the process that had been
 
03:24:37.490 --> 03:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
envisioned working with Das and the
 
03:24:38.870 --> 03:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Public Works that that was
 
03:24:40.370 --> 03:24:40.380 align:start position:0%
going to be built into the contract with
 
03:24:42.349 --> 03:24:42.359 align:start position:0%
the future you know design firm if
 
03:24:43.849 --> 03:24:43.859 align:start position:0%
you're talking about carving that out as
 
03:24:46.010 --> 03:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
a separate process altogether I'd have
 
03:24:47.090 --> 03:24:47.100 align:start position:0%
to talk to the Department of Public
 
03:24:48.590 --> 03:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
Works about what that would look like I
 
03:24:49.910 --> 03:24:49.920 align:start position:0%
couldn't speculate as to what that would
 
03:24:52.190 --> 03:24:52.200 align:start position:0%
look like so so just to close us I'll
 
03:24:54.889 --> 03:24:54.899 align:start position:0%
come to your representative Weiler yes
 
03:24:59.330 --> 03:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
or no do you think the appropriation so
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
that you can begin the contracted side
 
03:25:04.849 --> 03:25:04.859 align:start position:0%
evaluation is
 
03:25:07.070 --> 03:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
urgent is that a critical issue is that
 
03:25:09.290 --> 03:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
something we ought to be doing like now
 
03:25:11.210 --> 03:25:11.220 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:25:14.929 --> 03:25:14.939 align:start position:0%
I think that if we if the goal is to get
 
03:25:16.610 --> 03:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
this is right the goal that I've always
 
03:25:18.650 --> 03:25:18.660 align:start position:0%
understood for the past couple years was
 
03:25:20.030 --> 03:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
that this needs to get done immediately
 
03:25:21.769 --> 03:25:21.779 align:start position:0%
right there were timelines put on this
 
03:25:24.590 --> 03:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
that were incredibly tight and ambitious
 
03:25:26.450 --> 03:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
under the best of circumstances that's
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
why we went ahead and started working
 
03:25:30.290 --> 03:25:30.300 align:start position:0%
with DPW and Architects to try to be
 
03:25:32.090 --> 03:25:32.100 align:start position:0%
ready to go at the moment that this
 
03:25:34.370 --> 03:25:34.380 align:start position:0%
legislature said go
 
03:25:36.410 --> 03:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
if that's no longer the reality then
 
03:25:38.210 --> 03:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
that's then that then that is what it is
 
03:25:40.729 --> 03:25:40.739 align:start position:0%
right the
 
03:25:44.030 --> 03:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
I would I would want to move as much as
 
03:25:46.250 --> 03:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
possible as soon as possible because I
 
03:25:47.929 --> 03:25:47.939 align:start position:0%
feel that if we don't actually get to
 
03:25:49.790 --> 03:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
work on this what I fear is that we're
 
03:25:52.309 --> 03:25:52.319 align:start position:0%
not gonna ever get this done I sat in
 
03:25:54.889 --> 03:25:54.899 align:start position:0%
the hearing room downstairs five years
 
03:25:57.050 --> 03:25:57.060 align:start position:0%
ago listening to you know people
 
03:25:59.570 --> 03:25:59.580 align:start position:0%
admonish us for not doing this you know
 
03:26:01.429 --> 03:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
six months after I walked into New
 
03:26:03.469 --> 03:26:03.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for the first time in my life
 
03:26:05.990 --> 03:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
and you know frankly it's time to get it
 
03:26:08.870 --> 03:26:08.880 align:start position:0%
done and um so I'd rather do something
 
03:26:10.070 --> 03:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
than nothing
 
03:26:13.130 --> 03:26:13.140 align:start position:0%
took so Madam commissioner yes or no is
 
03:26:15.229 --> 03:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
is the money to begin the site
 
03:26:17.929 --> 03:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
evaluation critical or not
 
03:26:19.729 --> 03:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
I do believe it's critical and and part
 
03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
of what haunts me is Imagining the
 
03:26:23.750 --> 03:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
staffing issues that are going to
 
03:26:26.870 --> 03:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
transpire without any serious plan and I
 
03:26:28.490 --> 03:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
think that is indicative of forward
 
03:26:29.870 --> 03:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
movement and it's already going to be
 
03:26:31.610 --> 03:26:31.620 align:start position:0%
hard enough to keep the place um
 
03:26:32.990 --> 03:26:33.000 align:start position:0%
functioning safely
 
03:26:35.530 --> 03:26:35.540 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Weiler well
 
03:26:37.550 --> 03:26:37.560 align:start position:0%
have you been waiting representative
 
03:26:39.229 --> 03:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
tolersky because I know representative
 
03:26:41.150 --> 03:26:41.160 align:start position:0%
Weiler is ready do you do you have
 
03:26:41.160 --> 03:26:42.590 align:start position:0%
Weiler is ready do you do you have
something

03:26:42.590 --> 03:26:42.600 align:start position:0%
something
 
03:26:44.690 --> 03:26:44.700 align:start position:0%
it's related to what you were saying
 
03:26:46.429 --> 03:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
which was a clarification for what we
 
03:26:49.849 --> 03:26:49.859 align:start position:0%
heard yesterday which was
 
03:26:52.790 --> 03:26:52.800 align:start position:0%
the it sounded to me and I I'm guess I'm
 
03:26:55.729 --> 03:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if I'm wrong that
 
03:26:57.650 --> 03:26:57.660 align:start position:0%
yesterday we heard the department is
 
03:26:59.269 --> 03:26:59.279 align:start position:0%
moving forward in the process of
 
03:27:01.429 --> 03:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
determining the best site and you did
 
03:27:03.950 --> 03:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
not need us to give you that green light
 
03:27:06.710 --> 03:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
to do it you did not need us to give you
 
03:27:06.720 --> 03:27:08.330 align:start position:0%
to do it you did not need us to give you
the

03:27:08.330 --> 03:27:08.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:27:11.150 --> 03:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
part of the two million dollars to get
 
03:27:13.910 --> 03:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
that done so I guess I'm confused as to
 
03:27:18.950 --> 03:27:18.960 align:start position:0%
what was just exchanged here no
 
03:27:20.750 --> 03:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm not I'm not sure exactly what
 
03:27:22.130 --> 03:27:22.140 align:start position:0%
what you were calling from yesterday or
 
03:27:24.889 --> 03:27:24.899 align:start position:0%
if I misspoke but the site evaluation
 
03:27:26.929 --> 03:27:26.939 align:start position:0%
was always intended to be part of the
 
03:27:29.570 --> 03:27:29.580 align:start position:0%
contract with the with the external
 
03:27:31.969 --> 03:27:31.979 align:start position:0%
Architects that piece of the work was
 
03:27:33.769 --> 03:27:33.779 align:start position:0%
through them making the final
 
03:27:35.750 --> 03:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
determination around Sight can't be done
 
03:27:38.269 --> 03:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
until that work is done right and that
 
03:27:39.889 --> 03:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
work was going to be the first part of
 
03:27:41.210 --> 03:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
what would be done under that contract
 
03:27:42.710 --> 03:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
so yesterday I remember talking about
 
03:27:43.969 --> 03:27:43.979 align:start position:0%
that that would be something that would
 
03:27:45.769 --> 03:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
probably be from my memory because I
 
03:27:47.870 --> 03:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
haven't looked at the looked at that
 
03:27:50.570 --> 03:27:50.580 align:start position:0%
proposal recently would have been done
 
03:27:52.790 --> 03:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
first and probably in a matter of weeks
 
03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:55.439 align:start position:0%
to a month or so from the start of that
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
contract so that would be the first
 
03:27:59.630 --> 03:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
piece of work done on that contract and
 
03:28:00.710 --> 03:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
that it would therefore be information
 
03:28:01.969 --> 03:28:01.979 align:start position:0%
that would be available for the
 
03:28:04.130 --> 03:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
September 30 date for the committee that
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
was being discussed yesterday but the
 
03:28:07.969 --> 03:28:07.979 align:start position:0%
site evaluation work was always a
 
03:28:09.349 --> 03:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
component of what needed to be done to
 
03:28:10.729 --> 03:28:10.739 align:start position:0%
make a final decision about a location
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
we couldn't make a final decision
 
03:28:15.849 --> 03:28:15.859 align:start position:0%
without doing that work
 
03:28:18.349 --> 03:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
do you have a follow-up
 
03:28:20.630 --> 03:28:20.640 align:start position:0%
no all right representative Weiler and
 
03:28:23.510 --> 03:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
then representative norgren
 
03:28:26.330 --> 03:28:26.340 align:start position:0%
I've been to all three sites
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
I was a representative for Hampstead for
 
03:28:31.849 --> 03:28:31.859 align:start position:0%
20 years before redistricting
 
03:28:33.290 --> 03:28:33.300 align:start position:0%
I've talked with the representatives
 
03:28:35.330 --> 03:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
from Hampstead and the senator
 
03:28:38.990 --> 03:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
who was involved in Senate bill one
 
03:28:39.000 --> 03:28:40.429 align:start position:0%
who was involved in Senate bill one
um

03:28:40.429 --> 03:28:40.439 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:28:42.410 --> 03:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
there's more flexibility on Hampstead
 
03:28:44.210 --> 03:28:44.220 align:start position:0%
than any other site
 
03:28:48.110 --> 03:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
that's about 100 acres of woods it's
 
03:28:50.030 --> 03:28:50.040 align:start position:0%
off the beaten path
 
03:28:52.490 --> 03:28:52.500 align:start position:0%
it's not on a main road
 
03:28:54.050 --> 03:28:54.060 align:start position:0%
a lot of people in Hampstead don't even
 
03:28:56.090 --> 03:28:56.100 align:start position:0%
know it's there it's the hospital that
 
03:28:57.769 --> 03:28:57.779 align:start position:0%
presently exists
 
03:28:57.779 --> 03:29:00.110 align:start position:0%
presently exists
and

03:29:00.110 --> 03:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:29:02.210 --> 03:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
we talked about
 
03:29:04.370 --> 03:29:04.380 align:start position:0%
putting it near the site in Manchester
 
03:29:06.590 --> 03:29:06.600 align:start position:0%
but it would need another kitchen it
 
03:29:08.150 --> 03:29:08.160 align:start position:0%
would need somebody to provide meals
 
03:29:09.650 --> 03:29:09.660 align:start position:0%
that isn't there they don't have a
 
03:29:13.070 --> 03:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
laundry if they get to Hampstead or
 
03:29:15.530 --> 03:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
Concord they have shared facilities they
 
03:29:17.269 --> 03:29:17.279 align:start position:0%
could have meals brought
 
03:29:20.990 --> 03:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
from another facility as well as laundry
 
03:29:25.070 --> 03:29:25.080 align:start position:0%
but having sat through the review on the
 
03:29:29.150 --> 03:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
secure psychiatric facility on Concord I
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
know the limitations that we've heard
 
03:29:32.389 --> 03:29:32.399 align:start position:0%
about Concord and there isn't that many
 
03:29:34.550 --> 03:29:34.560 align:start position:0%
places you could try it in the talk of
 
03:29:37.550 --> 03:29:37.560 align:start position:0%
wetlands and all that stuff so there's
 
03:29:39.650 --> 03:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
more flexibility and where it would go
 
03:29:42.410 --> 03:29:42.420 align:start position:0%
and what can be done in Hampstead as
 
03:29:45.229 --> 03:29:45.239 align:start position:0%
well as providing adjacent services that
 
03:29:47.269 --> 03:29:47.279 align:start position:0%
puts it out in the front in my book
 
03:29:49.670 --> 03:29:49.680 align:start position:0%
and I don't think the Hampstead people
 
03:29:52.729 --> 03:29:52.739 align:start position:0%
are going to be objective to it for that
 
03:29:55.910 --> 03:29:55.920 align:start position:0%
small population and that that uh plus
 
03:29:57.830 --> 03:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting the property taxes I
 
03:29:59.809 --> 03:29:59.819 align:start position:0%
think we've got that included that they
 
03:30:01.010 --> 03:30:01.020 align:start position:0%
would have lost
 
03:30:05.690 --> 03:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
by the Private Hospital being sold so
 
03:30:08.750 --> 03:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
I think there's as that was a big a big
 
03:30:10.250 --> 03:30:10.260 align:start position:0%
stumbling block for Hampstead which has
 
03:30:13.070 --> 03:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
gone away as far as I'm concerned so
 
03:30:15.530 --> 03:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
I think that we can we can be certain
 
03:30:17.809 --> 03:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
that it will end up in Hampstead and
 
03:30:17.819 --> 03:30:18.950 align:start position:0%
that it will end up in Hampstead and
that

03:30:18.950 --> 03:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:30:20.450 --> 03:30:20.460 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:30:22.309 --> 03:30:22.319 align:start position:0%
they may fine tune it a little more and
 
03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
pick exactly the site they want at
 
03:30:26.570 --> 03:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
Hampstead but I think that place has the
 
03:30:29.510 --> 03:30:29.520 align:start position:0%
most flexibility and is way ahead of the
 
03:30:32.389 --> 03:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
other sites so I wish we could agree on
 
03:30:34.729 --> 03:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
this and and get the ball rolling I
 
03:30:35.990 --> 03:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to see this happen where
 
03:30:37.610 --> 03:30:37.620 align:start position:0%
we're always two years behind or maybe
 
03:30:39.650 --> 03:30:39.660 align:start position:0%
five years behind
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we can't keep kicking the can down
 
03:30:44.330 --> 03:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
the road let's move and accept this
 
03:30:48.469 --> 03:30:48.479 align:start position:0%
amendment and pass sb1 and sb49 they're
 
03:30:50.570 --> 03:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
both the same we can move forward on
 
03:30:52.610 --> 03:30:52.620 align:start position:0%
this I hate to see all this delays thank
 
03:30:55.190 --> 03:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you representative Wilder
 
03:30:58.250 --> 03:30:58.260 align:start position:0%
and uh as as the chair of the committee
 
03:31:00.349 --> 03:31:00.359 align:start position:0%
let me ask you a question it's getting
 
03:31:02.450 --> 03:31:02.460 align:start position:0%
close to 1 30 where you said you'd be
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
pulling us out of recess of the full
 
03:31:07.610 --> 03:31:07.620 align:start position:0%
Finance it it feels to me like I need
 
03:31:09.950 --> 03:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
another 20 minutes to be able to give
 
03:31:11.990 --> 03:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
you a clear recommendation of division
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
three where we stand on uh this
 
03:31:17.330 --> 03:31:17.340 align:start position:0%
amendment or any other Amendment get it
 
03:31:19.250 --> 03:31:19.260 align:start position:0%
done get it done okay thank you sir
 
03:31:21.590 --> 03:31:21.600 align:start position:0%
representative norgren yeah
 
03:31:25.250 --> 03:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
to add to the discussion and I yesterday
 
03:31:27.830 --> 03:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
I was watching online and I was texting
 
03:31:31.969 --> 03:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
Mary Jane and Laura because I I think we
 
03:31:34.969 --> 03:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
have to keep considering the employees
 
03:31:37.490 --> 03:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
of this organization
 
03:31:41.330 --> 03:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
um I think all the indecision is hard
 
03:31:43.969 --> 03:31:43.979 align:start position:0%
for them I think we're everyone's having
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
trouble retaining employees under the
 
03:31:48.410 --> 03:31:48.420 align:start position:0%
conditions we have now
 
03:31:52.010 --> 03:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
so I I think we have
 
03:31:54.889 --> 03:31:54.899 align:start position:0%
urgency for that reason to make a
 
03:31:58.490 --> 03:31:58.500 align:start position:0%
decision and get things moving so people
 
03:32:01.910 --> 03:32:01.920 align:start position:0%
who work there know where they're going
 
03:32:04.309 --> 03:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing have some
 
03:32:07.010 --> 03:32:07.020 align:start position:0%
stability in their lives so you can hire
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
more people in fact
 
03:32:11.229 --> 03:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to say that thank you
 
03:32:13.429 --> 03:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you I don't hear a question in
 
03:32:15.170 --> 03:32:15.180 align:start position:0%
there unless you want to argue with her
 
03:32:17.990 --> 03:32:18.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham do you have
 
03:32:21.050 --> 03:32:21.060 align:start position:0%
yeah just it seems to me that
 
03:32:22.969 --> 03:32:22.979 align:start position:0%
um you know down to the minutia of what
 
03:32:25.610 --> 03:32:25.620 align:start position:0%
uh we're we're talking about uh it
 
03:32:26.809 --> 03:32:26.819 align:start position:0%
sounds like you're gonna you would need
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
some appropriation uh to go through the
 
03:32:32.870 --> 03:32:32.880 align:start position:0%
site evaluation process as you described
 
03:32:35.389 --> 03:32:35.399 align:start position:0%
so moving the number from 2 million to
 
03:32:35.399 --> 03:32:36.710 align:start position:0%
so moving the number from 2 million to
zero

03:32:36.710 --> 03:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
zero
 
03:32:39.590 --> 03:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
um uh would uh hamper your progress
 
03:32:39.600 --> 03:32:41.570 align:start position:0%
um uh would uh hamper your progress
somewhat

03:32:41.570 --> 03:32:41.580 align:start position:0%
somewhat
 
03:32:43.130 --> 03:32:43.140 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:32:45.110 --> 03:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
um uh you know you know if we more
 
03:32:47.210 --> 03:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
limited and and by the way I trust you
 
03:32:50.330 --> 03:32:50.340 align:start position:0%
with my life this is this is just you
 
03:32:51.710 --> 03:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
know I'm just here to represent the
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
community and and make sure when we ask
 
03:32:56.030 --> 03:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
them to pay money that that we're
 
03:32:58.130 --> 03:32:58.140 align:start position:0%
getting something from it so and I thank
 
03:32:59.510 --> 03:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
you very much for all your testimony
 
03:33:01.370 --> 03:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
over the last few days
 
03:33:02.570 --> 03:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:33:04.070 --> 03:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and you know I don't know which way
 
03:33:06.769 --> 03:33:06.779 align:start position:0%
we as a group will will go and you know
 
03:33:09.170 --> 03:33:09.180 align:start position:0%
continue with this larger package are
 
03:33:12.610 --> 03:33:12.620 align:start position:0%
limited to a site evaluation
 
03:33:15.050 --> 03:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
but if there's a number less than 2
 
03:33:16.790 --> 03:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
million and bigger than zero that would
 
03:33:18.950 --> 03:33:18.960 align:start position:0%
allow you full flexibility to go through
 
03:33:20.510 --> 03:33:20.520 align:start position:0%
the site evaluation what would that
 
03:33:22.790 --> 03:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
number be the truth is I don't know the
 
03:33:25.490 --> 03:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
answer to that question right the two
 
03:33:27.229 --> 03:33:27.239 align:start position:0%
million all these numbers have come from
 
03:33:28.250 --> 03:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
the Department of administrative
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
services and the vision of Public Works
 
03:33:32.750 --> 03:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
who are the experts and how we build
 
03:33:34.070 --> 03:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
things and everything else in the state
 
03:33:36.229 --> 03:33:36.239 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire and in fact DHHS
 
03:33:39.769 --> 03:33:39.779 align:start position:0%
where the DPW is the the lead on all
 
03:33:40.969 --> 03:33:40.979 align:start position:0%
these efforts and we're kind of the
 
03:33:43.190 --> 03:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
client who is Consulting on on you know
 
03:33:44.750 --> 03:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
what the needs are around these efforts
 
03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:47.460 align:start position:0%
so anything I would give would be a
 
03:33:49.309 --> 03:33:49.319 align:start position:0%
total guess and I really you know
 
03:33:50.630 --> 03:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
somebody else's guess would probably be
 
03:33:53.950 --> 03:33:53.960 align:start position:0%
better than mine I I would wag 400 000.
 
03:33:57.590 --> 03:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
that would be my way just doing projects
 
03:33:59.510 --> 03:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
in the past but
 
03:34:01.429 --> 03:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
um all right any other questions on this
 
03:34:03.950 --> 03:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
because what I'd like to do now is I
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
want to get a sense of the division on
 
03:34:09.830 --> 03:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 31 I'm going to ask two
 
03:34:09.840 --> 03:34:10.870 align:start position:0%
lines 25 through 31 I'm going to ask two
things

03:34:10.870 --> 03:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
things
 
03:34:13.309 --> 03:34:13.319 align:start position:0%
hopefully it'll it only becomes one
 
03:34:16.370 --> 03:34:16.380 align:start position:0%
thing I would like to know
 
03:34:19.870 --> 03:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
yes or no do you accept the language
 
03:34:23.389 --> 03:34:23.399 align:start position:0%
that's already written on Amendment zero
 
03:34:28.370 --> 03:34:28.380 align:start position:0%
four five four lines 25 through 31 as is
 
03:34:31.429 --> 03:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
representative Hull
 
03:34:34.729 --> 03:34:34.739 align:start position:0%
I have no issues with the language I do
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
ask for a clarification though because
 
03:34:40.670 --> 03:34:40.680 align:start position:0%
in line 27 we have requests to procure a
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
qualified architect and then line 28
 
03:34:45.229 --> 03:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
right which is start the project
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
immediately I hear that right get the
 
03:34:49.610 --> 03:34:49.620 align:start position:0%
architect up and running and then in
 
03:34:51.769 --> 03:34:51.779 align:start position:0%
line 28 I hear a request if you're a
 
03:34:54.050 --> 03:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
contractor to build and I don't think
 
03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
that's going in parallel so it's the
 
03:34:57.650 --> 03:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
same language with two different actions
 
03:34:59.450 --> 03:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
and I just want to make sure that I
 
03:35:01.610 --> 03:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
understand or that we somehow document
 
03:35:04.550 --> 03:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
that this is to get to Define where
 
03:35:06.790 --> 03:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
we're going but not necessarily go build
 
03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
and I think I would interpret request to
 
03:35:12.410 --> 03:35:12.420 align:start position:0%
procure a contractor wanting more of an
 
03:35:14.929 --> 03:35:14.939 align:start position:0%
RFP right request for proposal process
 
03:35:18.650 --> 03:35:18.660 align:start position:0%
as opposed to issue a PO but that I just
 
03:35:21.170 --> 03:35:21.180 align:start position:0%
would like that clarified you know I
 
03:35:23.809 --> 03:35:23.819 align:start position:0%
think I had stumbled on this before and
 
03:35:25.910 --> 03:35:25.920 align:start position:0%
we had initially written requests for
 
03:35:28.130 --> 03:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
proposal and that got changed somewhere
 
03:35:31.370 --> 03:35:31.380 align:start position:0%
on the along the line and and I think
 
03:35:34.309 --> 03:35:34.319 align:start position:0%
you've picked up a nice little rub there
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
that we want to figure out the way it
 
03:35:39.889 --> 03:35:39.899 align:start position:0%
should lay down I I I I the first one I
 
03:35:41.570 --> 03:35:41.580 align:start position:0%
think is a request to procure because
 
03:35:43.610 --> 03:35:43.620 align:start position:0%
all the RFP stuff has been done they're
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
ready to pull the trigger I believe I
 
03:35:48.650 --> 03:35:48.660 align:start position:0%
did Mr ribson do you want to tell us if
 
03:35:50.330 --> 03:35:50.340 align:start position:0%
they're both meant to be requests for
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
procure and if we do tend to limit if we
 
03:35:55.010 --> 03:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
decide to limit this do we need to
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
strike that authorization language so
 
03:36:00.229 --> 03:36:00.239 align:start position:0%
DPW uses multiple different types of
 
03:36:01.610 --> 03:36:01.620 align:start position:0%
procurement tools
 
03:36:03.349 --> 03:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
right and again this is outside of my
 
03:36:04.790 --> 03:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
scope of expertise but I've learned a
 
03:36:06.110 --> 03:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
little bit trying to go through this
 
03:36:08.090 --> 03:36:08.100 align:start position:0%
process and they're not they don't
 
03:36:10.190 --> 03:36:10.200 align:start position:0%
typically use the request for proposal
 
03:36:11.570 --> 03:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
tool even though that's the tool that we
 
03:36:13.910 --> 03:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
typically use in vhhs right so the
 
03:36:16.429 --> 03:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
reason why we used the language procure
 
03:36:18.769 --> 03:36:18.779 align:start position:0%
was just to be flexible in the type of
 
03:36:20.570 --> 03:36:20.580 align:start position:0%
public procurement tool that they would
 
03:36:22.610 --> 03:36:22.620 align:start position:0%
use to not prescribe which tool is
 
03:36:23.870 --> 03:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate that they would use the
 
03:36:26.929 --> 03:36:26.939 align:start position:0%
request for X whatever that is
 
03:36:28.670 --> 03:36:28.680 align:start position:0%
um based on their you know expertise in
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
judgment as the best way to publicly
 
03:36:32.630 --> 03:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
legally appropriately procure that
 
03:36:32.640 --> 03:36:34.130 align:start position:0%
legally appropriately procure that
service

03:36:34.130 --> 03:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:36:36.950 --> 03:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
I I just realized I was on the wrong
 
03:36:39.950 --> 03:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
section we're still on lines 15 through
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
24 and I I got myself jumbled oh
 
03:36:47.090 --> 03:36:47.100 align:start position:0%
so so but that was good foreshadowing uh
 
03:36:49.490 --> 03:36:49.500 align:start position:0%
represent representative hole would your
 
03:36:51.469 --> 03:36:51.479 align:start position:0%
concern about the second request for
 
03:36:51.479 --> 03:36:52.670 align:start position:0%
concern about the second request for
procure

03:36:52.670 --> 03:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
procure
 
03:36:56.269 --> 03:36:56.279 align:start position:0%
be satisfied if we ended up striking on
 
03:36:59.590 --> 03:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
line 17 the phrase architect
 
03:37:01.910 --> 03:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
consultation and development of design
 
03:37:01.920 --> 03:37:03.229 align:start position:0%
consultation and development of design
options

03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
options
 
03:37:05.809 --> 03:37:05.819 align:start position:0%
I am okay with that I am okay with what
 
03:37:08.269 --> 03:37:08.279 align:start position:0%
we agreed to yesterday both both are
 
03:37:08.279 --> 03:37:09.410 align:start position:0%
we agreed to yesterday both both are
options

03:37:09.410 --> 03:37:09.420 align:start position:0%
options
 
03:37:12.410 --> 03:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
um if we're going to change the
 
03:37:16.130 --> 03:37:16.140 align:start position:0%
the effort right then probably the the
 
03:37:18.050 --> 03:37:18.060 align:start position:0%
amount spent should also be changed so
 
03:37:20.050 --> 03:37:20.060 align:start position:0%
so I'll go back to what I meant to say
 
03:37:23.090 --> 03:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
we're going yes or no do you accept the
 
03:37:26.210 --> 03:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
language as written for lines 15 through
 
03:37:26.220 --> 03:37:27.650 align:start position:0%
language as written for lines 15 through
24.

03:37:27.650 --> 03:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
24.
 
03:37:30.769 --> 03:37:30.779 align:start position:0%
yes representative Stringham
 
03:37:34.429 --> 03:37:34.439 align:start position:0%
um I I prefer what you just described so
 
03:37:36.590 --> 03:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
we'll you you're open to a modification
 
03:37:38.690 --> 03:37:38.700 align:start position:0%
you don't so you're a no on just
 
03:37:41.090 --> 03:37:41.100 align:start position:0%
accepting this language well I'm I'm
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:47.530 --> 03:37:47.540 align:start position:0%
so I'll say no thank you
 
03:37:50.210 --> 03:37:50.220 align:start position:0%
uh representative Weiler yes or no on
 
03:37:53.150 --> 03:37:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:57.590 --> 03:37:57.600 align:start position:0%
I don't see a problem on 27 and 28 uh
 
03:37:59.809 --> 03:37:59.819 align:start position:0%
it's it's a request of accurate
 
03:38:02.030 --> 03:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
qualified architect honor before March
 
03:38:04.729 --> 03:38:04.739 align:start position:0%
1st and shall collaborate to issue a
 
03:38:06.830 --> 03:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
request to procure a contractor to build
 
03:38:08.990 --> 03:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
the resulting construction project
 
03:38:11.809 --> 03:38:11.819 align:start position:0%
that's assumes in my mind after you have
 
03:38:13.610 --> 03:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
the design it doesn't mean they have to
 
03:38:16.550 --> 03:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
be done at the same moment yeah so it's
 
03:38:18.830 --> 03:38:18.840 align:start position:0%
The Logical way to read it so you're a
 
03:38:22.250 --> 03:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
yes on 15 through 24. uh representative
 
03:38:22.260 --> 03:38:24.290 align:start position:0%
yes on 15 through 24. uh representative
Wallner

03:38:24.290 --> 03:38:24.300 align:start position:0%
Wallner
 
03:38:27.710 --> 03:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
no I'm not are you open to tweaking it
 
03:38:30.950 --> 03:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
to limit it to Simply site evaluation
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
I I I think that's what I brought up
 
03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
with site location first
 
03:38:37.929 --> 03:38:37.939 align:start position:0%
um and as far as
 
03:38:40.670 --> 03:38:40.680 align:start position:0%
money in there I'd have to think about
 
03:38:42.530 --> 03:38:42.540 align:start position:0%
that for a little while longer and I
 
03:38:44.330 --> 03:38:44.340 align:start position:0%
don't know that 400 000 is the right
 
03:38:47.210 --> 03:38:47.220 align:start position:0%
amount but that I would replace that
 
03:38:49.610 --> 03:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
whole section with
 
03:38:51.349 --> 03:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
um do you have language right now that
 
03:38:53.330 --> 03:38:53.340 align:start position:0%
you can offer the committee
 
03:38:56.929 --> 03:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
we we we're on a March one doesn't
 
03:39:01.130 --> 03:39:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.650 --> 03:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
still talking
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.110 --> 03:39:09.120 align:start position:0%
so you're you're you're you're a no and
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
you're a no on a simple modification to
 
03:39:13.250 --> 03:39:13.260 align:start position:0%
just leave site evaluation
 
03:39:15.590 --> 03:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
and in the in the dollar amount you're
 
03:39:18.050 --> 03:39:18.060 align:start position:0%
you're no one either is the dollar
 
03:39:21.650 --> 03:39:21.660 align:start position:0%
amount 400 000. I I would wag it at 400
 
03:39:24.050 --> 03:39:24.060 align:start position:0%
000. would you have a better wag
 
03:39:26.870 --> 03:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
I don't have the slightest idea what
 
03:39:28.729 --> 03:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
what it would be I would need some
 
03:39:30.410 --> 03:39:30.420 align:start position:0%
someone who knew
 
03:39:32.330 --> 03:39:32.340 align:start position:0%
about um I mean someone like from
 
03:39:34.490 --> 03:39:34.500 align:start position:0%
administrative Services because that was
 
03:39:36.530 --> 03:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
the right amount all right 50 years of
 
03:39:39.170 --> 03:39:39.180 align:start position:0%
judgment like 400 000 is not a bad whack
 
03:39:43.790 --> 03:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
uh representative tolersky do you accept
 
03:39:46.490 --> 03:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
the language is written lines 15 through
 
03:39:49.550 --> 03:39:49.560 align:start position:0%
24. I'm a no on it is written I would be
 
03:39:51.530 --> 03:39:51.540 align:start position:0%
open to sing you're open to a
 
03:39:54.469 --> 03:39:54.479 align:start position:0%
modification representative nordgren
 
03:39:57.410 --> 03:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
you you accept that language as is
 
03:40:00.229 --> 03:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
no I accept change in the language
 
03:40:03.050 --> 03:40:03.060 align:start position:0%
you're open to tweaking it
 
03:40:06.110 --> 03:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
03:40:08.570 --> 03:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
pose leaving it as is and also you
 
03:40:10.550 --> 03:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
brought up a good point that um I know
 
03:40:11.929 --> 03:40:11.939 align:start position:0%
our discussions could go on in
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
perpetuity in fact it doesn't change the
 
03:40:16.370 --> 03:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
date it actually brings the date closer
 
03:40:18.349 --> 03:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
March 1st actually comes closer with
 
03:40:19.490 --> 03:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
every moment that we're here
 
03:40:22.429 --> 03:40:22.439 align:start position:0%
unfortunately so I like representative
 
03:40:25.190 --> 03:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
Weiler proposed moving this amendment to
 
03:40:26.750 --> 03:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
our exec session
 
03:40:27.950 --> 03:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:40:30.229 --> 03:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay I I'm I'm so sorry I'm just not
 
03:40:34.130 --> 03:40:34.140 align:start position:0%
there yet so uh that I my head count is
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
four four on accepting the language is
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
is uh for against and now I'm gonna
 
03:40:44.150 --> 03:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
explore a tweak in a uh and an effort to
 
03:40:46.550 --> 03:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
get us to say yes to one another
 
03:40:50.630 --> 03:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
if we changed on line 16
 
03:40:52.250 --> 03:40:52.260 align:start position:0%
2 million
 
03:40:55.969 --> 03:40:55.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:58.370 --> 03:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we could put a not to exceed in
 
03:41:00.410 --> 03:41:00.420 align:start position:0%
there just to really you know make that
 
03:41:01.490 --> 03:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
more clear
 
03:41:03.950 --> 03:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh I don't think the department tries to
 
03:41:06.830 --> 03:41:06.840 align:start position:0%
waste money so we could make that a not
 
03:41:08.889 --> 03:41:08.899 align:start position:0%
to exceed four hundred thousand dollars
 
03:41:13.849 --> 03:41:13.859 align:start position:0%
and on line 17 leave for the purpose of
 
03:41:16.610 --> 03:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
site evaluation there because we all
 
03:41:20.410 --> 03:41:20.420 align:start position:0%
agree that's important and then strike
 
03:41:28.130 --> 03:41:28.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:31.670 --> 03:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
delete from the word development through
 
03:41:34.570 --> 03:41:34.580 align:start position:0%
the word
 
03:41:37.429 --> 03:41:37.439 align:start position:0%
what through just design options
 
03:41:40.070 --> 03:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
development of design options so that
 
03:41:41.690 --> 03:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
would read for the purpose of site
 
03:41:44.210 --> 03:41:44.220 align:start position:0%
evaluation for replacement facility for
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
the sununu Youth Center
 
03:41:48.050 --> 03:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
that that that is my proposed
 
03:41:50.809 --> 03:41:50.819 align:start position:0%
alternative language
 
03:41:52.370 --> 03:41:52.380 align:start position:0%
would you accept that representative
 
03:41:52.380 --> 03:41:56.929 align:start position:0%
would you accept that representative
hole

03:41:56.929 --> 03:41:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:59.389 --> 03:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
so if I'm reading if I'm hearing what
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
you said and I'll restate it for
 
03:42:03.590 --> 03:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
clarification right 16 is now four
 
03:42:05.269 --> 03:42:05.279 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars Seventeen we
 
03:42:07.790 --> 03:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
strike out architect consultation and
 
03:42:10.429 --> 03:42:10.439 align:start position:0%
development of design options
 
03:42:14.630 --> 03:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
my concern then is lines 18 and 19 the
 
03:42:16.070 --> 03:42:16.080 align:start position:0%
department shall develop two design
 
03:42:18.170 --> 03:42:18.180 align:start position:0%
options we're still mandating that that
 
03:42:20.150 --> 03:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
happened but we didn't fund it so I
 
03:42:22.070 --> 03:42:22.080 align:start position:0%
think there's a conflict right a
 
03:42:23.750 --> 03:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
technical conflict
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
um that I don't know what to do with
 
03:42:29.330 --> 03:42:29.340 align:start position:0%
okay so so how about if we strike on
 
03:42:31.190 --> 03:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
line 19
 
03:42:31.200 --> 03:42:33.830 align:start position:0%
line 19
um

03:42:33.830 --> 03:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:37.929 --> 03:42:37.939 align:start position:0%
for the shell develop design options
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
because the rest of this is kind of
 
03:42:43.070 --> 03:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
clarifying on the site evaluation piece
 
03:42:45.590 --> 03:42:45.600 align:start position:0%
of this for the site evaluation it's
 
03:42:47.690 --> 03:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
helpful for them to know
 
03:42:50.630 --> 03:42:50.640 align:start position:0%
starting on 18 on to 19 the department
 
03:42:53.090 --> 03:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
for possibilities
 
03:42:55.790 --> 03:42:55.800 align:start position:0%
for two possibilities a facility with a
 
03:42:57.889 --> 03:42:57.899 align:start position:0%
capacity of six to twelve and a capacity
 
03:43:00.530 --> 03:43:00.540 align:start position:0%
of 12 to 18. so at least they know what
 
03:43:03.050 --> 03:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
they're evaluating I am okay with the
 
03:43:04.610 --> 03:43:04.620 align:start position:0%
proposed four hundred thousand dollars
 
03:43:06.889 --> 03:43:06.899 align:start position:0%
for site evaluation to consider two
 
03:43:10.370 --> 03:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
design options right not architect not
 
03:43:12.769 --> 03:43:12.779 align:start position:0%
go do detailed engineering drawings but
 
03:43:14.570 --> 03:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
two conceptual right
 
03:43:18.050 --> 03:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
and have those as information to present
 
03:43:19.370 --> 03:43:19.380 align:start position:0%
back to the legislature because
 
03:43:20.809 --> 03:43:20.819 align:start position:0%
yesterday we spent a lot of time talking
 
03:43:22.550 --> 03:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
about who's making the decision on where
 
03:43:23.750 --> 03:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
this goes I don't think there was
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
agreement amongst the entire division
 
03:43:27.710 --> 03:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
that the legislature should be making
 
03:43:30.830 --> 03:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
the decision ultimately on where this is
 
03:43:32.929 --> 03:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
so the site evaluation and the design
 
03:43:34.550 --> 03:43:34.560 align:start position:0%
options coming back to us is a good
 
03:43:37.610 --> 03:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
thing so so my disclaimer on this as we
 
03:43:40.729 --> 03:43:40.739 align:start position:0%
go flying by is that I know that Mr
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
Ripple is listening he's following the
 
03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
antenna he's following the
 
03:43:46.429 --> 03:43:46.439 align:start position:0%
strikethroughs and when he gets to
 
03:43:48.349 --> 03:43:48.359 align:start position:0%
writing an amendment to the amendment
 
03:43:50.750 --> 03:43:50.760 align:start position:0%
he'll he'll he he's probably going to
 
03:43:53.090 --> 03:43:53.100 align:start position:0%
have a tweak in there that makes it
 
03:43:56.950 --> 03:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
smooth without killing the intent so
 
03:43:59.630 --> 03:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
you do that all the time so that that's
 
03:44:01.190 --> 03:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
where I'm a member of your intent as
 
03:44:04.070 --> 03:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
discussed okay so uh representative
 
03:44:07.070 --> 03:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
Stringham modified language would you be
 
03:44:08.990 --> 03:44:09.000 align:start position:0%
open to that yes or no
 
03:44:09.000 --> 03:44:09.769 align:start position:0%
open to that yes or no
um

03:44:09.769 --> 03:44:09.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:12.729 --> 03:44:12.739 align:start position:0%
uh subject to seeing it yes okay
 
03:44:15.590 --> 03:44:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney
 
03:44:18.349 --> 03:44:18.359 align:start position:0%
yes with the caveat though that I think
 
03:44:21.889 --> 03:44:21.899 align:start position:0%
by taking out the original language we
 
03:44:25.910 --> 03:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
move further away from Senate bill one
 
03:44:28.190 --> 03:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
but the answer to your question is yes
 
03:44:30.650 --> 03:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay I think that was a true statement
 
03:44:33.469 --> 03:44:33.479 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler yes representative
 
03:44:33.479 --> 03:44:35.510 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler yes representative
walner

03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
walner
 
03:44:37.790 --> 03:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
I think I want to see the language but
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
yes I think I can go with that thank you
 
03:44:42.590 --> 03:44:42.600 align:start position:0%
for that representative yes upon
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
reviewing it representative Morgan yes
 
03:44:48.769 --> 03:44:48.779 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so good uh that part's
 
03:44:51.290 --> 03:44:51.300 align:start position:0%
unanimous let's let's skinny up the
 
03:44:54.410 --> 03:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
section on appropriation to to put 400
 
03:44:57.349 --> 03:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
000 for begin the side evaluation
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
okay then paragraph four line 25 through
 
03:45:01.800 --> 03:45:03.170 align:start position:0%
okay then paragraph four line 25 through
31

03:45:03.170 --> 03:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
31
 
03:45:06.410 --> 03:45:06.420 align:start position:0%
the key thing that this does the most
 
03:45:08.510 --> 03:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
powerful aspect of this whole section
 
03:45:10.910 --> 03:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
from my point of view is that final
 
03:45:13.790 --> 03:45:13.800 align:start position:0%
sentence the sysc shall immediately be
 
03:45:16.190 --> 03:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
closed for detention or admission of any
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
child when a replacement facility is
 
03:45:20.630 --> 03:45:20.640 align:start position:0%
sufficiently completed the children can
 
03:45:22.550 --> 03:45:22.560 align:start position:0%
be legal and safely housed there that
 
03:45:25.010 --> 03:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
way we're not facing the guillotine of
 
03:45:27.229 --> 03:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
an of another date we're just saying
 
03:45:29.389 --> 03:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
let's let's do the replacement
 
03:45:33.050 --> 03:45:33.060 align:start position:0%
uh is there any other part of lines 25
 
03:45:34.849 --> 03:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
through 31
 
03:45:37.969 --> 03:45:37.979 align:start position:0%
that that anyone wants to discuss
 
03:45:41.269 --> 03:45:41.279 align:start position:0%
Mr chair as I pointed out earlier and
 
03:45:44.389 --> 03:45:44.399 align:start position:0%
words matter and yeah versus
 
03:45:47.030 --> 03:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
um some sort of proposal right are very
 
03:45:49.389 --> 03:45:49.399 align:start position:0%
different to me so so
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not disagreeing I just need words on
 
03:45:56.750 --> 03:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
line 28 the return requests a change
 
03:45:59.330 --> 03:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
procure to proposal yes please
 
03:46:02.690 --> 03:46:02.700 align:start position:0%
okay and and the in the and the only
 
03:46:06.710 --> 03:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
disclaimer there is we don't know the
 
03:46:09.889 --> 03:46:09.899 align:start position:0%
words that our state uses but the term
 
03:46:12.410 --> 03:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
request for proposal makes
 
03:46:14.809 --> 03:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
sense to me
 
03:46:17.929 --> 03:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
so hopefully our state has a similar
 
03:46:17.939 --> 03:46:19.969 align:start position:0%
so hopefully our state has a similar
word

03:46:19.969 --> 03:46:19.979 align:start position:0%
word
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay so you're okay with that with that
 
03:46:25.010 --> 03:46:25.020 align:start position:0%
change in that word I am representative
 
03:46:25.020 --> 03:46:26.570 align:start position:0%
change in that word I am representative
Stringham

03:46:26.570 --> 03:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
Stringham
 
03:46:30.110 --> 03:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Mooney yes
 
03:46:30.120 --> 03:46:32.110 align:start position:0%
yeah yes representative Mooney yes
Weiler

03:46:32.110 --> 03:46:32.120 align:start position:0%
Weiler
 
03:46:35.030 --> 03:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
03:46:36.769 --> 03:46:36.779 align:start position:0%
I'm going to read it but I think with
 
03:46:39.650 --> 03:46:39.660 align:start position:0%
the word change yeah okay Yep this is
 
03:46:42.290 --> 03:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
all content contingent upon reading it
 
03:46:45.710 --> 03:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
yes yes yes representative yes okay
 
03:46:48.889 --> 03:46:48.899 align:start position:0%
again we got some unanimity with the one
 
03:46:51.590 --> 03:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
word change on line 28 for requests for
 
03:46:56.510 --> 03:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
to procure to request for proposal
 
03:47:01.550 --> 03:47:01.560 align:start position:0%
then on line 32 this is the commission
 
03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
I recommend we just keep the whole
 
03:47:05.510 --> 03:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
commission I mean you know we we're
 
03:47:06.650 --> 03:47:06.660 align:start position:0%
going to go ahead and start the
 
03:47:08.450 --> 03:47:08.460 align:start position:0%
evaluation process I think this
 
03:47:10.790 --> 03:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
commission is a vital part of it this
 
03:47:12.650 --> 03:47:12.660 align:start position:0%
commission is limited in its Authority
 
03:47:14.870 --> 03:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
it doesn't make any decisions it's going
 
03:47:16.790 --> 03:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to write reports it's going
 
03:47:19.250 --> 03:47:19.260 align:start position:0%
to be able to propose legislation it's
 
03:47:23.690 --> 03:47:23.700 align:start position:0%
going to engage the communities so so I
 
03:47:26.090 --> 03:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
think that does all the things that
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
we've said we want done and that's lines
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
1 through 33.
 
03:47:38.750 --> 03:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:41.150 --> 03:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes sir
 
03:47:44.750 --> 03:47:44.760 align:start position:0%
uh just to comply with 1449 can we just
 
03:47:47.150 --> 03:47:47.160 align:start position:0%
make uh
 
03:47:47.160 --> 03:47:48.050 align:start position:0%
make uh
um

03:47:48.050 --> 03:47:48.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:51.349 --> 03:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
G and H representative
 
03:47:53.510 --> 03:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
um rather than representatives and and
 
03:47:56.210 --> 03:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
perhaps add one House member make it
 
03:47:58.250 --> 03:47:58.260 align:start position:0%
four and three or something oh okay
 
03:48:01.670 --> 03:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
let's do one at a time on line 15 and I
 
03:48:03.050 --> 03:48:03.060 align:start position:0%
think the same thing is going to be true
 
03:48:06.469 --> 03:48:06.479 align:start position:0%
on line 17. the the word is currently
 
03:48:11.450 --> 03:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
plural Representatives right so so in in
 
03:48:13.130 --> 03:48:13.140 align:start position:0%
the way that I've written things that
 
03:48:15.110 --> 03:48:15.120 align:start position:0%
has been accepted I don't know if my
 
03:48:16.849 --> 03:48:16.859 align:start position:0%
fifth grade English teacher would agree
 
03:48:19.969 --> 03:48:19.979 align:start position:0%
but I would put the S of Representatives
 
03:48:22.429 --> 03:48:22.439 align:start position:0%
in parentheses so it could be a
 
03:48:24.110 --> 03:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
representative or Representatives
 
03:48:26.809 --> 03:48:26.819 align:start position:0%
without specifying a number and the
 
03:48:29.929 --> 03:48:29.939 align:start position:0%
reason for not specifying a number is is
 
03:48:32.450 --> 03:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
just so that we can do things rationally
 
03:48:35.809 --> 03:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
if they really get fixated on Hampstead
 
03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
they can bother the Hampstead people
 
03:48:39.889 --> 03:48:39.899 align:start position:0%
without trying to get a Concord person
 
03:48:41.389 --> 03:48:41.399 align:start position:0%
to show up
 
03:48:45.110 --> 03:48:45.120 align:start position:0%
so so what does that work Mr Ripple if
 
03:48:47.330 --> 03:48:47.340 align:start position:0%
we just put the S of Representatives in
 
03:48:50.929 --> 03:48:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:52.610 --> 03:48:52.620 align:start position:0%
I think it could
 
03:48:55.070 --> 03:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
as representative Stringham points out
 
03:48:57.650 --> 03:48:57.660 align:start position:0%
so RSA 1449 caps the number of members
 
03:48:59.510 --> 03:48:59.520 align:start position:0%
of the commission at 15 and contains
 
03:49:01.849 --> 03:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
various other requirements Senate bill
 
03:49:01.859 --> 03:49:03.349 align:start position:0%
various other requirements Senate bill
one

03:49:03.349 --> 03:49:03.359 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:49:04.729 --> 03:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
actually had language saying
 
03:49:07.370 --> 03:49:07.380 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding RSA 1449 that I noticed
 
03:49:08.990 --> 03:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
is missing from this so I would add that
 
03:49:10.969 --> 03:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
to this language as well tell me what
 
03:49:14.269 --> 03:49:14.279 align:start position:0%
line item you would put notwithstanding
 
03:49:14.279 --> 03:49:15.650 align:start position:0%
line item you would put notwithstanding
um

03:49:15.650 --> 03:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:49:18.650 --> 03:49:18.660 align:start position:0%
at the beginning of the sentence that's
 
03:49:20.570 --> 03:49:20.580 align:start position:0%
at the end of line five the commission
 
03:49:22.490 --> 03:49:22.500 align:start position:0%
shall consists of the following members
 
03:49:25.610 --> 03:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
I would say notwithstanding RSA 1449 the
 
03:49:26.809 --> 03:49:26.819 align:start position:0%
commission shall consist of the
 
03:49:30.469 --> 03:49:30.479 align:start position:0%
following members okay I'm I'm okay with
 
03:49:33.050 --> 03:49:33.060 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure what it means but

something that looks like a Mr ribson
 
03:51:04.190 --> 03:51:04.200 align:start position:0%

03:51:27.720 --> 03:51:29.530 align:start position:0%
 
now

03:51:29.530 --> 03:51:29.540 align:start position:0%

03:51:32.630 --> 03:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes sir I thought I'd have a
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%

03:51:37.610 --> 03:51:37.620 align:start position:0%
decision two years ago so uh okay so
 
03:51:39.590 --> 03:51:39.600 align:start position:0%
you're okay with that I think we're all
 
03:51:41.990 --> 03:51:42.000 align:start position:0%
okay with lines one through thirty three
 
03:51:44.330 --> 03:51:44.340 align:start position:0%
and then the rest of it gets into
 
03:51:48.290 --> 03:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
repeals and effective dates and and uh I
 
03:51:51.170 --> 03:51:51.180 align:start position:0%
I think we're okay with those
 
03:51:52.929 --> 03:51:52.939 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:51:55.929 --> 03:51:55.939 align:start position:0%

Wyler Waller okay
 
03:52:03.710 --> 03:52:03.720 align:start position:0%
all right so we have a proposal uh if we
 
03:52:07.070 --> 03:52:07.080 align:start position:0%

03:52:10.370 --> 03:52:10.380 align:start position:0%

03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
or no
 
03:52:11.399 --> 03:52:14.809 align:start position:0%

03:52:21.590 --> 03:52:21.600 align:start position:0%

any comments if you're going to have
 
03:53:20.510 --> 03:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
another work session then I have to
 
03:53:22.729 --> 03:53:22.739 align:start position:0%
dismiss the rest of the committee no no
 
03:53:24.229 --> 03:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
next week we're not going to do that
 
03:53:27.349 --> 03:53:27.359 align:start position:0%

03:53:34.849 --> 03:53:34.859 align:start position:0%
postpone 49 and 527 until a future work
 
03:53:36.650 --> 03:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
session that's already being calendared
 
03:53:38.809 --> 03:53:38.819 align:start position:0%

03:53:40.010 --> 03:53:40.020 align:start position:0%
rest of this committee waiting around
 
03:53:43.070 --> 03:53:43.080 align:start position:0%
this is a result of this
 
03:53:45.650 --> 03:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing to report I I I
 
03:53:48.410 --> 03:53:48.420 align:start position:0%
believe there is I believe that we're
 
03:53:50.090 --> 03:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
working on a fresh Amendment it'll be
 
03:53:53.330 --> 03:53:53.340 align:start position:0%
coming back as soon as it can and and I
 
03:53:55.370 --> 03:53:55.380 align:start position:0%
think we have as long as there's no
 
03:53:58.070 --> 03:53:58.080 align:start position:0%
typographical error in there or uh we're
 
03:54:00.349 --> 03:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're gonna recommend to the
 
03:54:04.010 --> 03:54:04.020 align:start position:0%
the committee acceptance I hope we have
 
03:54:05.570 --> 03:54:05.580 align:start position:0%
a quorum
 
03:54:07.790 --> 03:54:07.800 align:start position:0%

support for this amendment because I
 
05:02:31.610 --> 05:02:31.620 align:start position:0%
