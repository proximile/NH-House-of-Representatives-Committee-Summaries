coming good
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
morning does everyone understand the
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
item and and uh have any questions
 
00:08:02.869 --> 00:08:02.879 align:start position:0%
Senator rosenal thank you very much Mr
 
00:08:07.469 --> 00:08:07.479 align:start position:0%
chairman um I understand the item but I
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
don't really understand is why the
 
00:08:14.749 --> 00:08:14.759 align:start position:0%
administrator needs to pause the claims
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
process for two two
 
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:22.000 align:start position:0%
months so could you please explain
 
00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:34.909 --> 00:08:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:38.430 --> 00:08:38.440 align:start position:0%
CL is that good
 
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
okay um sure happy to answer that so we
 
00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640 align:start position:0%
um put a temporary hold in place that
 
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:47.480 align:start position:0%
actually is in somewhat it's partial U
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
so we are there are areas of claims
 
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:52.240 align:start position:0%
processing that is continuing um and
 
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:54.760 align:start position:0%
there is areas of payment processing
 
00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:56.760 align:start position:0%
once we got over the fiscal year change
 
00:08:59.670 --> 00:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
over that are continuing um so the
 
00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:02.160 align:start position:0%
temporary hold is on some portions of it
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
but not all of it um and the reason for
 
00:09:07.389 --> 00:09:07.399 align:start position:0%
the temporary hold is we have uh legal
 
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
documents that need to be changed due to
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
the statutory changes there's
 
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
significant you know substantive and
 
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
procedural um changes that the Senate
 
00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
Bill 591 put in place so we have to take
 
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
those forms down we have to take the
 
00:09:23.470 --> 00:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
claims processing document um the claim
 
00:09:26.509 --> 00:09:26.519 align:start position:0%
form itself the valuation guidelines all
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
those set of legal documents that joint
 
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:32.320 align:start position:0%
fiscal is required to approve um for us
 
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
to move forward with under the new
 
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
statute that applies to pending and
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
unresolved claims and also all new
 
00:09:40.949 --> 00:09:40.959 align:start position:0%
claims are coming to us so that's one of
 
00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:43.120 align:start position:0%
the primary reasons is that we we are in
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
a transition
 
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:50.000 align:start position:0%
period follow up thank you but then that
 
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:51.720 align:start position:0%
bill was
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
signed some time ago yep um how long
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
does it take to for you to do that yep
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
work y so um the bill was signed on June
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
14th um so part of the work let me give
 
00:10:11.190 --> 00:10:11.200 align:start position:0%
you just sort of the pockets of work
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
that we're doing right now um one is
 
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
assessing which of the claims in front
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
of us um are in the pending and
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
unresolved State um the new claims that
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
are coming in um to make sure we're sort
 
00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:26.720 align:start position:0%
of doing an appropriate inventory um as
 
00:10:28.829 --> 00:10:28.839 align:start position:0%
to and some claims were close to being
 
00:10:31.069 --> 00:10:31.079 align:start position:0%
resolved award letters had gone out and
 
00:10:32.790 --> 00:10:32.800 align:start position:0%
so we needed to assess and we are
 
00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
assessing which claims are in somewhat
 
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:38.440 align:start position:0%
governed under the old um former statute
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
right so we're kind of making that
 
00:10:41.310 --> 00:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
inventory that's one area of work that
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
our staff is doing uh another area of
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
work is the legal documents that need to
 
00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:49.720 align:start position:0%
be revised that involves uh folks Beyond
 
00:10:51.710 --> 00:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
administrator bradrick so we have
 
00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:53.320 align:start position:0%
representative we attorney general
 
00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:55.200 align:start position:0%
design is present with us today Laura
 
00:10:57.670 --> 00:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
Raymond um who is um who's taking the
 
00:10:59.870 --> 00:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
place of Jennifer Ramsey the AG
 
00:11:01.949 --> 00:11:01.959 align:start position:0%
designate and the Attorney General's
 
00:11:04.509 --> 00:11:04.519 align:start position:0%
office um is um has essentially the
 
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:07.000 align:start position:0%
charge of making sure that set of legal
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
documents is revised appropriately under
 
00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:11.720 align:start position:0%
the statute is getting the input um
 
00:11:13.829 --> 00:11:13.839 align:start position:0%
needed from claims Council and also from
 
00:11:16.030 --> 00:11:16.040 align:start position:0%
our office and we're also teaming up
 
00:11:18.629 --> 00:11:18.639 align:start position:0%
actually there's about four or five
 
00:11:20.670 --> 00:11:20.680 align:start position:0%
significant legal documents that takes
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
you know lawyers and others to get
 
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
involved from both of our offices to
 
00:11:26.430 --> 00:11:26.440 align:start position:0%
work together and to coordinate um and
 
00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:28.399 align:start position:0%
so I don't want to get ahead of Laura
 
00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:30.200 align:start position:0%
Raymond speaking to what process the
 
00:11:31.629 --> 00:11:31.639 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is doing but
 
00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
we're having a series of meetings um
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
just yesterday I got another legal
 
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:38.160 align:start position:0%
document to look at and to get back to
 
00:11:40.430 --> 00:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office by Friday
 
00:11:42.069 --> 00:11:42.079 align:start position:0%
I also gave them a legal document so
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
we're we're it it takes that time to
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
make sure that um the the new statute
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
the the new revisions are appropriately
 
00:11:52.350 --> 00:11:52.360 align:start position:0%
applied and then brought to Joint fiscal
 
00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:54.680 align:start position:0%
I believe August 16th is the next time
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal meets and advance that
 
00:11:58.750 --> 00:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
meeting we'll be getting those revised
 
00:12:00.590 --> 00:12:00.600 align:start position:0%
legal doc documents for Joy fiscal to
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
review um and and hopefully approve um
 
00:12:05.069 --> 00:12:05.079 align:start position:0%
relatively quickly so that we can go
 
00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:07.240 align:start position:0%
ahead and apply those new stat those new
 
00:12:11.269 --> 00:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:14.389 --> 00:12:14.399 align:start position:0%
itself good and maybe this is really a
 
00:12:16.949 --> 00:12:16.959 align:start position:0%
question for the Attorney General's
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:28.880 align:start position:0%
reports seem like the plaintiffs or the
 
00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:32.120 align:start position:0%
CL payments let's say are not really
 
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:35.720 align:start position:0%
getting the full story on what the
 
00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:40.760 align:start position:0%
revision to the statute does so it seems
 
00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
like they're not getting the information
 
00:12:46.069 --> 00:12:46.079 align:start position:0%
that if they're getting a multi-year pan
 
00:12:49.389 --> 00:12:49.399 align:start position:0%
they'll also be getting 5% interest
 
00:12:54.750 --> 00:12:54.760 align:start position:0%
every year and so I'm wondering who who
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
between the administrator and the AG
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
will be explaining clearly on a
 
00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:08.120 align:start position:0%
website what the changes are to this
 
00:13:14.790 --> 00:13:14.800 align:start position:0%
statute and and what the true story of
 
00:13:18.590 --> 00:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
the multi-year PS is is will that be the
 
00:13:22.189 --> 00:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
administrator's office or that or will
 
00:13:24.629 --> 00:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
that be the AG that's that's a great
 
00:13:28.069 --> 00:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
question so transparency is our top
 
00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
priority we understand that um making
 
00:13:33.790 --> 00:13:33.800 align:start position:0%
sure that there is um clear information
 
00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:36.040 align:start position:0%
um publicly available so that there's
 
00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:38.160 align:start position:0%
stability in the system and stability in
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
the fund and people are confident that
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
the the appropriate work is being done
 
00:13:44.750 --> 00:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
and done on time so that we can you know
 
00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
resume all claims processing and all
 
00:13:49.509 --> 00:13:49.519 align:start position:0%
Payment Processing as quickly as
 
00:13:53.069 --> 00:13:53.079 align:start position:0%
possible so we um once the uh we want we
 
00:13:56.069 --> 00:13:56.079 align:start position:0%
monitored when the bill U was signed the
 
00:13:57.870 --> 00:13:57.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office told us right
 
00:14:00.749 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
away um we posted those changes on our
 
00:14:03.350 --> 00:14:03.360 align:start position:0%
website immediately so on our website
 
00:14:06.749 --> 00:14:06.759 align:start position:0%
the very opening paragraphs um explain
 
00:14:09.790 --> 00:14:09.800 align:start position:0%
that um this change is in place um the
 
00:14:11.749 --> 00:14:11.759 align:start position:0%
chapter version of the bill was posted
 
00:14:15.030 --> 00:14:15.040 align:start position:0%
on our website um immediately um we do
 
00:14:18.310 --> 00:14:18.320 align:start position:0%
um from as a a neutral standpoint um we
 
00:14:21.590 --> 00:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
do um strike the balance between um we
 
00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:24.880 align:start position:0%
need to explain to um claims Council
 
00:14:28.509 --> 00:14:28.519 align:start position:0%
what the statute means and says um
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
versus they are I mean I'm not trying to
 
00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:33.680 align:start position:0%
be cute in this but they are lawyers and
 
00:14:35.550 --> 00:14:35.560 align:start position:0%
and and with the statute being posted on
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
our website they are knowledgeable about
 
00:14:41.069 --> 00:14:41.079 align:start position:0%
what about the 5% interest um I think
 
00:14:43.310 --> 00:14:43.320 align:start position:0%
the the place that um our office is
 
00:14:45.550 --> 00:14:45.560 align:start position:0%
working very hard to be transparent with
 
00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:48.600 align:start position:0%
is getting um we get out guidelines um
 
00:14:50.269 --> 00:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
that are they're not joint fiscal
 
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:51.680 align:start position:0%
guideline joint fiscal approved
 
00:14:53.590 --> 00:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
guidelines they're more like guide posts
 
00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:56.240 align:start position:0%
I suppose that give a little more plain
 
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
speaking or Layman's explanation right
 
00:15:02.350 --> 00:15:02.360 align:start position:0%
and so um we want to make sure we're
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
coordinating carefully with the Attorney
 
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:05.880 align:start position:0%
General's office and with claims counsil
 
00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:08.800 align:start position:0%
to make sure that the expression our lay
 
00:15:12.189 --> 00:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
person expression um is um in line with
 
00:15:14.790 --> 00:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
all expectations um so that is something
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
that will be posted on our our website
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
those those are part of the forms um and
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
the instructions um and the guide posts
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
that we are working on revising now um
 
00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:27.560 align:start position:0%
and I believe it's next week that the
 
00:15:29.150 --> 00:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office is hosting in
 
00:15:30.870 --> 00:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
a listening session with all with with
 
00:15:33.749 --> 00:15:33.759 align:start position:0%
claims Council um where there there
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
there'll be you know we need to hear
 
00:15:38.069 --> 00:15:38.079 align:start position:0%
where any areas of confusion are so we
 
00:15:39.509 --> 00:15:39.519 align:start position:0%
can make sure that the forms that we
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
revise are satisfying that confusion and
 
00:15:44.350 --> 00:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
we have a maximum input so that we can
 
00:15:46.829 --> 00:15:46.839 align:start position:0%
make sure our instructions and forms
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
give the lay persons um expression thank
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
you most hear you
 
00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:00.680 align:start position:0%
br sure yep did you want me to um repeat
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
anything no okay all right
 
00:16:05.230 --> 00:16:05.240 align:start position:0%
representative lean for a question
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
followed by Senator Dallas Andro
 
00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:09.160 align:start position:0%
representative lean is recognized thank
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thanks for being
 
00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:12.560 align:start position:0%
here this may be a question more
 
00:16:14.509 --> 00:16:14.519 align:start position:0%
appropriate for the representative from
 
00:16:16.590 --> 00:16:16.600 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office but you
 
00:16:18.670 --> 00:16:18.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned there are new claims coming
 
00:16:20.710 --> 00:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
forward apparently you know they keep
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
adding up there's hundreds and hundreds
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
of claims and complaints where do things
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
stand I think there are only like 10 or
 
00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
11 people that have been indicted so far
 
00:16:33.389 --> 00:16:33.399 align:start position:0%
how is that side of this whole thing
 
00:16:34.990 --> 00:16:35.000 align:start position:0%
going and again probably the question
 
00:16:36.550 --> 00:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
for the representative from the Attorney
 
00:16:38.590 --> 00:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
General's office yeah you're right that
 
00:16:40.470 --> 00:16:40.480 align:start position:0%
question would be for for the Attorney
 
00:16:42.230 --> 00:16:42.240 align:start position:0%
General's office in terms of asking the
 
00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
status of criminal indictments that
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
that's the claims process office is not
 
00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
part of that
 
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
thanks senator dallesandro for a
 
00:16:52.910 --> 00:16:52.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
chair just a a quick two questions what
 
00:16:59.430 --> 00:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
is the attorney general
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office prosecutes
 
00:17:04.309 --> 00:17:04.319 align:start position:0%
defends and then makes decisions that's
 
00:17:07.630 --> 00:17:07.640 align:start position:0%
a triple header right they prosecute
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
those who are criminally intent they
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
defend the State against this and then
 
00:17:17.470 --> 00:17:17.480 align:start position:0%
make make decisions how does all of that
 
00:17:20.069 --> 00:17:20.079 align:start position:0%
work and my second question is I've had
 
00:17:22.909 --> 00:17:22.919 align:start position:0%
an individual come to see me who who
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
claims this is he was a recipient now
 
00:17:29.789 --> 00:17:29.799 align:start position:0%
who claims that he wasn't fully
 
00:17:33.870 --> 00:17:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh he wasn't fully given all of the
 
00:17:36.909 --> 00:17:36.919 align:start position:0%
information that he he he thought was
 
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
required he he settled he settled he
 
00:17:42.190 --> 00:17:42.200 align:start position:0%
said he signed this document he show he
 
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
signed the document for 400 something
 
00:17:45.630 --> 00:17:45.640 align:start position:0%
thousand he thought he was going to get
 
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:49.360 align:start position:0%
2.5 billion and the real
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
real problem there real problem and I I
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
did speak with the administrator about
 
00:17:57.149 --> 00:17:57.159 align:start position:0%
it it
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
uh that problem
 
00:18:02.430 --> 00:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
seems to have been reoccurring how do we
 
00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:05.310 align:start position:0%
seems to have been reoccurring how do we
solve

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:05.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
that so
 
00:18:11.789 --> 00:18:11.799 align:start position:0%
um in terms of getting information to
 
00:18:15.190 --> 00:18:15.200 align:start position:0%
folks um along the way of the process um
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
I can speak to that portion of it in
 
00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
terms of what the caims processing
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
office um seeks to do y um and we
 
00:18:24.710 --> 00:18:24.720 align:start position:0%
certainly do our level best to give
 
00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:27.120 align:start position:0%
people information in advance of them
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
needing to make critical decisions in
 
00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:30.120 align:start position:0%
the life about whether they're going to
 
00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:32.240 align:start position:0%
accept an award withdraw from the
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
process or however they are choosing to
 
00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
engage with the process and we get that
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
information to them in advance um you
 
00:18:44.029 --> 00:18:44.039 align:start position:0%
know whether um they're personally
 
00:18:48.430 --> 00:18:48.440 align:start position:0%
receiving um the the the uh help that
 
00:18:50.310 --> 00:18:50.320 align:start position:0%
they may need as individuals next to
 
00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:53.240 align:start position:0%
them um to translate the information
 
00:18:55.110 --> 00:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
because even like a lay person's
 
00:18:57.190 --> 00:18:57.200 align:start position:0%
description on our website can be I
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
think sometimes hard for clim understand
 
00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
um or the and there's another example
 
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
the waiver and release forms that are
 
00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:06.400 align:start position:0%
obviously very important forms to um
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
read and understand and digest uh before
 
00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:10.720 align:start position:0%
you choose to an accept an award you
 
00:19:12.590 --> 00:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
know I we're not going to speak to the
 
00:19:13.750 --> 00:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office because
 
00:19:15.669 --> 00:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
they're in charge of those forms but in
 
00:19:17.950 --> 00:19:17.960 align:start position:0%
my working side by side with them um I
 
00:19:20.110 --> 00:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
see that they work also very hard to
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
have as much as possible um in a legal
 
00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:27.880 align:start position:0%
process a uh lay person's description um
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
what else can we do we can keep um
 
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
hearing it's very important for us to
 
00:19:35.430 --> 00:19:35.440 align:start position:0%
hear areas of confusion so we can go
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
back to those forms during this revision
 
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:39.000 align:start position:0%
process and say is there a way we can do
 
00:19:41.669 --> 00:19:41.679 align:start position:0%
better is there a way we can um give a
 
00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
more clear expression um we have a lot
 
00:19:46.630 --> 00:19:46.640 align:start position:0%
of people that gives us input let me
 
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
give you an example if I could um from
 
00:19:52.350 --> 00:19:52.360 align:start position:0%
the beginning we hired trauma-informed
 
00:19:55.549 --> 00:19:55.559 align:start position:0%
experts um that are non- lawyers uh
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
which can I think can be a very
 
00:19:58.230 --> 00:19:58.240 align:start position:0%
important part to have part of any
 
00:20:00.870 --> 00:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
communic ation process with claimants to
 
00:20:03.510 --> 00:20:03.520 align:start position:0%
read our forms in advance of us um
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
putting them into the process in live
 
00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
fashion um I work you know uh with with
 
00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
folks every day is saying okay this is
 
00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:14.080 align:start position:0%
my lawyer perspective now I go along to
 
00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240 align:start position:0%
my staff who has different experience in
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
different areas including my trauma and
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
form experts read those forms and say
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
have we have we met the balance where
 
00:20:26.149 --> 00:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
the legal expression is there um but
 
00:20:28.750 --> 00:20:28.760 align:start position:0%
it's also as much lay person as possible
 
00:20:31.190 --> 00:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
even early on in the process we had um
 
00:20:33.830 --> 00:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
commissioner Hanks review um some of our
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
frequently asked questions um because we
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
know uh we don't have the perspective of
 
00:20:41.149 --> 00:20:41.159 align:start position:0%
those who are um residents of Department
 
00:20:43.669 --> 00:20:43.679 align:start position:0%
of Corrections and you what kind of
 
00:20:46.789 --> 00:20:46.799 align:start position:0%
educational level um language we need to
 
00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
use so that's that's a something we
 
00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:52.240 align:start position:0%
Endeavor to do um every day all the time
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
when we're revising forms um is to try
 
00:20:56.669 --> 00:20:56.679 align:start position:0%
to strike that balance um whether we
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
always hit it we love to hear the
 
00:20:58.080 --> 00:20:59.190 align:start position:0%
always hit it we love to hear the
feedback

00:20:59.190 --> 00:20:59.200 align:start position:0%
feedback
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
um I often get calls um from press and I
 
00:21:04.230 --> 00:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
say hey I would love it if you would
 
00:21:06.149 --> 00:21:06.159 align:start position:0%
review our website and review our
 
00:21:08.190 --> 00:21:08.200 align:start position:0%
frequently asked questions and let us
 
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:11.320 align:start position:0%
know where it's confusing um and I have
 
00:21:13.390 --> 00:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
folks sit with me in the room and take
 
00:21:15.190 --> 00:21:15.200 align:start position:0%
down the notes that press is asking
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
because I could say they are our best
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
litness test as to whether things are
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
clear or confusing um but it does take
 
00:21:24.149 --> 00:21:24.159 align:start position:0%
time that once I hear that we still have
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
to go back to the documents and say okay
 
00:21:29.070 --> 00:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
where can we make some tweaks sure okay
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
appreciate that yeah I I I did I did
 
00:21:35.190 --> 00:21:35.200 align:start position:0%
contact the administrator discuss this
 
00:21:37.350 --> 00:21:37.360 align:start position:0%
with the administrator maybe some of you
 
00:21:39.310 --> 00:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
also got these calls but I get a call
 
00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559 align:start position:0%
from a guy who says I'm ready to commit
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
suicide because that uh the deal that I
 
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:47.440 align:start position:0%
made wasn't exactly what I thought it
 
00:21:50.549 --> 00:21:50.559 align:start position:0%
was going to be and as a result of that
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh I'm living in a car I I can't do this
 
00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
I can't I I can't do that and uh I'm
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
ready to take my ready to take my
 
00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:01.440 align:start position:0%
life mean I don't like getting those
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
calls obviously and I can't solve it not
 
00:22:08.710 --> 00:22:08.720 align:start position:0%
I can only refer back to you or to the
 
00:22:11.950 --> 00:22:11.960 align:start position:0%
administrators as to to what's to what's
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
kind of going on here I I I don't know
 
00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
how many of these kinds of circumstances
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
have developed when legislators have
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
been involved but I know in my case I've
 
00:22:26.070 --> 00:22:26.080 align:start position:0%
had those calls yeah yeah I I think
 
00:22:28.789 --> 00:22:28.799 align:start position:0%
we've done everything we we can here at
 
00:22:31.269 --> 00:22:31.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative level to make things
 
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:34.120 align:start position:0%
better for all of these people you know
 
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:37.240 align:start position:0%
we did the initial the initial bill we
 
00:22:39.310 --> 00:22:39.320 align:start position:0%
got a secondary bill because we found
 
00:22:41.710 --> 00:22:41.720 align:start position:0%
out that there were problems with the
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
original piece of legislation and Asos
 
00:22:47.909 --> 00:22:47.919 align:start position:0%
well point it out they are not getting
 
00:22:50.789 --> 00:22:50.799 align:start position:0%
the shaft by having an extended payment
 
00:22:52.990 --> 00:22:53.000 align:start position:0%
schedule they're getting paid uh for
 
00:22:54.909 --> 00:22:54.919 align:start position:0%
that there there's there's an
 
00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
interest that's paid if the uh payout is
 
00:23:03.470 --> 00:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
is elongated so I I just I just worry
 
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
about this whole the whole situation to
 
00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:07.240 align:start position:0%
be honest with you I thought it was
 
00:23:10.350 --> 00:23:10.360 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot smoother uh and I'm
 
00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
very worried about it that's all I
 
00:23:14.669 --> 00:23:14.679 align:start position:0%
passed that on to you and I appreciate
 
00:23:16.669 --> 00:23:16.679 align:start position:0%
the kind of work you you guys are doing
 
00:23:19.470 --> 00:23:19.480 align:start position:0%
but uh there's I think there's trouble
 
00:23:22.269 --> 00:23:22.279 align:start position:0%
in the bubble and that's that's all I I
 
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
want to make that point Thank you thank
 
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:28.600 align:start position:0%
chairman representative Edwards for
 
00:23:30.310 --> 00:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
thank thank you Mr chair this kind of a
 
00:23:33.269 --> 00:23:33.279 align:start position:0%
question to you g given that this is a a
 
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:35.320 align:start position:0%
fairly straightforward request to hire
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
one assistant administrator and there
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
are so many questions I I I wonder if we
 
00:23:41.710 --> 00:23:41.720 align:start position:0%
should schedule an information briefing
 
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:43.480 align:start position:0%
at some point for the fiscal committee
 
00:23:45.750 --> 00:23:45.760 align:start position:0%
so that the rest of these questions
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
could be explored I I have questions
 
00:23:50.310 --> 00:23:50.320 align:start position:0%
that I'm not asking because it's not
 
00:23:52.269 --> 00:23:52.279 align:start position:0%
now's the opportunity we we're not on a
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
tight schedule here today and if you uh
 
00:23:57.390 --> 00:23:57.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping the Attorney General's
 
00:23:59.110 --> 00:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
person comes back cuz I know some of you
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
have questions for that person
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
so so so in that case I have a question
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
but it's for the Attorney General all
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
right so and and I think some of us also
 
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:12.440 align:start position:0%
had questions for the attorney general
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
and don't know what happened to her Mr
 
00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
chair cruset from the L's office the
 
00:24:18.950 --> 00:24:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative from the Attorney
 
00:24:21.510 --> 00:24:21.520 align:start position:0%
General's office had to leave so there
 
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:23.000 align:start position:0%
will be nobody here for the rest of this
 
00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:25.600 align:start position:0%
meeting from their office I believe on
 
00:24:28.669 --> 00:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
the 16th when uh is the intended date
 
00:24:30.789 --> 00:24:30.799 align:start position:0%
the fiscal is to meet again and at that
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
time the revised documents would come
 
00:24:34.389 --> 00:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
forward the Attorney General would be
 
00:24:36.750 --> 00:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
here for that as well so I don't know if
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
you want to kind of make that a meeting
 
00:24:40.389 --> 00:24:40.399 align:start position:0%
where you focus some of these questions
 
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:41.960 align:start position:0%
or if you want something before that no
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's something that that
 
00:24:45.669 --> 00:24:45.679 align:start position:0%
people have asked me why isn't there a
 
00:24:48.669 --> 00:24:48.679 align:start position:0%
lie detector test for these things that
 
00:24:50.830 --> 00:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
keep coming up and know happened to me
 
00:24:52.909 --> 00:24:52.919 align:start position:0%
thousands of times and so on so forth
 
00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
and and uh you
 
00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:57.520 align:start position:0%
know we we we're not relying on that at
 
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
all seems like the lie detector test
 
00:25:02.870 --> 00:25:02.880 align:start position:0%
would would prove how many people are
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
lying or they've been coached by the
 
00:25:08.389 --> 00:25:08.399 align:start position:0%
lawyers or whatever and you know there's
 
00:25:10.789 --> 00:25:10.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of Suspicion of all this and and
 
00:25:13.230 --> 00:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
I've read in the paper somebody borrowed
 
00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:15.640 align:start position:0%
160,000 based upon the fact he thought
 
00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:17.880 align:start position:0%
he was going to get a lot of
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
money and and somebody loaned him that
 
00:25:22.549 --> 00:25:22.559 align:start position:0%
money based upon the fact that oh yeah
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a lot of money out
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
of this this deal and so you know this
 
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
this is troubling
 
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
so you know I thought she would stay
 
00:25:34.230 --> 00:25:34.240 align:start position:0%
here so we could have some conversations
 
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:39.720 align:start position:0%
about this um I oh she had oh I'm
 
00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320 align:start position:0%
sorry it seems to me that that this is a
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
pressing issue yes why would the
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
Attorney General
 
00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:50.559 align:start position:0%
leave yeah what else was more important
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
yeah what else exactly we're talking
 
00:25:55.710 --> 00:25:55.720 align:start position:0%
about the lives of of deip Citizens
 
00:25:58.870 --> 00:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
We're talking about a a lot of resources
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
that we're expending in order to to to
 
00:26:04.029 --> 00:26:04.039 align:start position:0%
do to do this and we have we have
 
00:26:05.750 --> 00:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
questions people have questions on the
 
00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
board that that they'd like to bring
 
00:26:11.750 --> 00:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
forward and uh help the next opportunity
 
00:26:14.269 --> 00:26:14.279 align:start position:0%
would be a month from now yeah that
 
00:26:15.710 --> 00:26:15.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense to me just
 
00:26:19.029 --> 00:26:19.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense what we will do
 
00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
is send all our questions to Mike Kane
 
00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
and he will forward them to the attorney
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
general so they will be ready to give
 
00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
some answers because I want to know why
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
we're not doing a lot detectors okay you
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
know and we all want to know why haven't
 
00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
prosecuted more people why haven't they
 
00:26:37.149 --> 00:26:37.159 align:start position:0%
identified more of these people that
 
00:26:39.269 --> 00:26:39.279 align:start position:0%
have been doing the abuse and can we get
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
some number out of them because the two
 
00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
numbers on the both sides don't make
 
00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
sense 100,000 people are all going to
 
00:26:47.470 --> 00:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
put in claims that they were abused on
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
by a handful of employees it makes no
 
00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.630 align:start position:0%
by a handful of employees it makes no
sense

00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
sense
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
so represent you have a question for the
 
00:26:59.029 --> 00:26:59.039 align:start position:0%
administrators what's that I do have a
 
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
um does your office have a
 
00:27:13.310 --> 00:27:13.320 align:start position:0%
projection for the administrative cost
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
for the next fiscal year that will be
 
00:27:20.430 --> 00:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
drawing out from the
 
00:27:24.029 --> 00:27:24.039 align:start position:0%
fund um so administrative costs um in
 
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:25.720 align:start position:0%
terms of from our office are also
 
00:27:27.669 --> 00:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
including the Attorney General's um from
 
00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
your office yes which was about 2
 
00:27:35.350 --> 00:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
million in the last fiscal year um thean
 
00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
the answer is yes um I don't have that
 
00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:39.760 align:start position:0%
number in my mind right now I can get it
 
00:27:42.509 --> 00:27:42.519 align:start position:0%
for you we did put together um an
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
operating budget um to put in front of
 
00:27:48.269 --> 00:27:48.279 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General's office um and so
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
that we could all sort of be on the same
 
00:27:53.310 --> 00:27:53.320 align:start position:0%
page as to what are projected costs and
 
00:27:57.350 --> 00:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
expenses um we have um brought in uh
 
00:27:59.389 --> 00:27:59.399 align:start position:0%
folks with um a lot of financial
 
00:28:00.870 --> 00:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
experience in terms of being able to
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
monitor the fund carefully and project
 
00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:06.760 align:start position:0%
expenses monitor actual expenses as the
 
00:28:09.190 --> 00:28:09.200 align:start position:0%
months go forward in order to have a lot
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
of financial transparency for for for
 
00:28:13.909 --> 00:28:13.919 align:start position:0%
joint fiscal uh we've had um several
 
00:28:15.350 --> 00:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
meetings with the Attorney General's
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
office um and representatives there to
 
00:28:20.590 --> 00:28:20.600 align:start position:0%
prepare for that so that for this next
 
00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:23.960 align:start position:0%
um joint um the next appropriation um we
 
00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:26.720 align:start position:0%
are accounting for anticip anticipated
 
00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
expenses from both of the office offices
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
plus um what the awards are going to
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
look like um that come from both
 
00:28:36.070 --> 00:28:36.080 align:start position:0%
administrator broad's final decisions
 
00:28:38.389 --> 00:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
that are accepted and also we um
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
anticipate that there will still be some
 
00:28:41.310 --> 00:28:41.320 align:start position:0%
stipulated agreements or settlement
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
agreements that go directly with the
 
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:45.000 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office that um also
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
run through the claims process and come
 
00:28:49.430 --> 00:28:49.440 align:start position:0%
from the fund so all of those four
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
buckets we are um doing the best we can
 
00:28:54.990 --> 00:28:55.000 align:start position:0%
to get um uh that we've done some actual
 
00:28:57.389 --> 00:28:57.399 align:start position:0%
projections and then actual watching on
 
00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
a monthly basis is of what the impact on
 
00:29:04.029 --> 00:29:04.039 align:start position:0%
the fund is Mr chairman can I ask that
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
we request that we all see that
 
00:29:12.029 --> 00:29:12.039 align:start position:0%
budget very good send send all this send
 
00:29:14.789 --> 00:29:14.799 align:start position:0%
all these questions to the LBA we'll
 
00:29:17.789 --> 00:29:17.799 align:start position:0%
forward them to the uh the attorney
 
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:19.440 align:start position:0%
general I'm hopeful that we can move
 
00:29:21.389 --> 00:29:21.399 align:start position:0%
forward in this process by approving
 
00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
this request and then obviously we'd
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
have to come back because of changes and
 
00:29:29.190 --> 00:29:29.200 align:start position:0%
if we in the room we send all our
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
questions to the attorney general it may
 
00:29:33.710 --> 00:29:33.720 align:start position:0%
affect what he come back to us with a
 
00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
proposal in about a month so I'm hoping
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
we can do that I wish we had the
 
00:29:41.789 --> 00:29:41.799 align:start position:0%
Attorney General here now but in in lie
 
00:29:44.149 --> 00:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
of that we'll I'll send questions
 
00:29:47.310 --> 00:29:47.320 align:start position:0%
forward uh so I would entertain a motion
 
00:29:51.830 --> 00:29:51.840 align:start position:0%
to adopt the item so that this can
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
begin I I would also move the item um
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
but if I could just say say something Mr
 
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:01.840 align:start position:0%
chair so a little disappointed that
 
00:30:05.230 --> 00:30:05.240 align:start position:0%
there's a hold for two months on um
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
paying any of the claims I think it's
 
00:30:11.909 --> 00:30:11.919 align:start position:0%
not the best look but I guess first
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
question um it will be ready by the 16th
 
00:30:18.990 --> 00:30:19.000 align:start position:0%
with any of the rule changes that we and
 
00:30:24.549 --> 00:30:24.559 align:start position:0%
fiscal need to approve yes okay um
 
00:30:28.269 --> 00:30:28.279 align:start position:0%
so I would also say that there were
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
extensive hearings on my bill Senate
 
00:30:34.909 --> 00:30:34.919 align:start position:0%
Bill 591 which made these
 
00:30:37.710 --> 00:30:37.720 align:start position:0%
changes um the Attorney General did
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
testify in front of the Senate I'm
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
assuming he testified in front of the
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
house um but given the magnitude of
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
potentially a thousand claims and the
 
00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
average cost of
 
00:30:56.789 --> 00:30:56.799 align:start position:0%
$500,000 I think um the legislature is
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
going to be in the business for quite
 
00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:01.240 align:start position:0%
some time of having to fund these
 
00:31:04.549 --> 00:31:04.559 align:start position:0%
settlements so it would be helpful for
 
00:31:07.070 --> 00:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General uh to be able to
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
testify but he is I I I also have to
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
defend the Attorney General he's been
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
pretty upfront um with at least those of
 
00:31:18.669 --> 00:31:18.679 align:start position:0%
us in the Senate and I'm assuming in the
 
00:31:23.549 --> 00:31:23.559 align:start position:0%
house um going back to you know when my
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
good friend Karen umberger introduced
 
00:31:28.669 --> 00:31:28.679 align:start position:0%
her bill a couple of years ago and and
 
00:31:31.350 --> 00:31:31.360 align:start position:0%
um I think he's taken the lead on trying
 
00:31:34.629 --> 00:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
to resolve this issue and has done a
 
00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:37.760 align:start position:0%
done a really admirable job but you know
 
00:31:39.870 --> 00:31:39.880 align:start position:0%
like anything else a lot of money at
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
stake so we need to keep a watchful eye
 
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
on it but uh we're not going to be able
 
00:31:51.389 --> 00:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
to move forward if we don't approve this
 
00:31:53.870 --> 00:31:53.880 align:start position:0%
position today so right having said that
 
00:31:55.830 --> 00:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
I hope we can all vote to approve this
 
00:31:58.629 --> 00:31:58.639 align:start position:0%
position thank you all right
 
00:32:00.909 --> 00:32:00.919 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards moves Senator
 
00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:03.320 align:start position:0%
Bradley seconds to adopt the item
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing Nani ready for
 
00:32:08.669 --> 00:32:08.679 align:start position:0%
the question all in favor say I I oppose
 
00:32:12.430 --> 00:32:12.440 align:start position:0%
no the item is adopted thank you do do
 
00:32:15.470 --> 00:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
you mind if I clarify a couple of
 
00:32:19.750 --> 00:32:19.760 align:start position:0%
items thank you um Payment Processing um
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
was um the first thing put on hold um
 
00:32:26.430 --> 00:32:26.440 align:start position:0%
and has started to continue so as of
 
00:32:28.990 --> 00:32:29.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday um
 
00:32:31.830 --> 00:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
probably at least 10 went forward um
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
that were award letters that were
 
00:32:37.750 --> 00:32:37.760 align:start position:0%
accepted in lumpsum um and under the
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
former um statute um that were put on
 
00:32:43.029 --> 00:32:43.039 align:start position:0%
hold to get through the fiscal year um
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
changeover um those did go forward
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday um also what went out
 
00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:52.360 align:start position:0%
yesterday to um claims Council was um uh
 
00:32:54.870 --> 00:32:54.880 align:start position:0%
basically a call for information on the
 
00:32:58.389 --> 00:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
um periodic payment um uh question
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh so the there's a a whole series of uh
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
final decisions that are sitting on my
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
desk that cannot go out until the
 
00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
administrator makes a decision about
 
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's a periodic imp payment or a
 
00:33:15.029 --> 00:33:15.039 align:start position:0%
lump sum under the new statute so uh we
 
00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:19.360 align:start position:0%
sent out um a a request to those Council
 
00:33:20.909 --> 00:33:20.919 align:start position:0%
that have those claims to get its
 
00:33:23.230 --> 00:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
information by the middle of August um
 
00:33:24.909 --> 00:33:24.919 align:start position:0%
that would so that the administrator can
 
00:33:27.110 --> 00:33:27.120 align:start position:0%
go ahead and make um that discretionary
 
00:33:29.669 --> 00:33:29.679 align:start position:0%
decision um so some of payment
 
00:33:31.590 --> 00:33:31.600 align:start position:0%
processing is on hold simply because we
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
need to get the information to the
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
administrator um so that he can make the
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
type of payment um so I just wanted to
 
00:33:40.509 --> 00:33:40.519 align:start position:0%
clarify that um I'm also aware that Miss
 
00:33:44.149 --> 00:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
Raymond had a um a court date at 10:30
 
00:33:46.830 --> 00:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
which is why she needed to to leave um
 
00:33:48.669 --> 00:33:48.679 align:start position:0%
so there wasn't anybody else that could
 
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
come I can't speak to I can't speak to
 
00:33:53.549 --> 00:33:53.559 align:start position:0%
that um but I just wanted to at least um
 
00:33:57.870 --> 00:33:57.880 align:start position:0%
clarify that but appreciate that um is
 
00:34:00.470 --> 00:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
not a good look for the state to see all
 
00:34:02.070 --> 00:34:02.080 align:start position:0%
these people coming forward with all
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
this abuse and the fact nothing was done
 
00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.590 align:start position:0%
this abuse and the fact nothing was done
for

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:08.430 --> 00:34:08.440 align:start position:0%
decades so when they when they put a
 
00:34:11.550 --> 00:34:11.560 align:start position:0%
further delay on it's oh cover up you
 
00:34:13.030 --> 00:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
know and all this other stuff this this
 
00:34:15.069 --> 00:34:15.079 align:start position:0%
is not a good look for the state and and
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
we're all working hard to make this the
 
00:34:21.030 --> 00:34:21.040 align:start position:0%
best state and it it falls on us to say
 
00:34:22.629 --> 00:34:22.639 align:start position:0%
what did you do about it you know this
 
00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
kind of thing and obviously people are
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
very attuned to get a hold of the senior
 
00:34:30.510 --> 00:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
senator here because they know he'll get
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
things done so he's getting calls from
 
00:34:33.909 --> 00:34:33.919 align:start position:0%
all over and saying what are you doing
 
00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:35.879 align:start position:0%
about this you know and it's not a good
 
00:34:38.909 --> 00:34:38.919 align:start position:0%
look yes and and we have to do our best
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
to move this forward and show that we're
 
00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
being fair and we're doing something but
 
00:34:45.710 --> 00:34:45.720 align:start position:0%
the fact that so few people have been
 
00:34:48.869 --> 00:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
charged with crimes and it took so long
 
00:34:51.069 --> 00:34:51.079 align:start position:0%
to get it to this point these things are
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
all very negative looking for this for
 
00:34:56.230 --> 00:34:56.240 align:start position:0%
state government and we're all upset by
 
00:34:58.510 --> 00:34:58.520 align:start position:0%
it and we're ready to move forward by it
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
but we have to have some things done
 
00:35:03.069 --> 00:35:03.079 align:start position:0%
that have a good appearance that really
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
something is being done and it's not
 
00:35:07.069 --> 00:35:07.079 align:start position:0%
being pushed away it's not being delayed
 
00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:10.760 align:start position:0%
it's not being trying to shove it aside
 
00:35:14.150 --> 00:35:14.160 align:start position:0%
and plus the greed of the lawyers is is
 
00:35:16.750 --> 00:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
coming to light too the fact that you
 
00:35:19.630 --> 00:35:19.640 align:start position:0%
know 33 and A3 per of hundred million
 
00:35:20.670 --> 00:35:20.680 align:start position:0%
give me a
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
break you know this is this is just
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
people having a low opinion of law
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers enforced when this kind of thing
 
00:35:32.109 --> 00:35:32.119 align:start position:0%
happens so
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
Le representa Lehman for a comment thank
 
00:35:38.030 --> 00:35:38.040 align:start position:0%
you uh thank you Mr chairman do you know
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
what remains in the settlement fund at
 
00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:42.230 align:start position:0%
what remains in the settlement fund at
this

00:35:42.230 --> 00:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:35:44.710 --> 00:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
point uh well we've had an appro
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
appropriation change over if you will
 
00:35:47.710 --> 00:35:47.720 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that's the right
 
00:35:51.870 --> 00:35:51.880 align:start position:0%
terminology um so there the first 100
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
million that was appropriated um that

conversations around this and we thought

the best path forward at this point in
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
time would be to move the item forward
 
00:38:17.910 --> 00:38:17.920 align:start position:0%
uh without the inclusion of those funds
 
00:38:21.910 --> 00:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
