Hampshire Coalition for responsible
 
00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:30.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis legisl
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
uh is has been following this
 
00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 align:start position:0%
conversation this commission's work
 
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
they're comprised of a group of large
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
beer and beverage distributors now
 
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
serving most of New Hampshire uh they
 
00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
have modern state-of-the-art warehousing
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
professional drivers of trucking Fleet
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
Insurance the ability to track inventory
 
00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
tax product uh make deliveries they know
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
what they're doing uh they contract with
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
multiple manufacturers they move
 
00:06:58.869 --> 00:06:58.879 align:start position:0%
varieties of products for for big makers
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
if new Hampshire is going to legalize
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
recreational Cannabis then many of the
 
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
same controlled substance issues uh and
 
00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:09.400 align:start position:0%
priorities that now affect beer and
 
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
alcohol distribution will certainly come
 
00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 align:start position:0%
to the surface in the regulation and
 
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
transportation of cannabis in that
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
Marketplace in order to prioritize
 
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
safety product tracking access security
 
00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:25.039 align:start position:0%
all the things that are valued in the
 
00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 align:start position:0%
three tier alcohol model um we would
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
suggest that the Mission consider a
 
00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 align:start position:0%
definition of cannabis distributor which
 
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
if authorized would allow a a licensed
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
distributor to move product from
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
multiple cultivators to and between
 
00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:45.560 align:start position:0%
multiple cannabis establishments this
 
00:07:48.309 --> 00:07:48.319 align:start position:0%
would not deprive those who are
 
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
cultivating moving their own and to
 
00:07:53.189 --> 00:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
their own centers and vertically
 
00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
integrated from being a cannabis
 
00:07:58.909 --> 00:07:58.919 align:start position:0%
transporter as that definition is now in
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
your work work product but it would add
 
00:08:04.629 --> 00:08:04.639 align:start position:0%
an additional uh option for those who
 
00:08:06.589 --> 00:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
don't want to transport their own and
 
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:09.280 align:start position:0%
wish to Outsource those Services we've
 
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:12.280 align:start position:0%
got a memo uh that um was on the
 
00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
distribution table last time but I have
 
00:08:16.350 --> 00:08:16.360 align:start position:0%
additional copies that I'll send around
 
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
with suggestions for that definition if
 
00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:21.080 align:start position:0%
I've gone slightly be Beyond two minutes
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
apologies thank
 
00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:31.469 align:start position:0%
apologies thank
you

00:08:31.469 --> 00:08:31.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any
 
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
questions link so again your your ideas
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
that we'll have um as we form these
 
00:08:41.990 --> 00:08:42.000 align:start position:0%
public private Partnerships this will be
 
00:08:43.509 --> 00:08:43.519 align:start position:0%
the private side of the partnership that
 
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:46.680 align:start position:0%
would allow for um warehousing a product
 
00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:48.360 align:start position:0%
and then distribution so at five o'clock
 
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
at night when somebody might run out of
 
00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
product they could have a phone number
 
00:08:53.030 --> 00:08:53.040 align:start position:0%
to call and be able to get product
 
00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
delivered to them in a manner which
 
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
similar you do now for beer and those
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
kind of things exactly correct thank
 
00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:02.949 align:start position:0%
kind of things exactly correct thank
you

00:09:02.949 --> 00:09:02.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
is is there any anyone on have any
 
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:08.360 align:start position:0%
comment on this you know I think this
 
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
allows more
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility is the way I kind of look at
 
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
it I know does liquor have
 
00:09:19.389 --> 00:09:19.399 align:start position:0%
any U Mr chair just a quick comment uh I
 
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
think this is a relevant option that we
 
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:23.200 align:start position:0%
should certainly look at in the
 
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:26.320 align:start position:0%
legislation it's uh I I think it it
 
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't take away from the way it's
 
00:09:30.750 --> 00:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
written now just gives us another option
 
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:32.920 align:start position:0%
for uh the folks that will be in the
 
00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240 align:start position:0%
business either on the manufacturing
 
00:09:37.750 --> 00:09:37.760 align:start position:0%
side or the retail side so I think it's
 
00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
you right thank you for your testimony I
 
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
I I think this you
 
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
know maybe incorporating this memorandum
 
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:56.320 align:start position:0%
into you know it's more than one section
 
00:09:58.110 --> 00:09:58.120 align:start position:0%
but does anyone have any objection with
 
00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:01.120 align:start position:0%
that I think it's a wonderful idea yeah
 
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a formal motion but
 
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:04.880 align:start position:0%
it's like when we put together what we
 
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
hope to be a bill proposed bill would um
 
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:09.800 align:start position:0%
I think it's relevant to make sure we
 
00:10:10.949 --> 00:10:10.959 align:start position:0%
have this in there so we'll put that in
 
00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
there all right so I think we were last
 
00:10:14.509 --> 00:10:14.519 align:start position:0%
talking thank
 
00:10:18.509 --> 00:10:18.519 align:start position:0%
you we were we were last had to do with
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
um we call it the sanctuary policy and
 
00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.509 align:start position:0%
um we call it the sanctuary policy and
the

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
violation uh section the public use so I
 
00:10:27.269 --> 00:10:27.279 align:start position:0%
think there was page we starting page
 
00:10:34.389 --> 00:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.440 align:start position:0%
that's the uh I I call it the sanctuary
 
00:10:37.710 --> 00:10:37.720 align:start position:0%
Paul that's just what it is we've seen
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
language like that in other other
 
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:42.800 align:start position:0%
formats given some time for this to go
 
00:10:46.269 --> 00:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
back and forth um I know we had a very
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
healthy conversation about it last week
 
00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:50.920 align:start position:0%
my understanding that if this language
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
stays in there this might fall
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
apart so I have my own opinion on it
 
00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.670 align:start position:0%
apart so I have my own opinion on it
but

00:10:59.670 --> 00:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.120 align:start position:0%
if we don't compromise then we're not
 
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
going to have anything right I I
 
00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:07.480 align:start position:0%
recommend Mr say we strike the language
 
00:11:10.269 --> 00:11:10.279 align:start position:0%
so I may not necessarily agree with some
 
00:11:12.829 --> 00:11:12.839 align:start position:0%
of the some of the debate the direction
 
00:11:14.629 --> 00:11:14.639 align:start position:0%
we're going but I think if we take if we
 
00:11:16.269 --> 00:11:16.279 align:start position:0%
if we leave that in there I'm not sure
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
we're we're spinning our tires and mud
 
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:19.920 align:start position:0%
on everything else so I I would
 
00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:22.160 align:start position:0%
recommend we take that out and I would
 
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:25.760 align:start position:0%
say though Chief and I I I understand if
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
there ever is an operation where the
 
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
fed's in local law enforcer working
 
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:33.000 align:start position:0%
together I just would pray that liquor
 
00:11:35.470 --> 00:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
is also a priz at the situation as it's
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
unfolding perfectly
 
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
in as as it's done now with alcohol
 
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:42.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair no there there would
 
00:11:44.389 --> 00:11:44.399 align:start position:0%
be no change in the coordination with
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
liquor with respect to those laws for
 
00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:49.320 align:start position:0%
which liquor has the authority to
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
enforce as we do now so there would be
 
00:11:53.509 --> 00:11:53.519 align:start position:0%
no change and I and I concur with the
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
proposal to redact the U I concur with
 
00:11:58.590 --> 00:11:58.600 align:start position:0%
the proposal to redact the language
 
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:02.600 align:start position:0%
simply because as we discussed last time
 
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:05.560 align:start position:0%
uh it presents significant uh
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
prohibition to proper coordination of
 
00:12:10.990 --> 00:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
Public Safety um in every community in
 
00:12:13.069 --> 00:12:13.079 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire I I I understand I I'm
 
00:12:16.629 --> 00:12:16.639 align:start position:0%
still saying I prefer to leave it in but
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
at the same
 
00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:20.920 align:start position:0%
time I'm I'm not it's not going to work
 
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.710 align:start position:0%
time I'm I'm not it's not going to work
we're

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:27.120 align:start position:0%
striking what I would say is is uh we
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
have a consensus on that one way or
 
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:31.430 align:start position:0%
have a consensus on that one way or
another

00:12:31.430 --> 00:12:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.069 --> 00:12:33.079 align:start position:0%
I'm for striking who's if you're for
 
00:12:37.710 --> 00:12:37.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:40.189 align:start position:0%
 
hand

00:12:40.189 --> 00:12:40.199 align:start position:0%
hand
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
okay what's
 
00:12:46.030 --> 00:12:46.040 align:start position:0%
gone yeah I was allumed on that
 
00:12:50.030 --> 00:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
one next is the uh if you go to page
 
00:12:54.110 --> 00:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
seven lines one through five that is the
 
00:12:58.030 --> 00:12:58.040 align:start position:0%
public use provision uh that applies to
 
00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.389 align:start position:0%
public use provision uh that applies to
vaping

00:12:59.389 --> 00:12:59.399 align:start position:0%
vaping
 
00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.310 align:start position:0%
vaping
and

00:13:01.310 --> 00:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:03.949 --> 00:13:03.959 align:start position:0%
smoking I know my friend to my left
 
00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
Senator Lang wanted that to be a
 
00:13:07.949 --> 00:13:07.959 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor a Class B misdemeanor know
 
00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:10.040 align:start position:0%
our friends from the
 
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
ACLU do not not appreciate that Senator
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
Whitley's not here she was um also
 
00:13:16.189 --> 00:13:16.199 align:start position:0%
opposed to
 
00:13:19.230 --> 00:13:19.240 align:start position:0%
that um where are we on that today any
 
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
more thought
 
00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:23.230 align:start position:0%
more thought
any

00:13:23.230 --> 00:13:23.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:13:26.350 --> 00:13:26.360 align:start position:0%
Frank so if we look at our neighbors um
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
in Maine it is I believe just a $100
 
00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
fine in Mass it's a $100 fine but in
 
00:13:35.509 --> 00:13:35.519 align:start position:0%
Vermont it's much more uh in line with
 
00:13:37.189 --> 00:13:37.199 align:start position:0%
what I think the compromise sounded like
 
00:13:38.990 --> 00:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
last time which is a graduated fine
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
system so it is 100 for the First
 
00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
Defense second up to Second 200 for the
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
second offense and not more than 500 for
 
00:13:48.430 --> 00:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
third and subsequent I think that's a
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
fair balance between the two positions
 
00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um particularly because there's zero
 
00:13:54.949 --> 00:13:54.959 align:start position:0%
evidence that criminalizing is actually
 
00:13:57.389 --> 00:13:57.399 align:start position:0%
a deterrent in this respect um and so
 
00:13:58.910 --> 00:13:58.920 align:start position:0%
all we're doing is funneling more people
 
00:14:00.550 --> 00:14:00.560 align:start position:0%
to the Cal legal system which we know
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
has collateral harms but respectfully
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
those first of all in Old Orchard Beach
 
00:14:06.350 --> 00:14:06.360 align:start position:0%
I can tell you they're not enforcing it
 
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
very well and in Massachusetts places
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:12.959 align:start position:0%
to uh it's not being enforced very well
 
00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
so those violation I mean if it's not if
 
00:14:17.110 --> 00:14:17.120 align:start position:0%
the Fine's not a deterrent then what are
 
00:14:18.470 --> 00:14:18.480 align:start position:0%
we even doing well I think there's a
 
00:14:19.829 --> 00:14:19.839 align:start position:0%
difference between the fine not being a
 
00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
deterrent and people not enforcing the
 
00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:23.399 align:start position:0%
law so if folks want to enforce that I
 
00:14:25.150 --> 00:14:25.160 align:start position:0%
mean if people aren't enforcing we can't
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
help that but if we have a place that
 
00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:30.279 align:start position:0%
gives them tool essentially parallel to
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
that of a parking but that's also how we
 
00:14:33.710 --> 00:14:33.720 align:start position:0%
keep our road safe we have fines in
 
00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
terms of speeding that keeps I mean
 
00:14:37.509 --> 00:14:37.519 align:start position:0%
that's that's how we run safety in
 
00:14:40.150 --> 00:14:40.160 align:start position:0%
multiple aspects of our society you're
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
right but if you keep speeding you're
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
going to lose your driver's license what
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
do you lose here the I mean I'm just
 
00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.120 align:start position:0%
saying I get it but but I think it's I
 
00:14:48.069 --> 00:14:48.079 align:start position:0%
mean it's a problem because it's our
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
two-tier system of people with wealth
 
00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
can afford these fines and people
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
without can't um but it is it is how we
 
00:14:56.509 --> 00:14:56.519 align:start position:0%
we deal with lots of issues in our we
 
00:14:58.509 --> 00:14:58.519 align:start position:0%
can afford to buy the marijuana I I'm
 
00:14:59.949 --> 00:14:59.959 align:start position:0%
not hoping that they bought it legally
 
00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:00.710 align:start position:0%
not hoping that they bought it legally
from

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:04.279 align:start position:0%
a retail store and then they go out of
 
00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:06.160 align:start position:0%
their way this is not something you're
 
00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
going to violate accidentally all right
 
00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759 align:start position:0%
you may not know the speed limit you may
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
whatever but this you have to go out of
 
00:15:14.829 --> 00:15:14.839 align:start position:0%
your way to violate
 
00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
so so just understand Colorado uh public
 
00:15:20.269 --> 00:15:20.279 align:start position:0%
consumption is a misdemeanor punishable
 
00:15:23.790 --> 00:15:23.800 align:start position:0%
by fing up to $100 Andor 15 days in jail
 
00:15:25.829 --> 00:15:25.839 align:start position:0%
Illinois public consumption is marijuana
 
00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:27.440 align:start position:0%
is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
up to $500 in Michigan uh it's a
 
00:15:33.150 --> 00:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $500
 
00:15:35.749 --> 00:15:35.759 align:start position:0%
Andor 90 days in jail up to 90 days in
 
00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
jail so I think we're trying to strike a
 
00:15:39.990 --> 00:15:40.000 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise here and I'd be
 
00:15:41.749 --> 00:15:41.759 align:start position:0%
okay with moving the first offense down
 
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:44.120 align:start position:0%
to a violation level offense but a
 
00:15:47.069 --> 00:15:47.079 align:start position:0%
second offense which changes the entire
 
00:15:48.670 --> 00:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
you know first offense a person may not
 
00:15:50.309 --> 00:15:50.319 align:start position:0%
know it's illegal to smoke in public
 
00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
it's legal they know it's legal so
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
therefore they may not realize they
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
can't smoke it in public the cigarettes
 
00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
are smoked in public and so we give them
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
a up to a $500 fine allows it a judge to
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
be able to offer classes or alternative
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
models um if he wants to on that first
 
00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:06.560 align:start position:0%
offense but the fine could be up to 00
 
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:10.040 align:start position:0%
$500 but on a second offense the mental
 
00:16:12.110 --> 00:16:12.120 align:start position:0%
state changes from I didn't know to you
 
00:16:14.269 --> 00:16:14.279 align:start position:0%
knowingly know it is and you've chosen
 
00:16:17.309 --> 00:16:17.319 align:start position:0%
not to follow the law so it's an act of
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
knowing it's not an act of I didn't know
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
and so from that reason I wanted I think
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
we should have an enhanced penalty
 
00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:26.160 align:start position:0%
because the person is is acting it
 
00:16:29.150 --> 00:16:29.160 align:start position:0%
absolutely contrary to the Hampshire law
 
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:30.800 align:start position:0%
and is just thumbing their nose at the
 
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:32.680 align:start position:0%
court after they've been after they've
 
00:16:35.069 --> 00:16:35.079 align:start position:0%
been already fined once for this so I
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
want to I'd like to see uh uh it be a
 
00:16:41.069 --> 00:16:41.079 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and and um and be I I don't
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
know we want to stick to a b or I'd
 
00:16:44.910 --> 00:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
prefer an a misdemeanor with up to a
 
00:16:48.150 --> 00:16:48.160 align:start position:0%
$2,000 Fine Again the judge can assess
 
00:16:49.710 --> 00:16:49.720 align:start position:0%
whether jail time because if it's a
 
00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
third and fourth offense the judge may
 
00:16:53.870 --> 00:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
want in increase that enhanced penalty
 
00:16:55.269 --> 00:16:55.279 align:start position:0%
and allow for jail time because this
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
guy's just not following the law and
 
00:17:01.749 --> 00:17:01.759 align:start position:0%
putting other citizens um rights if you
 
00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:05.160 align:start position:0%
will to aside right we've said that it
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
we don't want public consumption they're
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
just ignoring it we made a public policy
 
00:17:10.590 --> 00:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
of that for our citizens and they're
 
00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:13.079 align:start position:0%
ignoring it so I'd like to see it stay
 
00:17:14.590 --> 00:17:14.600 align:start position:0%
an a misdemeanor on a second and
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
subsequent offense and allow discretion
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:20.120 align:start position:0%
judge but I'm willing to go down to a
 
00:17:21.630 --> 00:17:21.640 align:start position:0%
violation on a first
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
offense thank you Mr chair with all due
 
00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
respect this uh this is New Hampshire
 
00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
this isn't Maine or Mac CH its and both
 
00:17:31.190 --> 00:17:31.200 align:start position:0%
of their their systems have completely
 
00:17:33.270 --> 00:17:33.280 align:start position:0%
failed their populations and are are
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
crumbling their states um if if if we
 
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.470 align:start position:0%
crumbling their states um if if if we
were

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:17:40.909 --> 00:17:40.919 align:start position:0%
to ignorantly leave this as a $100 fine
 
00:17:43.470 --> 00:17:43.480 align:start position:0%
no municipality would be enforcing that
 
00:17:45.950 --> 00:17:45.960 align:start position:0%
law because they would be losing money
 
00:17:48.549 --> 00:17:48.559 align:start position:0%
enforcing that law I I agree with the
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
senator we we need to have even stronger
 
00:17:54.669 --> 00:17:54.679 align:start position:0%
monetary um penalties for for public
 
00:17:56.350 --> 00:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
smoking we don't want public smoking and
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
it absolutely does infringe on other
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
people's rights not to do drugs right
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know we want to be able to breathe
 
00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
in public that's like a god-given right
 
00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:07.000 align:start position:0%
I know some people don't like that word
 
00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:10.840 align:start position:0%
but it is a god-given right so and and
 
00:18:12.590 --> 00:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
with all due respect there there was no
 
00:18:15.270 --> 00:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
compromise that there is no compromise
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
um we do need the Class B misdemeanor we
 
00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
do need strong penalties so that we can
 
00:18:25.149 --> 00:18:25.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
law one thing we need to consider is if
 
00:18:31.230 --> 00:18:31.240 align:start position:0%
a police officer say in conquered give
 
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
somebody a violation ticket
 
00:18:38.390 --> 00:18:38.400 align:start position:0%
for or uh smoking in public say uh three
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
months later the person's in Manchester
 
00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:43.480 align:start position:0%
uh he that person's smoking in public a
 
00:18:46.789 --> 00:18:46.799 align:start position:0%
Manchester police officer cites them at
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
this time there's no way the way the
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
system is is set up and correct me if
 
00:18:53.310 --> 00:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong uh Chief uh unless that's a
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
state summons we nobody will ever know
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not this is a first or second
 
00:19:01.789 --> 00:19:01.799 align:start position:0%
fence or third or fourth so and plus
 
00:19:06.470 --> 00:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
when also have to consider that when you
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
when you stop somebody from a violation
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
you still need to seize the marijuana it
 
00:19:13.870 --> 00:19:13.880 align:start position:0%
still needs to be uh and it also needs
 
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:16.960 align:start position:0%
to be tested as well so I would keep
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
that in mind and I just go back to and I
 
00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:22.600 align:start position:0%
understand the I understand the concept
 
00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
and I I I don't disagree with you on a
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
lot of it but we just decriminalized Mar
 
00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:30.760 align:start position:0%
we just decriminalized marijuana now
 
00:19:33.630 --> 00:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking about legalizing it so now
 
00:19:37.510 --> 00:19:37.520 align:start position:0%
it to me it just doesn't match up where
 
00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:40.760 align:start position:0%
the substance itself is legal
 
00:19:43.630 --> 00:19:43.640 align:start position:0%
but but we are going to uh make it a
 
00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:48.120 align:start position:0%
crime if you're smoking it in public we
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
with alcohol we we don't do that and I
 
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
understand in the reason I'm I'm I'd be
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
agreeable to or amendable if it has to
 
00:19:58.789 --> 00:19:58.799 align:start position:0%
go that way to a Class B misdemeanor
 
00:20:00.909 --> 00:20:00.919 align:start position:0%
is I understand the the the whole
 
00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:03.840 align:start position:0%
concept about secondhand smoke and what
 
00:20:06.510 --> 00:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
it can that you can actually have
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
marijuana in your system from the
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
secondhand smoke just to
 
00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:13.240 align:start position:0%
clarify would you be are you suggesting
 
00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:16.200 align:start position:0%
the first offense be a violation offense
 
00:20:18.110 --> 00:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
but the second offense would be a class
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
if we're going to go if it's if we're
 
00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
going to go to it a step up but so
 
00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:27.400 align:start position:0%
second offense would be a Class B
 
00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.870 align:start position:0%
second offense would be a Class B
misdemeanor

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
yeah as as opposed to a class A and and
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
and just for everyone knows the
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
difference between the two a Class B
 
00:20:38.310 --> 00:20:38.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor you cannot go to you would
 
00:20:40.029 --> 00:20:40.039 align:start position:0%
not be sentenced to jail I mean you are
 
00:20:42.549 --> 00:20:42.559 align:start position:0%
if you're violating like your pre-trial
 
00:20:43.549 --> 00:20:43.559 align:start position:0%
conditions or if you're violating
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
probation that can but that's different
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
but for that offense in of itself you
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
would not be sentenced to a jail
 
00:20:52.789 --> 00:20:52.799 align:start position:0%
sentence okay that's a question AG yeah
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
yeah you can ask so a question for the
 
00:20:58.510 --> 00:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
AG if we didn't CL specify a or B and
 
00:20:59.990 --> 00:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
just said misdem meter does that leave
 
00:21:01.510 --> 00:21:01.520 align:start position:0%
it to the discretion of the prosecutor
 
00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:03.880 align:start position:0%
to charge either
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
way misdem meter a the answer is yes
 
00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
answer so you'd have to provide notice
 
00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:16.200 align:start position:0%
if you're going to proceed with the the
 
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:19.240 align:start position:0%
a uh so if you're if you're not defining
 
00:21:21.190 --> 00:21:21.200 align:start position:0%
anything then the presumption would be a
 
00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:23.000 align:start position:0%
b if you're providing notice of those
 
00:21:24.750 --> 00:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalties then you could move
 
00:21:28.230 --> 00:21:28.240 align:start position:0%
it to an A so I guess Mr chair given
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
that that scenario I would I would agree
 
00:21:33.070 --> 00:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
with a violation on the first and just a
 
00:21:35.549 --> 00:21:35.559 align:start position:0%
word misdemeanor for the second and then
 
00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:37.440 align:start position:0%
if we have somebody who is you know
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
second offense they may again give them
 
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:40.960 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the doubt but a third
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
offense they could charge it as an a if
 
00:21:45.149 --> 00:21:45.159 align:start position:0%
they want to if that if that or fifth
 
00:21:46.750 --> 00:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
offense they could charge it as an a if
 
00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
they want to and then for allowing even
 
00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:50.679 align:start position:0%
further enhanced penals but if we just
 
00:21:52.669 --> 00:21:52.679 align:start position:0%
change it to a violation at the first
 
00:21:54.070 --> 00:21:54.080 align:start position:0%
level we don't even have to put a fine
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
because we know what the violations for
 
00:21:56.789 --> 00:21:56.799 align:start position:0%
misdemeanors are they're already in
 
00:21:59.149 --> 00:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
statute it's an up to language and the
 
00:22:00.909 --> 00:22:00.919 align:start position:0%
same with a misdemeanor there's an up to
 
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
language in statute already so we can
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
just change to it's it's a violation
 
00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:07.799 align:start position:0%
with no fine set and it's a misdemeanor
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
on a subsequent
 
00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:13.039 align:start position:0%
fence um thank you um you know I think
 
00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
it's important that I think we all agree
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
that smoking in public is not a good
 
00:22:17.909 --> 00:22:17.919 align:start position:0%
thing and I think we all are trying to
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
figure out how to mitigate and stop that
 
00:22:21.669 --> 00:22:21.679 align:start position:0%
from happening I think from our
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
perspective it's that's not the question
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
the question is what is effective and I
 
00:22:27.350 --> 00:22:27.360 align:start position:0%
think the research is quite clear that
 
00:22:29.350 --> 00:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
criminalizing conduct like this is not
 
00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
effective and in fact it puts hurdles in
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
front of people so if you're giving
 
00:22:35.110 --> 00:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
people even a be misdemeanor they're
 
00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
going to have a criminal record would
 
00:22:37.909 --> 00:22:37.919 align:start position:0%
makes it harder to get employment it
 
00:22:40.029 --> 00:22:40.039 align:start position:0%
makes it harder to get housing things
 
00:22:42.269 --> 00:22:42.279 align:start position:0%
that we know from research you know um
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
increase recidivism rates and so I think
 
00:22:46.830 --> 00:22:46.840 align:start position:0%
it would be problematic for us to kind
 
00:22:48.350 --> 00:22:48.360 align:start position:0%
of put those additional hurdles in front
 
00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:50.480 align:start position:0%
of people if we're trying to stop people
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
from smoking in public and the research
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't show that that would actually be
 
00:22:55.350 --> 00:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
effective but the research does show
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
that it would make it harder and create
 
00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
collateral harms from idual why would we
 
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:00.760 align:start position:0%
go that route um and I think that's
 
00:23:03.029 --> 00:23:03.039 align:start position:0%
that's a core part of our concern here
 
00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:04.600 align:start position:0%
so you know we all agree smoking in
 
00:23:06.110 --> 00:23:06.120 align:start position:0%
public is bad but let's figure out a way
 
00:23:07.990 --> 00:23:08.000 align:start position:0%
to do that that's effective and
 
00:23:10.990 --> 00:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
minimizes harm how many times would
 
00:23:13.750 --> 00:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
someone have to be found responsible for
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
a violation before you would be
 
00:23:17.870 --> 00:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with it being a Class B MISD
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
I mean five 10 I mean there it does
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
reach a point
 
00:23:24.149 --> 00:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
where people are just going to pay the
 
00:23:26.110 --> 00:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
fine and do what they want I think it's
 
00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:27.320 align:start position:0%
the same with smoking cigarettes in
 
00:23:28.830 --> 00:23:28.840 align:start position:0%
public which have tremendous secondhand
 
00:23:31.070 --> 00:23:31.080 align:start position:0%
consequences you know there's I don't
 
00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:32.480 align:start position:0%
know what that magic number is but
 
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:35.080 align:start position:0%
criminalizing we know is not effective
 
00:23:36.789 --> 00:23:36.799 align:start position:0%
and so I think it's it's I guess the
 
00:23:38.390 --> 00:23:38.400 align:start position:0%
premise I think I have concerns with
 
00:23:39.590 --> 00:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
because that premise assumes that at
 
00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
some point it becomes effective I've
 
00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
never seen research to show that it does
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
become effective I'm asking though for
 
00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:46.039 align:start position:0%
the purposes of this because the number
 
00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
one complaint I hear about any
 
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
recreational policy in the other states
 
00:23:50.909 --> 00:23:50.919 align:start position:0%
and this is just talking to people on
 
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:53.400 align:start position:0%
the people in the communities is the
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
public use issue that's what bothers a
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
lot of people that's what bothers me and
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
can we stop it will people still violate
 
00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:02.840 align:start position:0%
the you can criminalize there's class A
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
felonies out there people violate the
 
00:24:06.870 --> 00:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
Wason you're right it doesn't deter
 
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:08.960 align:start position:0%
people from doing horrible things all
 
00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:11.840 align:start position:0%
right this violent crimes all I can go
 
00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:15.919 align:start position:0%
on and on I'm just asking how many times
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
does someone have to violate this
 
00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:20.640 align:start position:0%
provision intentionally smoke or vape
 
00:24:23.870 --> 00:24:23.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis in a public place before you're
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
comfortable and say all right now we can
 
00:24:28.029 --> 00:24:28.039 align:start position:0%
do a class be Mr it could be a High
 
00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
number I'm just trying to say at some
 
00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:32.480 align:start position:0%
point is it really out of line to
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
elevate the offense I know there was a
 
00:24:36.789 --> 00:24:36.799 align:start position:0%
suggestion on the second offense maybe
 
00:24:38.990 --> 00:24:39.000 align:start position:0%
the third offense maybe the fourth but
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
again you're whoever's getting in
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
trouble for this they're intentionally
 
00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:45.159 align:start position:0%
violating law they're not they're not
 
00:24:46.590 --> 00:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
even trying to comply with they're going
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
well out of their way so I'm just asking
 
00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
what what's the what's the common ground
 
00:24:53.070 --> 00:24:53.080 align:start position:0%
here I think we also have to realize
 
00:24:54.350 --> 00:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
like in a state like New Hampshire where
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
we have urban and rural you know this is
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
going to be applied quite differently in
 
00:24:58.909 --> 00:24:58.919 align:start position:0%
different places where people who live
 
00:25:00.909 --> 00:25:00.919 align:start position:0%
in dense raw areas have less opportunity
 
00:25:03.149 --> 00:25:03.159 align:start position:0%
to smoke potentially in their I mean so
 
00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
there's there's not equal footing in our
 
00:25:07.110 --> 00:25:07.120 align:start position:0%
state on this issue um right off the bat
 
00:25:08.909 --> 00:25:08.919 align:start position:0%
and so I don't know that there's a magic
 
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:10.440 align:start position:0%
number I because I don't know where the
 
00:25:12.029 --> 00:25:12.039 align:start position:0%
evidence shows that there is a magic
 
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:14.240 align:start position:0%
number Our concern is that criminalizing
 
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:15.200 align:start position:0%
this type of conduct is
 
00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
counterproductive to Public Safety um
 
00:25:19.950 --> 00:25:19.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a deterrent and so I don't see
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
a magic number really appearing if if
 
00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:23.840 align:start position:0%
those are the Baseline
 
00:25:25.549 --> 00:25:25.559 align:start position:0%
facts I
 
00:25:28.029 --> 00:25:28.039 align:start position:0%
mean not saying any numbers right M
 
00:25:30.990 --> 00:25:31.000 align:start position:0%
asking five on the fifth offense can we
 
00:25:34.350 --> 00:25:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
mrir I don't I'm sure others have the
 
00:25:37.039 --> 00:25:38.149 align:start position:0%
mrir I don't I'm sure others have the
answer

00:25:38.149 --> 00:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:25:40.909 --> 00:25:40.919 align:start position:0%
no Chief thank you Mr chair well with
 
00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:42.520 align:start position:0%
due resp with all due respect to my
 
00:25:45.230 --> 00:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
commission colleague consequences do
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
affect public Behavior Uh that is the
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
reason why we have a system of laws in
 
00:25:51.149 --> 00:25:51.159 align:start position:0%
the country with
 
00:25:53.669 --> 00:25:53.679 align:start position:0%
penalties and in this case the
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
discussion now centers on what is the
 
00:25:59.669 --> 00:25:59.679 align:start position:0%
necessary consequence deter people from
 
00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:02.200 align:start position:0%
smoking cannabis in public which we all
 
00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
take judicial notice of that in places
 
00:26:07.909 --> 00:26:07.919 align:start position:0%
uh near us uh the penalties have been
 
00:26:10.549 --> 00:26:10.559 align:start position:0%
ineffective totally ineffective in
 
00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:15.159 align:start position:0%
inhibiting that practice so in this case
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um well it
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
is humankind nature to not want to
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
criminalize on the alternative side uh
 
00:26:29.909 --> 00:26:29.919 align:start position:0%
if we were to enact a panel and fine uh
 
00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
significant with consequences
 
00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
significant enough so that the general
 
00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:38.120 align:start position:0%
public both residents and visitors would
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
take notice that it is not a wise idea
 
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
and a costly idea and the analogy
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
frankly ladies and gentlemen would be uh
 
00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:51.640 align:start position:0%
our current endemic of speeding in the
 
00:26:53.750 --> 00:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire uh where the
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
fineing fee schedule is totally uh
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
ineffective in detering speeding so in
 
00:27:02.430 --> 00:27:02.440 align:start position:0%
this case the proposal that I would uh
 
00:27:04.389 --> 00:27:04.399 align:start position:0%
recommend is that we start with a
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum where the judge cannot
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
reduce it down to a Happy Meal somewhere
 
00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:14.159 align:start position:0%
at the $150 to $250 range a minimum not
 
00:27:18.029 --> 00:27:18.039 align:start position:0%
uh not less than um and then up to $500
 
00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:20.840 align:start position:0%
and then graduated into a Class B
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor for subsequent
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
offenses uh with a mandatory minimum of
 
00:27:28.269 --> 00:27:28.279 align:start position:0%
not less than
 
00:27:30.630 --> 00:27:30.640 align:start position:0%
uh it sends the clear message that the
 
00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:33.200 align:start position:0%
state is serious about detering this
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
kind of behavior uh and it is a bit
 
00:27:41.710 --> 00:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
costly uh which does uh tend to create
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
uh the consequence inhibition in human
 
00:27:46.750 --> 00:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
behavior human behavior does pay
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
attention to consequences we've seen
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
that every place else in the country for
 
00:27:53.070 --> 00:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
anyone who hasn't spoke on this issue
 
00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:54.600 align:start position:0%
yet does anyone else have any comment as
 
00:27:57.110 --> 00:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
they watch four of us or five of us
 
00:27:59.470 --> 00:27:59.480 align:start position:0%
debate amongst ourselves and I feel like
 
00:28:02.190 --> 00:28:02.200 align:start position:0%
you know we're all we're all taking on
 
00:28:04.070 --> 00:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
Frank by ourselves you know what's
 
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
him I I would actually like to know if
 
00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
there's a single policy that he can
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
recommend that has actually succeeded in
 
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
stopping people from smoking publicly in
 
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
states that don't want public smoking a
 
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.190 align:start position:0%
states that don't want public smoking a
single

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
single
 
00:28:20.909 --> 00:28:20.919 align:start position:0%
policy I mean I think that's the
 
00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:23.200 align:start position:0%
research that we need to focus on and I
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
think part I mean part of the reason we
 
00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:25.760 align:start position:0%
have problems with our criminal legal
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
system in the first place is because
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
we've put criminal laws into place
 
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:30.240 align:start position:0%
without any evidence that they're
 
00:28:32.310 --> 00:28:32.320 align:start position:0%
effective that's led to mass I mean we
 
00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:34.640 align:start position:0%
have 5% of the world's population 25% of
 
00:28:36.430 --> 00:28:36.440 align:start position:0%
the world's incarcerated population
 
00:28:37.789 --> 00:28:37.799 align:start position:0%
because we didn't do research on the
 
00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:40.480 align:start position:0%
front end and put into law you know put
 
00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:42.120 align:start position:0%
into policy laws that are actually
 
00:28:43.590 --> 00:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
counterproductive and we're starting to
 
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
repeal those laws across the country so
 
00:28:46.870 --> 00:28:46.880 align:start position:0%
I think it's important that we on the
 
00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:48.600 align:start position:0%
front end before you create criminal
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
laws and take away people's Liberty
 
00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:52.640 align:start position:0%
figure out ways that is this effective
 
00:28:54.549 --> 00:28:54.559 align:start position:0%
and if the answer is yes then that's
 
00:28:55.950 --> 00:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
potentially appropriate if the answer is
 
00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
no if there's no research we we
 
00:28:59.430 --> 00:28:59.440 align:start position:0%
shouldn't do that we shouldn't you know
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
the the the gut check shouldn't be
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
criminalized the gut check should be
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
what is effective and go from
 
00:29:09.710 --> 00:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
there any comment any so what you're
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
saying is you have no no policy that
 
00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.029 align:start position:0%
saying is you have no no policy that
succeeds

00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
succeeds
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
well listen it you can make this a class
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
a felony people are still going to
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
violate the law so I don't think that
 
00:29:23.350 --> 00:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
that making it a harsh penalty is going
 
00:29:26.230 --> 00:29:26.240 align:start position:0%
to stop it in its entirety rips him H
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
welcome back yeah I I'm I'm a big
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
believer of kiss and um and so I would
 
00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
say we should model what after the
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
Smoking law is because that way the the
 
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:39.240 align:start position:0%
the officer won't get into you know whe
 
00:29:40.830 --> 00:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
whether whether were smoking marijuana
 
00:29:43.669 --> 00:29:43.679 align:start position:0%
or smoking C whatever it is you smoking
 
00:29:45.269 --> 00:29:45.279 align:start position:0%
we have you know do you're not allow to
 
00:29:48.909 --> 00:29:48.919 align:start position:0%
smoke in public and keep it simple and
 
00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
and uh uh if if if you really that in
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
terms of you know getting making some
 
00:29:56.789 --> 00:29:56.799 align:start position:0%
tears and making like this I I just
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
don't know any of those things were
 
00:29:59.950 --> 00:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
effective because most people just were
 
00:30:02.070 --> 00:30:02.080 align:start position:0%
going to smoke I mean when you're out in
 
00:30:03.389 --> 00:30:03.399 align:start position:0%
the middle of the woods and nobody's
 
00:30:04.909 --> 00:30:04.919 align:start position:0%
around you and you were smoking and then
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden just happened to be a
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
fishing game guy walk by you know and oh
 
00:30:12.029 --> 00:30:12.039 align:start position:0%
my God versus you know walking down the
 
00:30:14.909 --> 00:30:14.919 align:start position:0%
Main Street where uh to a concert and
 
00:30:17.149 --> 00:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
everybody in his brother is smoking and
 
00:30:19.630 --> 00:30:19.640 align:start position:0%
the LA is not going to enforce it there
 
00:30:20.870 --> 00:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
because there's too many people to
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
enforce it against so it just keep it
 
00:30:27.669 --> 00:30:27.679 align:start position:0%
simple I I will say the putting in line
 
00:30:31.470 --> 00:30:31.480 align:start position:0%
with tobacco would stall this in the in
 
00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.230 align:start position:0%
with tobacco would stall this in the in
the

00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:30:35.669 --> 00:30:35.679 align:start position:0%
Senate uh okay well whatever me you
 
00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:37.159 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to smoke it right out
 
00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320 align:start position:0%
front of the state house and that that
 
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
was a deal break that's still a $100
 
00:30:43.029 --> 00:30:43.039 align:start position:0%
fine isn't it Mr chair if I can propose
 
00:30:44.909 --> 00:30:44.919 align:start position:0%
some language and just see if how we
 
00:30:46.389 --> 00:30:46.399 align:start position:0%
take a raise of hands to see who would
 
00:30:48.149 --> 00:30:48.159 align:start position:0%
support that maybe we can move past this
 
00:30:50.190 --> 00:30:50.200 align:start position:0%
piece um I understand some people aren't
 
00:30:51.750 --> 00:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
going to support the recommendation but
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
to see if we get a majority of the
 
00:30:54.509 --> 00:30:54.519 align:start position:0%
committee to say yes so the
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
recommendation is that no person shall
 
00:30:57.870 --> 00:30:57.880 align:start position:0%
smoke or vaporized can abis in an area
 
00:30:59.549 --> 00:30:59.559 align:start position:0%
accessible to any public any person who
 
00:31:01.110 --> 00:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
violates this section shall be guilty of
 
00:31:02.629 --> 00:31:02.639 align:start position:0%
a violation and shall forfeit the
 
00:31:04.430 --> 00:31:04.440 align:start position:0%
Cannabis and cannabis products for the
 
00:31:06.430 --> 00:31:06.440 align:start position:0%
first offense on a subsequent offense it
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
shall be a misdemeanor um a subsequent
 
00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.120 align:start position:0%
offense within three years shall be a
 
00:31:13.310 --> 00:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor period just let's not set
 
00:31:16.629 --> 00:31:16.639 align:start position:0%
fines let's not set uh limitations it
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
makes it simple it's a violation it's a
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor uh because we've heard from
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
the AG that a misdemeanor can go either
 
00:31:24.789 --> 00:31:24.799 align:start position:0%
A or B depending on what the prosecutor
 
00:31:27.230 --> 00:31:27.240 align:start position:0%
wants to bring based on history it
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
allows for some flexibility and
 
00:31:30.710 --> 00:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
discretion um it doesn't it allows a
 
00:31:32.950 --> 00:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
judge to be able to wave fines and allow
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
a class if they want um instead of
 
00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
setting a prescriptive uh U value in a a
 
00:31:42.029 --> 00:31:42.039 align:start position:0%
violation so something as simple as that
 
00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
to John to John's point the
 
00:31:44.909 --> 00:31:44.919 align:start position:0%
representative Hunts Point it's a kiss
 
00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
symbol a kiss principle violation on
 
00:31:48.509 --> 00:31:48.519 align:start position:0%
first offense misdemeanor on second
 
00:31:50.909 --> 00:31:50.919 align:start position:0%
offense within three years and let the
 
00:31:52.990 --> 00:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
let it let it roll out from there sink
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
can I make a a comment maybe first first
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
offense violation second offense Class B
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
misia third offense no that starts
 
00:32:06.190 --> 00:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
violating John's kiss principle right we
 
00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
just say misdemeanor it allows for
 
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:10.720 align:start position:0%
prosecutorial discretion um based on the
 
00:32:12.669 --> 00:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
number of offenses again if this guy's
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
the fifth offense I may want to charge
 
00:32:15.509 --> 00:32:15.519 align:start position:0%
as a be misdemeanor for the second and
 
00:32:17.149 --> 00:32:17.159 align:start position:0%
third offense but by the fourth offense
 
00:32:18.389 --> 00:32:18.399 align:start position:0%
I'm done with this guy and I want to
 
00:32:20.549 --> 00:32:20.559 align:start position:0%
charge I guess I I will say because I
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
told you before I have nothing about
 
00:32:23.629 --> 00:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
this criminal stuff because I don't but
 
00:32:27.789 --> 00:32:27.799 align:start position:0%
the one thing I do know is that um if
 
00:32:29.750 --> 00:32:29.760 align:start position:0%
you just say muner that automatically
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
defaults to a be no it defaults to a
 
00:32:36.509 --> 00:32:36.519 align:start position:0%
because it's the assumption that when we
 
00:32:37.870 --> 00:32:37.880 align:start position:0%
didn't have a
 
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
b oh we it anything that was just said
 
00:32:45.269 --> 00:32:45.279 align:start position:0%
mror that was automatically in a then B
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
creates a new category but I'm just
 
00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:50.360 align:start position:0%
saying is that that my understanding
 
00:32:53.870 --> 00:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
from my short time here in the house is
 
00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:57.080 align:start position:0%
that uh if you don't say it it's on it's
 
00:32:59.029 --> 00:32:59.039 align:start position:0%
assumed it's an a because it's an old
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
statute no no um represent what the
 
00:33:04.070 --> 00:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
represent from
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
the AG's office to um offer comment yeah
 
00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.950 align:start position:0%
the AG's office to um offer comment yeah
RSA

00:33:09.950 --> 00:33:09.960 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
00:33:14.389 --> 00:33:14.399 align:start position:0%
6259 Roman numeral 4 um C addresses the
 
00:33:16.990 --> 00:33:17.000 align:start position:0%
the classification of misdemeanors uh if
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
it's specified in law then that holds so
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
if it's a Class B or Class A then that
 
00:33:23.669 --> 00:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
designation holds if it's undesignated
 
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
uh then the the default would be for a
 
00:33:27.789 --> 00:33:27.799 align:start position:0%
class B unless there are three
 
00:33:30.029 --> 00:33:30.039 align:start position:0%
circumstances where it could be um
 
00:33:31.669 --> 00:33:31.679 align:start position:0%
elevated so for example if it's a threat
 
00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:34.080 align:start position:0%
of violence then uh that would be a
 
00:33:39.190 --> 00:33:39.200 align:start position:0%
Class A if it's unspecified or if a a um
 
00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
prosecutor files a notice of intent to
 
00:33:44.750 --> 00:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
seek the enhance penalties under C2 uh
 
00:33:46.629 --> 00:33:46.639 align:start position:0%
and filing the notice of intent form
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
then that would elevate it from a Class
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
B to a class
 
00:33:53.070 --> 00:33:53.080 align:start position:0%
A so again we can I just ask for a show
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
a hands and see who would support kind
 
00:33:56.950 --> 00:33:56.960 align:start position:0%
have a question uh to the does it propos
 
00:33:59.310 --> 00:33:59.320 align:start position:0%
proposal that you just put up not
 
00:34:03.990 --> 00:34:04.000 align:start position:0%
contain a fine it it leaves sorry it
 
00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:06.120 align:start position:0%
would leave the current fine schedule
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
for a violation which is up to $1,000
 
00:34:09.669 --> 00:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
right that's what a that's what is a
 
00:34:11.230 --> 00:34:11.240 align:start position:0%
violation level offense if I remember
 
00:34:13.470 --> 00:34:13.480 align:start position:0%
right and a be a misdemeanor has a
 
00:34:17.589 --> 00:34:17.599 align:start position:0%
violation uh fine up to $2,000 or let
 
00:34:19.550 --> 00:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
let me so I I think if I remember right
 
00:34:21.470 --> 00:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
those are the I'm not sure about a B
 
00:34:23.790 --> 00:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor what the high is a thousand
 
00:34:25.030 --> 00:34:25.040 align:start position:0%
again still
 
00:34:28.349 --> 00:34:28.359 align:start position:0%
12,200 so again would l for a maximum
 
00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:30.200 align:start position:0%
fine up to those levels but doesn't
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
designate A Fine Again leaving it to um
 
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
the aggravating mitigating circumstances
 
00:34:38.710 --> 00:34:38.720 align:start position:0%
of an individual offense the judge could
 
00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
certify well let me make u a prediction
 
00:34:44.389 --> 00:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
based on my 45 years of experience in
 
00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
law enforcement you will never get to a
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
Class B misdemeanor because the vast
 
00:34:51.750 --> 00:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
majority of police officers under those
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
conditions under the circumstances that
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
you just described will make the person
 
00:34:59.030 --> 00:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
and stop throw it away or take
 
00:35:00.430 --> 00:35:00.440 align:start position:0%
possession of it and that'll be the end
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
of it you won't never get to the second
 
00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
offense in the real world that may in
 
00:35:06.829 --> 00:35:06.839 align:start position:0%
the real world that's what will happen
 
00:35:08.109 --> 00:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
ladies and gentlemen no I understand
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
that that that's but that's also keep in
 
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.550 align:start position:0%
that that that's but that's also keep in
mind

00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
mind
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's and and by the way that
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
will not deter at all one thing that we
 
00:35:24.109 --> 00:35:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:26.550 --> 00:35:26.560 align:start position:0%
in if if you guys are really serious
 
00:35:29.349 --> 00:35:29.359 align:start position:0%
about not having public smoking you know
 
00:35:31.270 --> 00:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
that this proposal is a joke but
 
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't they but couldn't descriptive
 
00:35:36.710 --> 00:35:36.720 align:start position:0%
or wrong if they if a person let's say
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
it could be their second offense I mean
 
00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:42.680 align:start position:0%
they can still be charged or issued the
 
00:35:44.790 --> 00:35:44.800 align:start position:0%
violation is the first that's up you
 
00:35:46.829 --> 00:35:46.839 align:start position:0%
won't get there the practical
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
application in in humanity is is that
 
00:35:51.550 --> 00:35:51.560 align:start position:0%
most police officers given the legality
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
of the substance and the and the
 
00:35:58.030 --> 00:35:58.040 align:start position:0%
relative low uh and processing nature
 
00:36:00.829 --> 00:36:00.839 align:start position:0%
and cost as as the good representative
 
00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
indicated exercising the system is a
 
00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.440 align:start position:0%
burden to the taxpayer at this point and
 
00:36:08.109 --> 00:36:08.119 align:start position:0%
without any deterrent
 
00:36:11.390 --> 00:36:11.400 align:start position:0%
effect so uh better to have a deterrent
 
00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:14.560 align:start position:0%
effect or have nothing at all because at
 
00:36:18.349 --> 00:36:18.359 align:start position:0%
the end of the day you need to make
 
00:36:20.750 --> 00:36:20.760 align:start position:0%
sense of what you're doing and that's
 
00:36:22.670 --> 00:36:22.680 align:start position:0%
the practical application that I'm
 
00:36:26.309 --> 00:36:26.319 align:start position:0%
predicting here both so without a fine
 
00:36:28.550 --> 00:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
uh it's not going to go anywhere it's
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
going to get end up being dumped and
 
00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
that's the end of the day you won't
 
00:36:34.990 --> 00:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
never get to a class feed Mr Mayor but I
 
00:36:37.990 --> 00:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
think the first I think what Senator
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
Lang was suggesting was the first
 
00:36:43.870 --> 00:36:43.880 align:start position:0%
offense could be up to a, fund for the
 
00:36:47.470 --> 00:36:47.480 align:start position:0%
violation it could be up to $1,000 fine
 
00:36:50.309 --> 00:36:50.319 align:start position:0%
but uh but no less than you want less
 
00:36:53.390 --> 00:36:53.400 align:start position:0%
than language but there needs to be a
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
threshold again because people simply
 
00:36:59.270 --> 00:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
won't know what they're facing it could
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
be a $5 fine it could be a $10 fine the
 
00:37:05.270 --> 00:37:05.280 align:start position:0%
judge has wide latitude so under that
 
00:37:08.230 --> 00:37:08.240 align:start position:0%
under that scenario maybe no less than
 
00:37:12.710 --> 00:37:12.720 align:start position:0%
100 bucks if smoking's 100 every sign
 
00:37:14.109 --> 00:37:14.119 align:start position:0%
they're not the same thing with all due
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
respect say any smoken device it'll be a
 
00:37:20.750 --> 00:37:20.760 align:start position:0%
$100 F Well maybe maybe we do just so we
 
00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200 align:start position:0%
can get a motion voted on here or maybe
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
we do no less than 100 but up to a th000
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
some offenses are more egregious than
 
00:37:32.230 --> 00:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
others and this is as we discussed in
 
00:37:33.630 --> 00:37:33.640 align:start position:0%
the last meeting for the benefit of
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
those that were here there was I think
 
00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh a significant discussion regarding
 
00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
the differentiation between smoking
 
00:37:44.030 --> 00:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis in public and the ill effects
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
that could uh ascribe to that from
 
00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:49.720 align:start position:0%
people nearby versus smoking otherwise
 
00:37:51.270 --> 00:37:51.280 align:start position:0%
well what's do this what's what's vote
 
00:37:52.990 --> 00:37:53.000 align:start position:0%
on what nothing's final by the way
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
there's still going to be this still has
 
00:37:55.510 --> 00:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
to be introduced legisl still has to be
 
00:37:57.589 --> 00:37:57.599 align:start position:0%
public hearings on that I'm just
 
00:37:59.030 --> 00:37:59.040 align:start position:0%
we got a lot of pages to go but why
 
00:38:01.430 --> 00:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't we just take for Senator Lang's
 
00:38:04.190 --> 00:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
proposal who's in favor that please
 
00:38:09.109 --> 00:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:12.910 --> 00:38:12.920 align:start position:0%
hand sure to reread it just it would
 
00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:15.240 align:start position:0%
just say that any person who violates a
 
00:38:17.550 --> 00:38:17.560 align:start position:0%
section shall be guilty of a violation
 
00:38:19.550 --> 00:38:19.560 align:start position:0%
on first offense and shall forfeit all
 
00:38:22.430 --> 00:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis and products um and on a second
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
offense be guilty of a misdemeanor
 
00:38:26.870 --> 00:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
subject to Forfeit of uh cannabis
 
00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
products if the offense occurs the
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
second offense occurs within three years
 
00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:34.720 align:start position:0%
so again allows I mean I'd be we weren't
 
00:38:36.710 --> 00:38:36.720 align:start position:0%
close by the way so we W even close so
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
that's so if the sticking point is a
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
minimum threshold I don't know what
 
00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's sticking point is how about
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
this because we don't have a consensus
 
00:38:49.109 --> 00:38:49.119 align:start position:0%
uh as it's proposed $500 fine is that
 
00:38:53.270 --> 00:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
what people that is that is that the
 
00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
consensus that's even wor if you if you
 
00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
the original Lang in there who supports
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:02.829 --> 00:39:02.839 align:start position:0%
hand well these guys
 
00:39:06.030 --> 00:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
want want enfor
 
00:39:08.430 --> 00:39:08.440 align:start position:0%
so remember this is still going to go
 
00:39:10.470 --> 00:39:10.480 align:start position:0%
through committees in multiple Chambers
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
here right but I'm just trying to and
 
00:39:15.230 --> 00:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
clearly smoking cigarettes doesn't cost
 
00:39:17.710 --> 00:39:17.720 align:start position:0%
my security yeah I'm not compar I don't
 
00:39:21.270 --> 00:39:21.280 align:start position:0%
I agree with you tobacco and games are
 
00:39:24.630 --> 00:39:24.640 align:start position:0%
different human nature is if you want to
 
00:39:27.470 --> 00:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
avoid folks getting J Amed with a
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and being put in the
 
00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
criminal system then started off with
 
00:39:35.910 --> 00:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
something that is consequential
 
00:39:38.790 --> 00:39:38.800 align:start position:0%
sufficiently consequential to alert them
 
00:39:40.670 --> 00:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
what Chief what I'm going to do I'm
 
00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
going to leave the language that's in
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
the the the rough draft as it is and
 
00:39:47.349 --> 00:39:47.359 align:start position:0%
when that goes through the when there's
 
00:39:48.670 --> 00:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
public hearings in the house and Sen
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be fought over there at
 
00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:52.040 align:start position:0%
this point we don't have a consensus on
 
00:39:54.430 --> 00:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
anything we don't so you know I don't I
 
00:39:55.309 --> 00:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to strike the
 
00:39:56.589 --> 00:39:56.599 align:start position:0%
language so we're going to leave it as
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
it is for now and I I think in the
 
00:40:00.750 --> 00:40:00.760 align:start position:0%
public hearings we'll debate that more
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
if we want to cover that issue again if
 
00:40:04.589 --> 00:40:04.599 align:start position:0%
we have time we will but I think we got
 
00:40:06.550 --> 00:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
to move on so because we have another
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
very animated uh conversation have on
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
page seven lines 5 to 25 that's
 
00:40:16.109 --> 00:40:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:20.349 --> 00:40:20.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:22.829 --> 00:40:22.839 align:start position:0%
uh it creates a lot of problems that
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to deal with now so
 
00:40:29.150 --> 00:40:29.160 align:start position:0%
um as it's
 
00:40:31.270 --> 00:40:31.280 align:start position:0%
written does anyone have any issues with
 
00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:34.520 align:start position:0%
the language as it's written
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
abut FL is yours represent Gil this is
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
this is not a strong enough deterrent
 
00:40:41.309 --> 00:40:41.319 align:start position:0%
with the amount of traffic fatalities
 
00:40:43.390 --> 00:40:43.400 align:start position:0%
that we're experiencing on our roads the
 
00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
highest number of motorcycle fatalities
 
00:40:47.230 --> 00:40:47.240 align:start position:0%
we've had in 20
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
years $150 fine that's like a clown
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
show and we also need some language for
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
for handsfree use of vaporizing so you
 
00:41:00.270 --> 00:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
on are you on number line
 
00:41:04.470 --> 00:41:04.480 align:start position:0%
15 16 16 yeah sorry this Roman numeral
 
00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:05.910 align:start position:0%
15 16 16 yeah sorry this Roman numeral
two

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:41:08.430 --> 00:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
Senator I think he's on R Minal three
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I I assumed that we were just
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
going to be talking about this as a
 
00:41:14.670 --> 00:41:14.680 align:start position:0%
whole bu bang so is everybody okay with
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
section one as it's
 
00:41:20.069 --> 00:41:20.079 align:start position:0%
written everybody okay with section two
 
00:41:20.079 --> 00:41:21.069 align:start position:0%
written everybody okay with section two
is

00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:41:24.990 --> 00:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
written great now we're on three and the
 
00:41:27.150 --> 00:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
penalty portion of it is representative
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
kill's issue yeah I prefer that to be
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
say misdemeanor
 
00:41:35.550 --> 00:41:35.560 align:start position:0%
not um violation so that mean and if you
 
00:41:43.470 --> 00:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:45.800 align:start position:0%
section I also think it needs to include
 
00:41:48.230 --> 00:41:48.240 align:start position:0%
language about the hands-free use of
 
00:41:50.670 --> 00:41:50.680 align:start position:0%
these stupid vaporizer pens I mean let's
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
be honest when people are driving down
 
00:41:53.510 --> 00:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
the road using them they're not driving
 
00:41:56.309 --> 00:41:56.319 align:start position:0%
for the handsfree issue you just raised
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
we can make that its own Roman numeral
 
00:42:00.670 --> 00:42:00.680 align:start position:0%
so perhaps at the next meeting maybe
 
00:42:03.230 --> 00:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
we'll have a potential Roman numeral six
 
00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
if you can put something together for us
 
00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
to to look at but I think that
 
00:42:09.069 --> 00:42:09.079 align:start position:0%
that's um that's something obviously
 
00:42:09.079 --> 00:42:10.430 align:start position:0%
that's um that's something obviously
worth

00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:10.440 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:42:14.109 --> 00:42:14.119 align:start position:0%
discussing uh Senator the the question
 
00:42:17.829 --> 00:42:17.839 align:start position:0%
here from uh Public Safety is where uh
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
in these sections if this is the correct
 
00:42:23.670 --> 00:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
section should we have a discussion with
 
00:42:27.470 --> 00:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
respect to establishing a prima fascia
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
limit for an
 
00:42:34.030 --> 00:42:34.040 align:start position:0%
operator with a certain amount of th
 
00:42:36.670 --> 00:42:36.680 align:start position:0%
Delta 9 THC per nanogram per milliliter
 
00:42:39.630 --> 00:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
of blood that's consistent with some of
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
the other states many of the other
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
states that are
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
legalized Dr shaking her head can you
 
00:42:48.990 --> 00:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
offer us some I see I know there's
 
00:42:50.910 --> 00:42:50.920 align:start position:0%
different yeah I I mean I don't know
 
00:42:52.390 --> 00:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
what the cut offs are that I I'm sure
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
the chief does but I I certainly think
 
00:42:56.109 --> 00:42:56.119 align:start position:0%
you know if people are driving in talk
 
00:42:57.870 --> 00:42:57.880 align:start position:0%
toxicated and putting the rest of us all
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
at risk there should be some cut off
 
00:43:04.710 --> 00:43:04.720 align:start position:0%
that's um that is um I mean that that
 
00:43:06.270 --> 00:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
the police have to work off of I know
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
that like in Seattle this like my
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
friends in the police force there where
 
00:43:11.390 --> 00:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
I grew up had a really you know strong
 
00:43:12.829 --> 00:43:12.839 align:start position:0%
learning curve of saying like clearly
 
00:43:14.910 --> 00:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
they're intoxicated but we we don't know
 
00:43:16.990 --> 00:43:17.000 align:start position:0%
how to enforce this we need to make it
 
00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
enforcable so let's just say that the
 
00:43:23.270 --> 00:43:23.280 align:start position:0%
limit was to is integrant am I saying
 
00:43:25.710 --> 00:43:25.720 align:start position:0%
that correctly the the range that we see
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
in States range from two nanograms per
 
00:43:32.190 --> 00:43:32.200 align:start position:0%
milliliter up to seven um nanograms per
 
00:43:34.630 --> 00:43:34.640 align:start position:0%
milliliters uh one state is actually at
 
00:43:37.510 --> 00:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
zero but here's here's the issue it's
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
it's not and it should not be
 
00:43:42.109 --> 00:43:42.119 align:start position:0%
interpreted the same way as a breath
 
00:43:45.390 --> 00:43:45.400 align:start position:0%
test is uh and here's the reason why a
 
00:43:47.309 --> 00:43:47.319 align:start position:0%
breath test we've come to the scientific
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion that 0.008 uh is presumptive
 
00:43:53.069 --> 00:43:53.079 align:start position:0%
limit scientifically for impairment for
 
00:43:56.190 --> 00:43:56.200 align:start position:0%
operation of a motor vehicle Uh current
 
00:43:58.630 --> 00:43:58.640 align:start position:0%
ly there is no scientific evidence with
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
respect to intoxication by cannabis the
 
00:44:05.150 --> 00:44:05.160 align:start position:0%
states that have set a limit have said
 
00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:09.200 align:start position:0%
so knowingly and arbitrarily to induce
 
00:44:12.390 --> 00:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
their population that now has legalize
 
00:44:15.829 --> 00:44:15.839 align:start position:0%
cannabis to not drive right with while
 
00:44:18.510 --> 00:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
using cannabis or under the influence of
 
00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis so uh this would be a prima
 
00:44:26.270 --> 00:44:26.280 align:start position:0%
fascia uh limit which means that it
 
00:44:29.309 --> 00:44:29.319 align:start position:0%
would only establish along with other
 
00:44:31.230 --> 00:44:31.240 align:start position:0%
evidence produced by a law enforcement
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
officer a level of intoxication but it
 
00:44:37.870 --> 00:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
at least allows the officer bring
 
00:44:39.549 --> 00:44:39.559 align:start position:0%
legitimate charges before the judge and
 
00:44:41.589 --> 00:44:41.599 align:start position:0%
produce other evidence now can I ask one
 
00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
question yeah so I understand the
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
various this is a ballpark it's a
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
question for Dr Younger if let's just
 
00:44:50.990 --> 00:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
say it was five nags am I saying that
 
00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800 align:start position:0%
correctly nagr familiar and so if I if
 
00:44:56.069 --> 00:44:56.079 align:start position:0%
it's it's just say the it's the per se
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
five how much cannabis is someone we
 
00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:04.040 align:start position:0%
just use my someone 215 pounds how much
 
00:45:06.990 --> 00:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
do I have to have to register I guess
 
00:45:09.510 --> 00:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
well that's that's The $64,000 Question
 
00:45:11.750 --> 00:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
that science has yet to come to a
 
00:45:13.990 --> 00:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
conclusion because it the body
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
metabolizes THC differently in your
 
00:45:20.430 --> 00:45:20.440 align:start position:0%
fatty tissue uh based on your body
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
composition uh the states that have said
 
00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
I want to get into that yeah
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
right I I I think that uh we can take
 
00:45:30.109 --> 00:45:30.119 align:start position:0%
traditional notice of your of your
 
00:45:33.390 --> 00:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
physique so I I have no idea what that
 
00:45:35.510 --> 00:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
limit would be for you or anyone else in
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
the room but again we work off of what
 
00:45:40.950 --> 00:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
other states have done uh here in the
 
00:45:42.270 --> 00:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I can tell you
 
00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
with two fatals in my community
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
back-to-back fatals two separate fatals
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
with significant quantities uh Delta
 
00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:52.960 align:start position:0%
nthc in their bloodstream we could not
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
get a conviction neither the County
 
00:45:56.829 --> 00:45:56.839 align:start position:0%
Attorney nor the Attorney General's
 
00:46:00.549 --> 00:46:00.559 align:start position:0%
office so we desperately need desper
 
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:02.680 align:start position:0%
someone let's say our our friends at the
 
00:46:05.589 --> 00:46:05.599 align:start position:0%
AG's office want issue an advisory on
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
this how could we advise someone to
 
00:46:10.230 --> 00:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
comply with the law if we have no idea
 
00:46:12.030 --> 00:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
like someone might be violating even
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
knowing they violing the smoking in
 
00:46:16.790 --> 00:46:16.800 align:start position:0%
public that person definitely knows what
 
00:46:18.750 --> 00:46:18.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing and just doesn't care this
 
00:46:22.150 --> 00:46:22.160 align:start position:0%
one you could perceivably be over the
 
00:46:24.990 --> 00:46:25.000 align:start position:0%
two the five the seven whatever it is
 
00:46:27.910 --> 00:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sure how much a person's
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
using to get to that five and seven it's
 
00:46:32.950 --> 00:46:32.960 align:start position:0%
very on body and all
 
00:46:36.349 --> 00:46:36.359 align:start position:0%
thatly it's a same no I'm not I'm not
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
qualified to be able to make that
 
00:46:38.950 --> 00:46:38.960 align:start position:0%
statement is
 
00:46:42.190 --> 00:46:42.200 align:start position:0%
anyone but at but at the end of the day
 
00:46:43.670 --> 00:46:43.680 align:start position:0%
no one is because the science and
 
00:46:46.390 --> 00:46:46.400 align:start position:0%
research is not well established in this
 
00:46:48.870 --> 00:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
regard recognize that the states that
 
00:46:51.589 --> 00:46:51.599 align:start position:0%
have set those limits have done so
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
knowingly to induce their population not
 
00:46:57.069 --> 00:46:57.079 align:start position:0%
to drive while
 
00:46:59.750 --> 00:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
using and again it's primeasia it's not
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.109 --> 00:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
0.08 um if helpful and I think this this
 
00:47:07.870 --> 00:47:07.880 align:start position:0%
is coming from the Michigan impaired
 
00:47:10.109 --> 00:47:10.119 align:start position:0%
driver safety commission um and they
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
actually are recommending now against
 
00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720 align:start position:0%
the threshold of um of a Delta 9 THD
 
00:47:16.829 --> 00:47:16.839 align:start position:0%
bodily content and instead recommend the
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
use of roadside sobriety tests to
 
00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
determine whether someone's impared or
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
not and so and I know we have Revenue in
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
here in the current version to ensure
 
00:47:27.230 --> 00:47:27.240 align:start position:0%
that we have the ability to kind of get
 
00:47:29.990 --> 00:47:30.000 align:start position:0%
officers and others tested up on
 
00:47:32.710 --> 00:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
roadside impairment for marijuana that
 
00:47:34.790 --> 00:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
roadside soety test you just referenced
 
00:47:36.910 --> 00:47:36.920 align:start position:0%
in Michigan is that being accepted by
 
00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
the courts in Michigan because one thing
 
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:41.480 align:start position:0%
it sounds great to send law enforcement
 
00:47:43.829 --> 00:47:43.839 align:start position:0%
to get trained on a field sobriety test
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
but it needs to be accepted by the court
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
as to our evidence if it's not going to
 
00:47:49.750 --> 00:47:49.760 align:start position:0%
be accepted by the court it's a waste of
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
time and resources in mind and that's
 
00:47:52.950 --> 00:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
what happened in
 
00:47:56.630 --> 00:47:56.640 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so do Dr
 
00:47:58.990 --> 00:47:59.000 align:start position:0%
I I would be happy to look at the
 
00:48:00.870 --> 00:48:00.880 align:start position:0%
medical literature because I I I hear
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying about how can it be
 
00:48:04.750 --> 00:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
like how can we not violate the law if
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
it's legal and we don't know how much
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
that is um but how long does the average
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
person need to have not consumed can
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis in order to be adherent to this
 
00:48:17.750 --> 00:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
law I mean I I'm happy to look to see
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
what what that looks like in the medical
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
literature if you don't mind doing that
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
because I think the it's one thing to
 
00:48:25.790 --> 00:48:25.800 align:start position:0%
have number there it's nothing we don't
 
00:48:27.109 --> 00:48:27.119 align:start position:0%
people violating law without even
 
00:48:28.950 --> 00:48:28.960 align:start position:0%
realizing they're doing it right in from
 
00:48:31.069 --> 00:48:31.079 align:start position:0%
a public safety perspective you know we
 
00:48:32.430 --> 00:48:32.440 align:start position:0%
have you know it's easy with alcohol but
 
00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
at least we know people know what the
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
legal limit is but I think getting some
 
00:48:38.230 --> 00:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
information from the dark might help us
 
00:48:40.270 --> 00:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
pin down a number whether it's two five
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
seven whatever well in in the two cases
 
00:48:45.549 --> 00:48:45.559 align:start position:0%
in the two fatalities single car crashes
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
right the evidence was in one case the
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
operator of the vehicle was tested as a
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
result of the Fatal and had 54 nanograms
 
00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
for mill
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
of can of THC in in their blood at the
 
00:49:02.109 --> 00:49:02.119 align:start position:0%
time of the crash the second operator
 
00:49:04.870 --> 00:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
had 34 nanograms fromer in their blood
 
00:49:06.870 --> 00:49:06.880 align:start position:0%
at the time of the crash and in neither
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
case neither case could neither the
 
00:49:11.870 --> 00:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office who adopted
 
00:49:14.990 --> 00:49:15.000 align:start position:0%
one case nor could the county attorney
 
00:49:16.950 --> 00:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
in the other case obtain a conviction
 
00:49:18.950 --> 00:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
for impairment no I understand that I'm
 
00:49:21.109 --> 00:49:21.119 align:start position:0%
just trying to when we make a
 
00:49:23.230 --> 00:49:23.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation we got to pick a me a
 
00:49:24.910 --> 00:49:24.920 align:start position:0%
measurement and I'm we're just trying to
 
00:49:26.990 --> 00:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
lock down what it takes to get to that
 
00:49:28.990 --> 00:49:29.000 align:start position:0%
measure we can do that right now with
 
00:49:30.910 --> 00:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
certainty alol I understand we we're not
 
00:49:32.349 --> 00:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
going to have an exact amount the
 
00:49:35.069 --> 00:49:35.079 align:start position:0%
ballparking in but at least having some
 
00:49:37.150 --> 00:49:37.160 align:start position:0%
idea what the law is going to be so
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
people aren't violing left and right by
 
00:49:41.549 --> 00:49:41.559 align:start position:0%
accident I I I take what you what you
 
00:49:44.349 --> 00:49:44.359 align:start position:0%
saying very serious because 54
 
00:49:46.510 --> 00:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
sounds you know through the roof here I
 
00:49:48.990 --> 00:49:49.000 align:start position:0%
get it so why don't we wait for Dr Young
 
00:49:50.789 --> 00:49:50.799 align:start position:0%
to get us some information on that I can
 
00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:53.960 align:start position:0%
I use shorts so again I I wanted to be
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
clear we're not talking about DUI in a
 
00:49:58.150 --> 00:49:58.160 align:start position:0%
section right this is strictly anybody
 
00:49:59.870 --> 00:49:59.880 align:start position:0%
who smokes a joint in a car is going to
 
00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:01.240 align:start position:0%
be convicted all you have to do is prove
 
00:50:02.990 --> 00:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
that it's marijuana and you saw him
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
smoking it and that's the conviction
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
this isn't about levels we don't have a
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
265 uh a statute yet in I don't know if
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
it's later on in this bill but that's
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
not what we're discussing right here so
 
00:50:14.589 --> 00:50:14.599 align:start position:0%
you don't need to prove that it's even
 
00:50:15.950 --> 00:50:15.960 align:start position:0%
in their system you need to prove that I
 
00:50:18.309 --> 00:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
saw him smoking this I tested this and
 
00:50:20.270 --> 00:50:20.280 align:start position:0%
this is marijuana you're convicted of
 
00:50:23.549 --> 00:50:23.559 align:start position:0%
the section um I think we I think we
 
00:50:26.470 --> 00:50:26.480 align:start position:0%
should take a look at somewhere the bill
 
00:50:29.430 --> 00:50:29.440 align:start position:0%
where we look at 265a which is the DUI
 
00:50:31.470 --> 00:50:31.480 align:start position:0%
statutes and whether we set a prim
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
acious standard under the 265 statutes
 
00:50:37.230 --> 00:50:37.240 align:start position:0%
like we have uh 0.08 and 01 that's what
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
we're gonna we're going to do so I think
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
but but I'm just I just want to move the
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
conversation along so we're not talking
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
about that right here right now we're
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
just strictly talking about smoking in a
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
car um that's moving and and whether or
 
00:50:50.349 --> 00:50:50.359 align:start position:0%
not that's leg paragraph three I I would
 
00:50:52.230 --> 00:50:52.240 align:start position:0%
prefer that to be a misdemeanor because
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
it's basically you're using it while
 
00:50:57.390 --> 00:50:57.400 align:start position:0%
operating vehicle all right you can
 
00:51:00.109 --> 00:51:00.119 align:start position:0%
strike the fine section lost lights up
 
00:51:01.710 --> 00:51:01.720 align:start position:0%
to 68 for the first offense one year for
 
00:51:03.630 --> 00:51:03.640 align:start position:0%
the second any I'm fine with that any
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
objection to
 
00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:07.240 align:start position:0%
that that I mean literally that's when
 
00:51:08.990 --> 00:51:09.000 align:start position:0%
you're using it while driving like just
 
00:51:12.910 --> 00:51:12.920 align:start position:0%
smoking and driving as we so um all
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
right just one to Mo
 
00:51:17.670 --> 00:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
that you like we and we'll come we'll
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
come back to that I think at the next
 
00:51:20.630 --> 00:51:20.640 align:start position:0%
meeting I think get good Dr does any
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
information you get if if it even exist
 
00:51:24.190 --> 00:51:24.200 align:start position:0%
and anyone listening if you have any
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
information on that so please help us
 
00:51:28.230 --> 00:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
out next meting you're striking not to
 
00:51:30.270 --> 00:51:30.280 align:start position:0%
exceed $150 and replacing that with Mr
 
00:51:32.470 --> 00:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
meter it yeah you don't need to have the
 
00:51:33.990 --> 00:51:34.000 align:start position:0%
fine section because that's already in
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
other other round yeah because because
 
00:51:36.950 --> 00:51:36.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want we don't want a limitation
 
00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:38.839 align:start position:0%
on fine we we want to hold these people
 
00:51:40.470 --> 00:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
accountable for putting every citizen in
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
the state at risk the M demeanor there's
 
00:51:43.990 --> 00:51:44.000 align:start position:0%
already a statutory finding in general
 
00:51:46.510 --> 00:51:46.520 align:start position:0%
so we don't have to add to it
 
00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:49.280 align:start position:0%
um otherwise we all that section we all
 
00:51:49.280 --> 00:51:50.750 align:start position:0%
um otherwise we all that section we all
go

00:51:50.750 --> 00:51:50.760 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:51:54.270 --> 00:51:54.280 align:start position:0%
with okay so on then now same SE uh same
 
00:51:58.030 --> 00:51:58.040 align:start position:0%
page 26 to 38 if you look at ran num 1
 
00:52:01.069 --> 00:52:01.079 align:start position:0%
29 to 33 that has to do with that's
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
basically cut and pasting precedence I
 
00:52:05.190 --> 00:52:05.200 align:start position:0%
don't think we need to do that in
 
00:52:08.390 --> 00:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
statute so we can strike that if if the
 
00:52:10.829 --> 00:52:10.839 align:start position:0%
scent of alcohol is not in of itself
 
00:52:12.470 --> 00:52:12.480 align:start position:0%
probably CA the search same thing with
 
00:52:14.510 --> 00:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
the Canabis it's legal same thing if
 
00:52:16.549 --> 00:52:16.559 align:start position:0%
it's been if it's been decriminalized
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
you can't there's no criminal offense to
 
00:52:22.470 --> 00:52:22.480 align:start position:0%
search so that language is is repetitive
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
I'm always hesitant to cut and paste a
 
00:52:25.990 --> 00:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
supreme court holding
 
00:52:29.230 --> 00:52:29.240 align:start position:0%
and putting it into an RSA because every
 
00:52:30.870 --> 00:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
word matters and that's how things get a
 
00:52:33.630 --> 00:52:33.640 align:start position:0%
little mixed up so I I would say we can
 
00:52:35.670 --> 00:52:35.680 align:start position:0%
strike that and rely on the existing
 
00:52:38.109 --> 00:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
presence does the AG's office have any
 
00:52:39.390 --> 00:52:39.400 align:start position:0%
comment on
 
00:52:41.910 --> 00:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
that no additional comment on
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
that so we striking it I think that
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
whole section can just come out I
 
00:52:52.589 --> 00:52:52.599 align:start position:0%
agree so lines 27 to 38 oh it doesn't
 
00:52:55.990 --> 00:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
change the exist the law either way CH
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
yes so I I'm sorry we need to go back to
 
00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:58.710 align:start position:0%
yes so I I'm sorry we need to go back to
line

00:52:58.710 --> 00:52:58.720 align:start position:0%
line
 
00:53:02.710 --> 00:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
23 um and this I think this was meant to
 
00:53:05.309 --> 00:53:05.319 align:start position:0%
say that you can't be charged with both
 
00:53:08.390 --> 00:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
smoking in the car as well as DUI except
 
00:53:11.870 --> 00:53:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's referencing the wrong statute um
 
00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:14.280 align:start position:0%
265 A1 is
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
definitions I don't think you're
 
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
violating a definition statute I think
 
00:53:21.470 --> 00:53:21.480 align:start position:0%
you we have 265 A2 or three which is DUI
 
00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
or aggravated DWI that that that's
 
00:53:25.430 --> 00:53:25.440 align:start position:0%
correct Senator that that should
 
00:53:27.950 --> 00:53:27.960 align:start position:0%
probably go if you're
 
00:53:30.190 --> 00:53:30.200 align:start position:0%
changing I agree we should be we should
 
00:53:31.349 --> 00:53:31.359 align:start position:0%
be getting rid of that we should be
 
00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:32.720 align:start position:0%
holding these people accountable for
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
putting everything section five all
 
00:53:37.109 --> 00:53:37.119 align:start position:0%
together so Roman numero 5 is is
 
00:53:51.150 --> 00:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
Senator invading your your
 
00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.829 align:start position:0%
Senator invading your your
desk

00:53:57.829 --> 00:53:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
so when it comes to
 
00:54:01.829 --> 00:54:01.839 align:start position:0%
um we're now on the enforcement
 
00:54:13.670 --> 00:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:16.990 --> 00:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
s if you're on Roman numer one Senator
 
00:54:20.630 --> 00:54:20.640 align:start position:0%
um I would propose that uh at line 40 it
 
00:54:22.990 --> 00:54:23.000 align:start position:0%
would be the New Hampshire Liquor
 
00:54:24.789 --> 00:54:24.799 align:start position:0%
Commission they'll have the primary
 
00:54:30.549 --> 00:54:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
clear technically we defined Commission
 
00:54:36.069 --> 00:54:36.079 align:start position:0%
in in the definition section right so
 
00:54:37.789 --> 00:54:37.799 align:start position:0%
when we're referencing commission it
 
00:54:39.630 --> 00:54:39.640 align:start position:0%
specifically references New Hampshire
 
00:54:39.640 --> 00:54:41.710 align:start position:0%
specifically references New Hampshire
Liquor

00:54:41.710 --> 00:54:41.720 align:start position:0%
Liquor
 
00:54:44.950 --> 00:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
Commission we do say that on page four
 
00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:47.040 align:start position:0%
line 34 commission shall mean the New
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor
 
00:54:48.119 --> 00:54:50.190 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor
Commission

00:54:50.190 --> 00:54:50.200 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:54:54.069 --> 00:54:54.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:54.079 --> 00:54:58.430 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
and I think in paragraph two I believe
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
we heard some testimony that there was
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
likely to be a distinction between
 
00:55:07.150 --> 00:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis
 
00:55:10.950 --> 00:55:10.960 align:start position:0%
investigators where it shows Liquor on
 
00:55:14.430 --> 00:55:14.440 align:start position:0%
uh Roman numeral 2 line two perhaps
 
00:55:16.190 --> 00:55:16.200 align:start position:0%
consideration change at the Cannabis
 
00:55:17.829 --> 00:55:17.839 align:start position:0%
investigators that's what the commission
 
00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
intends to do separate the two can I ask
 
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
uh is there what's the I suppose
 
00:55:26.309 --> 00:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
rational are having separate
 
00:55:29.069 --> 00:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
investigators for cannabis versus liquor
 
00:55:31.589 --> 00:55:31.599 align:start position:0%
I understand you know internally one may
 
00:55:33.870 --> 00:55:33.880 align:start position:0%
someone can kind of specialize more in
 
00:55:36.950 --> 00:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
One Direction or the other but I guess
 
00:55:42.069 --> 00:55:42.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.029 --> 00:55:44.039 align:start position:0%
there I mean does it make sense for us
 
00:55:45.390 --> 00:55:45.400 align:start position:0%
to legislate the
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
distinction is or is that necessary for
 
00:55:50.029 --> 00:55:50.039 align:start position:0%
us I I wouldn't think so I I don't think
 
00:55:52.150 --> 00:55:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have to legislate the distinction I
 
00:55:54.390 --> 00:55:54.400 align:start position:0%
understand internally they may choose to
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
operate that way but maybe an
 
00:55:59.630 --> 00:55:59.640 align:start position:0%
investigator is an investigator and they
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
can well if they're all liquor
 
00:56:03.470 --> 00:56:03.480 align:start position:0%
investigators and they also investigate
 
00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:07.160 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's fine um but I think that
 
00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh you don't want to create a defense uh
 
00:56:14.470 --> 00:56:14.480 align:start position:0%
for someone who's investigated by a um a
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
a liquor uh person yet and yet they make
 
00:56:20.390 --> 00:56:20.400 align:start position:0%
the distinction later on well I think
 
00:56:22.390 --> 00:56:22.400 align:start position:0%
the what I'm saying is essentially any
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
liquor investigator would also be a
 
00:56:26.750 --> 00:56:26.760 align:start position:0%
cannabis investig now internally they
 
00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
may have some if that's what they want
 
00:56:30.190 --> 00:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
to do then then the language is fine
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
some investigators may have a directive
 
00:56:33.950 --> 00:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
that they're they're focus on this yeah
 
00:56:35.910 --> 00:56:35.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to that but that's an
 
00:56:38.950 --> 00:56:38.960 align:start position:0%
internal operation am I let's just
 
00:56:41.069 --> 00:56:41.079 align:start position:0%
strike the word liquor just is
 
00:56:47.670 --> 00:56:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:50.549 --> 00:56:50.559 align:start position:0%
out yeah shello investigators and leave
 
00:56:50.559 --> 00:56:52.069 align:start position:0%
out yeah shello investigators and leave
it

00:56:52.069 --> 00:56:52.079 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
open yes all right so but it doesn't
 
00:56:57.750 --> 00:56:57.760 align:start position:0%
have to say liquor
 
00:56:59.349 --> 00:56:59.359 align:start position:0%
investigators because that's what
 
00:57:01.750 --> 00:57:01.760 align:start position:0%
they're called say investigator but if
 
00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.549 align:start position:0%
they're called say investigator but if
it's

00:57:02.549 --> 00:57:02.559 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
investigators aren't they called liquor
 
00:57:08.470 --> 00:57:08.480 align:start position:0%
investigators throughout other rsas so
 
00:57:10.950 --> 00:57:10.960 align:start position:0%
so we have to keep that consistency I'm
 
00:57:12.109 --> 00:57:12.119 align:start position:0%
saying if you look at other sections
 
00:57:13.510 --> 00:57:13.520 align:start position:0%
it's going to say liquor investigators
 
00:57:15.910 --> 00:57:15.920 align:start position:0%
we got to keep the same
 
00:57:17.789 --> 00:57:17.799 align:start position:0%
language even though they're doing more
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
than that the title is the title but
 
00:57:22.630 --> 00:57:22.640 align:start position:0%
it's not this we're not it's going to be
 
00:57:23.910 --> 00:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
called The Liquor Commission still even
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
though they also
 
00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
it's also going to involve cannabis
 
00:57:34.349 --> 00:57:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.359 --> 00:57:41.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:57:41.190 --> 00:57:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.390 --> 00:57:43.400 align:start position:0%
P we
 
00:57:45.630 --> 00:57:45.640 align:start position:0%
did the other comment the Chiefs would
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
make uh this would be uh Roman numeral
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
two I think one two three four four
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
lines down in that paragraph where where
 
00:57:57.230 --> 00:57:57.240 align:start position:0%
it says with or independently of
 
00:58:00.470 --> 00:58:00.480 align:start position:0%
officers with count counties or towns uh
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
we would just ask that or independently
 
00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
of be stricken uh it should be a
 
00:58:06.510 --> 00:58:06.520 align:start position:0%
Cooperative effort or at least
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
notification there with the
 
00:58:12.670 --> 00:58:12.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities the counties and or and
 
00:58:14.230 --> 00:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
and even in those areas where the state
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
police or the primary Authority should
 
00:58:19.150 --> 00:58:19.160 align:start position:0%
should be properly coordinated is there
 
00:58:21.710 --> 00:58:21.720 align:start position:0%
similar language right now for for
 
00:58:23.789 --> 00:58:23.799 align:start position:0%
liquor like if it's if it's a liquor
 
00:58:25.670 --> 00:58:25.680 align:start position:0%
Enforcement issue I I don't know what
 
00:58:29.190 --> 00:58:29.200 align:start position:0%
that language is Senator I because I I I
 
00:58:31.109 --> 00:58:31.119 align:start position:0%
want to say that this
 
00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:33.720 align:start position:0%
is so I I I I appreciate what you're
 
00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:37.319 align:start position:0%
saying I'm I'm just saying that
 
00:58:40.230 --> 00:58:40.240 align:start position:0%
consistently for if it's just when it
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
this language when it's used somewhere
 
00:58:45.150 --> 00:58:45.160 align:start position:0%
else for liquor it's it says or
 
00:58:47.789 --> 00:58:47.799 align:start position:0%
independently so again you would have an
 
00:58:50.630 --> 00:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
inconsistency there and I don't know if
 
00:58:53.069 --> 00:58:53.079 align:start position:0%
we want to I'm not I'm not saying I'm
 
00:58:54.990 --> 00:58:55.000 align:start position:0%
against what changing that in future
 
00:58:57.549 --> 00:58:57.559 align:start position:0%
point in time but if we change it here
 
00:59:00.390 --> 00:59:00.400 align:start position:0%
we have to change it alcohol too yeah Mr
 
00:59:02.230 --> 00:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
chairman the chief is here could we ask
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
him to just come forward and I'm sure we
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
can straighten straighten this out for
 
00:59:09.230 --> 00:59:09.240 align:start position:0%
well I I I already know it's what it
 
00:59:11.029 --> 00:59:11.039 align:start position:0%
says in the other section because okay
 
00:59:13.470 --> 00:59:13.480 align:start position:0%
so I'm just saying like know and you
 
00:59:15.870 --> 00:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
know no no offense
 
00:59:18.710 --> 00:59:18.720 align:start position:0%
Chief I'm just saying you know
 
00:59:21.870 --> 00:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
we we got to use the same language Y
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
which direction do we want to go so Mr
 
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.039 align:start position:0%
chair again the interesting part is we
 
00:59:27.670 --> 00:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
have that one line it actually says his
 
00:59:29.349 --> 00:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
primary function so it just means that
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
liquor is going to take a liquor
 
00:59:32.829 --> 00:59:32.839 align:start position:0%
investigator and say hey your primary
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
function is cannabis but that doesn't
 
00:59:36.910 --> 00:59:36.920 align:start position:0%
mean it's your only function right you
 
00:59:38.829 --> 00:59:38.839 align:start position:0%
may also be enforcing liquor laws as
 
00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
well and and any of the other laws
 
00:59:42.710 --> 00:59:42.720 align:start position:0%
allowed for by the commission so I don't
 
00:59:44.029 --> 00:59:44.039 align:start position:0%
know that we need to change the section
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
at all I think it allows the flexibility
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
necessary it says that they will have
 
00:59:50.190 --> 00:59:50.200 align:start position:0%
somebody who at least will have the
 
00:59:52.390 --> 00:59:52.400 align:start position:0%
primary responsibility of enforcement
 
00:59:53.630 --> 00:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
but it's not going to be their sole
 
00:59:56.430 --> 00:59:56.440 align:start position:0%
enforcement so I I think the section is
 
00:59:57.950 --> 00:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
fine just the way it is and those
 
01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:00.359 align:start position:0%
positions are defined in statute as well
 
01:00:03.549 --> 01:00:03.559 align:start position:0%
so I don't I I it'd be a little remiss
 
01:00:07.390 --> 01:00:07.400 align:start position:0%
to to adjust or mess with the names of
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:15.670 --> 01:00:15.680 align:start position:0%
investigators any other issues on
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
anything on on page eight and again as
 
01:00:21.029 --> 01:00:21.039 align:start position:0%
as in law enforcement me just because
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
you have a primary job function as means
 
01:00:24.870 --> 01:00:24.880 align:start position:0%
your only job function I'm sure I
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
officers in State Police Who weigh
 
01:00:28.870 --> 01:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
trucks also pull over Speeders right
 
01:00:30.349 --> 01:00:30.359 align:start position:0%
that are going down the highway as well
 
01:00:31.789 --> 01:00:31.799 align:start position:0%
so there's an additional function that's
 
01:00:33.510 --> 01:00:33.520 align:start position:0%
allowed so that's all this is allowing
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
for is that we'll have cannabis
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:41.670 --> 01:00:41.680 align:start position:0%
investigators any other issues on this
 
01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:44.720 align:start position:0%
page are we are you including um room
 
01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:48.160 align:start position:0%
numeral three on this page
 
01:00:50.230 --> 01:00:50.240 align:start position:0%
Senator where it says the inter the
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
authority to interpret statutes are you
 
01:00:55.390 --> 01:00:55.400 align:start position:0%
including that as part of the page
 
01:01:00.029 --> 01:01:00.039 align:start position:0%
if you are uh the uh the recommendation
 
01:01:01.950 --> 01:01:01.960 align:start position:0%
here would be and this perhaps is the
 
01:01:05.029 --> 01:01:05.039 align:start position:0%
appropriate time is to bring up whether
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
or not uh in the recommendation that we
 
01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:10.480 align:start position:0%
have is to establish a New Hampshire
 
01:01:13.430 --> 01:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis Control Commission much uh in
 
01:01:15.309 --> 01:01:15.319 align:start position:0%
line with the testimony you heard from
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
ly silver uh at last meeting where the
 
01:01:22.630 --> 01:01:22.640 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Control Commission would uh sit
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
as an authority in have the authority to
 
01:01:27.390 --> 01:01:27.400 align:start position:0%
interpret the statutes and the rules and
 
01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:29.440 align:start position:0%
administrative Rules promulgated by The
 
01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:30.870 align:start position:0%
administrative Rules promulgated by The
Liquor

01:01:30.870 --> 01:01:30.880 align:start position:0%
Liquor
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
Commission so there'll be a commission
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
within the commission no there would be
 
01:01:38.150 --> 01:01:38.160 align:start position:0%
a a commission that uh that is
 
01:01:40.150 --> 01:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
established consistent with many of the
 
01:01:42.470 --> 01:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
other states that have legalized that is
 
01:01:45.390 --> 01:01:45.400 align:start position:0%
a Control Commission that uh sits and
 
01:01:49.029 --> 01:01:49.039 align:start position:0%
reviews and uh approves doesn't has
 
01:01:51.430 --> 01:01:51.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't make the rules but approves the
 
01:01:54.430 --> 01:01:54.440 align:start position:0%
rule the regulatory authority of the
 
01:01:56.829 --> 01:01:56.839 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission that makes the rules
 
01:02:00.630 --> 01:02:00.640 align:start position:0%
so that there is a separate layer of
 
01:02:03.870 --> 01:02:03.880 align:start position:0%
review by this independent
 
01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:06.920 align:start position:0%
commission so Mr two things 541a is big
 
01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:09.670 align:start position:0%
commission so Mr two things 541a is big
issue

01:02:09.670 --> 01:02:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
so well I I just I think I think that's
 
01:02:16.430 --> 01:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
an extra layer layer of government that
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
we we want to be cautious about I think
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission does it already I
 
01:02:23.230 --> 01:02:23.240 align:start position:0%
I I just don't know if we need that
 
01:02:25.670 --> 01:02:25.680 align:start position:0%
extra layer of government here when
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
that's what they're sort of set up to do
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
I don't know if people thought about
 
01:02:28.319 --> 01:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
I don't know if people thought about
that

01:02:29.190 --> 01:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
agreed it is an extra layer government
 
01:02:33.029 --> 01:02:33.039 align:start position:0%
and certainly we're not in favor of an
 
01:02:34.630 --> 01:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
extra layer of government when there
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
when there isn't a necessity but in this
 
01:02:38.870 --> 01:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
case we argue that there is a necessity
 
01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:41.720 align:start position:0%
in that Li commission not compris the
 
01:02:44.750 --> 01:02:44.760 align:start position:0%
public health authorities um and other
 
01:02:47.150 --> 01:02:47.160 align:start position:0%
uh folks that are independently minded
 
01:02:49.430 --> 01:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
to look at and review and to keep the
 
01:02:51.589 --> 01:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
state's best interests in mind from an
 
01:02:53.789 --> 01:02:53.799 align:start position:0%
independent perspective of course the
 
01:02:55.549 --> 01:02:55.559 align:start position:0%
governor and the executive Council would
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
establish who would sit on that
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
commission uh but that commission would
 
01:03:03.950 --> 01:03:03.960 align:start position:0%
simply be in review of the rules and
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
regulations promulgated uh by that
 
01:03:11.150 --> 01:03:11.160 align:start position:0%
commission maybe maybe a compromise just
 
01:03:14.029 --> 01:03:14.039 align:start position:0%
not I agree with this but maybe a study
 
01:03:16.150 --> 01:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
commission or legislative one just to
 
01:03:18.309 --> 01:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
have something in the early stages of
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:25.720 align:start position:0%
that uh Mr chairman we we don't feel
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
that that would be a necessary U
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic step in this uh The Liquor
 
01:03:34.670 --> 01:03:34.680 align:start position:0%
Commission is has run for 95 years as of
 
01:03:37.109 --> 01:03:37.119 align:start position:0%
this year and we we're apprised of any
 
01:03:40.069 --> 01:03:40.079 align:start position:0%
laws and statutes and and rules that we
 
01:03:42.710 --> 01:03:42.720 align:start position:0%
have to run under and uh to run a
 
01:03:45.750 --> 01:03:45.760 align:start position:0%
business uh by committee is not a way to
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
run a
 
01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.630 align:start position:0%
run a
business

01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
thank take over so so the other thing I
 
01:03:53.670 --> 01:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
just C Chief is we have an entire set of
 
01:03:56.789 --> 01:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
administrative rule law 541a in our in
 
01:03:59.269 --> 01:03:59.279 align:start position:0%
our state that requires public hearings
 
01:04:02.789 --> 01:04:02.799 align:start position:0%
and requires notice and requires input
 
01:04:04.549 --> 01:04:04.559 align:start position:0%
um and then on top of that it's the next
 
01:04:06.069 --> 01:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
step is it serves it has to go to a
 
01:04:08.029 --> 01:04:08.039 align:start position:0%
state legislative board which I serve on
 
01:04:10.109 --> 01:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
J car The Joint legislative committee on
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
administrative rules which would then
 
01:04:14.349 --> 01:04:14.359 align:start position:0%
have to also approve those rules as well
 
01:04:15.750 --> 01:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
so I think there's a wellestablished
 
01:04:17.710 --> 01:04:17.720 align:start position:0%
process for allowing public input
 
01:04:19.069 --> 01:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
whether it's public health or anything
 
01:04:20.990 --> 01:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
else and then still a legislative
 
01:04:22.589 --> 01:04:22.599 align:start position:0%
oversight that make sure the rules being
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
implemented are consistent with the law
 
01:04:26.990 --> 01:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's been passed well in the other
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
states um and I I respectfully disagree
 
01:04:31.910 --> 01:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
with both the commission and and that
 
01:04:34.150 --> 01:04:34.160 align:start position:0%
the other States including Massachusetts
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
and others that have uh promulgated
 
01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
rules and regulations saw fit to
 
01:04:41.950 --> 01:04:41.960 align:start position:0%
establish an independent Authority that
 
01:04:44.549 --> 01:04:44.559 align:start position:0%
is not producing the rules but approves
 
01:04:46.589 --> 01:04:46.599 align:start position:0%
those rules and makes and has the
 
01:04:48.029 --> 01:04:48.039 align:start position:0%
authority to be able to say to the
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
legislation that we've looked and
 
01:04:51.309 --> 01:04:51.319 align:start position:0%
reviewed these from an independent
 
01:04:53.630 --> 01:04:53.640 align:start position:0%
Public Health Public Safety and other
 
01:04:56.069 --> 01:04:56.079 align:start position:0%
perspective so uh those other states
 
01:04:58.950 --> 01:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
have saw a fit and again you heard from
 
01:05:01.670 --> 01:05:01.680 align:start position:0%
um Miss silver last week uh that
 
01:05:04.269 --> 01:05:04.279 align:start position:0%
recommended that a commission uh be
 
01:05:07.109 --> 01:05:07.119 align:start position:0%
established uh I think that that's a
 
01:05:08.309 --> 01:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
recommendation that we make and of
 
01:05:09.630 --> 01:05:09.640 align:start position:0%
course the commission decides not to go
 
01:05:11.750 --> 01:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
forward with it that's fine but I think
 
01:05:13.349 --> 01:05:13.359 align:start position:0%
governor and executive Council would
 
01:05:14.789 --> 01:05:14.799 align:start position:0%
benefit from having an
 
01:05:17.190 --> 01:05:17.200 align:start position:0%
independent-minded review commission
 
01:05:19.069 --> 01:05:19.079 align:start position:0%
thank you represent H yeah I just want
 
01:05:21.430 --> 01:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
to comment is that um I
 
01:05:24.269 --> 01:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
know I read Boston newspapers and
 
01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
evidently the Massachusetts one is
 
01:05:28.990 --> 01:05:29.000 align:start position:0%
actually a problem so if nothing else
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
we've learned our lesson is not to
 
01:05:32.910 --> 01:05:32.920 align:start position:0%
create one of these another levels of
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
government because uh it becomes
 
01:05:37.750 --> 01:05:37.760 align:start position:0%
political and it becomes uh they they
 
01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
start fighting infighting over their
 
01:05:42.630 --> 01:05:42.640 align:start position:0%
Authority and we do not need it at the
 
01:05:44.470 --> 01:05:44.480 align:start position:0%
end of the day if there's a public
 
01:05:46.269 --> 01:05:46.279 align:start position:0%
health or is any issue that's a problem
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
with way our statute is written then you
 
01:05:50.750 --> 01:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
bring it to the legislature and we'll
 
01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:52.269 align:start position:0%
bring it to the legislature and we'll
fix

01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:52.279 align:start position:0%
fix
 
01:05:55.990 --> 01:05:56.000 align:start position:0%
it right any further comment so I I
 
01:05:58.150 --> 01:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
think as we stand now again remember
 
01:06:00.269 --> 01:06:00.279 align:start position:0%
that we're presenting a bill that'll be
 
01:06:02.430 --> 01:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
open the public hearing um I think we'll
 
01:06:04.950 --> 01:06:04.960 align:start position:0%
leave language now everyone's okay as it
 
01:06:06.990 --> 01:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
is and then if we want to have a
 
01:06:08.430 --> 01:06:08.440 align:start position:0%
commission that could be brought forward
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
as an amendment in the Bill hearing
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
process that consistent with everybody's
 
01:06:17.109 --> 01:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
thinking great so number so number two
 
01:06:19.630 --> 01:06:19.640 align:start position:0%
is okay as is number three is okay as is
 
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:22.240 align:start position:0%
number four anybody have comments on
 
01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:22.990 align:start position:0%

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:49.240 align:start position:0%
good actually hold on I had a comment on
 
01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:52.990 align:start position:0%
good actually hold on I had a comment on
my

01:06:52.990 --> 01:06:53.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:53.000 --> 01:07:00.109 align:start position:0%
 
page

01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.119 --> 01:07:01.029 align:start position:0%
 
number

01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
seven anybody
 
01:07:09.950 --> 01:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:13.269 --> 01:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
eight you done good all right moving on
 
01:07:15.670 --> 01:07:15.680 align:start position:0%
to the regulation of cannabis uh section
 
01:07:22.150 --> 01:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
318 F colon 7 um number one
 
01:07:24.630 --> 01:07:24.640 align:start position:0%
Frank uh just a question this might be
 
01:07:26.910 --> 01:07:26.920 align:start position:0%
actually more appropriate for liquor um
 
01:07:29.230 --> 01:07:29.240 align:start position:0%
because I know in Vermont the the
 
01:07:31.069 --> 01:07:31.079 align:start position:0%
timeline the 24 months was maybe a
 
01:07:32.630 --> 01:07:32.640 align:start position:0%
little bit too short and so I'm
 
01:07:34.470 --> 01:07:34.480 align:start position:0%
wondering if it'd be worth just asking
 
01:07:36.190 --> 01:07:36.200 align:start position:0%
liquor whether like what that number
 
01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:38.799 align:start position:0%
should be because that's like beyond my
 
01:07:40.750 --> 01:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
comprehension but I assume that that we
 
01:07:42.630 --> 01:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
want to get that number
 
01:07:45.789 --> 01:07:45.799 align:start position:0%
right I think in our original uh
 
01:07:48.230 --> 01:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
discussion and legislation we had
 
01:07:50.789 --> 01:07:50.799 align:start position:0%
originally put 36
 
01:07:54.349 --> 01:07:54.359 align:start position:0%
months so was houseal comp Commerce had
 
01:07:55.950 --> 01:07:55.960 align:start position:0%
moved it to
 
01:07:57.870 --> 01:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
24 was there a
 
01:07:57.880 --> 01:08:00.670 align:start position:0%
24 was there a
reason

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:00.680 align:start position:0%
reason
 
01:08:05.150 --> 01:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
um we don't want them to dilly
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
dally I I think Mr M knows what he's
 
01:08:11.230 --> 01:08:11.240 align:start position:0%
doing right so I'm sorry so Chief what
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
was your recommend recommended length of
 
01:08:16.110 --> 01:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
time originally uh Senator we had
 
01:08:19.430 --> 01:08:19.440 align:start position:0%
discussed the 36 months and and and the
 
01:08:21.430 --> 01:08:21.440 align:start position:0%
the main reason behind that is because
 
01:08:23.630 --> 01:08:23.640 align:start position:0%
of the investment of the people who are
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
going going to grow the product and
 
01:08:28.669 --> 01:08:28.679 align:start position:0%
manufacture and how long it would take
 
01:08:31.990 --> 01:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
them to get their facilities in place
 
01:08:35.470 --> 01:08:35.480 align:start position:0%
and prepare that first grow uh it's it's
 
01:08:37.669 --> 01:08:37.679 align:start position:0%
quite you it's an it's a six to eight
 
01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
million doll Endeavor so uh we we want
 
01:08:43.630 --> 01:08:43.640 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they have enough time
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
and obviously that they have that we
 
01:08:48.669 --> 01:08:48.679 align:start position:0%
have enough product to sell so and we do
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
it in 24 months we may be able to but
 
01:08:53.510 --> 01:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
we're we're really concerned if we get
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
to the the 24 months and we don't have
 
01:08:57.789 --> 01:08:57.799 align:start position:0%
enough product to sell we don't want to
 
01:09:00.349 --> 01:09:00.359 align:start position:0%
make the mistake of of opening a
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
business or licensing retail when we
 
01:09:04.870 --> 01:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
don't have enough product to
 
01:09:08.269 --> 01:09:08.279 align:start position:0%
sell so that was our that was our
 
01:09:09.550 --> 01:09:09.560 align:start position:0%
discussion behind it right our
 
01:09:11.470 --> 01:09:11.480 align:start position:0%
discussions around 36 months versus 24
 
01:09:12.990 --> 01:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
months cut the baby in
 
01:09:16.990 --> 01:09:17.000 align:start position:0%
half make it 30 is that good for your
 
01:09:19.070 --> 01:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
Chief chairman he's a chairman he's
 
01:09:22.709 --> 01:09:22.719 align:start position:0%
chairman sorry Chief's back he's gone
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
too and I'm assuming we'll move section
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:33.789 --> 01:09:33.799 align:start position:0%
months any further discuss on uh Roman
 
01:09:36.229 --> 01:09:36.239 align:start position:0%
numeral one and Roman numeral 2 and
 
01:09:37.470 --> 01:09:37.480 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral two goes to the other page
 
01:09:39.110 --> 01:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
and I actually do have a comment but
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
let's just look at uh Ro Roman numeral
 
01:09:44.070 --> 01:09:44.080 align:start position:0%
one's okay Roman numeral two A and B
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
those none moving on to the next page
 
01:09:54.669 --> 01:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
page 10 um Roman numerals or subro
 
01:09:57.310 --> 01:09:57.320 align:start position:0%
numerals 1 through
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
12 any comment about and that's relative
 
01:10:05.430 --> 01:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
to um operation of franchise Senator
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
just some cleanup language in uh Roman
 
01:10:11.390 --> 01:10:11.400 align:start position:0%
well in number two I think it's at least
 
01:10:14.550 --> 01:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
on my page five where it starts with the
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
handling um perhaps uh to make it more
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
precise It should read the handling
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
regulation manufacturer cultivation
 
01:10:25.229 --> 01:10:25.239 align:start position:0%
Packaging Transportation documentation
 
01:10:27.830 --> 01:10:27.840 align:start position:0%
and sale of cannabis that brings all
 
01:10:29.870 --> 01:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
those functions within the
 
01:10:29.880 --> 01:10:31.590 align:start position:0%
those functions within the
regulatory

01:10:31.590 --> 01:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
01:10:38.669 --> 01:10:38.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.950 --> 01:10:40.960 align:start position:0%
sale and then in three the only other
 
01:10:43.550 --> 01:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be storage and
 
01:10:46.390 --> 01:10:46.400 align:start position:0%
security for facility facilities for
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
cannabis cannabis product again bringing
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
that within the regulatory Authority so
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
Chief can I get you to submit the that
 
01:10:55.750 --> 01:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
in writings I not writing fast enough
 
01:10:57.189 --> 01:10:57.199 align:start position:0%
but doesn't that some of that go beyond
 
01:11:00.229 --> 01:11:00.239 align:start position:0%
what a a franchisee this is this is
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
specific not to the whole commission
 
01:11:04.390 --> 01:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
this is about what a franchise can
 
01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.110 align:start position:0%
this is about what a franchise can
do

01:11:06.110 --> 01:11:06.120 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:11:10.229 --> 01:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
so this this if you goes back to the the
 
01:11:14.750 --> 01:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
38- F 7 regulation says not later than x
 
01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:16.600 align:start position:0%
number of months 24 months I'm looking
 
01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
down at B at the bottom of that page but
 
01:11:20.950 --> 01:11:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is the governing statute part that
 
01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
provides for the regulation does it not
 
01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the bottom of that
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
page B I think the chief's right it is
 
01:11:30.910 --> 01:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
the governing statute the B then goes
 
01:11:33.950 --> 01:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
to the be is I thought was about about
 
01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
the franchisees so it is so if you read
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
roman number two so there a CO in there
 
01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:39.880 align:start position:0%
the rules shall include the following
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
and if you do the B procedures for the
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
selection and operation of a franchise
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail outlet included but not
 
01:11:47.629 --> 01:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
limited to so understand it's not an
 
01:11:50.229 --> 01:11:50.239 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list U it's not an absolute
 
01:11:51.830 --> 01:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
list it's a list that it's some
 
01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
recommendations that you at minimum have
 
01:11:55.430 --> 01:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
to cover these things and you may find
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
other things you want to cover as well
 
01:12:00.350 --> 01:12:00.360 align:start position:0%
um and then the one through 12 1 through
 
01:12:03.430 --> 01:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
17 are all the minimum things that they
 
01:12:06.110 --> 01:12:06.120 align:start position:0%
need to include but not again not an
 
01:12:08.669 --> 01:12:08.679 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list so jeeve are you looking
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
to add something else on this minimum
 
01:12:15.270 --> 01:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
list um relative to franchise operations
 
01:12:16.750 --> 01:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
yeah the procedures regarding the
 
01:12:18.950 --> 01:12:18.960 align:start position:0%
handling and then I would add regulation
 
01:12:21.669 --> 01:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
manufacture cultivation packaging
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
transportation and documentation
 
01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but they're not
 
01:12:27.629 --> 01:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
manufacturers right this this is about
 
01:12:28.790 --> 01:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
the franchise this is just the
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
franchisee this is just the the retail
 
01:12:34.629 --> 01:12:34.639 align:start position:0%
location well it's the procedures but I
 
01:12:35.870 --> 01:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'm reading it differently but
 
01:12:37.070 --> 01:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
it's the procedures that they're going
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
to have to be held responsible
 
01:12:43.110 --> 01:12:43.120 align:start position:0%
for so again this this talks about ran
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
numeral 2 talks about their their um Ru
 
01:12:48.510 --> 01:12:48.520 align:start position:0%
making process and in subsection B we're
 
01:12:50.830 --> 01:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
talking specifically the rule um rate
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
making process relev the franchise
 
01:12:56.149 --> 01:12:56.159 align:start position:0%
Cannabis stores outlets and again A 1
 
01:12:58.629 --> 01:12:58.639 align:start position:0%
through 17 is a non-exhaustive list of
 
01:13:00.790 --> 01:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
minimums basically we have to at least
 
01:13:02.270 --> 01:13:02.280 align:start position:0%
do these things and if the commission
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
finds other things it wants to do it can
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
add it because we we leave them that
 
01:13:09.950 --> 01:13:09.960 align:start position:0%
catchall of uh including but not limited
 
01:13:12.590 --> 01:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
to so I guess the question is what is
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
there anything other than 1 through 17
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
we want to add to this inclusive list or
 
01:13:18.629 --> 01:13:18.639 align:start position:0%
non-inclusive list at at least as a
 
01:13:22.350 --> 01:13:22.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.629 align:start position:0%
 
requirements

01:13:24.629 --> 01:13:24.639 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:13:26.790 --> 01:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
Chief if you want to submit that um
 
01:13:28.310 --> 01:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
language we can take a look at it and
 
01:13:29.950 --> 01:13:29.960 align:start position:0%
see if there's a way of incorporating it
 
01:13:31.390 --> 01:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
but otherwise we're going to assume
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
number 1 through 17 on page 10 is okay
 
01:13:36.550 --> 01:13:36.560 align:start position:0%
does testing need to be
 
01:13:38.870 --> 01:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
added again this is the operation of a
 
01:13:40.990 --> 01:13:41.000 align:start position:0%
franchise store testing happens at the
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and uh cultivation l i I
 
01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
missed the beginning okay so number c
 
01:13:49.950 --> 01:13:49.960 align:start position:0%
before before we get to see just one
 
01:13:52.669 --> 01:13:52.679 align:start position:0%
mind if you go to page eight you go to
 
01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.870 align:start position:0%
mind if you go to page eight you go to
um

01:13:54.870 --> 01:13:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:58.550 --> 01:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
11 I think we need to add just to
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
that add State
 
01:14:08.629 --> 01:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
police police officials towns Sheriff's
 
01:14:14.070 --> 01:14:14.080 align:start position:0%
the deputies I think just adding state
 
01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:14.910 align:start position:0%
the deputies I think just adding state
would

01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:14:20.350 --> 01:14:20.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure I heard what your
 
01:14:25.790 --> 01:14:25.800 align:start position:0%
suggestion was so on on page eight lines
 
01:14:28.950 --> 01:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
2 through 11 just at the end of that so
 
01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
line 11 which says
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
towns we just want to add or or the New
 
01:14:37.149 --> 01:14:37.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state or
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
state I think they just there was an
 
01:14:41.550 --> 01:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
Omission in the
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
draft with that none I didn't think
 
01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:46.920 align:start position:0%
there would
 
01:14:48.750 --> 01:14:48.760 align:start position:0%
be all
 
01:14:51.550 --> 01:14:51.560 align:start position:0%
right uh going on to section c training
 
01:14:54.070 --> 01:14:54.080 align:start position:0%
and continuing education requirements
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
any questions about
 
01:15:00.590 --> 01:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
that d uh procedures for selection of
 
01:15:02.870 --> 01:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities and Manufacturing
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
facilities again so D has a not limited
 
01:15:07.790 --> 01:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
two language which includes Roman
 
01:15:10.229 --> 01:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
numeral one and two on the second
 
01:15:13.149 --> 01:15:13.159 align:start position:0%
side any questions about one and two
 
01:15:17.229 --> 01:15:17.239 align:start position:0%
again these are minimums not not
 
01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
uh exhaustiveness
 
01:15:23.390 --> 01:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
e um procedures to hear complaints and
 
01:15:24.870 --> 01:15:24.880 align:start position:0%
imposed penalties of alternative
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
treatment centers licensed as a cannabis
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
retail store to provide an adequate
 
01:15:31.709 --> 01:15:31.719 align:start position:0%
Supply and variety of therapeutic um I
 
01:15:35.510 --> 01:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
here oh this is I had a note just
 
01:15:42.149 --> 01:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:44.950 --> 01:15:44.960 align:start position:0%
um that the language of cannabis retail
 
01:15:46.669 --> 01:15:46.679 align:start position:0%
stores we CH we were changing that
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
definition somewhere in the back so I
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
want to make sure it's that language is
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
consistent with whatever it is but there
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
should be a procedure basically that for
 
01:15:57.790 --> 01:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
any retail store there's a if there's a
 
01:16:02.229 --> 01:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
um violation um there's a process for
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
adjudication yeah and I think this the
 
01:16:06.629 --> 01:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
direction we made the
 
01:16:06.639 --> 01:16:08.310 align:start position:0%
direction we made the
Leaning

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:08.320 align:start position:0%
Leaning
 
01:16:11.470 --> 01:16:11.480 align:start position:0%
just language may be up somewhere off
 
01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:13.030 align:start position:0%
just language may be up somewhere off
sleeve

01:16:13.030 --> 01:16:13.040 align:start position:0%
sleeve
 
01:16:15.430 --> 01:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
right so I'm going to leave e to come
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
back because we want to talk about atc's
 
01:16:20.390 --> 01:16:20.400 align:start position:0%
versus retail stores and cleaning that
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
language up so we'll leave it as an open
 
01:16:24.669 --> 01:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
item and come back to that um maybe darl
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
you can write up appropriate
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
language it will be put together and we
 
01:16:31.709 --> 01:16:31.719 align:start position:0%
kind of talked about that and maybe
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
we'll close with that towards the end
 
01:16:34.550 --> 01:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
but we'll just keep going through the
 
01:16:37.229 --> 01:16:37.239 align:start position:0%
rest of the bill F uh a fee schedule for
 
01:16:39.550 --> 01:16:39.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable application licens in touch
 
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:40.840 align:start position:0%
again we're all talking about the rul
 
01:16:42.709 --> 01:16:42.719 align:start position:0%
making process what it needs to include
 
01:16:44.750 --> 01:16:44.760 align:start position:0%
so is anybody have any questions on F I
 
01:16:46.950 --> 01:16:46.960 align:start position:0%
think we got to add
 
01:16:50.390 --> 01:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
transfer this what I have in my notes Fe
 
01:16:52.470 --> 01:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
schedule for reasonal application licens
 
01:16:54.669 --> 01:16:54.679 align:start position:0%
an annual renewal fees provided that
 
01:16:56.669 --> 01:16:56.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation license fees
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
beered transfer from one uh entity to
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
another with the license say that again
 
01:17:04.950 --> 01:17:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.550 --> 01:17:08.560 align:start position:0%
to what was there suggested am I'm not
 
01:17:10.390 --> 01:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
sure why transfer fit this is just them
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
setting PS for what a license costs what
 
01:17:15.790 --> 01:17:15.800 align:start position:0%
a you know and and yeah but if you can
 
01:17:18.629 --> 01:17:18.639 align:start position:0%
transfer the license it's my point right
 
01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:21.080 align:start position:0%
oh you can sell your Fran as a
 
01:17:22.750 --> 01:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
franchisee you can sell I can imagine it
 
01:17:25.390 --> 01:17:25.400 align:start position:0%
be to approval but I'm Afra I can sell
 
01:17:27.830 --> 01:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
it so have a we add that as another item
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
when we get to the back here all the way
 
01:17:31.229 --> 01:17:31.239 align:start position:0%
at the end right under here because it's
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
a requirement I don't know that it falls
 
01:17:34.229 --> 01:17:34.239 align:start position:0%
under a fee schedule for transfer of
 
01:17:36.430 --> 01:17:36.440 align:start position:0%
license as just a general process of
 
01:17:37.990 --> 01:17:38.000 align:start position:0%
what happens if the owner wants to
 
01:17:42.110 --> 01:17:42.120 align:start position:0%
transfer a license right so we'll add
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
a We'll add a letter
 
01:17:51.790 --> 01:17:51.800 align:start position:0%
in add an O at the end of of section
 
01:17:54.790 --> 01:17:54.800 align:start position:0%
whatever we're at here section question
 
01:17:58.950 --> 01:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
uh question are we past uh uh G as in
 
01:18:02.590 --> 01:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
George the qualifications
 
01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:04.229 align:start position:0%
George the qualifications
yeah

01:18:04.229 --> 01:18:04.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
so I think for cannabis offenses well
 
01:18:09.550 --> 01:18:09.560 align:start position:0%
the problem that here is that that
 
01:18:12.070 --> 01:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
language is so broad that so for example
 
01:18:13.870 --> 01:18:13.880 align:start position:0%
if you had someone that was convicted
 
01:18:15.870 --> 01:18:15.880 align:start position:0%
multiple times of operating illegal
 
01:18:19.229 --> 01:18:19.239 align:start position:0%
grows even by State Statute right that
 
01:18:21.950 --> 01:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
that would not be um something that
 
01:18:25.070 --> 01:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
could be consider Ed and I think that
 
01:18:27.709 --> 01:18:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's overly broaden language so
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
again this if if I could just to say
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
what this says that they're required to
 
01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:36.199 align:start position:0%
create a rule that um talks about the
 
01:18:38.669 --> 01:18:38.679 align:start position:0%
qualifications for lure and it must
 
01:18:40.430 --> 01:18:40.440 align:start position:0%
include also who's disqualified
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
automatically from that lure as well
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's what this letter G says as I read
 
01:18:47.550 --> 01:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
it so I think Canabis offense it's one
 
01:18:50.510 --> 01:18:50.520 align:start position:0%
thing to have you know on your record
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
possession even possession with intent
 
01:18:53.910 --> 01:18:53.920 align:start position:0%
but if you are I guess
 
01:18:56.110 --> 01:18:56.120 align:start position:0%
cultivating on a you know 100 yard field
 
01:18:58.350 --> 01:18:58.360 align:start position:0%
here you're basically in in the
 
01:19:00.990 --> 01:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
trafficking business at that point and
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
that would be construed as a cannabis
 
01:19:05.790 --> 01:19:05.800 align:start position:0%
offense technically so I guess the we
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
want to there should be more specific
 
01:19:11.430 --> 01:19:11.440 align:start position:0%
language as to what uh you want to
 
01:19:14.070 --> 01:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
exclude here for disqualification and I
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
think the intent here is folks that may
 
01:19:18.590 --> 01:19:18.600 align:start position:0%
have violations for personal possessory
 
01:19:21.470 --> 01:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
amounts and things of that nature but uh
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
what this does is effective
 
01:19:28.510 --> 01:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
um allow someone who operates a 500 acre
 
01:19:31.629 --> 01:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
illegal grow under New Hampshire law so
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
I think to accomplish that we after
 
01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:34.310 align:start position:0%
I think to accomplish that we after
which

01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
says line 19 says operation of a canis
 
01:19:39.510 --> 01:19:39.520 align:start position:0%
establishment you put a period that then
 
01:19:42.430 --> 01:19:42.440 align:start position:0%
which say and to strike the rest of
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
it would that work we we definitely want
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
to take that disqualifying stuff out I
 
01:19:49.870 --> 01:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
mean you know if you if you've had an
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
established illegal grow you're saying
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
hey I'm not going to follow the rules
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
and we we want above board citizens with
 
01:20:00.470 --> 01:20:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:02.750 --> 01:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
rules I think I think from our
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
perspective I I I I'm okay with what the
 
01:20:07.030 --> 01:20:07.040 align:start position:0%
chief is talking about in terms of like
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
people who are engaged in grows I but I
 
01:20:09.950 --> 01:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
do think it would be important to have
 
01:20:11.510 --> 01:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
language in there to clarify that people
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
who have passed marijuana possession
 
01:20:15.390 --> 01:20:15.400 align:start position:0%
offense records particularly with the
 
01:20:16.629 --> 01:20:16.639 align:start position:0%
disparity and arrests we have in New
 
01:20:18.870 --> 01:20:18.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that we're not you know
 
01:20:20.990 --> 01:20:21.000 align:start position:0%
automatically cutting those folks off um
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
from the opportunity to engage in this
 
01:20:23.910 --> 01:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
so I think you know figuring out that
 
01:20:26.629 --> 01:20:26.639 align:start position:0%
middle ground there so maybe at the next
 
01:20:28.149 --> 01:20:28.159 align:start position:0%
have a middle ground because I I agree
 
01:20:29.629 --> 01:20:29.639 align:start position:0%
possession is totally different than
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
trafficking right so the traffic are
 
01:20:35.070 --> 01:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
much I I'm with you on that so what
 
01:20:36.430 --> 01:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
maybe come with some proposed language
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
we'll revisit so actually was I think Mr
 
01:20:41.110 --> 01:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
chair we can simply on G saying that the
 
01:20:43.149 --> 01:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
qualifications and disqualifications for
 
01:20:45.350 --> 01:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
lenser that are directly and
 
01:20:47.870 --> 01:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
demonstrably related to the operation of
 
01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
a Canabis establishment period done and
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
that requires them now to say what if
 
01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:53.920 align:start position:0%
you have these things on your record
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
you're automatically disqualified
 
01:20:57.629 --> 01:20:57.639 align:start position:0%
otherwise you're you you're that's good
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
answer right so I think we just add
 
01:21:01.550 --> 01:21:01.560 align:start position:0%
qualifications and disqualifications for
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
lure that are directly and demonstrably
 
01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
related to the operation of cannabis
 
01:21:08.510 --> 01:21:08.520 align:start position:0%
establishment period
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
and that works all
 
01:21:17.830 --> 01:21:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.629 align:start position:0%
 
anybody

01:21:21.629 --> 01:21:21.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:21.639 --> 01:21:24.590 align:start position:0%
 
I

01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay okay um is J has to do with the
 
01:21:31.390 --> 01:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
transportation did we is that where we
 
01:21:33.149 --> 01:21:33.159 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:21:35.189 --> 01:21:35.199 align:start position:0%
implement some of the warehouse
 
01:21:37.070 --> 01:21:37.080 align:start position:0%
distribution rules or is
 
01:21:39.750 --> 01:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
that well I think we need to add the
 
01:21:41.390 --> 01:21:41.400 align:start position:0%
language from the op from the
 
01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
distribution language that they'll
 
01:21:44.709 --> 01:21:44.719 align:start position:0%
establish the same qualifications right
 
01:21:47.870 --> 01:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
for requirements for transportation
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
warehousing and distribution is that
 
01:21:53.310 --> 01:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
what you want to add yes
 
01:21:57.830 --> 01:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
like the put all right so in J inj
 
01:21:59.870 --> 01:21:59.880 align:start position:0%
Transportation warehousing
 
01:22:01.590 --> 01:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
transportation and
 
01:22:04.430 --> 01:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
distribution and
 
01:22:06.270 --> 01:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
distribution and then at the end
 
01:22:08.510 --> 01:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
transported or
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
distributed well transported warehoused
 
01:22:14.189 --> 01:22:14.199 align:start position:0%
and distributed transported warehoused
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody okay with that change to
 
01:22:21.719 --> 01:22:26.030 align:start position:0%
yeah everybody okay with that change to
Jay

01:22:26.030 --> 01:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:27.750 --> 01:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
okay reasonable security requirements
 
01:22:29.750 --> 01:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
reach type of Canabis establishments
 
01:22:34.990 --> 01:22:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:37.390 --> 01:22:37.400 align:start position:0%
establishment um
 
01:22:41.229 --> 01:22:41.239 align:start position:0%
I L um restrictions on where cannabis
 
01:22:42.629 --> 01:22:42.639 align:start position:0%
may be located consistent with
 
01:22:44.470 --> 01:22:44.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions in this
 
01:22:46.629 --> 01:22:46.639 align:start position:0%
chapter again this is about them
 
01:22:46.639 --> 01:22:47.750 align:start position:0%
chapter again this is about them
developing

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:47.760 align:start position:0%
developing
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
regulations standards for the operation
 
01:22:51.270 --> 01:22:51.280 align:start position:0%
of Testing Laboratories including
 
01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.080 --> 01:23:01.030 align:start position:0%
 
personnel

01:23:01.030 --> 01:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:03.669 --> 01:23:03.679 align:start position:0%
and again this we get we get into that
 
01:23:05.830 --> 01:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
conversation we had with the lab company
 
01:23:09.149 --> 01:23:09.159 align:start position:0%
that came in last week Chief sorry to
 
01:23:11.950 --> 01:23:11.960 align:start position:0%
break you slow there but for the
 
01:23:14.470 --> 01:23:14.480 align:start position:0%
requirements of uh restrictions of where
 
01:23:16.270 --> 01:23:16.280 align:start position:0%
they may be
 
01:23:18.430 --> 01:23:18.440 align:start position:0%
located is should it be something should
 
01:23:20.149 --> 01:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
we put something in this bill I
 
01:23:22.110 --> 01:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
understand that uh a lot of come to
 
01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.280 align:start position:0%
rules about so many feet from a school
 
01:23:26.470 --> 01:23:26.480 align:start position:0%
or an area that's very important should
 
01:23:29.629 --> 01:23:29.639 align:start position:0%
we put that that's in here somewhere it
 
01:23:31.669 --> 01:23:31.679 align:start position:0%
is yeah somewhere else in that's that's
 
01:23:33.070 --> 01:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
in here in a separate section I think
 
01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:34.149 align:start position:0%
in here in a separate section I think
it's

01:23:34.149 --> 01:23:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
um I think what's there now I'm sure
 
01:23:39.149 --> 01:23:39.159 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a healthy debate on
 
01:23:39.159 --> 01:23:42.750 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a healthy debate on
that

01:23:42.750 --> 01:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:45.669 --> 01:23:45.679 align:start position:0%
one um so back to n requirements for the
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
testing cannabis Canabis products
 
01:23:49.070 --> 01:23:49.080 align:start position:0%
limited but not included so again this
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
is all the conversation around um
 
01:23:55.510 --> 01:23:55.520 align:start position:0%
testing for all the different um
 
01:23:58.110 --> 01:23:58.120 align:start position:0%
carcinogens and and contaminants and
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff again it's not an
 
01:24:03.350 --> 01:24:03.360 align:start position:0%
exhaustive list um and I think we
 
01:24:05.910 --> 01:24:05.920 align:start position:0%
have again including but not limited to
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
language so it allows them to expand
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
based on the input of that Lab company
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
we had before that talks about what
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
should be tested for and what not and
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
creating that
 
01:24:18.790 --> 01:24:18.800 align:start position:0%
list so Roman numeral the sub Roman
 
01:24:22.149 --> 01:24:22.159 align:start position:0%
numeral one 2 3 four five six seven
 
01:24:25.510 --> 01:24:25.520 align:start position:0%
eight n any comments on any of those
 
01:24:27.189 --> 01:24:27.199 align:start position:0%
that we think we need to add into that
 
01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
lab as a again this is a minimum list
 
01:24:33.470 --> 01:24:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.750 --> 01:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
list any any comment seeing none right
 
01:24:39.910 --> 01:24:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh I just want you to know at Amsterdam
 
01:24:42.070 --> 01:24:42.080 align:start position:0%
which is covered with canals covered
 
01:24:44.229 --> 01:24:44.239 align:start position:0%
with it was rained every day we were
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
there and there is no regulation of mold
 
01:24:50.870 --> 01:24:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:53.370 --> 01:24:53.380 align:start position:0%
stores what else happened
 
01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:56.030 align:start position:0%
stores what else happened
[Music]

01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:24:58.109 --> 01:24:58.119 align:start position:0%
so number Roman numeral number
 
01:24:58.119 --> 01:24:59.990 align:start position:0%
so number Roman numeral number
three

01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:25:02.470 --> 01:25:02.480 align:start position:0%
um so I think Mr chair this might go
 
01:25:04.189 --> 01:25:04.199 align:start position:0%
along with that other one we left open
 
01:25:09.990 --> 01:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
for you on uh e relative to the um
 
01:25:12.030 --> 01:25:12.040 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers
 
01:25:14.910 --> 01:25:14.920 align:start position:0%
and Mr frair I think that we should
 
01:25:16.350 --> 01:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
probably change that to 30 months to be
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
consistent with yep
 
01:25:21.709 --> 01:25:21.719 align:start position:0%
30 thank you catch that this section
 
01:25:24.189 --> 01:25:24.199 align:start position:0%
needs to
 
01:25:26.790 --> 01:25:26.800 align:start position:0%
incorporate I get I what I saying so the
 
01:25:29.149 --> 01:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
direction we were kind of going in was
 
01:25:31.990 --> 01:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps if if an ATC were to apply to be
 
01:25:33.790 --> 01:25:33.800 align:start position:0%
a franchisee and if they were granted
 
01:25:36.149 --> 01:25:36.159 align:start position:0%
that they were you know selected and
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
assuming they they met the
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
criteria uh rather than have a dual
 
01:25:42.149 --> 01:25:42.159 align:start position:0%
store they would basically become a
 
01:25:43.750 --> 01:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
retail store but the therapeutic
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
products would be its own separate
 
01:25:47.350 --> 01:25:47.360 align:start position:0%
industry they kind of would be grandf
 
01:25:50.390 --> 01:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
followed in for manufacturing purposes
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
and leave it to them to and how they
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
they want to distribute that to other
 
01:25:56.709 --> 01:25:56.719 align:start position:0%
franchises again it's we're not going to
 
01:25:58.590 --> 01:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
force them to sell that but that means
 
01:26:00.910 --> 01:26:00.920 align:start position:0%
any franchisee would be able to sell
 
01:26:02.950 --> 01:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
therapeutic products if they wish they
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
still would need the card but I and the
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
I know some representatives from the
 
01:26:10.510 --> 01:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
atcs are here I think for the most part
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
we're they're on on board with that you
 
01:26:14.030 --> 01:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
know obviously there's
 
01:26:16.470 --> 01:26:16.480 align:start position:0%
some more detailed concerns but I think
 
01:26:18.109 --> 01:26:18.119 align:start position:0%
that would get rid of the Dual store the
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
dual lights the having the two signs up
 
01:26:22.870 --> 01:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
and all that confusion it kind of sets
 
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
it one One Direction I'm wondering that
 
01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:26.639 align:start position:0%
I mean that's an issue that I think we
 
01:26:29.709 --> 01:26:29.719 align:start position:0%
need to hash out um and I don't know if
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mike H wants to weigh in on that
 
01:26:33.109 --> 01:26:33.119 align:start position:0%
issue I think the collocation issue is
 
01:26:34.790 --> 01:26:34.800 align:start position:0%
one that we really do need to hash out
 
01:26:37.950 --> 01:26:37.960 align:start position:0%
well yes well but I think what what
 
01:26:40.510 --> 01:26:40.520 align:start position:0%
we're saying is it's if an ATC wants to
 
01:26:43.229 --> 01:26:43.239 align:start position:0%
remain an ATC that is within their
 
01:26:44.709 --> 01:26:44.719 align:start position:0%
that's their discre they can do that
 
01:26:46.870 --> 01:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
they're already there if they want to
 
01:26:49.830 --> 01:26:49.840 align:start position:0%
have become a retail St right rather
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
than have all this dual license all this
 
01:26:55.030 --> 01:26:55.040 align:start position:0%
in you know their sign and the state
 
01:26:57.470 --> 01:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
whatever they're be they're coming to
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
the state wanting to be a franchise at
 
01:27:02.350 --> 01:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
that point the the long term of this the
 
01:27:04.709 --> 01:27:04.719 align:start position:0%
brand is not the the sign at your store
 
01:27:07.109 --> 01:27:07.119 align:start position:0%
the brand is the product is they give
 
01:27:09.189 --> 01:27:09.199 align:start position:0%
Like Liquor Jack Daniels Jim Beam Johnny
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that that's the brand
 
01:27:13.109 --> 01:27:13.119 align:start position:0%
right so they're gonna have that but I
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
think I think I would like to hear from
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
Mike hle and maybe some of the atcs
 
01:27:19.270 --> 01:27:19.280 align:start position:0%
about about this issue and how it would
 
01:27:21.390 --> 01:27:21.400 align:start position:0%
affect our existing businesses in New
 
01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:23.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I would like to hear some
 
01:27:27.229 --> 01:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
additional Mr chairman and yeah we'll
 
01:27:28.790 --> 01:27:28.800 align:start position:0%
keep moving through the bill maybe when
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
we get towards the end today what's our
 
01:27:35.189 --> 01:27:35.199 align:start position:0%
time hour I think this is a larger issue
 
01:27:37.470 --> 01:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
that we and and and I cannot
 
01:27:41.709 --> 01:27:41.719 align:start position:0%
underestimate that the the issue is that
 
01:27:42.910 --> 01:27:42.920 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:27:47.510 --> 01:27:47.520 align:start position:0%
tax that the atcs don't pay any tax and
 
01:27:50.590 --> 01:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
a and b is there's no cap on how much
 
01:27:52.910 --> 01:27:52.920 align:start position:0%
THC is in the product
 
01:27:54.750 --> 01:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
I think all those those those are still
 
01:27:56.870 --> 01:27:56.880 align:start position:0%
subject to the whole process but I think
 
01:27:59.910 --> 01:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
this the basis that what I'm talking
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
about the ATC product could be subject
 
01:28:04.990 --> 01:28:05.000 align:start position:0%
to the franchise fee still uh but that
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
also gives us an opportunity to perhaps
 
01:28:08.910 --> 01:28:08.920 align:start position:0%
lower that franchise fee there is a
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
public interest in lowering that amount
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
to keep the retail price lower but um
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
let's keep going through this but I
 
01:28:17.390 --> 01:28:17.400 align:start position:0%
think before we close up maybe in about
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
15 minutes we'll let the atcs
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
and take we go take the station and my P
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
too I really I think this is a critical
 
01:28:28.229 --> 01:28:28.239 align:start position:0%
issue for exempting businesses so I do
 
01:28:30.350 --> 01:28:30.360 align:start position:0%
before we I don't think we reach consent
 
01:28:32.629 --> 01:28:32.639 align:start position:0%
hold on Mr Holt is not an owner of an
 
01:28:35.189 --> 01:28:35.199 align:start position:0%
ATC well that's like a therapeutic let
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
me let me keep talking don't interrup me
 
01:28:39.669 --> 01:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying is that this is a
 
01:28:42.350 --> 01:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
critical policy issue my col runs the
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
program atcs are existing businesses
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
before I'm comfortable making any
 
01:28:48.270 --> 01:28:48.280 align:start position:0%
decision I don't think there's consensus
 
01:28:50.669 --> 01:28:50.679 align:start position:0%
on the committee I would like to hear
 
01:28:52.830 --> 01:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
how that would impact the existing
 
01:28:56.550 --> 01:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
program the patients and the businesses
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
I think from the Department's
 
01:28:59.790 --> 01:28:59.800 align:start position:0%
perspective we have the business
 
01:29:01.070 --> 01:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
perspective we have the Department's
 
01:29:03.149 --> 01:29:03.159 align:start position:0%
perspective which hopefully is also
 
01:29:04.830 --> 01:29:04.840 align:start position:0%
thinking about the patients I think
 
01:29:06.950 --> 01:29:06.960 align:start position:0%
before I can make a a decision about
 
01:29:08.910 --> 01:29:08.920 align:start position:0%
where it should go I would like to hear
 
01:29:11.510 --> 01:29:11.520 align:start position:0%
hear from all the parties maybe you guys
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
have already made your decision but I
 
01:29:12.719 --> 01:29:13.430 align:start position:0%
have already made your decision but I
have

01:29:13.430 --> 01:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
not no I think that was the point I
 
01:29:17.590 --> 01:29:17.600 align:start position:0%
think we it's a bigger conversation that
 
01:29:19.270 --> 01:29:19.280 align:start position:0%
we need to talk about and maybe we can
 
01:29:20.910 --> 01:29:20.920 align:start position:0%
skip that piece right now and move on to
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
something else that we can get consensus
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
and can you moving through the bill
 
01:29:27.510 --> 01:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
let's keep moving but maybe in about 15
 
01:29:29.950 --> 01:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
minutes we'll we'll switch all right so
 
01:29:32.070 --> 01:29:32.080 align:start position:0%
number four um again we have the 30
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
month change and I would like that
 
01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:39.040 align:start position:0%
online um so we're on page 13 now on
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
line 34 um number Roman numeral four I'd
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
like to change that again to 30 months
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
and then add online 37 that but not
 
01:29:50.430 --> 01:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
limited to language to give the them
 
01:29:52.070 --> 01:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
room on the rule making to deal with all
 
01:29:53.910 --> 01:29:53.920 align:start position:0%
the issues that they may that may crop
 
01:30:20.830 --> 01:30:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:45.910 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:30:45.910 --> 01:30:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
I think most States distinguish whether
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
not I'm sorry so let's let's so Frank
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
let's go uh thank you um so I know
 
01:31:00.189 --> 01:31:00.199 align:start position:0%
looking at the new futures um handout
 
01:31:01.629 --> 01:31:01.639 align:start position:0%
that they gave us they had some thoughts
 
01:31:03.070 --> 01:31:03.080 align:start position:0%
on this so I'm not if it'd be
 
01:31:05.870 --> 01:31:05.880 align:start position:0%
appropriate if we could call Kate to
 
01:31:07.430 --> 01:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
give their opinion on this or if we want
 
01:31:07.440 --> 01:31:11.870 align:start position:0%
give their opinion on this or if we want
to

01:31:11.870 --> 01:31:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.629 --> 01:31:14.639 align:start position:0%
push thank you very much uh members of
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
the committee again um my name is Kate
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
fried VI vice president of advocacy for
 
01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
new Futures I did send the committee our
 
01:31:23.070 --> 01:31:23.080 align:start position:0%
side by side with the principles as well
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
as revised language I'm sending out a
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
copy again I know I brought it last time
 
01:31:29.830 --> 01:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
but just in case you need a revised copy
 
01:31:33.109 --> 01:31:33.119 align:start position:0%
so I speak to this on page two of the
 
01:31:35.950 --> 01:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
document that has um suggested
 
01:31:39.390 --> 01:31:39.400 align:start position:0%
edits um I do have to say that uh a lot
 
01:31:42.629 --> 01:31:42.639 align:start position:0%
of our previous concerns in uh within
 
01:31:44.830 --> 01:31:44.840 align:start position:0%
our principles around advertising
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
marketing labeling things like that um
 
01:31:50.149 --> 01:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
have been addressed I will also bring
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
attention to uh what Dr Silver's
 
01:31:56.350 --> 01:31:56.360 align:start position:0%
comments were in her draft she actually
 
01:31:58.350 --> 01:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
um did an excellent job as well probably
 
01:32:00.270 --> 01:32:00.280 align:start position:0%
better language than me so I defer to
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
that as well um but there were two
 
01:32:04.709 --> 01:32:04.719 align:start position:0%
issues in particular on page
 
01:32:08.709 --> 01:32:08.719 align:start position:0%
14 um I do think that
 
01:32:12.790 --> 01:32:12.800 align:start position:0%
um we uh need to tweak that language uh
 
01:32:14.990 --> 01:32:15.000 align:start position:0%
establishing potency limits for cannabis
 
01:32:17.629 --> 01:32:17.639 align:start position:0%
products and the maximum amount of THC
 
01:32:19.629 --> 01:32:19.639 align:start position:0%
that may be included in each cannabis
 
01:32:22.030 --> 01:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
product serving so if you don't want to
 
01:32:24.270 --> 01:32:24.280 align:start position:0%
put a number in there now that's fine I
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
will say 20 is way too high that's
 
01:32:30.590 --> 01:32:30.600 align:start position:0%
dangerously High even the industry had
 
01:32:32.950 --> 01:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
said that in their comments there is no
 
01:32:35.950 --> 01:32:35.960 align:start position:0%
state that allows 20 in the serving size
 
01:32:39.350 --> 01:32:39.360 align:start position:0%
the average is five I believe 10 is in
 
01:32:42.030 --> 01:32:42.040 align:start position:0%
Maine um so I think that's very
 
01:32:45.550 --> 01:32:45.560 align:start position:0%
dangerous to have that set at 20 in
 
01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
statute um I would also urge the
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
committee to make sure there are potency
 
01:32:53.590 --> 01:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
limits within the statute that is
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
something that we heard very clearly
 
01:33:00.350 --> 01:33:00.360 align:start position:0%
from Dr Silver on evolving um uh science
 
01:33:03.070 --> 01:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
uh that we've had uh with the connection
 
01:33:06.310 --> 01:33:06.320 align:start position:0%
on um psychosis um and other mental
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
health issues um the other thing that I
 
01:33:12.590 --> 01:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
have included um this is well that's
 
01:33:14.950 --> 01:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
jumping ahead to page 15 too when we
 
01:33:16.790 --> 01:33:16.800 align:start position:0%
start to talk about labeling I can hold
 
01:33:18.709 --> 01:33:18.719 align:start position:0%
on that let's get through Page let's get
 
01:33:21.629 --> 01:33:21.639 align:start position:0%
through that but page 14 one so it says
 
01:33:24.910 --> 01:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
20 I think that I'm hearing that's way
 
01:33:29.910 --> 01:33:29.920 align:start position:0%
too high M does 10 uh not saying we 10's
 
01:33:31.270 --> 01:33:31.280 align:start position:0%
going to be the final number but we at
 
01:33:32.950 --> 01:33:32.960 align:start position:0%
least agree to reduce that to 10 for the
 
01:33:37.390 --> 01:33:37.400 align:start position:0%
time being Mr fine i' I'd leave it as as
 
01:33:38.990 --> 01:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
their recommending and not put any limit
 
01:33:40.910 --> 01:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
in there because now we're basically
 
01:33:42.629 --> 01:33:42.639 align:start position:0%
going to put a limit in but then give
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
the commission statutory authority to
 
01:33:47.070 --> 01:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
change the limit after we've we've
 
01:33:48.750 --> 01:33:48.760 align:start position:0%
already set the limit as a legislature I
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
think that's a little confusing I think
 
01:33:52.430 --> 01:33:52.440 align:start position:0%
if we just change it to to establish
 
01:33:54.070 --> 01:33:54.080 align:start position:0%
again this is about rul making and what
 
01:33:56.550 --> 01:33:56.560 align:start position:0%
rules they have to make and one of them
 
01:33:58.030 --> 01:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
is in the rule making we're asking them
 
01:33:59.830 --> 01:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
to establish a maximum amount of T that
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
may be included in each cannabis product
 
01:34:04.109 --> 01:34:04.119 align:start position:0%
serving period and let the let it just
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
end right there so get ready to accept
 
01:34:07.430 --> 01:34:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the commission me so strike that
 
01:34:09.590 --> 01:34:09.600 align:start position:0%
language strike as 20 from as 20
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
milligrams all the way to the end of the
 
01:34:12.750 --> 01:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
sentence and that just gives the
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
commission the right through public
 
01:34:16.990 --> 01:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
through the rules making process to
 
01:34:18.990 --> 01:34:19.000 align:start position:0%
establish a limit including Public
 
01:34:21.149 --> 01:34:21.159 align:start position:0%
Health input and everything else without
 
01:34:24.390 --> 01:34:24.400 align:start position:0%
setting statute so on the segue with
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
that exactly with what you said as far
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
as public health input on page three we
 
01:34:30.950 --> 01:34:30.960 align:start position:0%
actually offered additional language
 
01:34:34.109 --> 01:34:34.119 align:start position:0%
under number eight um this is not me
 
01:34:35.870 --> 01:34:35.880 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can finish C well it
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
ties into C it's related to that so we
 
01:34:41.430 --> 01:34:41.440 align:start position:0%
don't um I think you heard last week
 
01:34:43.629 --> 01:34:43.639 align:start position:0%
there is evolving science all the time
 
01:34:47.350 --> 01:34:47.360 align:start position:0%
on potency limits you know um we're not
 
01:34:49.030 --> 01:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
really sure what that number is but that
 
01:34:50.550 --> 01:34:50.560 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we shouldn't be doing
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
anything um our partners at the at the
 
01:34:55.310 --> 01:34:55.320 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission while they we I think
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
they do great work and they know the
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
products um I think it's important to
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
have some kind of advisory committee to
 
01:35:05.350 --> 01:35:05.360 align:start position:0%
assist with um advising on public health
 
01:35:08.109 --> 01:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
issues such as potency limits um based
 
01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:09.920 align:start position:0%
on the experts that are out there on the
 
01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
on the science I'm not saying that it
 
01:35:14.830 --> 01:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
should be um an advi a regulatory body
 
01:35:17.510 --> 01:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
or take the place of the rules process
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
but just an advisory body that the
 
01:35:22.669 --> 01:35:22.679 align:start position:0%
commission could rely on for the latest
 
01:35:25.709 --> 01:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
Public Health um and most upto-date
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
evidence-based information on potency
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
limits and serving sizes so that's how
 
01:35:32.830 --> 01:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
you would get to assisting that
 
01:35:34.750 --> 01:35:34.760 align:start position:0%
commission find that
 
01:35:37.590 --> 01:35:37.600 align:start position:0%
number have the doctor and lqu any any
 
01:35:39.830 --> 01:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
comment I just wanted to clarify so if
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
we didn't have something here there
 
01:35:43.550 --> 01:35:43.560 align:start position:0%
would be nothing in this bill that had a
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
product serving size limit well would
 
01:35:49.590 --> 01:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
require the commission to establish one
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
we're not establishing as legisl
 
01:35:54.070 --> 01:35:54.080 align:start position:0%
a product
 
01:35:57.310 --> 01:35:57.320 align:start position:0%
service so one of the reasons why we
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
should probably leave that in in there
 
01:36:01.990 --> 01:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
is what what if we get it wrong and our
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
constituents elect a new body that want
 
01:36:05.629 --> 01:36:05.639 align:start position:0%
us to make a change we won't have the
 
01:36:07.950 --> 01:36:07.960 align:start position:0%
ability to make a change it would only
 
01:36:10.109 --> 01:36:10.119 align:start position:0%
we well through legislation we can
 
01:36:11.870 --> 01:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
always we can always change a rule I'm
 
01:36:15.189 --> 01:36:15.199 align:start position:0%
thinking what I'm saying is I think
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
having making a 10 I'm not saying future
 
01:36:21.590 --> 01:36:21.600 align:start position:0%
legislation will increase that I'm sure
 
01:36:25.229 --> 01:36:25.239 align:start position:0%
if if liquor finds the a good reason for
 
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
that to be increased they would come to
 
01:36:28.790 --> 01:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
the legisl I think just having I think
 
01:36:30.189 --> 01:36:30.199 align:start position:0%
the one thing is we don't want to do too
 
01:36:32.350 --> 01:36:32.360 align:start position:0%
much too soon and then try to roll it
 
01:36:34.310 --> 01:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
back I think going backwards is going to
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
be tough Senator Whitley yeah I I think
 
01:36:41.470 --> 01:36:41.480 align:start position:0%
if we're going I understand the very I
 
01:36:43.590 --> 01:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
share the same concerns about removing
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
all sort of limits in the statute I
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
think we're exceeding some of our
 
01:36:50.510 --> 01:36:50.520 align:start position:0%
Authority there perhaps if we are going
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
to do that we also need you know this um
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
you know advisory this public health
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
advisory perspective I think it's sort
 
01:37:01.709 --> 01:37:01.719 align:start position:0%
of a middle ground so this is
 
01:37:04.950 --> 01:37:04.960 align:start position:0%
recommended by new Futures on on page
 
01:37:07.510 --> 01:37:07.520 align:start position:0%
three of their memo at eight I think
 
01:37:10.109 --> 01:37:10.119 align:start position:0%
that is a middle ground between what the
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
chief was proposing and what we
 
01:37:14.629 --> 01:37:14.639 align:start position:0%
discussed maybe would be an extra lay
 
01:37:16.590 --> 01:37:16.600 align:start position:0%
uner layer of government I think the
 
01:37:18.070 --> 01:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
addition if we're going to remove those
 
01:37:19.390 --> 01:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
limits if we're going to give all our
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
authority to Ru Mak I think having that
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
public health I wouldn't say back stop
 
01:37:29.070 --> 01:37:29.080 align:start position:0%
but uh uh there's no partic
 
01:37:31.149 --> 01:37:31.159 align:start position:0%
participation would be helpful does that
 
01:37:32.350 --> 01:37:32.360 align:start position:0%
make sense I don't think there's any
 
01:37:34.709 --> 01:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
harm with what um new Futures is
 
01:37:37.390 --> 01:37:37.400 align:start position:0%
proposing in on number eight yeah I
 
01:37:38.709 --> 01:37:38.719 align:start position:0%
think it's a a middle ground from what
 
01:37:40.550 --> 01:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
the chief was proposing yeah I mean I
 
01:37:42.350 --> 01:37:42.360 align:start position:0%
think when we heard I was not here last
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
week the week before about all the sort
 
01:37:46.030 --> 01:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
of public health advocacy and how little
 
01:37:48.030 --> 01:37:48.040 align:start position:0%
role they've had in other states I mean
 
01:37:49.910 --> 01:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
it sort of makes me feel like if there
 
01:37:52.030 --> 01:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
isn't a limit set now like are they
 
01:37:53.470 --> 01:37:53.480 align:start position:0%
really going to have any real role in
 
01:37:56.470 --> 01:37:56.480 align:start position:0%
the future you know even if we say they
 
01:37:59.669 --> 01:37:59.679 align:start position:0%
will will they really um and so I I I
 
01:38:01.510 --> 01:38:01.520 align:start position:0%
think it's always concerning when we
 
01:38:04.990 --> 01:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
even I mean if most places are five
 
01:38:06.950 --> 01:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
starting it's it's much easier as
 
01:38:08.310 --> 01:38:08.320 align:start position:0%
everybody's mentioned to go up than to
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
go back five most plac are five well no
 
01:38:12.830 --> 01:38:12.840 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if most I I'm just looking at
 
01:38:15.270 --> 01:38:15.280 align:start position:0%
you know some of the the testimony from
 
01:38:16.750 --> 01:38:16.760 align:start position:0%
from last week and I'm just saying you
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
know if I saw California was 10 and
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
Maine is 10 I see or some are five I
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
mean NIH recommends five I'm just asking
 
01:38:27.790 --> 01:38:27.800 align:start position:0%
I don't know um what you know in other
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
states that are have recreational legal
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis what is the average limit we
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
certainly shouldn't be above that and
 
01:38:35.790 --> 01:38:35.800 align:start position:0%
what is that what I believe it's
 
01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
actually five and Vermont and
 
01:38:39.470 --> 01:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts are five too and that's
 
01:38:41.669 --> 01:38:41.679 align:start position:0%
another reason you know again we can be
 
01:38:44.350 --> 01:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
fluid with what's in statute and rely on
 
01:38:45.669 --> 01:38:45.679 align:start position:0%
that through Ru making because there's
 
01:38:47.709 --> 01:38:47.719 align:start position:0%
some time for that but we would want
 
01:38:49.870 --> 01:38:49.880 align:start position:0%
that public health expertise I would be
 
01:38:51.709 --> 01:38:51.719 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with setting it with 10 in
 
01:38:53.510 --> 01:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
the statute I still feel that that's too
 
01:38:54.910 --> 01:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
high I'm not sure I'm at 10 either I
 
01:38:57.950 --> 01:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
just 20 is too high so she's correct it
 
01:39:01.470 --> 01:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
is five so now we're down to 10 so who
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
wants it to say who wants it to be five
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand yeah right well
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
five has it so uh Mr chair I I the whole
 
01:39:16.629 --> 01:39:16.639 align:start position:0%
one of our issues here is to be
 
01:39:19.629 --> 01:39:19.639 align:start position:0%
competitive if Maine has all these
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
stores surrounding us that are selling
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
it at 10 I think we should do 10 but
 
01:39:28.070 --> 01:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
then include the health this health
 
01:39:31.629 --> 01:39:31.639 align:start position:0%
entity do they can then make a case that
 
01:39:33.629 --> 01:39:33.639 align:start position:0%
the number should go down so I think
 
01:39:35.910 --> 01:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
yeah with with all due respect but I
 
01:39:38.070 --> 01:39:38.080 align:start position:0%
think this is no one's saying you can't
 
01:39:40.790 --> 01:39:40.800 align:start position:0%
buy more than one product this each
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
product has a max potency right you can
 
01:39:46.669 --> 01:39:46.679 align:start position:0%
have so you can buy 10K I believe me I
 
01:39:47.589 --> 01:39:47.599 align:start position:0%
understand the
 
01:39:49.669 --> 01:39:49.679 align:start position:0%
situation uh but I'm just saying this
 
01:39:51.910 --> 01:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
what consumers are are aware of what
 
01:39:55.229 --> 01:39:55.239 align:start position:0%
they're thinking about uh you and if the
 
01:39:58.270 --> 01:39:58.280 align:start position:0%
fact that um I I would say our number
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
one competitor is going to be main uh
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
then why why would we handicap our
 
01:40:07.109 --> 01:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
stores right out of the box why not just
 
01:40:08.669 --> 01:40:08.679 align:start position:0%
stick with the take the 10 because
 
01:40:10.750 --> 01:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
that's what the that was the president
 
01:40:13.070 --> 01:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
and then let the health health this
 
01:40:15.109 --> 01:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
health if this health people are going
 
01:40:17.430 --> 01:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to start doing some research
 
01:40:19.149 --> 01:40:19.159 align:start position:0%
and doing some know you knowledge
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
gaining then they can make a case going
 
01:40:22.870 --> 01:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
forward to lower before I get to the the
 
01:40:26.709 --> 01:40:26.719 align:start position:0%
hands we do have a person from Maine or
 
01:40:27.950 --> 01:40:27.960 align:start position:0%
I think he actually lives in the state
 
01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:29.510 align:start position:0%
I think he actually lives in the state
but

01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
he's if you want come up to the mic
 
01:40:34.270 --> 01:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps try to persuade this this
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
Commission of why 10 is the PR but come
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:44.830 --> 01:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
microphone I just want you to know the
 
01:40:46.589 --> 01:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
the different one thing that you don't
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
consider right we're competing with
 
01:40:52.149 --> 01:40:52.159 align:start position:0%
other states when I make a job of gummy
 
01:40:57.030 --> 01:40:57.040 align:start position:0%
say right in Maine we make 10 pieces for
 
01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
100 milligrams because that's the
 
01:41:01.990 --> 01:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
maximum dose so we have jars of a 100 if
 
01:41:05.189 --> 01:41:05.199 align:start position:0%
we want to make a jar of fives just
 
01:41:06.870 --> 01:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
understand what happens is your cost
 
01:41:09.350 --> 01:41:09.360 align:start position:0%
goes way up your packaging doubles
 
01:41:11.109 --> 01:41:11.119 align:start position:0%
because you you need twice as much
 
01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
volume to put 20 pieces in instead of 10
 
01:41:17.390 --> 01:41:17.400 align:start position:0%
and the ingredients go up so it's a cost
 
01:41:21.109 --> 01:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
issue thing I think five or 10 works
 
01:41:23.430 --> 01:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
either way but I'm just wanted to bring
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
up to you guys to explain the uh the
 
01:41:27.950 --> 01:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
other consideration that happens when we
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
put this stuff on the Shelf
 
01:41:31.080 --> 01:41:33.390 align:start position:0%
put this stuff on the Shelf
so

01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:41:37.030 --> 01:41:37.040 align:start position:0%
Whitley yeah I think um five makes sense
 
01:41:39.709 --> 01:41:39.719 align:start position:0%
to me I think I I understand the
 
01:41:41.870 --> 01:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
competitive uh advantage that we are
 
01:41:44.270 --> 01:41:44.280 align:start position:0%
looking for but I don't think that this
 
01:41:46.750 --> 01:41:46.760 align:start position:0%
is the place where we want to seek that
 
01:41:48.750 --> 01:41:48.760 align:start position:0%
competitive Advantage I think this is a
 
01:41:50.950 --> 01:41:50.960 align:start position:0%
critical Public Health we talked a lot
 
01:41:52.669 --> 01:41:52.679 align:start position:0%
about um public health and child
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
protection and I think this is a piece
 
01:41:57.229 --> 01:41:57.239 align:start position:0%
where um it's consistent with most
 
01:41:58.870 --> 01:41:58.880 align:start position:0%
surrounding states I think this is a
 
01:42:00.870 --> 01:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
piece that we can really weigh in
 
01:42:04.270 --> 01:42:04.280 align:start position:0%
on do I I agree I think that it's hard
 
01:42:07.390 --> 01:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
to put uh public or profitability over
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
Public Health like I understand this
 
01:42:09.870 --> 01:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
needs to be profitable but like when you
 
01:42:11.790 --> 01:42:11.800 align:start position:0%
think about like increasing ER visits
 
01:42:13.270 --> 01:42:13.280 align:start position:0%
for kids when they get a handle on these
 
01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
things like it's it's you know it can
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
always go up I I I I think the the key
 
01:42:21.350 --> 01:42:21.360 align:start position:0%
is if we go to five
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
it can be changed to 10 20 if you're at
 
01:42:26.709 --> 01:42:26.719 align:start position:0%
20 going down to 10 going down to five
 
01:42:30.070 --> 01:42:30.080 align:start position:0%
is Not Practical so I rather start slow
 
01:42:32.990 --> 01:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
move up than go too high and move back
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
down I think that's where where I'm at
 
01:42:38.550 --> 01:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
so so Mr CH there a recommendation just
 
01:42:42.109 --> 01:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
changing striking the accept language so
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
the commission can't change the law and
 
01:42:46.830 --> 01:42:46.840 align:start position:0%
just set the instead of 20 milligrams
 
01:42:48.510 --> 01:42:48.520 align:start position:0%
change it to five and yes correct and
 
01:42:51.470 --> 01:42:51.480 align:start position:0%
then paragraph eight in what new Futures
 
01:42:53.350 --> 01:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
provide us
 
01:42:55.109 --> 01:42:55.119 align:start position:0%
basically I'm not sure that would go
 
01:42:57.070 --> 01:42:57.080 align:start position:0%
under section c but we want to put that
 
01:42:58.950 --> 01:42:58.960 align:start position:0%
in into this working model somewhere
 
01:43:00.669 --> 01:43:00.679 align:start position:0%
does anyone have any problem with
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
that no I think that I think that's a
 
01:43:04.830 --> 01:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
great a great addition to keep that I
 
01:43:05.750 --> 01:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
mean I think we're going to be the
 
01:43:07.750 --> 01:43:07.760 align:start position:0%
leader hopefully we're going to be do in
 
01:43:08.990 --> 01:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire for the leader on this
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%
public health perspective and having
 
01:43:11.750 --> 01:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
this advisory body I think would be
 
01:43:14.550 --> 01:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
really helpful Chief I I'd like to hear
 
01:43:15.629 --> 01:43:15.639 align:start position:0%
what the chief says because that's kind
 
01:43:17.990 --> 01:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
of a compromise on what um Lynn silver
 
01:43:20.229 --> 01:43:20.239 align:start position:0%
had testified I mean she she was asking
 
01:43:22.149 --> 01:43:22.159 align:start position:0%
for something
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.669 --> 01:43:37.679 align:start position:0%
nature can I ask on
 
01:43:43.870 --> 01:43:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.350 --> 01:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
yeah so the way this is written
 
01:43:48.990 --> 01:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
including a Prohibition on vaporizing
 
01:43:53.550 --> 01:43:53.560 align:start position:0%
devices that include toxic or addictive
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
additives I I
 
01:43:58.310 --> 01:43:58.320 align:start position:0%
understand this is written is that
 
01:44:00.550 --> 01:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
intended to maybe not mix THD with like
 
01:44:02.470 --> 01:44:02.480 align:start position:0%
nicotine but I don't think we want to
 
01:44:05.510 --> 01:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
ban vaping of nicotine products does
 
01:44:08.310 --> 01:44:08.320 align:start position:0%
this do that but
 
01:44:08.320 --> 01:44:10.149 align:start position:0%
this do that but
inadvertently

01:44:10.149 --> 01:44:10.159 align:start position:0%
inadvertently
 
01:44:14.750 --> 01:44:14.760 align:start position:0%
anyone I'm on page 14 lines 15 to
 
01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
20 yeah it seems like it does because we
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
all know that nicotine's toxic right I
 
01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:23.239 align:start position:0%
mean and it's addictive so yeah I and I
 
01:44:24.470 --> 01:44:24.480 align:start position:0%
think that there are other I mean I
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
think that the the language is still
 
01:44:28.589 --> 01:44:28.599 align:start position:0%
important but maybe taking nicotine out
 
01:44:30.070 --> 01:44:30.080 align:start position:0%
of that because there are other things
 
01:44:31.669 --> 01:44:31.679 align:start position:0%
that you can vaporize that could be
 
01:44:33.950 --> 01:44:33.960 align:start position:0%
mixed with cannabis like katom or some
 
01:44:36.589 --> 01:44:36.599 align:start position:0%
other you know things that are currently
 
01:44:39.709 --> 01:44:39.719 align:start position:0%
legal but bad I don't think we want to
 
01:44:43.229 --> 01:44:43.239 align:start position:0%
we could prohibit like THC being mixed
 
01:44:43.239 --> 01:44:44.030 align:start position:0%
we could prohibit like THC being mixed
with

01:44:44.030 --> 01:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:44:47.550 --> 01:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
nicotine I don't think that's a bad bad
 
01:44:51.470 --> 01:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
policy but I think number D has
 
01:44:54.870 --> 01:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
to make it clear that we're not Banning
 
01:44:56.709 --> 01:44:56.719 align:start position:0%
vaping products that involve nicotine
 
01:45:02.669 --> 01:45:02.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:13.990 --> 01:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
back I mean we definitely want to
 
01:45:17.750 --> 01:45:17.760 align:start position:0%
prohibit some of these chemical
 
01:45:19.390 --> 01:45:19.400 align:start position:0%
compounds that are not approved or
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
tested or
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.470 --> 01:45:31.480 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I I see what you were saying
 
01:45:33.790 --> 01:45:33.800 align:start position:0%
because it's not it's saying that on the
 
01:45:36.510 --> 01:45:36.520 align:start position:0%
Cannabis accessories specifically so it
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
really doesn't have anything to do with
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
what you're putting in the vapor the
 
01:45:41.870 --> 01:45:41.880 align:start position:0%
vaporizer the accessory it's just the
 
01:45:43.950 --> 01:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
accessory itself is that is that right
 
01:45:49.470 --> 01:45:49.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.480 --> 01:45:59.189 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:02.910 --> 01:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
he's right okay just double checking
 
01:46:04.030 --> 01:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the first time the
 
01:46:06.709 --> 01:46:06.719 align:start position:0%
legislator made that mistake that
 
01:46:08.109 --> 01:46:08.119 align:start position:0%
consequences they didn't intend so all
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
right so otherwise are we good with the
 
01:46:15.629 --> 01:46:15.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
written good move on to
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:22.990 align:start position:0%
written good move on to
E

01:46:22.990 --> 01:46:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:24.870 --> 01:46:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is a big one with the signs I
 
01:46:26.990 --> 01:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
personally any billboard signage you
 
01:46:29.030 --> 01:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
know I don't support any of that I think
 
01:46:30.189 --> 01:46:30.199 align:start position:0%
driving through
 
01:46:30.199 --> 01:46:31.790 align:start position:0%
driving through
Massachusetts

01:46:31.790 --> 01:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
01:46:34.350 --> 01:46:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's over the top what what they're
 
01:46:36.510 --> 01:46:36.520 align:start position:0%
doing there with the advertisements
 
01:46:39.629 --> 01:46:39.639 align:start position:0%
every billboard these neon Billboards
 
01:46:42.709 --> 01:46:42.719 align:start position:0%
it's I mean it's just what it
 
01:46:44.950 --> 01:46:44.960 align:start position:0%
is used go back from maned him what did
 
01:46:47.589 --> 01:46:47.599 align:start position:0%
they do over there there's no
 
01:46:50.189 --> 01:46:50.199 align:start position:0%
signs but does anyone have any issue
 
01:46:54.229 --> 01:46:54.239 align:start position:0%
with the with uh PL 22 to 45 it goes on
 
01:47:02.510 --> 01:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.350 --> 01:47:10.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
add one one thing you want to consider
 
01:47:15.070 --> 01:47:15.080 align:start position:0%
we advertise on billboards in New
 
01:47:17.589 --> 01:47:17.599 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from Maine so if you're going
 
01:47:20.709 --> 01:47:20.719 align:start position:0%
to stop billboard advertising just don't
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
stop it for New Hampshire because
 
01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
because we could still
 
01:47:27.950 --> 01:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
advertise you on your Billboards unless
 
01:47:29.709 --> 01:47:29.719 align:start position:0%
there's some restriction on that I would
 
01:47:32.109 --> 01:47:32.119 align:start position:0%
have to ban all advertising not just
 
01:47:35.189 --> 01:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
instate correct
 
01:47:38.430 --> 01:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
just that make sense I I appreciate that
 
01:47:39.790 --> 01:47:39.800 align:start position:0%
especially that seems to be against your
 
01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.950 align:start position:0%
especially that seems to be against your
own

01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
own
 
01:47:43.109 --> 01:47:43.119 align:start position:0%
interest so I really I really do
 
01:47:45.350 --> 01:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you you just saved
 
01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:49.310 align:start position:0%
appreciate that thank you you just saved
him

01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:52.669 --> 01:47:52.679 align:start position:0%
money I think um we were going to stop
 
01:47:54.870 --> 01:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
around 12 that's I think what we were
 
01:47:56.830 --> 01:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
trying to get at
 
01:48:00.430 --> 01:48:00.440 align:start position:0%
um but there was a citizen that wanted
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
to testify yes
 
01:48:07.790 --> 01:48:07.800 align:start position:0%
um you you're recognized that some
 
01:48:14.229 --> 01:48:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.239 --> 01:48:17.870 align:start position:0%
 
riddle

01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:22.149 --> 01:48:22.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and after after witness is done the
 
01:48:23.910 --> 01:48:23.920 align:start position:0%
represents from the atcs if you don't
 
01:48:25.750 --> 01:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
mind kind of
 
01:48:27.709 --> 01:48:27.719 align:start position:0%
discussing the idea I had of kind of
 
01:48:28.870 --> 01:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
putting everything together maybe just
 
01:48:30.030 --> 01:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
for the rest of the commission again I
 
01:48:31.350 --> 01:48:31.360 align:start position:0%
would like to hear from Michael H at the
 
01:48:33.109 --> 01:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
same time if Michael H wants to join the
 
01:48:35.310 --> 01:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
atcs even though he's a they have
 
01:48:37.669 --> 01:48:37.679 align:start position:0%
different interests like the atcs have
 
01:48:39.589 --> 01:48:39.599 align:start position:0%
business interests and the the
 
01:48:41.910 --> 01:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
department has public health and patient
 
01:48:43.910 --> 01:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
if Mr hle wants to join the atcs he's
 
01:48:45.270 --> 01:48:45.280 align:start position:0%
welcome to join
 
01:48:48.070 --> 01:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
me thank you uh Mr chair members of the
 
01:48:50.390 --> 01:48:50.400 align:start position:0%
commission uh my name is Jim Riddle uh
 
01:48:52.070 --> 01:48:52.080 align:start position:0%
Lambs breath seeds Hillsboro New
 
01:48:54.189 --> 01:48:54.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I've attended every one of
 
01:48:57.390 --> 01:48:57.400 align:start position:0%
your meetings and uh thank you for the
 
01:48:58.950 --> 01:48:58.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak and thank you for
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
the hard work you're doing too um and uh
 
01:49:05.910 --> 01:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
I spoke about a month ago or so and and
 
01:49:08.870 --> 01:49:08.880 align:start position:0%
summarized a grower survey that I worked
 
01:49:11.229 --> 01:49:11.239 align:start position:0%
with the Farm Bureau and the Northeast
 
01:49:13.990 --> 01:49:14.000 align:start position:0%
organic Farmers Association and I'm not
 
01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%
going to repeat that but I did uh uh
 
01:49:18.310 --> 01:49:18.320 align:start position:0%
send around a handout which has the
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
those results in more detail and I guess
 
01:49:24.350 --> 01:49:24.360 align:start position:0%
um one of my main concerns as a lifelong
 
01:49:27.109 --> 01:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
farmer is maximizing opportunities for
 
01:49:29.589 --> 01:49:29.599 align:start position:0%
granted State farmers we've got the land
 
01:49:31.589 --> 01:49:31.599 align:start position:0%
we got buildings we got equipment we
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
have knowledge growing crops and let's I
 
01:49:35.830 --> 01:49:35.840 align:start position:0%
don't hear that being discussed so I
 
01:49:37.830 --> 01:49:37.840 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
opportunities uh are given to Farmers in
 
01:49:42.950 --> 01:49:42.960 align:start position:0%
this state and just also want to point
 
01:49:46.109 --> 01:49:46.119 align:start position:0%
out the uh recent vote in Ohio uh
 
01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
57% of the public uh voted to uh support
 
01:49:53.830 --> 01:49:53.840 align:start position:0%
uh adult use marijuana or cannabis as
 
01:49:55.910 --> 01:49:55.920 align:start position:0%
and that includes hom growing up to 12
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
plants per household uh so overwhelming
 
01:50:03.030 --> 01:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
there but uh one of my concerns I'm a
 
01:50:07.550 --> 01:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
licensed hemp grower I grow seed and uh
 
01:50:11.070 --> 01:50:11.080 align:start position:0%
the whole issue of cannabis seed is not
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
being addressed in your legislation yet
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
uh but Minnesota was just before Ohio
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
was the 23rd state to legalize and they
 
01:50:22.830 --> 01:50:22.840 align:start position:0%
did establish some very uh I think
 
01:50:26.589 --> 01:50:26.599 align:start position:0%
reasonable realistic uh regulations for
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis seed production requiring that
 
01:50:32.790 --> 01:50:32.800 align:start position:0%
seed producers have a state permit and
 
01:50:35.589 --> 01:50:35.599 align:start position:0%
that they properly label their seeds if
 
01:50:37.390 --> 01:50:37.400 align:start position:0%
the seed makes a
 
01:50:42.350 --> 01:50:42.360 align:start position:0%
THC claim I mean seed contains no THC so
 
01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:44.280 align:start position:0%
but the parent coming or the plant
 
01:50:46.270 --> 01:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
coming from it they would need to have
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
certificate of analysis of the mother
 
01:50:51.669 --> 01:50:51.679 align:start position:0%
plant uh to to have it actually be
 
01:50:55.109 --> 01:50:55.119 align:start position:0%
verified they also have to do uh germ
 
01:50:58.229 --> 01:50:58.239 align:start position:0%
tests uh weed seeds all the things it
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
takes to put a good quality seed on the
 
01:51:03.310 --> 01:51:03.320 align:start position:0%
market so I think that is something that
 
01:51:05.069 --> 01:51:05.079 align:start position:0%
you need to think about or the
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
Commission in rule writing needs to take
 
01:51:10.189 --> 01:51:10.199 align:start position:0%
into consideration and I don't have
 
01:51:11.950 --> 01:51:11.960 align:start position:0%
copies for everybody but I will leave a
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
copy for the record of the Minnesota
 
01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
Department of agricultures uh
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
regulations for cannabis seed production
 
01:51:20.390 --> 01:51:20.400 align:start position:0%
I think it's a good model and encourage
 
01:51:23.550 --> 01:51:23.560 align:start position:0%
you to take a look at
 
01:51:26.430 --> 01:51:26.440 align:start position:0%
um I think one of your goals that I've
 
01:51:28.069 --> 01:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
gotten from attending the meeting is to
 
01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
try and treat cannabis a lot like
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
alcohol it's going to be legal and you
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
know if it's legal to have uh um you
 
01:51:38.990 --> 01:51:39.000 align:start position:0%
know so the things about public
 
01:51:42.510 --> 01:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
consumption should mirror uh the uh uh
 
01:51:44.950 --> 01:51:44.960 align:start position:0%
alcohol but also what are The Possession
 
01:51:46.470 --> 01:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
limits for
 
01:51:49.470 --> 01:51:49.480 align:start position:0%
alcohol there aren't any I can buy as
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
much beer beer Wine Liquor as I want
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
what are the potency limits for alcohol
 
01:51:59.069 --> 01:51:59.079 align:start position:0%
there aren't any I can buy 151 rum I can
 
01:52:02.990 --> 01:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
buy Ever CLE 190 proof 95% essentially
 
01:52:06.629 --> 01:52:06.639 align:start position:0%
pure grain alcohol um you know some
 
01:52:09.430 --> 01:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
things can be left to the public to
 
01:52:11.990 --> 01:52:12.000 align:start position:0%
individuals to make judgments like they
 
01:52:15.550 --> 01:52:15.560 align:start position:0%
are with alcohol right now so you know
 
01:52:18.390 --> 01:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
just also in alcohol home brewing is
 
01:52:22.109 --> 01:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
allowed wine Mak is allowed hom growing
 
01:52:23.790 --> 01:52:23.800 align:start position:0%
should be allowed on those same lines
 
01:52:25.629 --> 01:52:25.639 align:start position:0%
and just finally I will tell you though
 
01:52:27.750 --> 01:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
yeah I understand people keep bringing
 
01:52:29.550 --> 01:52:29.560 align:start position:0%
up hom grow I will tell you that is an
 
01:52:31.310 --> 01:52:31.320 align:start position:0%
absolute deal breaker with this bill if
 
01:52:33.550 --> 01:52:33.560 align:start position:0%
it's in here we might as well just
 
01:52:34.950 --> 01:52:34.960 align:start position:0%
adjourn for the day and call it a day
 
01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
it's not it will never make it off the
 
01:52:38.910 --> 01:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
Finish Line yeah well it's a critical
 
01:52:41.669 --> 01:52:41.679 align:start position:0%
part of cutting the illicit market and
 
01:52:44.830 --> 01:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
it's also just a personal Liberty and we
 
01:52:47.709 --> 01:52:47.719 align:start position:0%
do already have HP 411 that passed the
 
01:52:49.870 --> 01:52:49.880 align:start position:0%
house overwhelmingly tabled in the
 
01:52:52.830 --> 01:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
Senate allowing medical hom grow maybe
 
01:52:54.669 --> 01:52:54.679 align:start position:0%
they go separately but I think it could
 
01:52:58.109 --> 01:52:58.119 align:start position:0%
be merged uh into this bill so just I I
 
01:52:59.870 --> 01:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
think it's a critical component other
 
01:53:02.030 --> 01:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
states everyone around us allows hom
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
grow um it doesn't undercut the market
 
01:53:09.990 --> 01:53:10.000 align:start position:0%
um and then I just uh finally um getting
 
01:53:12.229 --> 01:53:12.239 align:start position:0%
back to the point about conflicts of
 
01:53:14.430 --> 01:53:14.440 align:start position:0%
interest that the chief raise that was
 
01:53:16.669 --> 01:53:16.679 align:start position:0%
raised by uh your speaker from
 
01:53:20.229 --> 01:53:20.239 align:start position:0%
California last week um you know not
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
letting the Cannabis industry
 
01:53:25.310 --> 01:53:25.320 align:start position:0%
essentially set the regulations but the
 
01:53:25.320 --> 01:53:26.350 align:start position:0%
essentially set the regulations but the
way

01:53:26.350 --> 01:53:26.360 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
this franchise bill is being
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
constructed the commission is both the
 
01:53:37.589 --> 01:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
marketer and the regulator there's
 
01:53:41.390 --> 01:53:41.400 align:start position:0%
there's no separation of interests so
 
01:53:43.229 --> 01:53:43.239 align:start position:0%
they have an interest in maximizing
 
01:53:46.470 --> 01:53:46.480 align:start position:0%
sales as well as limiting public you
 
01:53:50.069 --> 01:53:50.079 align:start position:0%
know entrance limiting competition um
 
01:53:54.189 --> 01:53:54.199 align:start position:0%
and uh I do think there is a role for a
 
01:53:56.149 --> 01:53:56.159 align:start position:0%
cannabis Control Commission that can
 
01:53:59.350 --> 01:53:59.360 align:start position:0%
include Public Health that really is
 
01:54:02.510 --> 01:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
independent takes a big picture and has
 
01:54:05.270 --> 01:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
some Powers because the commission does
 
01:54:08.470 --> 01:54:08.480 align:start position:0%
have a vested interest um and you you
 
01:54:10.149 --> 01:54:10.159 align:start position:0%
can't really separate that with this
 
01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
model so uh those are just things I
 
01:54:15.109 --> 01:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
wanted to share with you oh on one thing
 
01:54:17.030 --> 01:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
you were talking about today in the bill
 
01:54:22.629 --> 01:54:22.639 align:start position:0%
language about uh the cultivation
 
01:54:26.390 --> 01:54:26.400 align:start position:0%
tiers based just it just says size it's
 
01:54:29.350 --> 01:54:29.360 align:start position:0%
really should be focused on the square
 
01:54:32.669 --> 01:54:32.679 align:start position:0%
footage of flowering space because
 
01:54:34.069 --> 01:54:34.079 align:start position:0%
there's so many different types of
 
01:54:37.229 --> 01:54:37.239 align:start position:0%
production models indoor hydroponic
 
01:54:42.069 --> 01:54:42.079 align:start position:0%
indoor in living soil outdoor uh all all
 
01:54:44.750 --> 01:54:44.760 align:start position:0%
different ways just the word size is not
 
01:54:47.149 --> 01:54:47.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient it's really how many square
 
01:54:51.910 --> 01:54:51.920 align:start position:0%
foot of flowering plants or the annual
 
01:54:54.430 --> 01:54:54.440 align:start position:0%
gross sales of the operation but
 
01:54:56.669 --> 01:54:56.679 align:start position:0%
something that's more Equitable than
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
just that word size so I just wanted to
 
01:55:01.790 --> 01:55:01.800 align:start position:0%
point that out and maybe that could be
 
01:55:04.270 --> 01:55:04.280 align:start position:0%
addressed in Ru making but you you've
 
01:55:07.470 --> 01:55:07.480 align:start position:0%
got to be um you know
 
01:55:09.589 --> 01:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
specific thank
 
01:55:14.870 --> 01:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:18.229 --> 01:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
questions good all right
 
01:55:21.149 --> 01:55:21.159 align:start position:0%
are so I for the rest of purposes today
 
01:55:22.950 --> 01:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
are there any representatives from the
 
01:55:22.960 --> 01:55:24.510 align:start position:0%
are there any representatives from the
atcs

01:55:24.510 --> 01:55:24.520 align:start position:0%
atcs
 
01:55:24.520 --> 01:55:28.910 align:start position:0%
atcs
here

01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:31.990 --> 01:55:32.000 align:start position:0%
in you can you can hand that up thank
 
01:55:35.589 --> 01:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
you and Michael Holtz here from DHHS do
 
01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:47.229 --> 01:55:47.239 align:start position:0%
up so I ju I just want to be clear again
 
01:55:49.310 --> 01:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
you know atc's have their own interest
 
01:55:52.229 --> 01:55:52.239 align:start position:0%
which is very valuable the state running
 
01:55:54.950 --> 01:55:54.960 align:start position:0%
the program has their own input which is
 
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
valuable I I often I don't want to
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
conate those interests and so I
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
understand that they are separate and I
 
01:56:03.030 --> 01:56:03.040 align:start position:0%
think that's important so I think we
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
should give them each due due course for
 
01:56:11.310 --> 01:56:11.320 align:start position:0%
input okay and the topic that I'm I'm I
 
01:56:14.310 --> 01:56:14.320 align:start position:0%
think I'm hoping that is addressed by
 
01:56:17.510 --> 01:56:17.520 align:start position:0%
three Witnesses is this idea of having
 
01:56:20.229 --> 01:56:20.239 align:start position:0%
two signs for one store I can't wrap my
 
01:56:21.470 --> 01:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
head around
 
01:56:24.629 --> 01:56:24.639 align:start position:0%
that no one's making any ATC join the
 
01:56:27.270 --> 01:56:27.280 align:start position:0%
retail Market if they choose to join the
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
retail Market the certain conditions
 
01:56:32.669 --> 01:56:32.679 align:start position:0%
that it's going to entail all right it's
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
done on a voluntary basis what I was
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
kind of getting at
 
01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
is if they're going to do that they they
 
01:56:42.470 --> 01:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
are giving up essentially their
 
01:56:44.550 --> 01:56:44.560 align:start position:0%
storefront that they have
 
01:56:47.470 --> 01:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
now they still have their product brand
 
01:56:50.830 --> 01:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
but rather than limit those seven atcs
 
01:56:53.310 --> 01:56:53.320 align:start position:0%
to selling just the therapeutic products
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why they can't
 
01:56:56.990 --> 01:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
distribute those to any franchisee you
 
01:56:58.750 --> 01:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
know it would still be the same you
 
01:57:00.470 --> 01:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
still need a therapeutic card but
 
01:57:02.589 --> 01:57:02.599 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why their branded
 
01:57:04.149 --> 01:57:04.159 align:start position:0%
product wouldn't be sold in other
 
01:57:07.069 --> 01:57:07.079 align:start position:0%
franchisees however I think we would
 
01:57:09.109 --> 01:57:09.119 align:start position:0%
limit going forward we're not going to
 
01:57:12.030 --> 01:57:12.040 align:start position:0%
allow more manufacturers of ATC great
 
01:57:13.870 --> 01:57:13.880 align:start position:0%
products that's kind of where I was
 
01:57:16.910 --> 01:57:16.920 align:start position:0%
going with this and I thought that kind
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
of gives it increases their distribution
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
potential but at the same time if they
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
don't want to give up their store from
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
they don't have to to join the retail
 
01:57:27.830 --> 01:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
Market I think is going to be difficult
 
01:57:29.589 --> 01:57:29.599 align:start position:0%
having both of those and I also thought
 
01:57:31.950 --> 01:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
some of the rules and how that's going
 
01:57:34.870 --> 01:57:34.880 align:start position:0%
to be implemented it's difficult to have
 
01:57:37.550 --> 01:57:37.560 align:start position:0%
rules made by one body expecting liquor
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
to enforce it it's going to be kind of a
 
01:57:41.709 --> 01:57:41.719 align:start position:0%
fine line so I
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
thought some of the ATC program would be
 
01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
re not eliminate but reassign under
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
liquor that's a much more confusing
 
01:57:50.149 --> 01:57:50.159 align:start position:0%
process than I just and sound that's
 
01:57:53.430 --> 01:57:53.440 align:start position:0%
kind of where I was at um any comment on
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
that any anything you want yeah and I
 
01:57:58.390 --> 01:57:58.400 align:start position:0%
and I would from my perspective um you
 
01:58:02.109 --> 01:58:02.119 align:start position:0%
know I that's one perspective um I also
 
01:58:03.750 --> 01:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important to think through
 
01:58:05.589 --> 01:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
this issue broader without having
 
01:58:06.870 --> 01:58:06.880 align:start position:0%
without sort of deciding the issue
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
before we've really heard all the
 
01:58:11.310 --> 01:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
perspective about it about collocation
 
01:58:13.510 --> 01:58:13.520 align:start position:0%
about the future of the program so I
 
01:58:14.910 --> 01:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
would like to hear sort of a broader
 
01:58:16.990 --> 01:58:17.000 align:start position:0%
perspective about that about what this
 
01:58:27.589 --> 01:58:27.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
forward thank you for the record my name
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
is Michael Holt I'm the administrator of
 
01:58:33.229 --> 01:58:33.239 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program within
 
01:58:34.470 --> 01:58:34.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
01:58:37.189 --> 01:58:37.199 align:start position:0%
Services thanks for the opportunity to
 
01:58:41.109 --> 01:58:41.119 align:start position:0%
readdress this question um from our
 
01:58:42.990 --> 01:58:43.000 align:start position:0%
perspective this is an important issue
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
that will take more than five minutes to
 
01:58:49.550 --> 01:58:49.560 align:start position:0%
fully explore and um and and digest um
 
01:58:51.750 --> 01:58:51.760 align:start position:0%
I'd like to start by saying the draft
 
01:58:52.910 --> 01:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
that has been
 
01:58:56.149 --> 01:58:56.159 align:start position:0%
circulated um is a workable model where
 
01:58:56.159 --> 01:58:56.790 align:start position:0%
circulated um is a workable model where
the

01:58:56.790 --> 01:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:00.790 --> 01:59:00.800 align:start position:0%
atc's um have a separate uh license type
 
01:59:04.030 --> 01:59:04.040 align:start position:0%
that is not the franchise type uh where
 
01:59:07.229 --> 01:59:07.239 align:start position:0%
there is essentially dual licensure um
 
01:59:10.310 --> 01:59:10.320 align:start position:0%
essentially requires uh cooperation and
 
01:59:11.990 --> 01:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
collaboration between the Department of
 
01:59:13.950 --> 01:59:13.960 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and the Liquor
 
01:59:17.470 --> 01:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
Commission um that allows a separation
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
of of
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
allows a dual regulatory structure this
 
01:59:24.069 --> 01:59:24.079 align:start position:0%
is a model that works in other states it
 
01:59:29.430 --> 01:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
is workable it is it may be a bit more
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
complex and complicated than doing away
 
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
with the therapeutic cannabis program in
 
01:59:38.910 --> 01:59:38.920 align:start position:0%
its entirety um so the draft so to
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
conclude the that introduction the draft
 
01:59:46.470 --> 01:59:46.480 align:start position:0%
as proposed is a workable model for
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
both the department the program the
 
01:59:53.550 --> 01:59:53.560 align:start position:0%
patients in the program and I believe
 
01:59:53.560 --> 01:59:54.470 align:start position:0%
patients in the program and I believe
the

01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:59:57.669 --> 01:59:57.679 align:start position:0%
atc's now we are at the mercy of the
 
02:00:00.109 --> 02:00:00.119 align:start position:0%
legislature and if the legislature
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
chooses to make decisions that undercut
 
02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.510 align:start position:0%
chooses to make decisions that undercut
the

02:00:04.510 --> 02:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:07.030 --> 02:00:07.040 align:start position:0%
program we we will have to live with
 
02:00:09.870 --> 02:00:09.880 align:start position:0%
those legislative decisions
 
02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
however without seeing in front of me
 
02:00:16.189 --> 02:00:16.199 align:start position:0%
language that you're proposing Senator
 
02:00:18.270 --> 02:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
abbis which is which is something
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
different which is not exactly clear to
 
02:00:22.390 --> 02:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
me on a on the page it's hard for me to
 
02:00:25.709 --> 02:00:25.719 align:start position:0%
comment on how workable or how uh at
 
02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:28.880 align:start position:0%
what risk that places the program so
 
02:00:31.990 --> 02:00:32.000 align:start position:0%
when I hear that the draft in front of
 
02:00:35.350 --> 02:00:35.360 align:start position:0%
us is not what you want me to comment on
 
02:00:37.350 --> 02:00:37.360 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm gonna have a hard time saying
 
02:00:39.950 --> 02:00:39.960 align:start position:0%
that that's a pro that's a problematic
 
02:00:42.910 --> 02:00:42.920 align:start position:0%
um uh proposal
 
02:00:46.550 --> 02:00:46.560 align:start position:0%
um I think I I don't remember uh I've
 
02:00:48.270 --> 02:00:48.280 align:start position:0%
been here at every every session I don't
 
02:00:50.189 --> 02:00:50.199 align:start position:0%
know what you have changed or have
 
02:00:52.830 --> 02:00:52.840 align:start position:0%
agreed to change the definition of for
 
02:00:55.870 --> 02:00:55.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail store um if the atcs
 
02:00:55.880 --> 02:00:57.550 align:start position:0%
cannabis retail store um if the atcs
become

02:00:57.550 --> 02:00:57.560 align:start position:0%
become
 
02:00:59.550 --> 02:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
franchises that's a different model than
 
02:01:02.709 --> 02:01:02.719 align:start position:0%
what's being presented on paper and so I
 
02:01:04.750 --> 02:01:04.760 align:start position:0%
would like to understand the model more
 
02:01:08.109 --> 02:01:08.119 align:start position:0%
so I can comment more but again the
 
02:01:09.990 --> 02:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
model presented on the draft is a
 
02:01:12.390 --> 02:01:12.400 align:start position:0%
workable model requires collaboration
 
02:01:15.149 --> 02:01:15.159 align:start position:0%
between two agencies requires a dual
 
02:01:17.390 --> 02:01:17.400 align:start position:0%
licensing structure which is entirely
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
workable to be worked out in rul making
 
02:01:21.270 --> 02:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
and in collaboration with the liquor
 
02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:23.709 align:start position:0%
and in collaboration with the liquor
department

02:01:23.709 --> 02:01:23.719 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:01:30.830 --> 02:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
comment um so my name is Brandon Pollock
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
I'm the uh chair of the board of tascal
 
02:01:38.589 --> 02:01:38.599 align:start position:0%
Wellness we operate in Dober Lebanon and
 
02:01:41.069 --> 02:01:41.079 align:start position:0%
Keen I also have experience operating in
 
02:01:42.870 --> 02:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
several other canis
 
02:01:45.189 --> 02:01:45.199 align:start position:0%
markets and my name is Keenan Blum I'm
 
02:01:48.350 --> 02:01:48.360 align:start position:0%
the CEO of Grant Leaf cannabis and thank
 
02:01:49.870 --> 02:01:49.880 align:start position:0%
you for all of your time here working on
 
02:01:51.870 --> 02:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
this and making good policy yep yeah we
 
02:01:53.510 --> 02:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate it so couple things just
 
02:01:56.109 --> 02:01:56.119 align:start position:0%
generally from our perspective first it
 
02:01:58.790 --> 02:01:58.800 align:start position:0%
is essential as drafted to remove the uh
 
02:02:00.430 --> 02:02:00.440 align:start position:0%
nonprofit requirement if we're going to
 
02:02:01.750 --> 02:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
be able to participate in the new
 
02:02:04.109 --> 02:02:04.119 align:start position:0%
program that would be a a really
 
02:02:05.990 --> 02:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
competitive diff disadvantage and no
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
real logic to maintain that um from our
 
02:02:13.109 --> 02:02:13.119 align:start position:0%
view serving both uh therapeutic
 
02:02:15.390 --> 02:02:15.400 align:start position:0%
patients and recreational customers in
 
02:02:19.270 --> 02:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
the same building is the simplest and
 
02:02:22.669 --> 02:02:22.679 align:start position:0%
best approach uh I operate stores in
 
02:02:24.750 --> 02:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts that have that model we've
 
02:02:26.189 --> 02:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
served literally millions of
 
02:02:28.350 --> 02:02:28.360 align:start position:0%
recreational customers hundreds of
 
02:02:30.629 --> 02:02:30.639 align:start position:0%
thousands of patients there's no issues
 
02:02:32.510 --> 02:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
you have a separate counter or the
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
technology today allows us to simply
 
02:02:37.350 --> 02:02:37.360 align:start position:0%
just press a button on a computer and it
 
02:02:40.069 --> 02:02:40.079 align:start position:0%
can serve a patient versus a customer so
 
02:02:41.149 --> 02:02:41.159 align:start position:0%
that's really
 
02:02:44.990 --> 02:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
not not operationally challenging at all
 
02:02:46.750 --> 02:02:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh of course we'd like to keep our brand
 
02:02:49.830 --> 02:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
but we understand that could um POS some
 
02:02:53.310 --> 02:02:53.320 align:start position:0%
challenges for a franchisee so um I
 
02:02:56.950 --> 02:02:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:01.189 --> 02:03:01.199 align:start position:0%
that um you know we we do recommend for
 
02:03:04.189 --> 02:03:04.199 align:start position:0%
an ATC a licensing Model A license model
 
02:03:06.390 --> 02:03:06.400 align:start position:0%
some sort of expanded ATC license that
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
allows some certainty of Licensing
 
02:03:11.790 --> 02:03:11.800 align:start position:0%
moving forward uh on the manufacturing
 
02:03:13.669 --> 02:03:13.679 align:start position:0%
cultivation and Retail
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
side from a practical perspective the
 
02:03:17.390 --> 02:03:17.400 align:start position:0%
quicker that you can have some
 
02:03:20.069 --> 02:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
infrastructure become licensed
 
02:03:22.470 --> 02:03:22.480 align:start position:0%
uh the faster this program can launch
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
and the faster customers can go away
 
02:03:27.910 --> 02:03:27.920 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts and shop within their
 
02:03:27.920 --> 02:03:29.950 align:start position:0%
from Massachusetts and shop within their
own

02:03:29.950 --> 02:03:29.960 align:start position:0%
own
 
02:03:32.709 --> 02:03:32.719 align:start position:0%
state so I think that's you know from
 
02:03:34.430 --> 02:03:34.440 align:start position:0%
our view I think what we've heard here
 
02:03:36.350 --> 02:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
is all is all
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
workable um I think the the key though
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
is not having to have two separate
 
02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
physical locations I think that would
 
02:03:44.830 --> 02:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
really jeopardize serving patients
 
02:03:47.310 --> 02:03:47.320 align:start position:0%
because it would be very hard as that
 
02:03:49.430 --> 02:03:49.440 align:start position:0%
business declines in the future to to
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
keep the purely therapeutic store going
 
02:03:57.030 --> 02:03:57.040 align:start position:0%
do you think it's beneficial that if any
 
02:04:00.629 --> 02:04:00.639 align:start position:0%
franchise retail operation had the
 
02:04:04.069 --> 02:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
opportunity or at least option to uh
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
also sell you know therapeutic grade
 
02:04:10.069 --> 02:04:10.079 align:start position:0%
products to patients yeah I I think for
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
patients it would be with the caveat
 
02:04:14.990 --> 02:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
there has to be some extra educational
 
02:04:17.229 --> 02:04:17.239 align:start position:0%
materials and training provided to staff
 
02:04:19.709 --> 02:04:19.719 align:start position:0%
and um you know from the manufacturers
 
02:04:21.990 --> 02:04:22.000 align:start position:0%
to the stores some support so that you
 
02:04:23.229 --> 02:04:23.239 align:start position:0%
know there's a lot of discussion about 5
 
02:04:25.750 --> 02:04:25.760 align:start position:0%
milligrams you know as a dose if that is
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
indeed a public self safety issue then
 
02:04:30.069 --> 02:04:30.079 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure that therapeutic
 
02:04:32.830 --> 02:04:32.840 align:start position:0%
patients are being educated correct me
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
if I'm wrong though I don't believe
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
there's any requirement on training
 
02:04:40.669 --> 02:04:40.679 align:start position:0%
today am I correct right now to if
 
02:04:42.270 --> 02:04:42.280 align:start position:0%
you're going to work in a therapeutic
 
02:04:44.669 --> 02:04:44.679 align:start position:0%
store one of your there's no work you
 
02:04:46.750 --> 02:04:46.760 align:start position:0%
may have internal policies but there's
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
no rule or law that has any training
 
02:04:52.750 --> 02:04:52.760 align:start position:0%
required I I would I would hope that any
 
02:04:55.310 --> 02:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
product you sell you make sure the trans
 
02:04:56.709 --> 02:04:56.719 align:start position:0%
yeah there there's a variety of
 
02:04:59.310 --> 02:04:59.320 align:start position:0%
Education that we have to provide uh for
 
02:05:01.149 --> 02:05:01.159 align:start position:0%
example even physically we have to have
 
02:05:04.109 --> 02:05:04.119 align:start position:0%
a room in each store just for con
 
02:05:07.589 --> 02:05:07.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:10.639 align:start position:0%
patients okay so what about the the
 
02:05:12.870 --> 02:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
employees in inside the facility are
 
02:05:14.990 --> 02:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
they required any type of
 
02:05:17.069 --> 02:05:17.079 align:start position:0%
training right now under present Ru
 
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
making yeah I can let Mike I guess
 
02:05:20.430 --> 02:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
answer the rules I know we have policies
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
question the department requires the
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
atcs to provide initial and annual
 
02:05:36.350 --> 02:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
training to their
 
02:05:39.669 --> 02:05:39.679 align:start position:0%
employees we do not prescribe the type
 
02:05:42.270 --> 02:05:42.280 align:start position:0%
of training or the courses that must be
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
taken but we require ongoing annual
 
02:05:47.750 --> 02:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
training that is related to their job it
 
02:05:49.950 --> 02:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
is up to the ATC to choose what is
 
02:05:52.390 --> 02:05:52.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their employees to be
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
trained on how do you know an at how
 
02:05:57.069 --> 02:05:57.079 align:start position:0%
would you know that an ATC is complying
 
02:06:00.430 --> 02:06:00.440 align:start position:0%
with that we inspect the atcs for all of
 
02:06:02.310 --> 02:06:02.320 align:start position:0%
our administrative rules our
 
02:06:04.669 --> 02:06:04.679 align:start position:0%
administrative rules require training so
 
02:06:06.750 --> 02:06:06.760 align:start position:0%
during our inspections we go in and look
 
02:06:09.510 --> 02:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
at Personnel files uh we require
 
02:06:12.030 --> 02:06:12.040 align:start position:0%
documentation of training to be in uh in
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
those Personnel files but is there
 
02:06:15.790 --> 02:06:15.800 align:start position:0%
anything specific to what that training
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
has to be it needs to be job appropriate
 
02:06:20.629 --> 02:06:20.639 align:start position:0%
we're not we we trying to not to not to
 
02:06:23.390 --> 02:06:23.400 align:start position:0%
over regulate the atc's the atcs know
 
02:06:25.790 --> 02:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
best what they need to be trained on in
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
terms of cannaboid profile talking with
 
02:06:32.709 --> 02:06:32.719 align:start position:0%
patients uh we give them topics uh
 
02:06:35.030 --> 02:06:35.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality uh product safety
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
referral to substance use treatment um
 
02:06:39.870 --> 02:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
uh adverse side effects we give them
 
02:06:41.950 --> 02:06:41.960 align:start position:0%
topics that they have to they have to be
 
02:06:44.470 --> 02:06:44.480 align:start position:0%
trained on
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
um and that training needs to be job
 
02:06:54.030 --> 02:06:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.109 --> 02:06:57.119 align:start position:0%
overregulation cultivating cannabis they
 
02:06:59.709 --> 02:06:59.719 align:start position:0%
know what their their uh their employees
 
02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
need well I understand they have an
 
02:07:03.510 --> 02:07:03.520 align:start position:0%
interest from just a pure liability
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
perspective to train their employees
 
02:07:07.950 --> 02:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
without any rule or law necessary I get
 
02:07:10.910 --> 02:07:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm just saying right now if we
 
02:07:13.549 --> 02:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
were to right now what is the way you're
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
going to enforce that rule saying that
 
02:07:16.750 --> 02:07:16.760 align:start position:0%
they have to be trained you're saying
 
02:07:19.149 --> 02:07:19.159 align:start position:0%
you look at the Personnel files but I'm
 
02:07:21.910 --> 02:07:21.920 align:start position:0%
just asking what is that it says oh this
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
person did training does it even say
 
02:07:26.270 --> 02:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
specifically what they were trained on
 
02:07:27.709 --> 02:07:27.719 align:start position:0%
did they were they even paying attention
 
02:07:29.709 --> 02:07:29.719 align:start position:0%
during the video that was play I mean we
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
do not we're not part of the training so
 
02:07:33.030 --> 02:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
I can't tell you if people are falling
 
02:07:34.990 --> 02:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
asleep during the training or not um
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
that's not part of the documentation the
 
02:07:39.069 --> 02:07:39.079 align:start position:0%
documentation includes the name of the
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
person being trained the name of the
 
02:07:42.229 --> 02:07:42.239 align:start position:0%
trainer the topic of the training the
 
02:07:43.629 --> 02:07:43.639 align:start position:0%
date of the training and that
 
02:07:46.510 --> 02:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
documentation is in the personnel file I
 
02:07:48.669 --> 02:07:48.679 align:start position:0%
mean what I'm saying is that we don't
 
02:07:51.229 --> 02:07:51.239 align:start position:0%
prescribe the topics we don't prescribe
 
02:07:54.069 --> 02:07:54.079 align:start position:0%
the the the the format of the training
 
02:07:57.109 --> 02:07:57.119 align:start position:0%
uh we require the atcs to train all of
 
02:07:59.549 --> 02:07:59.559 align:start position:0%
their employees initially and ongoing in
 
02:08:02.030 --> 02:08:02.040 align:start position:0%
job appropriate topics
 
02:08:04.870 --> 02:08:04.880 align:start position:0%
I I I think we're I think the issues
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here are the I
 
02:08:08.430 --> 02:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
think we're mixing two issues about the
 
02:08:11.910 --> 02:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
education that ATC technicians Patient
 
02:08:14.310 --> 02:08:14.320 align:start position:0%
Service Associates provide to the
 
02:08:16.310 --> 02:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
patients versus the training that the
 
02:08:18.470 --> 02:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
atcs provide I think there's a little
 
02:08:20.750 --> 02:08:20.760 align:start position:0%
mingling of of these two topics and I'm
 
02:08:22.549 --> 02:08:22.559 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to tease them out by
 
02:08:25.549 --> 02:08:25.559 align:start position:0%
answering your very specific
 
02:08:28.629 --> 02:08:28.639 align:start position:0%
questions and I apologize if I'm not
 
02:08:30.310 --> 02:08:30.320 align:start position:0%
giving you the answer that you're
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
looking for I'm just trying to inquire
 
02:08:34.910 --> 02:08:34.920 align:start position:0%
about how that's would ever be enforced
 
02:08:37.310 --> 02:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
because my biggest concern is is having
 
02:08:39.510 --> 02:08:39.520 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission take over the
 
02:08:41.589 --> 02:08:41.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement side of this where there's I
 
02:08:43.589 --> 02:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
come across several rules that I feel
 
02:08:47.189 --> 02:08:47.199 align:start position:0%
are very difficult to ever enforce on
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
any on any level so I try to get to the
 
02:08:51.109 --> 02:08:51.119 align:start position:0%
bottom of whether they can even be
 
02:08:53.390 --> 02:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
enforced they sound good on paper but
 
02:08:55.470 --> 02:08:55.480 align:start position:0%
then when it comes to the reality of
 
02:08:58.350 --> 02:08:58.360 align:start position:0%
that and then my my bigger concern is if
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
you have an ATC rules and laws you know
 
02:09:04.109 --> 02:09:04.119 align:start position:0%
that are I would say virtually
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
impossible to enforce mixing that with
 
02:09:08.549 --> 02:09:08.559 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire franchise brand could
 
02:09:10.390 --> 02:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
be problematic because that would then
 
02:09:13.270 --> 02:09:13.280 align:start position:0%
be a negative on all I'm just explaining
 
02:09:15.950 --> 02:09:15.960 align:start position:0%
the concept the problem is that's why
 
02:09:17.589 --> 02:09:17.599 align:start position:0%
I'm asking how these would be enforced
 
02:09:19.069 --> 02:09:19.079 align:start position:0%
we might disagree on the ability to
 
02:09:20.750 --> 02:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
enforce that I mean we we do enforce it
 
02:09:22.669 --> 02:09:22.679 align:start position:0%
in the way we enforce it and that is
 
02:09:24.589 --> 02:09:24.599 align:start position:0%
they're required to have X hours of
 
02:09:26.669 --> 02:09:26.679 align:start position:0%
annual training and initial training the
 
02:09:28.709 --> 02:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
atcs need to document that training we
 
02:09:30.750 --> 02:09:30.760 align:start position:0%
go in and make sure that every single
 
02:09:33.470 --> 02:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
employee in the ATC has a doc has
 
02:09:36.109 --> 02:09:36.119 align:start position:0%
documented training it's it's not hard
 
02:09:39.030 --> 02:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
to enforce it's it's rather it's rather
 
02:09:41.149 --> 02:09:41.159 align:start position:0%
straightforward so I guess my question
 
02:09:44.629 --> 02:09:44.639 align:start position:0%
now for the atcs is if we were not have
 
02:09:47.990 --> 02:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
the the Dual license anymore in this one
 
02:09:49.830 --> 02:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
every franchise you essentially could
 
02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:51.510 align:start position:0%
every franchise you essentially could
sell

02:09:51.510 --> 02:09:51.520 align:start position:0%
sell
 
02:09:54.669 --> 02:09:54.679 align:start position:0%
both a working model or business model
 
02:09:57.430 --> 02:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
how how would that
 
02:10:00.830 --> 02:10:00.840 align:start position:0%
work I think um you'd want to require
 
02:10:03.790 --> 02:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
first of all uh educational materials at
 
02:10:05.950 --> 02:10:05.960 align:start position:0%
all the franchise stores that's easy to
 
02:10:07.750 --> 02:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
verify that's very common in other
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
markets um we provide that in New
 
02:10:12.030 --> 02:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire as well so there's pamphlets
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
that therapeutic patients get they it
 
02:10:17.589 --> 02:10:17.599 align:start position:0%
includes uh a little log that they can
 
02:10:19.589 --> 02:10:19.599 align:start position:0%
track their use and how it may affect
 
02:10:21.709 --> 02:10:21.719 align:start position:0%
them it includes information on misuse
 
02:10:25.109 --> 02:10:25.119 align:start position:0%
of cannabis safe use different dosing
 
02:10:28.549 --> 02:10:28.559 align:start position:0%
strategies um so requiring educational
 
02:10:28.559 --> 02:10:30.390 align:start position:0%
strategies um so requiring educational
materials

02:10:30.390 --> 02:10:30.400 align:start position:0%
materials
 
02:10:33.189 --> 02:10:33.199 align:start position:0%
and you know I think that it's good to
 
02:10:36.030 --> 02:10:36.040 align:start position:0%
train certain staff on therapeutic
 
02:10:38.629 --> 02:10:38.639 align:start position:0%
cannabis that's up to the you know
 
02:10:40.149 --> 02:10:40.159 align:start position:0%
committee here to decide whether that's
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
mandated or not but I think some sort of
 
02:10:45.910 --> 02:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
discussion about
 
02:10:48.990 --> 02:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
having staff that interact with patients
 
02:10:50.669 --> 02:10:50.679 align:start position:0%
have a higher level of training is not a
 
02:10:54.229 --> 02:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
bad idea and last question is there any
 
02:10:56.950 --> 02:10:56.960 align:start position:0%
other thought on having this guess the
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
regulatory side and the W making side
 
02:11:01.189 --> 02:11:01.199 align:start position:0%
not be eliminated for therapeutic
 
02:11:02.910 --> 02:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
purposes I'm just talking you take it
 
02:11:04.910 --> 02:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
from DHHS and it kind of falls under the
 
02:11:07.149 --> 02:11:07.159 align:start position:0%
liquor side kind of having
 
02:11:10.589 --> 02:11:10.599 align:start position:0%
one I feel like the they're going to be
 
02:11:11.990 --> 02:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
pass with enforcing some of these
 
02:11:13.669 --> 02:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
Provisions maybe they should be involved
 
02:11:15.430 --> 02:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
more in the ru making
 
02:11:17.589 --> 02:11:17.599 align:start position:0%
process is there any comment on that
 
02:11:20.350 --> 02:11:20.360 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean our our comment is we can
 
02:11:23.589 --> 02:11:23.599 align:start position:0%
work through any um regulatory Authority
 
02:11:25.990 --> 02:11:26.000 align:start position:0%
we're not we don't have an opinion of
 
02:11:27.549 --> 02:11:27.559 align:start position:0%
who it should be or whether it's one or
 
02:11:30.350 --> 02:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
two it's uh as long as the rules do not
 
02:11:32.669 --> 02:11:32.679 align:start position:0%
contradict each other that's the key and
 
02:11:34.669 --> 02:11:34.679 align:start position:0%
one of the rationals is to avoid
 
02:11:36.870 --> 02:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
contradicting rules is having if
 
02:11:38.549 --> 02:11:38.559 align:start position:0%
Liquor's going to be liquor commissions
 
02:11:40.390 --> 02:11:40.400 align:start position:0%
being involved in the make rule making
 
02:11:44.030 --> 02:11:44.040 align:start position:0%
for recreation perhaps going forward
 
02:11:45.990 --> 02:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
some of the therapeutic rules would be
 
02:11:47.069 --> 02:11:47.079 align:start position:0%
helpful if they were involved in that
 
02:11:48.990 --> 02:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
process that's just where I'm going with
 
02:11:51.549 --> 02:11:51.559 align:start position:0%
Senator Whitley yeah on that issue I I
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
think that DHHS has a because the goals
 
02:11:56.510 --> 02:11:56.520 align:start position:0%
of the program are different right this
 
02:11:58.750 --> 02:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
is a therapeutic canesas program we have
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
patients to keep in mind and the
 
02:12:04.310 --> 02:12:04.320 align:start position:0%
regulation is important from that
 
02:12:06.109 --> 02:12:06.119 align:start position:0%
perspective from DHHS because that's
 
02:12:07.549 --> 02:12:07.559 align:start position:0%
their mission right is the health and
 
02:12:10.990 --> 02:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
wellness of our citizens so I think it's
 
02:12:13.830 --> 02:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
very possible to have this co- uh
 
02:12:16.709 --> 02:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
regulation I I do think if we're looking
 
02:12:18.709 --> 02:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
at advertising la
 
02:12:21.669 --> 02:12:21.679 align:start position:0%
packaging you know those kind of things
 
02:12:24.830 --> 02:12:24.840 align:start position:0%
I agree we need consistency but I very
 
02:12:26.669 --> 02:12:26.679 align:start position:0%
much think that DHHS and Liquor
 
02:12:29.430 --> 02:12:29.440 align:start position:0%
Commission are very much able to to work
 
02:12:32.109 --> 02:12:32.119 align:start position:0%
together um because there are just we
 
02:12:33.589 --> 02:12:33.599 align:start position:0%
have to think about the purposes of the
 
02:12:35.870 --> 02:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
program and they are different and they
 
02:12:37.830 --> 02:12:37.840 align:start position:0%
have their own value and so we don't
 
02:12:40.629 --> 02:12:40.639 align:start position:0%
want to say to our patients that you
 
02:12:42.910 --> 02:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
know their involvement in that program
 
02:12:45.669 --> 02:12:45.679 align:start position:0%
is not valuable uh and because they need
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
it for health reasons so I think
 
02:12:50.709 --> 02:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
co-regulation is very possible but I do
 
02:12:53.270 --> 02:12:53.280 align:start position:0%
think that we need some continuity for
 
02:12:55.709 --> 02:12:55.719 align:start position:0%
advertising and packaging and labeling
 
02:12:57.430 --> 02:12:57.440 align:start position:0%
requirements but I think that is very
 
02:13:00.030 --> 02:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
doable so let's say there is a
 
02:13:02.510 --> 02:13:02.520 align:start position:0%
inconsistency who who own who owns the
 
02:13:07.189 --> 02:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
day the DHHS rule or the r b recogition
 
02:13:09.790 --> 02:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
it depends on the on the program right
 
02:13:13.310 --> 02:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
if it's a franchise e violation it would
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
be with a Liquor Commission if it's an
 
02:13:18.910 --> 02:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
ATC violation it would be with DHHS
 
02:13:20.910 --> 02:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
commission is the one I I I have a a
 
02:13:22.709 --> 02:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
very specific question on this issue but
 
02:13:25.229 --> 02:13:25.239 align:start position:0%
it's important and this is the the the
 
02:13:29.669 --> 02:13:29.679 align:start position:0%
discussion of five milligram versus
 
02:13:32.750 --> 02:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
unlimited and that the question is set
 
02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
that because of the medical because of
 
02:13:37.549 --> 02:13:37.559 align:start position:0%
the atc's what it
 
02:13:39.910 --> 02:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
does we don't have the
 
02:13:43.470 --> 02:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
limits but you can't have in the same
 
02:13:46.109 --> 02:13:46.119 align:start position:0%
location this other requirement that
 
02:13:47.549 --> 02:13:47.559 align:start position:0%
does have a limit but they're saying
 
02:13:48.950 --> 02:13:48.960 align:start position:0%
that they do do have that in other
 
02:13:50.910 --> 02:13:50.920 align:start position:0%
states I understand that but those other
 
02:13:53.189 --> 02:13:53.199 align:start position:0%
states don't have the franchise model
 
02:13:54.589 --> 02:13:54.599 align:start position:0%
those other states are they're
 
02:13:56.669 --> 02:13:56.679 align:start position:0%
independent they're they're that's
 
02:13:58.350 --> 02:13:58.360 align:start position:0%
that's the model that you the Senate
 
02:14:00.790 --> 02:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
killed okay and it's unfair Market
 
02:14:03.109 --> 02:14:03.119 align:start position:0%
advantage to allow some of these retail
 
02:14:06.229 --> 02:14:06.239 align:start position:0%
stores exactly franchisees to have that
 
02:14:08.629 --> 02:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
not right some not so what I'm hearing
 
02:14:11.750 --> 02:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
is from from Mike that if we allow the
 
02:14:15.669 --> 02:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
atcs to stand alone have their thing all
 
02:14:17.390 --> 02:14:17.400 align:start position:0%
they're asking for is to remove the
 
02:14:19.069 --> 02:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
nonprofit status they want to be
 
02:14:21.950 --> 02:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
for-profit but they continue to not want
 
02:14:25.310 --> 02:14:25.320 align:start position:0%
to have to pay a tax and they want to be
 
02:14:27.270 --> 02:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
able to go beyond the five
 
02:14:30.310 --> 02:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
milligrams so obviously that's a totally
 
02:14:33.149 --> 02:14:33.159 align:start position:0%
different model than if they want to be
 
02:14:35.629 --> 02:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
retail the retail you have just
 
02:14:38.149 --> 02:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
determined this five okay youve said
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
this five is Magic is an important
 
02:14:42.510 --> 02:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
number to you the whole point is you
 
02:14:44.830 --> 02:14:44.840 align:start position:0%
can't have anything more than five in
 
02:14:47.229 --> 02:14:47.239 align:start position:0%
that location that's why the two cannot
 
02:14:50.750 --> 02:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
mix the that if they want to have they
 
02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
want to sell recreational they need to
 
02:14:55.830 --> 02:14:55.840 align:start position:0%
open up a they apply for a franchisees
 
02:14:57.830 --> 02:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
get their agreement get their you know
 
02:15:00.549 --> 02:15:00.559 align:start position:0%
the get the r and then they they can pay
 
02:15:02.629 --> 02:15:02.639 align:start position:0%
the 15% and be limited to the 5
 
02:15:04.549 --> 02:15:04.559 align:start position:0%
milligrams can I just say Mr chair that
 
02:15:07.669 --> 02:15:07.679 align:start position:0%
we need to regain some control about how
 
02:15:09.229 --> 02:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
this commission is interacting with each
 
02:15:10.629 --> 02:15:10.639 align:start position:0%
other I think the doctor has had her
 
02:15:12.589 --> 02:15:12.599 align:start position:0%
hand up other had I think are you
 
02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:14.599 align:start position:0%
raising a point of order yes a point of
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
order we need to be more respectful of
 
02:15:18.549 --> 02:15:18.559 align:start position:0%
our process here and our other
 
02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:20.360 align:start position:0%
commission members and you know
 
02:15:21.790 --> 02:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
interrupting each other and letting each
 
02:15:24.149 --> 02:15:24.159 align:start position:0%
other finish and people that are raising
 
02:15:25.350 --> 02:15:25.360 align:start position:0%
their hands you stated your point of
 
02:15:27.830 --> 02:15:27.840 align:start position:0%
order I will call much tighter again
 
02:15:30.589 --> 02:15:30.599 align:start position:0%
like I I I and I apologize to the doctor
 
02:15:34.109 --> 02:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
if the do Dr Young Senator again like we
 
02:15:36.030 --> 02:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
need to be more respectful of letting
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
people finish their point and having
 
02:15:40.950 --> 02:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
people respond to that and and not
 
02:15:44.229 --> 02:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
interrupting each other so I would ask
 
02:15:46.549 --> 02:15:46.559 align:start position:0%
that the chair takes I apologize for
 
02:15:49.549 --> 02:15:49.559 align:start position:0%
that again please
 
02:15:52.189 --> 02:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
I I will remind the the representative
 
02:15:55.149 --> 02:15:55.159 align:start position:0%
who just got back to maner vam to not
 
02:15:56.430 --> 02:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
interrupt other
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
members I know he didn't mean it mean it
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
that way but I think it does it doesn't
 
02:16:02.709 --> 02:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
just apply to you representative just
 
02:16:04.149 --> 02:16:04.159 align:start position:0%
interrupted move it applies all
 
02:16:05.870 --> 02:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
committee MERS but you just interrupted
 
02:16:08.390 --> 02:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
me so if I'm G to hearing we're not
 
02:16:09.750 --> 02:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
going to interrupt anyone that includes
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
me all right and Dr Young me as well
 
02:16:16.709 --> 02:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
thank and he interrupted again I and Dr
 
02:16:16.719 --> 02:16:18.390 align:start position:0%
thank and he interrupted again I and Dr
jren

02:16:18.390 --> 02:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
jren
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm sure if I did offend you you
 
02:16:21.430 --> 02:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
would definitely let me know but if I do
 
02:16:24.109 --> 02:16:24.119 align:start position:0%
apologize um as a Collegiate rugby
 
02:16:26.589 --> 02:16:26.599 align:start position:0%
player I'm confident I can take you
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
down kidding of course um I'm gonna
 
02:16:30.990 --> 02:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
rewind a little bit because my comment
 
02:16:33.469 --> 02:16:33.479 align:start position:0%
was to something was said a while ago
 
02:16:35.270 --> 02:16:35.280 align:start position:0%
now but I I think as you're talking
 
02:16:36.990 --> 02:16:37.000 align:start position:0%
about a model that would have like all
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
franchise store have medical uh
 
02:16:40.429 --> 02:16:40.439 align:start position:0%
potentially have medical product
 
02:16:43.110 --> 02:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
available I just think that you know if
 
02:16:45.150 --> 02:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
that were the case that the education
 
02:16:46.549 --> 02:16:46.559 align:start position:0%
component is really important here
 
02:16:48.110 --> 02:16:48.120 align:start position:0%
especially if we have a potency limit of
 
02:16:50.750 --> 02:16:50.760 align:start position:0%
5 Mig for the recreational customer and
 
02:16:53.309 --> 02:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
none for the non-recreational customer
 
02:16:55.150 --> 02:16:55.160 align:start position:0%
um I think it's really important that
 
02:16:57.429 --> 02:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
they're educated because not all Edibles
 
02:16:58.669 --> 02:16:58.679 align:start position:0%
are the same and so if you have
 
02:17:00.750 --> 02:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
something that's 20 or 50 milligrams
 
02:17:02.429 --> 02:17:02.439 align:start position:0%
versus five we just need to make sure
 
02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.200 align:start position:0%
that the patients understand that that's
 
02:17:06.629 --> 02:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
different um and so I just think like
 
02:17:09.110 --> 02:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
making sure that that is absolutely
 
02:17:11.709 --> 02:17:11.719 align:start position:0%
essential if there is medical outside of
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:24.589 align:start position:0%
 
now

02:17:24.589 --> 02:17:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:27.389 --> 02:17:27.399 align:start position:0%
thank you everyone um I do believe that
 
02:17:29.549 --> 02:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
we can meet that requirement and and be
 
02:17:31.509 --> 02:17:31.519 align:start position:0%
able to provide Educational Services
 
02:17:33.629 --> 02:17:33.639 align:start position:0%
across the entire State I'd love to see
 
02:17:36.230 --> 02:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
greater patient access to these products
 
02:17:38.150 --> 02:17:38.160 align:start position:0%
on top of what we're trying to do here
 
02:17:41.790 --> 02:17:41.800 align:start position:0%
to legalize it for adults I well I
 
02:17:44.309 --> 02:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
personally provided over 500
 
02:17:46.230 --> 02:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
consultations each on average about an
 
02:17:47.950 --> 02:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
hour for the first year years in
 
02:17:50.990 --> 02:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
business we have found that consumers in
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
general are becoming more aware of the
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
standards the general Community is more
 
02:17:59.070 --> 02:17:59.080 align:start position:0%
aware of safety with cannabis
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
consumption and understanding of edible
 
02:18:03.110 --> 02:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
dosage things like that we've also
 
02:18:05.429 --> 02:18:05.439 align:start position:0%
dialed in our documentation and the
 
02:18:07.150 --> 02:18:07.160 align:start position:0%
things we've provided through thousands
 
02:18:09.870 --> 02:18:09.880 align:start position:0%
and thousands of hours of Labor in order
 
02:18:12.309 --> 02:18:12.319 align:start position:0%
to make sure that they're clear concise
 
02:18:13.950 --> 02:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
and able to be understood by all
 
02:18:16.309 --> 02:18:16.319 align:start position:0%
individuals who are able to read at
 
02:18:18.830 --> 02:18:18.840 align:start position:0%
above a third grade level was our Target
 
02:18:20.910 --> 02:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
we could provide those throughout as
 
02:18:22.669 --> 02:18:22.679 align:start position:0%
well as additional services that can be
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
reached and accessed so that any store
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
that was providing those products in the
 
02:18:31.870 --> 02:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
state is able to direct people or
 
02:18:34.030 --> 02:18:34.040 align:start position:0%
provide them directly basic services and
 
02:18:36.030 --> 02:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
allow them to access greater Services as
 
02:18:38.709 --> 02:18:38.719 align:start position:0%
needed to ensure safety um that's been a
 
02:18:41.030 --> 02:18:41.040 align:start position:0%
priority for us and now at this point
 
02:18:43.230 --> 02:18:43.240 align:start position:0%
with those with those documents with the
 
02:18:45.709 --> 02:18:45.719 align:start position:0%
ability to do that we're now not doing
 
02:18:48.830 --> 02:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
you know six we had we had three
 
02:18:50.950 --> 02:18:50.960 align:start position:0%
full-time patient Educators we're down
 
02:18:52.790 --> 02:18:52.800 align:start position:0%
to one and a half a full-timer and a
 
02:18:55.469 --> 02:18:55.479 align:start position:0%
part-timer and we are no longer doing
 
02:18:58.910 --> 02:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
you know 10 15 20 consults a day many of
 
02:19:01.270 --> 02:19:01.280 align:start position:0%
the patients are more educated so I do
 
02:19:03.469 --> 02:19:03.479 align:start position:0%
not believe quite the same level is
 
02:19:05.110 --> 02:19:05.120 align:start position:0%
required that was before and that we
 
02:19:07.070 --> 02:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
have much more basis to provide those
 
02:19:10.230 --> 02:19:10.240 align:start position:0%
services without issue now I was under
 
02:19:12.790 --> 02:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
the impression that it's been consistent
 
02:19:15.150 --> 02:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
from state to state when they allow a
 
02:19:17.709 --> 02:19:17.719 align:start position:0%
recreational program the number of
 
02:19:22.429 --> 02:19:22.439 align:start position:0%
therapeutic patients will drop it just
 
02:19:23.709 --> 02:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
we can get into the reasons why but it
 
02:19:27.110 --> 02:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
just will drop so one of the I guess the
 
02:19:30.070 --> 02:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
issues that we need to understand is I
 
02:19:31.910 --> 02:19:31.920 align:start position:0%
understand the experience in the
 
02:19:33.990 --> 02:19:34.000 align:start position:0%
industry may make you an ideal candidate
 
02:19:35.589 --> 02:19:35.599 align:start position:0%
for a
 
02:19:39.709 --> 02:19:39.719 align:start position:0%
um to be a franchisee however we're not
 
02:19:41.309 --> 02:19:41.319 align:start position:0%
nothing's going to be guaranteed here
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to explain to you is if
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
you're going to join the retail
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:48.750 align:start position:0%
you're going to join the retail
Market

02:19:48.750 --> 02:19:48.760 align:start position:0%
Market
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
I think having we got to keep it fair
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
for the other
 
02:19:53.670 --> 02:19:53.680 align:start position:0%
franchisees that's that's the problem it
 
02:19:55.590 --> 02:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
goes both ways you guys already are
 
02:19:57.510 --> 02:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
operating a
 
02:20:00.870 --> 02:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
your therapeutic centers now so I I'm
 
02:20:02.270 --> 02:20:02.280 align:start position:0%
trying to kind of merge those into one
 
02:20:03.950 --> 02:20:03.960 align:start position:0%
not having an exception for here an
 
02:20:06.270 --> 02:20:06.280 align:start position:0%
exception for there it's get confusing
 
02:20:07.950 --> 02:20:07.960 align:start position:0%
going from store to store especially
 
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
when you
 
02:20:12.309 --> 02:20:12.319 align:start position:0%
have enforcement on one end not involved
 
02:20:13.790 --> 02:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
in that not involved in some of the rul
 
02:20:16.790 --> 02:20:16.800 align:start position:0%
making process it seems to be a lot of
 
02:20:18.670 --> 02:20:18.680 align:start position:0%
different angles Now by combining them
 
02:20:20.150 --> 02:20:20.160 align:start position:0%
and I'm just saying if every store was
 
02:20:22.750 --> 02:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
on equal footing with that I think
 
02:20:24.309 --> 02:20:24.319 align:start position:0%
that's beneficial to patients where I
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
live in Salem where's the closest
 
02:20:29.710 --> 02:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
therapeutic location marac am I am I
 
02:20:32.030 --> 02:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
correct when I say that that that's a
 
02:20:34.670 --> 02:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
pretty long drive if there's a retail
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
store in sale them they're going to just
 
02:20:38.150 --> 02:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
most people are just going to go there
 
02:20:40.309 --> 02:20:40.319 align:start position:0%
to buy right we see that most of our
 
02:20:43.110 --> 02:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
customers are centered right around the
 
02:20:46.070 --> 02:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
atc's so while patients are registered
 
02:20:47.710 --> 02:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
throughout the state most most of the
 
02:20:50.070 --> 02:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
actual people that visit our stores
 
02:20:52.950 --> 02:20:52.960 align:start position:0%
actually live fairly close on average um
 
02:20:54.750 --> 02:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that's representative of a
 
02:20:56.990 --> 02:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
lack of access throughout the state to
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
the medical program so potentially by
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
allowing any franchise to do
 
02:21:04.590 --> 02:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
that this to be able to sell a
 
02:21:06.510 --> 02:21:06.520 align:start position:0%
therapeutic product that would maybe
 
02:21:08.150 --> 02:21:08.160 align:start position:0%
increase the amount of members in that
 
02:21:09.990 --> 02:21:10.000 align:start position:0%
program but
 
02:21:12.510 --> 02:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
if the franchise or needs to be on board
 
02:21:14.230 --> 02:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
with that and that's why I'm trying to
 
02:21:15.790 --> 02:21:15.800 align:start position:0%
kind of put the therapeutic program
 
02:21:17.309 --> 02:21:17.319 align:start position:0%
under liquor is that if they're going to
 
02:21:20.309 --> 02:21:20.319 align:start position:0%
ow that type of partnership with
 
02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
their with their franchises I feel like
 
02:21:24.190 --> 02:21:24.200 align:start position:0%
they want they're going to want to have
 
02:21:25.670 --> 02:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
more involvement in the process that's
 
02:21:28.270 --> 02:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
no disrespect to DHHS I'm just saying
 
02:21:29.550 --> 02:21:29.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at from a business
 
02:21:31.110 --> 02:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
perspective why would they want to have
 
02:21:33.270 --> 02:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
that Partnership if they have no real
 
02:21:36.349 --> 02:21:36.359 align:start position:0%
control over what's happening there does
 
02:21:38.110 --> 02:21:38.120 align:start position:0%
that make sense they don't have a hand
 
02:21:39.950 --> 02:21:39.960 align:start position:0%
on the wheel but then their entire model
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
is resting on it so I don't I don't see
 
02:21:44.990 --> 02:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
another way to practically do it do it m
 
02:21:50.950 --> 02:21:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:52.830 --> 02:21:52.840 align:start position:0%
turn away so obviously this is a big
 
02:21:55.070 --> 02:21:55.080 align:start position:0%
topic um we probably need to continue to
 
02:21:56.790 --> 02:21:56.800 align:start position:0%
next meeting and make sure we have this
 
02:21:58.870 --> 02:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
conversation but as I understand it
 
02:22:01.630 --> 02:22:01.640 align:start position:0%
again I'm trying to think of in a
 
02:22:04.190 --> 02:22:04.200 align:start position:0%
regulatory model which pieces would fall
 
02:22:06.030 --> 02:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
under liquor and which pieces would stay
 
02:22:08.630 --> 02:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
with DHHS I mean operationally it makes
 
02:22:10.870 --> 02:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
sense that a given physical location is
 
02:22:13.230 --> 02:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
regulated by a single entity so makes
 
02:22:16.150 --> 02:22:16.160 align:start position:0%
sense that liquor controls marketing and
 
02:22:17.910 --> 02:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
and and messaging and some of that that
 
02:22:20.830 --> 02:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
happens with a given entity for a store
 
02:22:23.190 --> 02:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
however I could also see where when it
 
02:22:26.590 --> 02:22:26.600 align:start position:0%
comes to the manufacturing side um there
 
02:22:30.030 --> 02:22:30.040 align:start position:0%
might be some dhh input as to potency
 
02:22:32.150 --> 02:22:32.160 align:start position:0%
and and requirements for the therapeutic
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
grade products that would be offered in
 
02:22:36.750 --> 02:22:36.760 align:start position:0%
those stores but I don't think it's a
 
02:22:38.990 --> 02:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
stretch to say that a single retail
 
02:22:42.150 --> 02:22:42.160 align:start position:0%
store could have both the and this is a
 
02:22:44.389 --> 02:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
change for me so because I was a I was
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
really a dual store I guy but I'm now
 
02:22:49.230 --> 02:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
falling underneath the idea of a a
 
02:22:52.190 --> 02:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
unistore a single store model um that
 
02:22:54.309 --> 02:22:54.319 align:start position:0%
allows for the sale of the medicinal
 
02:22:56.870 --> 02:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
product the therapeutic product um in
 
02:22:59.590 --> 02:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
the in the retail store provided that a
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
the medicinal product is regulated for
 
02:23:03.670 --> 02:23:03.680 align:start position:0%
therapeutic purposes which means the
 
02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
manufacturing side has to fall under
 
02:23:08.110 --> 02:23:08.120 align:start position:0%
DHHS and what what are allowed limits
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
and the retail side of the store is
 
02:23:12.630 --> 02:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
governed but the physical location
 
02:23:14.710 --> 02:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
operations component has to be regul by
 
02:23:17.190 --> 02:23:17.200 align:start position:0%
a single entity that's my concern so I I
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
think it belongs in liquor for the
 
02:23:21.429 --> 02:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
operational aspect of this product um
 
02:23:23.269 --> 02:23:23.279 align:start position:0%
technology-wise it's no big deal
 
02:23:25.550 --> 02:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
depending on what we decide on taxation
 
02:23:28.870 --> 02:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
whether a therapeutic product is is
 
02:23:30.550 --> 02:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
continued part of the gross and subject
 
02:23:32.790 --> 02:23:32.800 align:start position:0%
to the 15% or not considered part of the
 
02:23:34.389 --> 02:23:34.399 align:start position:0%
gross that's a checkbox and a point of
 
02:23:37.190 --> 02:23:37.200 align:start position:0%
sales system that's not hard to do um we
 
02:23:39.269 --> 02:23:39.279 align:start position:0%
do it right now in in our ret in our
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
restaurants there are some products that
 
02:23:42.150 --> 02:23:42.160 align:start position:0%
are tax and some products that aren't
 
02:23:44.030 --> 02:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
tax in a restaurant and they're able to
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
identify that within their Point of
 
02:23:47.349 --> 02:23:47.359 align:start position:0%
Sales system so that's not probably itic
 
02:23:49.469 --> 02:23:49.479 align:start position:0%
but I just say I think bigger topic we
 
02:23:50.830 --> 02:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
probably need to continue this at
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
another meeting with that understanding
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
and maybe someone putting together an
 
02:23:56.670 --> 02:23:56.680 align:start position:0%
outline of what they propos for those
 
02:23:58.230 --> 02:23:58.240 align:start position:0%
that want to keep their putic stores
 
02:23:59.790 --> 02:23:59.800 align:start position:0%
completely separated should probably
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
present what that looks like as it
 
02:24:04.030 --> 02:24:04.040 align:start position:0%
relates to retail and those that want to
 
02:24:08.990 --> 02:24:09.000 align:start position:0%
commingle retail and um and and
 
02:24:11.230 --> 02:24:11.240 align:start position:0%
therapeutic in the same store what that
 
02:24:13.150 --> 02:24:13.160 align:start position:0%
model looks like where's the bifurcation
 
02:24:15.950 --> 02:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
happen regulations um as it lays out
 
02:24:17.550 --> 02:24:17.560 align:start position:0%
it's probably be a best way for us to
 
02:24:18.990 --> 02:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
understand how this
 
02:24:21.750 --> 02:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
looks and just to clarify the point I
 
02:24:23.830 --> 02:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
was making too you would need to have a
 
02:24:25.710 --> 02:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
if there's a therapeutic thade product
 
02:24:27.150 --> 02:24:27.160 align:start position:0%
you still need a therapeutic card I
 
02:24:30.309 --> 02:24:30.319 align:start position:0%
think that's where thhs would still
 
02:24:31.670 --> 02:24:31.680 align:start position:0%
provide the most value is when it comes
 
02:24:34.429 --> 02:24:34.439 align:start position:0%
to issuing the card I think that's
 
02:24:37.349 --> 02:24:37.359 align:start position:0%
that's important but when it comes to
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
the rest of the enforceability side
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
that's where I shift it
 
02:24:44.550 --> 02:24:44.560 align:start position:0%
over yeah I mean you know you you go to
 
02:24:47.710 --> 02:24:47.720 align:start position:0%
CVS you have uh over the count drugs and
 
02:24:49.230 --> 02:24:49.240 align:start position:0%
not overthe counter drugs in the same
 
02:24:51.230 --> 02:24:51.240 align:start position:0%
store um and they're still governed by
 
02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:51.990 align:start position:0%
store um and they're still governed by
the

02:24:51.990 --> 02:24:52.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:24:55.630 --> 02:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
FDA um I think it totally makes sense to
 
02:24:58.830 --> 02:24:58.840 align:start position:0%
have um The Liquor Commission oversee
 
02:25:00.510 --> 02:25:00.520 align:start position:0%
all all of this stuff and we definitely
 
02:25:03.469 --> 02:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
have the ability to do it and I think by
 
02:25:05.269 --> 02:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
reassigning it there's a lot of
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
knowledge that would be reassigned you
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
know would help lior in you know getting
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
this program up and running they' be
 
02:25:13.750 --> 02:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
able to I might use the word Consulting
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
but they they bring some industry
 
02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
knowledge internally that would be
 
02:25:18.230 --> 02:25:18.240 align:start position:0%
helpful too
 
02:25:23.110 --> 02:25:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
this was jarif I can on one other
 
02:25:28.550 --> 02:25:28.560 align:start position:0%
different topic we move on from this one
 
02:25:30.269 --> 02:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
just real I just want to close the loop
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
Frank did his homework assignment he
 
02:25:33.710 --> 02:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
broaden the definition of Resident
 
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
everyone has it in front of you um on
 
02:25:38.070 --> 02:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
page five we have a definition in there
 
02:25:39.510 --> 02:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's different than the definition in
 
02:25:41.790 --> 02:25:41.800 align:start position:0%
statute my recommendation is just to
 
02:25:44.710 --> 02:25:44.720 align:start position:0%
strike this what's in the bill for a
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
definition and knowing that under the
 
02:25:49.670 --> 02:25:49.680 align:start position:0%
the chapter 21 statutory construction 21
 
02:25:52.590 --> 02:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
colon 6 has a definition and in all
 
02:25:54.510 --> 02:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
instances where it's not defined
 
02:25:56.349 --> 02:25:56.359 align:start position:0%
specifically it'll refer back to this
 
02:25:58.510 --> 02:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
anyway so I think we can just strike
 
02:26:02.110 --> 02:26:02.120 align:start position:0%
residents from the definition section I
 
02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:03.990 align:start position:0%
residents from the definition section I
would

02:26:03.990 --> 02:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
02:26:07.110 --> 02:26:07.120 align:start position:0%
agree or refer to page five well I was
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
going to refer to but again by default
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
it does it automatically so so just
 
02:26:15.110 --> 02:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
strike section 24 on page five where we
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
have a definition of resident and know
 
02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
that we already have a statutory
 
02:26:20.990 --> 02:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
definition of what a resident is under
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:26.510 --> 02:26:26.520 align:start position:0%
6 we're making the bill shorter inter
 
02:26:29.230 --> 02:26:29.240 align:start position:0%
read our next
 
02:26:32.510 --> 02:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
meeting it's a good
 
02:26:35.750 --> 02:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
question I I did uh have is the next
 
02:26:38.150 --> 02:26:38.160 align:start position:0%
meeting the 16th sorry I think so no I
 
02:26:39.630 --> 02:26:39.640 align:start position:0%
was just gonna say I do for the next
 
02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:41.520 align:start position:0%
meeting we reached out to the treasurer
 
02:26:42.670 --> 02:26:42.680 align:start position:0%
because there's a request of having a
 
02:26:44.950 --> 02:26:44.960 align:start position:0%
Treasurer come on to speak um and
 
02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
they're weren't available for today but
 
02:26:47.710 --> 02:26:47.720 align:start position:0%
they will be available for the next one
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
which I think is the 16th give me one
 
02:26:52.070 --> 02:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
second and I won't be here so we have
 
02:26:53.630 --> 02:26:53.640 align:start position:0%
the 16th what's our
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
other yeah 16th is the next meeting and
 
02:26:59.870 --> 02:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
after the 16th what's our next one I
 
02:27:01.429 --> 02:27:01.439 align:start position:0%
don't have the next one I don't have in
 
02:27:02.469 --> 02:27:02.479 align:start position:0%
front of
 
02:27:06.590 --> 02:27:06.600 align:start position:0%
me so we only have two meetings left um
 
02:27:09.910 --> 02:27:09.920 align:start position:0%
we have we have 12 17 Pages still to get
 
02:27:11.830 --> 02:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
through all right
 
02:27:14.950 --> 02:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
so you I will be here on the 16th what
 
02:27:17.070 --> 02:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
if we move the 16th to the 17th did that
 
02:27:19.550 --> 02:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
work for anyone not for
 
02:27:23.710 --> 02:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
me going back to an I have I have I I
 
02:27:26.230 --> 02:27:26.240 align:start position:0%
got to go to Pittsburg on the 16th in
 
02:27:28.230 --> 02:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
the afternoon so I can be here in the
 
02:27:32.750 --> 02:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
morning for the 16th but 17th 17 I'm the
 
02:27:36.269 --> 02:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
date that works for at what time we back
 
02:27:38.550 --> 02:27:38.560 align:start position:0%
it up the 15th I can't be here in the
 
02:27:41.269 --> 02:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
15th that's the one I could
 
02:27:44.429 --> 02:27:44.439 align:start position:0%
be you you do the 17th I'm I'm going out
 
02:27:47.429 --> 02:27:47.439 align:start position:0%
of state on the 16th to a tax
 
02:27:50.830 --> 02:27:50.840 align:start position:0%
um my other hat tax guy I got a instant
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.710 --> 02:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
to so so 16th is the day we have to
 
02:28:02.870 --> 02:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
stick with all right I I would well
 
02:28:05.790 --> 02:28:05.800 align:start position:0%
light well it's you know we have to have
 
02:28:07.110 --> 02:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
a quum that's the
 
02:28:10.790 --> 02:28:10.800 align:start position:0%
problem so if we do the six 16 maybe we
 
02:28:13.550 --> 02:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
got to be prepared to be here for a full
 
02:28:17.230 --> 02:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
day after to we'll take a lunch break is
 
02:28:19.230 --> 02:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
everyone would maybe be prepared for a
 
02:28:22.590 --> 02:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
morning and and afternoon on the 16th
 
02:28:26.070 --> 02:28:26.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay well I just let you know my
 
02:28:28.910 --> 02:28:28.920 align:start position:0%
flight out of Logan is at
 
02:28:32.990 --> 02:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
uh five o'clock 201 16th yeah M mine's
 
02:28:36.429 --> 02:28:36.439 align:start position:0%
at 2:30 250 so I can stay a little later
 
02:28:37.990 --> 02:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
I can stay a little later but I'm just
 
02:28:39.630 --> 02:28:39.640 align:start position:0%
chair is there is there any way we could
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
start an hour
 
02:28:45.910 --> 02:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
earlier we certainly can on the 16th
 
02:28:47.670 --> 02:28:47.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I might be late myself but that's
 
02:28:47.680 --> 02:28:49.110 align:start position:0%
yeah I might be late myself but that's
all

02:28:49.110 --> 02:28:49.120 align:start position:0%
all
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
right if we start early I can be on the
 
02:28:53.150 --> 02:28:53.160 align:start position:0%
16th and do the first half of the
 
02:28:54.950 --> 02:28:54.960 align:start position:0%
morning I just got to be out of here by
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
noonish so we get you guys can we start
 
02:28:58.550 --> 02:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
9:30 or 9
 
02:29:03.070 --> 02:29:03.080 align:start position:0%
9 I may I yes I just think there
 
02:29:05.870 --> 02:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
there besides scheduling there's a sort
 
02:29:08.429 --> 02:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
of larger point that I don't think going
 
02:29:11.150 --> 02:29:11.160 align:start position:0%
line by line is going to get us we're
 
02:29:13.790 --> 02:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
not going to have time to do that and so
 
02:29:15.469 --> 02:29:15.479 align:start position:0%
maybe the chair wants to consider a
 
02:29:17.349 --> 02:29:17.359 align:start position:0%
process that would be more efficient to
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
get us to where we need to be um that's
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
how I'm feeling at this point well I
 
02:29:25.309 --> 02:29:25.319 align:start position:0%
think I think if we're supposed to
 
02:29:27.590 --> 02:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
recommend legislation I think come
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
coming to a somewhat of a consensus
 
02:29:30.830 --> 02:29:30.840 align:start position:0%
we're not going to agree on every
 
02:29:33.349 --> 02:29:33.359 align:start position:0%
division but putting something out there
 
02:29:34.710 --> 02:29:34.720 align:start position:0%
as kind of
 
02:29:38.309 --> 02:29:38.319 align:start position:0%
a I guess the working draft a lot of the
 
02:29:40.070 --> 02:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
provisions we kind of went line by line
 
02:29:41.510 --> 02:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
with and whether I agree with it or
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
someone else we kind of just been doing
 
02:29:46.110 --> 02:29:46.120 align:start position:0%
a kind of a rough vote on it and the
 
02:29:48.510 --> 02:29:48.520 align:start position:0%
majority has been kind of owning the day
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
on so some of the provisions have been
 
02:29:52.510 --> 02:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
taken out put
 
02:29:55.269 --> 02:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
in a lot of it's been done that way most
 
02:29:58.590 --> 02:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
of the stuff we agreed on some of stuff
 
02:30:00.630 --> 02:30:00.640 align:start position:0%
I just think there's a lot of actually
 
02:30:02.990 --> 02:30:03.000 align:start position:0%
open questions I I think yeah we're
 
02:30:05.309 --> 02:30:05.319 align:start position:0%
going to agree on most but I think the
 
02:30:07.870 --> 02:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
big issues we haven't agreed on and so
 
02:30:09.790 --> 02:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
um I think maybe having some more
 
02:30:11.990 --> 02:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
structured conversation to get to a
 
02:30:13.790 --> 02:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
consensus on those points of
 
02:30:15.150 --> 02:30:15.160 align:start position:0%
disagreement might might be more
 
02:30:18.550 --> 02:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:20.630 --> 02:30:20.640 align:start position:0%
more structure structured conversation
 
02:30:23.269 --> 02:30:23.279 align:start position:0%
about those areas where we don't this
 
02:30:25.190 --> 02:30:25.200 align:start position:0%
and what are those topics yeah I think
 
02:30:27.710 --> 02:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
that we can identify those absolutely I
 
02:30:29.269 --> 02:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
think that we're still kind of The
 
02:30:32.230 --> 02:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
Possession limit still up up in the air
 
02:30:36.309 --> 02:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
I think not to open that can right now
 
02:30:40.670 --> 02:30:40.680 align:start position:0%
but if we pride ourselves on out State
 
02:30:43.030 --> 02:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
consumers I think people buy in bulk
 
02:30:44.990 --> 02:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
it's what it is if you live right next
 
02:30:46.469 --> 02:30:46.479 align:start position:0%
near the store I don't see why you buy
 
02:30:49.230 --> 02:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
invol but I think we got to balance that
 
02:30:51.750 --> 02:30:51.760 align:start position:0%
with the public safety side of things so
 
02:30:53.309 --> 02:30:53.319 align:start position:0%
we were still haven't agreed on the
 
02:30:55.990 --> 02:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
public use provision so I we just left
 
02:30:57.990 --> 02:30:58.000 align:start position:0%
it as the violation for now I think in
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
the the hearings in the the legislative
 
02:31:02.830 --> 02:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
bodies that might have to be had out
 
02:31:05.269 --> 02:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
because we couldn't come to a consensus
 
02:31:07.870 --> 02:31:07.880 align:start position:0%
on anything with that I think we're
 
02:31:10.150 --> 02:31:10.160 align:start position:0%
waiting on the on the nanogram
 
02:31:12.469 --> 02:31:12.479 align:start position:0%
measurement to see if there's any way to
 
02:31:14.030 --> 02:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
kind of ballpark what would be
 
02:31:16.510 --> 02:31:16.520 align:start position:0%
appropriate with that seems that it's
 
02:31:17.790 --> 02:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
been somewhat arbitrarily applied in
 
02:31:19.670 --> 02:31:19.680 align:start position:0%
other states but we we don't want
 
02:31:23.990 --> 02:31:24.000 align:start position:0%
inadvertent violators of that so we have
 
02:31:26.110 --> 02:31:26.120 align:start position:0%
that to work on but you know that's
 
02:31:26.120 --> 02:31:27.389 align:start position:0%
that to work on but you know that's
still

02:31:27.389 --> 02:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
still
 
02:31:29.670 --> 02:31:29.680 align:start position:0%
undecided and then there's the issue of
 
02:31:31.269 --> 02:31:31.279 align:start position:0%
whether we'll have dual
 
02:31:34.110 --> 02:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
licenses or we're going to have separate
 
02:31:35.950 --> 02:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
you know if they're GNA be if the atc's
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
join the retail Market there no one's
 
02:31:39.590 --> 02:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
stopping them from doing
 
02:31:42.710 --> 02:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
it um whether we're going to allow two
 
02:31:44.870 --> 02:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
signs in these dual stores
 
02:31:47.429 --> 02:31:47.439 align:start position:0%
and the potential problems that
 
02:31:49.790 --> 02:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
creates I think that's that's those are
 
02:31:51.750 --> 02:31:51.760 align:start position:0%
the only points of contention right
 
02:31:55.710 --> 02:31:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:57.750 --> 02:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
anything I think the Zone we haven't got
 
02:31:59.990 --> 02:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
to zoning yet but I know that's
 
02:32:03.630 --> 02:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
gonna I think it says 200 feet some we
 
02:32:07.630 --> 02:32:07.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:10.590 --> 02:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
there anything
 
02:32:14.190 --> 02:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
else any points of contention
 
02:32:17.150 --> 02:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
any all right I think I think A J so
 
02:32:20.550 --> 02:32:20.560 align:start position:0%
just to clarify 9:30 on on the 16th or 9
 
02:32:24.510 --> 02:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
N nine o'clock on on this on the 16th
 
02:32:26.230 --> 02:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
but I would just advise everyone I know
 
02:32:27.630 --> 02:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
not all of us can stay but we should be
 
02:32:29.349 --> 02:32:29.359 align:start position:0%
prepared to stay at maybe at least two
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
or three
 
02:32:33.309 --> 02:32:33.319 align:start position:0%
o'clock and hopefully give folks lunch
 
02:32:35.750 --> 02:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
break in a lunch with a lunch break yes
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah and uh that that is Jael cards yeah
 
02:32:39.990 --> 02:32:40.000 align:start position:0%

rej

02:33:28.950 --> 02:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
