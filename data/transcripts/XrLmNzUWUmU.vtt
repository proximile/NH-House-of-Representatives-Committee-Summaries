e

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 align:start position:0%
good morning I am going to open up the
 
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing for house bills 428
 
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
244 and 96 representative Davis would
 
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
the first bill we're going to be
 
00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
discussing today is HB
 
00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 align:start position:0%
428 um I would like to call Bill Sherman
 
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
uh to the table uh to um walk us through
 
00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 align:start position:0%
an amendment that has been worked on
 
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360 align:start position:0%
good morning mam chair members of the
 
00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
Committees uh my name is Philip Sherman
 
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 align:start position:0%
I'm the chair of the building code
 
00:03:12.149 --> 00:03:12.159 align:start position:0%
review board well we don't take a
 
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 align:start position:0%
position on this bill uh on the overall
 
00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 align:start position:0%
intent of it um I'm I'm here to provide
 
00:03:21.789 --> 00:03:21.799 align:start position:0%
some technical input in this proposed
 
00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
amendment which a number of us have
 
00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
worked on which would essentially
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
continue to prohibit technical
 
00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 align:start position:0%
amendments but allow administrative
 
00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
amend M ments and we can get into what
 
00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 align:start position:0%
that what that really means uh the chair
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
has asked me to sort of walk you through
 
00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 align:start position:0%
uh what I'll call the word document
 
00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 align:start position:0%
which has my notations a little bit as
 
00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:46.239 align:start position:0%
to as to what we're doing so uh I can go
 
00:03:47.869 --> 00:03:47.879 align:start position:0%
through it section by section and if
 
00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 align:start position:0%
anybody has questions just stop me or if
 
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
I'm going too slowly uh nudge me along
 
00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 align:start position:0%
and I'll go quicker um the first section
 
00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 align:start position:0%
basically just takes out the 420 4722
 
00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh City Grant of power for codes because
 
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
we move it into
 
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
155a that's essentially what we're
 
00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 align:start position:0%
trying to do in HB 244 anyway but where
 
00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.319 align:start position:0%
these sections were in midair uh being
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
amended it seemed like the right time to
 
00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 align:start position:0%
just put them where they belong and and
 
00:04:20.189 --> 00:04:20.199 align:start position:0%
then not have to move them again later
 
00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh under the other bill um the second
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
Bill I'm sorry the second section gets
 
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
to the definition of local enforcement
 
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.350 align:start position:0%
to the definition of local enforcement
agency

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 align:start position:0%
agency
 
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 align:start position:0%
sorry okay so are you are you looking at
 
00:04:55.029 --> 00:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
amendment so the first first section of
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
that has to do with RSA 4722 and and
 
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.790 align:start position:0%
that has to do with RSA 4722 and and
deletes

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
deletes
 
00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
it I hope we're looking at the same
 
00:05:18.189 --> 00:05:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 align:start position:0%
difficult should we we should wait till
 
00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:22.919 align:start position:0%
we get
 
00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 align:start position:0%
there I feel your pain yes um okay so
 
00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:29.360 align:start position:0%
the second section tries to clean up the
 
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:31.600 align:start position:0%
def definition of local enforcement
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
agency uh one we we refer to 67210 where
 
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
municipality takes the broad you know
 
00:05:40.469 --> 00:05:40.479 align:start position:0%
cities towns Village districts all that
 
00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
stuff and defines it um we've settled on
 
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:47.800 align:start position:0%
the term enforcement mechanism which is
 
00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
the the switch whereby a municipality
 
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
decides to either enforce the State
 
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 align:start position:0%
Building Code or not uh there are
 
00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
numerous terms used throughout the
 
00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
statutes that's the one that seems to be
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
used in the field and it it's already
 
00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:02.240 align:start position:0%
used in
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
155a um and then in terms of the the
 
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 align:start position:0%
general broad scope of the building code
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
we've used the language out of the model
 
00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 align:start position:0%
codes because it's very close to what
 
00:06:14.469 --> 00:06:14.479 align:start position:0%
was already there but it just it keeps
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
the model codes and the statutes in sync
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
and we're not running around amending
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
everything uh to meet the statute so any
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:46.749 --> 00:06:46.759 align:start position:0%
that I I think there's General agreement
 
00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 align:start position:0%
that any construction in a building
 
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:52.400 align:start position:0%
falls into one or more of these
 
00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
yeah okay a number of these references
 
00:06:58.629 --> 00:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
as you see in part three and four simply
 
00:07:00.909 --> 00:07:00.919 align:start position:0%
take existing references to what I'll
 
00:07:05.589 --> 00:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
call the 67x series 674 and so forth and
 
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:07.280 align:start position:0%
switch them to
 
00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 align:start position:0%
155a uh you know where they land on in
 
00:07:13.189 --> 00:07:13.199 align:start position:0%
in a minute here so three and four
 
00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:17.430 align:start position:0%
simply change those references um
 
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:18.830 align:start position:0%
simply change those references um
[Music]

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:21.639 align:start position:0%
five we took the fire code out of there
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
so that's just a reference
 
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:26.680 align:start position:0%
thing all right so
 
00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:30.400 align:start position:0%
local number six is the is the B of this
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
thing um we start off by essentially
 
00:07:36.909 --> 00:07:36.919 align:start position:0%
combining language from
 
00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:41.240 align:start position:0%
67451 for towns and cities and
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
4722 which was just for cities and put
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
them in one place and said basically you
 
00:07:50.189 --> 00:07:50.199 align:start position:0%
can decide to enforce the building code
 
00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
or not about 141 municipalities in New
 
00:07:56.510 --> 00:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire currently enforce the building
 
00:07:59.029 --> 00:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
code that covers a broad swath of the
 
00:07:59.039 --> 00:07:59.950 align:start position:0%
code that covers a broad swath of the
population

00:07:59.950 --> 00:07:59.960 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
obviously and then there's X number of
 
00:08:06.189 --> 00:08:06.199 align:start position:0%
of smaller jurisdictions that do not so
 
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
this simply is language that's already
 
00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
there and says you're empowered to adopt
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
an enforcement mechanism a local
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency and then enforce the
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
code uh the language about adopting a
 
00:08:23.869 --> 00:08:23.879 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized code not included
 
00:08:26.029 --> 00:08:26.039 align:start position:0%
in State Building Code was worked out
 
00:08:29.749 --> 00:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
last year under SP 437 that's important
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
it's been there since 2002 when State
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
Building Code started it allows
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities to adopt a housing or a
 
00:08:39.110 --> 00:08:39.120 align:start position:0%
property maintenance code where there
 
00:08:41.870 --> 00:08:41.880 align:start position:0%
was a dis decision way back not to do
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
that on a Statewide basis but it's very
 
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:46.560 align:start position:0%
important that the people who want to
 
00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
adopt it can continue to do so um while
 
00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:53.080 align:start position:0%
at the same time eliminating the ability
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
of municipalities to adopt later
 
00:08:57.790 --> 00:08:57.800 align:start position:0%
additions of the codes that are in the
 
00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
building code so if we're on one
 
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:02.440 align:start position:0%
addition of the international building
 
00:09:04.430 --> 00:09:04.440 align:start position:0%
code nobody can jump to the newer
 
00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
Amendment no it
 
00:09:18.670 --> 00:09:18.680 align:start position:0%
it the first paragraph uh where it says
 
00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:20.720 align:start position:0%
the local legislative body May adopt a
 
00:09:23.069 --> 00:09:23.079 align:start position:0%
nationally recognized code not included
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
in and not inconsistent with the State
 
00:09:27.630 --> 00:09:27.640 align:start position:0%
Building Code and then the accept is for
 
00:09:29.870 --> 00:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
a similar scope that's how we got rid of
 
00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:32.750 align:start position:0%
a similar scope that's how we got rid of
later

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
additions it would effectively
 
00:09:37.990 --> 00:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
prohibit it might prohibit
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
code housing and Property Maintenance
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
codes are sort of similar if not the
 
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:51.519 align:start position:0%
same idea so that's the the code that
 
00:09:54.190 --> 00:09:54.200 align:start position:0%
would allow a municipal inspector to say
 
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
your lead paint is falling off the walls
 
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:15.959 align:start position:0%
we didn't get to amendments yet this is
 
00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
talking about adopting a code amendments
 
00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
are in the next
 
00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph rip I take could I have you
 
00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
use your microphone so when you yeah no
 
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
problem so first we we basically say you
 
00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:31.800 align:start position:0%
can enforce the building codee if you
 
00:10:34.430 --> 00:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
want as a
 
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:36.920 align:start position:0%
municipality secondly we say you can
 
00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
adopt additional codes that's that's
 
00:10:41.030 --> 00:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
word for word what's in the statute
 
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:44.600 align:start position:0%
today and that specifically
 
00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:46.920 align:start position:0%
allows as I said the adoption of a
 
00:10:48.629 --> 00:10:48.639 align:start position:0%
housing or a property maintenance code
 
00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:50.200 align:start position:0%
which is not covered by the state
 
00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:51.590 align:start position:0%
which is not covered by the state
building

00:10:51.590 --> 00:10:51.600 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
code and then prohibits through the
 
00:10:58.350 --> 00:10:58.360 align:start position:0%
scope statement if we're on the 2021 you
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
know swimming pool code nobody can go to
 
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.360 align:start position:0%
the 2024 swimming pool code they've got
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
to stick with the addition that we're on
 
00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
that's that's language that was worked
 
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:15.509 --> 00:11:15.519 align:start position:0%
437 okay so far okay all right now we
 
00:11:18.949 --> 00:11:18.959 align:start position:0%
talk about amendments so the first
 
00:11:21.949 --> 00:11:21.959 align:start position:0%
sentence uh amendments implementing the
 
00:11:23.829 --> 00:11:23.839 align:start position:0%
issuance of permits the collection of
 
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:25.680 align:start position:0%
fees and the issuance of permits and
 
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
certificates of occupancy simply
 
00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:31.040 align:start position:0%
reference to two statute two statutes
 
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:34.200 align:start position:0%
today that Reserve those three items
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
issuance of permits collection of fees
 
00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:39.200 align:start position:0%
and C of O's certificates of occupancies
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:11:42.629 --> 00:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
municipalities the state has nothing
 
00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:44.560 align:start position:0%
state code folks have nothing to say
 
00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.200 align:start position:0%
about how they do it what they do with
 
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
it or not um and that simply allows them
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
to continue to do amendments to
 
00:11:54.030 --> 00:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
implement that stuff that's the part of
 
00:11:56.629 --> 00:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities uh
 
00:11:59.990 --> 00:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
today um then it talks about out or
 
00:12:02.350 --> 00:12:02.360 align:start position:0%
other administrative functions shall be
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
reserved for the municipalities provided
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
they're not less stringent than the
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
State Building Code and they get
 
00:12:09.949 --> 00:12:09.959 align:start position:0%
confirmed through the bcrb we can get to
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
that in a minute so this basically
 
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:17.720 align:start position:0%
allows people to amend um things to do
 
00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
with plan reviews and permits and all of
 
00:12:23.230 --> 00:12:23.240 align:start position:0%
that administrative stuff without
 
00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do technical
 
00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
amendments fairly critical I I mean you
 
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:30.760 align:start position:0%
know this city of Manchester operates
 
00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
their building department differently
 
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:35.320 align:start position:0%
than some town of 4,000 per people so
 
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
they've got to have the ability to to
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
massage that chapter one stuff to um to
 
00:12:44.829 --> 00:12:44.839 align:start position:0%
to fit into the way they've operated you
 
00:12:47.069 --> 00:12:47.079 align:start position:0%
know right along but again not
 
00:12:49.069 --> 00:12:49.079 align:start position:0%
permitting technical amendments through
 
00:12:49.079 --> 00:12:49.910 align:start position:0%
permitting technical amendments through
that

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
sentence we go on to just reinforce that
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
in case you didn't understand that it's
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
only administrative no amendments to the
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
technical requirements of the State
 
00:13:01.509 --> 00:13:01.519 align:start position:0%
Building Code or permitted period we
 
00:13:15.389 --> 00:13:15.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
sitech there was a sense on the part of
 
00:13:22.829 --> 00:13:22.839 align:start position:0%
one or more people that if for whatever
 
00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
the reason the state code bogged down
 
00:13:29.829 --> 00:13:29.839 align:start position:0%
we've seen that in the past one issue
 
00:13:32.189 --> 00:13:32.199 align:start position:0%
bogs down the whole state code and it
 
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't get updated for a number of
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
years back in the 2009 to 2015 cycle
 
00:13:42.269 --> 00:13:42.279 align:start position:0%
there was a major delay um these
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
individuals felt that at that point it
 
00:13:49.310 --> 00:13:49.320 align:start position:0%
was dangerous enough uh that amendments
 
00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
ought to be
 
00:13:59.310 --> 00:13:59.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:02.230 --> 00:14:02.240 align:start position:0%
but it concerns me that this may be an
 
00:14:05.629 --> 00:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
opportunity to get around the intent of
 
00:14:09.949 --> 00:14:09.959 align:start position:0%
the Bill of your Amendment it it that's
 
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
my concern yeah get around or seem to
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
not align with the overall intent of the
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
bill but only if the if the updates to
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code get delayed if
 
00:14:25.230 --> 00:14:25.240 align:start position:0%
that sounds to me like uh this could be
 
00:14:27.230 --> 00:14:27.240 align:start position:0%
eliminated and you're talking about
 
00:14:29.790 --> 00:14:29.800 align:start position:0%
something that's 15 years ago and I
 
00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880 align:start position:0%
don't I just don't see a clear and
 
00:14:34.829 --> 00:14:34.839 align:start position:0%
present danger of that that this this
 
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
too it can be eliminated you're the
 
00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:47.749 align:start position:0%
too it can be eliminated you're the
legislature

00:14:47.749 --> 00:14:47.759 align:start position:0%
legislature
 
00:14:51.310 --> 00:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
yes my point is it could be
 
00:14:54.310 --> 00:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
eliminated uh without any real harm to
 
00:14:56.990 --> 00:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
the intent of the
 
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
bill I would agree that it it's it's
 
00:15:09.870 --> 00:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.389 align:start position:0%
 
bill

00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:15:15.310 --> 00:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
um and again if that sentence stays it
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
requires the confirmation process that's
 
00:15:18.990 --> 00:15:19.000 align:start position:0%
in in place
 
00:15:21.509 --> 00:15:21.519 align:start position:0%
today all right so are we okay on that
 
00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
A3 the next part of this Roman numeral
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
one simply vacuums up a bunch of stuff
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
that's splattered in other places in the
 
00:15:38.509 --> 00:15:38.519 align:start position:0%
code today there's nothing new in there
 
00:15:40.110 --> 00:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
it simply says if you're going to have
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
an enforcement mechanism you have to
 
00:15:43.309 --> 00:15:43.319 align:start position:0%
have a building official you have to
 
00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
have an appeals board you have to have a
 
00:15:48.150 --> 00:15:48.160 align:start position:0%
fee structure that's all language that's
 
00:15:50.710 --> 00:15:50.720 align:start position:0%
in there now there's some duplication
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
there's actually a section in there in
 
00:15:55.749 --> 00:15:55.759 align:start position:0%
673 that's a holdover from back when
 
00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:58.680 align:start position:0%
municipalities adopted their own codes
 
00:16:01.509 --> 00:16:01.519 align:start position:0%
um so it simply combines and and
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
collates the the precise same issues
 
00:16:07.949 --> 00:16:07.959 align:start position:0%
that are are still in there it requires
 
00:16:11.670 --> 00:16:11.680 align:start position:0%
uh the the establishment of who has the
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
authority to set a fee schedule whether
 
00:16:15.829 --> 00:16:15.839 align:start position:0%
it's the city council the board of
 
00:16:17.829 --> 00:16:17.839 align:start position:0%
Selectmen the building inspector himself
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
or whoever it is all in the statute
 
00:16:26.629 --> 00:16:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:29.629 --> 00:16:29.639 align:start position:0%
one Roman numeral 2
 
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:33.800 align:start position:0%
who uh for some reason New Hampshire
 
00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
makes certificates of occupancy optional
 
00:16:38.749 --> 00:16:38.759 align:start position:0%
carries that language right through from
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
the current
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
code uh Roman uh yeah Roman numeral 3 is
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
basically in the code today uh it
 
00:16:51.309 --> 00:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
basically says State stay out of
 
00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:53.800 align:start position:0%
employment issues you know the
 
00:16:55.470 --> 00:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
municipalities have the right to put
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
whoever they want in that position to do
 
00:17:00.749 --> 00:17:00.759 align:start position:0%
the job uh we made one minor Amendment
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
there where we say existing or amended
 
00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:04.679 align:start position:0%
ordinances they may want to change these
 
00:17:07.510 --> 00:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
over time uh but that those ordinances
 
00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.630 align:start position:0%
over time uh but that those ordinances
still

00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:17:12.829 --> 00:17:12.839 align:start position:0%
stand yes sir Mr Sherman is that subb is
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
that a grandfather
 
00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
clause only as it as it involves
 
00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:21.710 align:start position:0%
clause only as it as it involves
employment

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:24.630 --> 00:17:24.640 align:start position:0%
issues yeah this is a very limited thing
 
00:17:27.110 --> 00:17:27.120 align:start position:0%
where you know the board of Selectmen
 
00:17:28.909 --> 00:17:28.919 align:start position:0%
hired a building inspector we're not
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
telling them who to hire and so forth
 
00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
right um what time the office is open or
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
whatever it
 
00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:41.280 align:start position:0%
is um Roman numeral 4 is a little bit of
 
00:17:43.510 --> 00:17:43.520 align:start position:0%
a duplicate but it just says whatever
 
00:17:45.110 --> 00:17:45.120 align:start position:0%
amendments come out of the previous
 
00:17:46.830 --> 00:17:46.840 align:start position:0%
sections still have to come back to the
 
00:17:51.710 --> 00:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
bcrb for confirmation yes sir Mr Sherman
 
00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
confirmation does that is that word
 
00:17:56.789 --> 00:17:56.799 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that word be
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
approval Mr I can hear Mr Mr ran Court
 
00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
giggling back there that word um
 
00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
resulted two years ago when the when the
 
00:18:08.149 --> 00:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
bcrb confirmation process was first
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
implemented in
 
00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:12.440 align:start position:0%
2023 um and it was
 
00:18:17.789 --> 00:18:17.799 align:start position:0%
carefully worded because we have no now
 
00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
again this is this is when we were
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
confirming technical amendments as we do
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
today we have no input on whether that
 
00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
technical amendment makes any sense or
 
00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:29.310 align:start position:0%
technical amendment makes any sense or
not

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
we're only looking at whether it's less
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
stringent than the State Building Code
 
00:18:35.230 --> 00:18:35.240 align:start position:0%
then it doesn't and then send it to the
 
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:37.240 align:start position:0%
Fire Marshall to be sure that it doesn't
 
00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880 align:start position:0%
conflict with the fire code so all we're
 
00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:42.440 align:start position:0%
looking at is does it comply with the
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
statute that says it it references a
 
00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:47.080 align:start position:0%
specific section in a specific code is
 
00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
it less stringent and is it um is it
 
00:18:52.350 --> 00:18:52.360 align:start position:0%
does it conflict with a fire code if
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
somebody wants an amendment that says
 
00:18:56.630 --> 00:18:56.640 align:start position:0%
all walls have to be painted purple we
 
00:18:58.230 --> 00:18:58.240 align:start position:0%
have nothing to say about whether that's
 
00:19:01.510 --> 00:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
a good idea idea or not so that's why we
 
00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
didn't use the term approved we use
 
00:19:07.350 --> 00:19:07.360 align:start position:0%
confirmed that's in the statute well I'm
 
00:19:09.789 --> 00:19:09.799 align:start position:0%
not convinced personally okay I like I
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
like the word approval because suppose
 
00:19:14.270 --> 00:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
you don't confirm what's that mean it's
 
00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:15.990 align:start position:0%
you don't confirm what's that mean it's
not

00:19:15.990 --> 00:19:16.000 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
approved the the statute says it can't
 
00:19:21.990 --> 00:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
be enforced if it's not confirmed but so
 
00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
there's a you're telling me there's a
 
00:19:26.390 --> 00:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
difference in word but not a difference
 
00:19:29.270 --> 00:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
in meaning from approval yeah I would I
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
would say 12
 
00:19:34.990 --> 00:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
right again we we made a little bit of
 
00:19:36.909 --> 00:19:36.919 align:start position:0%
an effort to try and not muck with
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
things that are there today other than
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:47.350 align:start position:0%
 
but

00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh all right so then Roman numeral 5
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
again picks up some stuff from other
 
00:19:56.830 --> 00:19:56.840 align:start position:0%
places basically just you know redefines
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
it defines a municipality so we're
 
00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
talking about um and again repeats no
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
local modification except as permitted
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
in this section um and as I understand
 
00:20:12.310 --> 00:20:12.320 align:start position:0%
it there's a difference between enacting
 
00:20:14.430 --> 00:20:14.440 align:start position:0%
an ordinance and enforcing an ordinance
 
00:20:18.950 --> 00:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
so we've tried to cover that base
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
um and basically just ties down this
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200 align:start position:0%
amendments that's where the teeth are in
 
00:20:29.710 --> 00:20:29.720 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:20:32.710 --> 00:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes I believe so
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
yeah Roman numeral 6 part 1 and two just
 
00:20:40.870 --> 00:20:40.880 align:start position:0%
repeat um language that's in the in the
 
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.110 align:start position:0%
repeat um language that's in the in the
statute

00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
statute
 
00:20:46.390 --> 00:20:46.400 align:start position:0%
today last year through S SP
 
00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:50.120 align:start position:0%
437 U all of these local ordinances were
 
00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:51.880 align:start position:0%
intended to be brought to the surface
 
00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
and submitted for
 
00:20:57.909 --> 00:20:57.919 align:start position:0%
confirmation that process is still just
 
00:20:57.919 --> 00:20:59.149 align:start position:0%
confirmation that process is still just
beginning

00:20:59.149 --> 00:20:59.159 align:start position:0%
beginning
 
00:21:02.350 --> 00:21:02.360 align:start position:0%
so we tried to carry in this amendment
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
the current language flushing all this
 
00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:07.919 align:start position:0%
stuff to the surface for a lookie we've
 
00:21:11.110 --> 00:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
had significant problems um with
 
00:21:13.470 --> 00:21:13.480 align:start position:0%
literally every am every ordinance that
 
00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
we've seen so there's a lot of work
 
00:21:17.990 --> 00:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
going on out there at the municipalities
 
00:21:20.590 --> 00:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
to redo their ordinances I've spent a
 
00:21:22.549 --> 00:21:22.559 align:start position:0%
lot of time on the phone I've personally
 
00:21:24.269 --> 00:21:24.279 align:start position:0%
talked with everybody who's submitted
 
00:21:26.710 --> 00:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
one many people who have not submitted
 
00:21:29.190 --> 00:21:29.200 align:start position:0%
yet um are busy working working on them
 
00:21:31.510 --> 00:21:31.520 align:start position:0%
because they know they've got problems
 
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:33.880 align:start position:0%
uh it's amazing what's hanging out there
 
00:21:35.870 --> 00:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
in Old ordinances that haven't been
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
looked at in a long time um so that that
 
00:21:42.390 --> 00:21:42.400 align:start position:0%
language just continues the process
 
00:21:44.990 --> 00:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's there today depending on the
 
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:47.080 align:start position:0%
implementation of this bill because
 
00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
obviously this this amendment if it goes
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
through would require some changes to
 
00:21:54.269 --> 00:21:54.279 align:start position:0%
those ordinances we may want to kick
 
00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:55.559 align:start position:0%
I'll get to this in a minute we may want
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
to kick this out so that we we sweep it
 
00:22:00.390 --> 00:22:00.400 align:start position:0%
all up in one one exercise rather than
 
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
having them rewrite their ordinance and
 
00:22:03.909 --> 00:22:03.919 align:start position:0%
then bang in July they get to do it all
 
00:22:06.830 --> 00:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
over again but we can we can talk about
 
00:22:10.510 --> 00:22:10.520 align:start position:0%
that in a minute so paragraph 6 one and
 
00:22:13.750 --> 00:22:13.760 align:start position:0%
two right out of the existing
 
00:22:16.190 --> 00:22:16.200 align:start position:0%
statute I'm Mr chairman I'm having
 
00:22:17.990 --> 00:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
trouble with these dates no local
 
00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:20.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment shall be enforced if it has
 
00:22:22.669 --> 00:22:22.679 align:start position:0%
not been submitted to the bill brcb
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of the effective date of
 
00:22:26.909 --> 00:22:26.919 align:start position:0%
this paragraph which
 
00:22:29.269 --> 00:22:29.279 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
I guess that's a is there July 1 in
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
there what what's the whole purpose of
 
00:22:37.750 --> 00:22:37.760 align:start position:0%
July 1 this bill this bills got uh got a
 
00:22:40.630 --> 00:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
year uh doesn't take the effective date
 
00:22:44.350 --> 00:22:44.360 align:start position:0%
is a year after passage so that really
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
Mak sense to put that in we we may have
 
00:22:50.669 --> 00:22:50.679 align:start position:0%
a I think you found an an editing issue
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
here that effective data the paragraph
 
00:22:56.149 --> 00:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
Was from the last statute which was July
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
of last year so this now we've got a
 
00:22:58.159 --> 00:22:58.950 align:start position:0%
of last year so this now we've got a
parag

00:22:58.950 --> 00:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
parag
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
here and that would need to be
 
00:23:04.950 --> 00:23:04.960 align:start position:0%
corrected well what what happened was
 
00:23:07.669 --> 00:23:07.679 align:start position:0%
that that the bill allowed a 60-day
 
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:09.400 align:start position:0%
window where all they had to do was send
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
us an email and say here's our ordinance
 
00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:13.520 align:start position:0%
and then it relieved the time pressure
 
00:23:15.350 --> 00:23:15.360 align:start position:0%
but it said if you didn't submit it
 
00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:19.320 align:start position:0%
within 60 days you could not enforce the
 
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:22.120 align:start position:0%
ordinance about 10 municipalities
 
00:23:25.909 --> 00:23:25.919 align:start position:0%
submitted it within that 60-day
 
00:23:31.549 --> 00:23:31.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880 align:start position:0%
but this is not going to permit
 
00:23:39.350 --> 00:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:42.750 --> 00:23:42.760 align:start position:0%
that any such ordinance paragraph two
 
00:23:44.870 --> 00:23:44.880 align:start position:0%
says if you if you have an ordinance on
 
00:23:47.549 --> 00:23:47.559 align:start position:0%
or after July 24 you can't enforce it
 
00:23:49.870 --> 00:23:49.880 align:start position:0%
unless we confirm it the earlier
 
00:23:53.110 --> 00:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
paragraphs now say in the amendment here
 
00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:55.480 align:start position:0%
so you can't have technical
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
amendments can can you suggest uh uh
 
00:24:03.549 --> 00:24:03.559 align:start position:0%
editing change to uh that you've for the
 
00:24:06.750 --> 00:24:06.760 align:start position:0%
dates is what I'm I think the editing
 
00:24:09.590 --> 00:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
changes simply in in paragraph number
 
00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:12.750 align:start position:0%
changes simply in in paragraph number
one

00:24:12.750 --> 00:24:12.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
um instead of saying within 60 days of
 
00:24:19.909 --> 00:24:19.919 align:start position:0%
the effected date of this
 
00:24:22.950 --> 00:24:22.960 align:start position:0%
paragraph We should say within 60 days
 
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my pen is run out of ink here
 
00:24:31.559 --> 00:24:32.990 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry my pen is run out of ink here
but

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:35.950 --> 00:24:35.960 align:start position:0%
um that would be an
 
00:24:42.230 --> 00:24:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
passed the ordinances are still out
 
00:24:52.830 --> 00:24:52.840 align:start position:0%
there though if we lose
 
00:24:55.470 --> 00:24:55.480 align:start position:0%
that we we go back and start that whole
 
00:24:57.789 --> 00:24:57.799 align:start position:0%
thing all over again whereas the fact is
 
00:25:01.389 --> 00:25:01.399 align:start position:0%
out of the 141 municipalities 131 of
 
00:25:04.590 --> 00:25:04.600 align:start position:0%
them plus or minus missed that deadline
 
00:25:07.269 --> 00:25:07.279 align:start position:0%
so their ordinances as of this point in
 
00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:09.480 align:start position:0%
time are not
 
00:25:12.630 --> 00:25:12.640 align:start position:0%
enforceable so you would you're can you
 
00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:16.760 align:start position:0%
would within 60 days of July 1 is that
 
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:19.640 align:start position:0%
202 July 1st 24 yeah okay so that should
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
be should be changed yeah
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
okay well there goes your career in OSS
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:37.520 align:start position:0%
ah really
 
00:25:40.190 --> 00:25:40.200 align:start position:0%
okay very perceptive questions yeah
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:44.830 --> 00:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
uh and the last two paragraphs seven and
 
00:25:46.950 --> 00:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
eight simply bring language that's been
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
in there for a long time prohibiting the
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
one and two family dwelling Sprinklers
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
and allowing for uh any heat Source in a
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
building that is word for word carried
 
00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:00.200 align:start position:0%
over or left there
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
um I guess I wasn't finished excuse me
 
00:26:05.470 --> 00:26:05.480 align:start position:0%
that means if it's a one or two family
 
00:26:07.149 --> 00:26:07.159 align:start position:0%
house they could just plane build it
 
00:26:09.070 --> 00:26:09.080 align:start position:0%
they don't need to let you know it has
 
00:26:10.789 --> 00:26:10.799 align:start position:0%
to be inspected by either the fire
 
00:26:12.990 --> 00:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
marshal or the local Authority but they
 
00:26:14.789 --> 00:26:14.799 align:start position:0%
don't have to let you know about
 
00:26:18.430 --> 00:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
it no this just prohibits municipalities
 
00:26:20.190 --> 00:26:20.200 align:start position:0%
from writing amendments that require
 
00:26:21.990 --> 00:26:22.000 align:start position:0%
sprinklers in one and two family
 
00:26:26.070 --> 00:26:26.080 align:start position:0%
dwellings wait that I'm on Roman numeral
 
00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:35.110 align:start position:0%
dwellings wait that I'm on Roman numeral
7

00:26:35.110 --> 00:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:38.310 --> 00:26:38.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm ahead again I'm almost at
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
the end I'll catch up to you in a
 
00:26:44.669 --> 00:26:44.679 align:start position:0%
minute all right so then paragraph
 
00:26:46.870 --> 00:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
number seven and eight simply realign
 
00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:47.830 align:start position:0%
number seven and eight simply realign
some

00:26:47.830 --> 00:26:47.840 align:start position:0%
some
 
00:26:51.269 --> 00:26:51.279 align:start position:0%
references um paragraph number nine
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
clarifies okay so this is the bcrb
 
00:26:56.950 --> 00:26:56.960 align:start position:0%
confirmation process and it really
 
00:26:58.669 --> 00:26:58.679 align:start position:0%
clarifies that we're reviewing
 
00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:00.880 align:start position:0%
ordinances not and the ordinances
 
00:27:02.350 --> 00:27:02.360 align:start position:0%
include the Amendments but it's the
 
00:27:05.510 --> 00:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
ordinance that we're we're confirming um
 
00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
and then a couple of references there uh
 
00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:10.520 align:start position:0%
but that process just continues the way
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
it has now for two years
 
00:27:18.070 --> 00:27:18.080 align:start position:0%
um number 10 red does an ordinance but
 
00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
we should note that there's another bill
 
00:27:22.310 --> 00:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
floating through the house that would
 
00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:26.440 align:start position:0%
would change that
 
00:27:30.510 --> 00:27:30.520 align:start position:0%
um number 11 is a reference oh number 11
 
00:27:33.870 --> 00:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
is an error in the current statute uh it
 
00:27:36.510 --> 00:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
talks about
 
00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.590 --> 00:27:44.600 align:start position:0%
appeal pretty sure we've got that got
 
00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.590 align:start position:0%
appeal pretty sure we've got that got
that

00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:50.909 align:start position:0%
that
correct

00:27:50.909 --> 00:27:50.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.149 --> 00:27:59.159 align:start position:0%
references and then back on 13 under
 
00:27:59.159 --> 00:28:01.269 align:start position:0%
references and then back on 13 under
repealing

00:28:01.269 --> 00:28:01.279 align:start position:0%
repealing
 
00:28:04.630 --> 00:28:04.640 align:start position:0%
um so it's a difficult to write an
 
00:28:06.269 --> 00:28:06.279 align:start position:0%
amendment to a bill because they don't
 
00:28:08.750 --> 00:28:08.760 align:start position:0%
know if we're amending the original
 
00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
statute or the bill but this basically
 
00:28:14.509 --> 00:28:14.519 align:start position:0%
puts the confirmation process back in in
 
00:28:17.750 --> 00:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
gear or leaves it there as the case may
 
00:28:21.750 --> 00:28:21.760 align:start position:0%
be yes sir it's your intention that this
 
00:28:24.669 --> 00:28:24.679 align:start position:0%
your word document that you described it
 
00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:28.840 align:start position:0%
replaces the entire Bill yes so it's
 
00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
everything we got the enacted Clause
 
00:28:36.870 --> 00:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah um and then we repeal 4722 and
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
67451 which is where a lot of this stuff
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
came from but we've covered everything
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
that's in there so then on the effective
 
00:28:48.149 --> 00:28:48.159 align:start position:0%
date as I as I alluded to previously it
 
00:28:50.710 --> 00:28:50.720 align:start position:0%
it seems to me that leaving a fairly
 
00:28:53.669 --> 00:28:53.679 align:start position:0%
significant window to catch up to all
 
00:28:56.430 --> 00:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
this stuff will allow the municipalities
 
00:28:58.350 --> 00:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
particularly the towns that are locked
 
00:29:00.669 --> 00:29:00.679 align:start position:0%
into town meeting schedules of which
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
most of them have missed for this year
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
give them enough time that they can redo
 
00:29:07.430 --> 00:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
their ordinance we confirm it they go to
 
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:09.360 align:start position:0%
the town meeting the city councils and
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
town councils have more more
 
00:29:14.430 --> 00:29:14.440 align:start position:0%
flexibility um but I'm I'm thinking that
 
00:29:17.710 --> 00:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
12 months uh would be a would be a good
 
00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:19.950 align:start position:0%
12 months uh would be a would be a good
time

00:29:19.950 --> 00:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:23.070 --> 00:29:23.080 align:start position:0%
frame Mr Sherman could you speak um to
 
00:29:28.389 --> 00:29:28.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
uh Sean will throw something at me if I
 
00:29:33.149 --> 00:29:33.159 align:start position:0%
get this wrong but uh Sean if you want
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:46.350 --> 00:29:46.360 align:start position:0%
to good morning uh Sean Tumi State Fire
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
Marshal for the record um so I think one
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
of the things that has been talked about
 
00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
is trying to make sure that building
 
00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
code related items are in the 155
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
building code statute and the fire code
 
00:29:58.950 --> 00:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
related items are in 15 3 the fire code
 
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:02.600 align:start position:0%
related statute um in 1535 which talks
 
00:30:04.509 --> 00:30:04.519 align:start position:0%
predominately about the state fire code
 
00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
in general there has been a
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh in paragraph five is a section that
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
points back to 155 A3 which as you heard
 
00:30:17.029 --> 00:30:17.039 align:start position:0%
this morning uh Phil's talk is is going
 
00:30:20.269 --> 00:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
to change and also talks about uh 4722
 
00:30:23.950 --> 00:30:23.960 align:start position:0%
so I think what we just need to do is uh
 
00:30:25.549 --> 00:30:25.559 align:start position:0%
hearing all of this is I need to come up
 
00:30:27.710 --> 00:30:27.720 align:start position:0%
with some language for you that will
 
00:30:31.669 --> 00:30:31.679 align:start position:0%
just help clean up in 1535 and then 1534
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
just the process if there's an intent to
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
keep some local amendments I know the
 
00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.080 align:start position:0%
intent is to restrict this I think
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
similar to on the building code uh
 
00:30:41.389 --> 00:30:41.399 align:start position:0%
having some ability for the
 
00:30:42.590 --> 00:30:42.600 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have some
 
00:30:45.950 --> 00:30:45.960 align:start position:0%
administrative changes makes sense um
 
00:30:47.430 --> 00:30:47.440 align:start position:0%
the technical changes I think are the
 
00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:49.760 align:start position:0%
bigger problem um some of the process
 
00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:51.799 align:start position:0%
related stuff at the local level um
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
would just need to craft some language
 
00:30:54.430 --> 00:30:54.440 align:start position:0%
to marrow what's going to happen in the
 
00:30:54.440 --> 00:30:56.629 align:start position:0%
to marrow what's going to happen in the
building

00:30:56.629 --> 00:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:30:59.149 --> 00:30:59.159 align:start position:0%
code uh thank you for taking my question
 
00:31:02.029 --> 00:31:02.039 align:start position:0%
so uh you bring up a good point and I
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
would hope that you could uh kind of um
 
00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:05.840 align:start position:0%
help me clarify this a little bit but
 
00:31:06.710 --> 00:31:06.720 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between
 
00:31:10.269 --> 00:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
administrative versus technical uh in
 
00:31:13.870 --> 00:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
that term sure so I think that
 
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
um I'll take the the driveway example
 
00:31:18.549 --> 00:31:18.559 align:start position:0%
for instance it's there's some
 
00:31:20.389 --> 00:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
Provisions in there that talk about uh
 
00:31:22.310 --> 00:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
driveway with fire department access
 
00:31:23.629 --> 00:31:23.639 align:start position:0%
things like that there was some there's
 
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:25.600 align:start position:0%
some stuff in statue that changed to
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
bring it down to 12 feet that happened
 
00:31:28.549 --> 00:31:28.559 align:start position:0%
last year but if the municipality
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
through the planning board decides that
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
like we want 14 or 16 or something like
 
00:31:34.269 --> 00:31:34.279 align:start position:0%
that uh that gets to be a problem I
 
00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
think um when they get into the weeds of
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
a sprinkler design or something like
 
00:31:40.509 --> 00:31:40.519 align:start position:0%
that that that kind of gets that seems
 
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
to be a problem for contractors owners
 
00:31:45.710 --> 00:31:45.720 align:start position:0%
and design professionals when and uh
 
00:31:47.509 --> 00:31:47.519 align:start position:0%
when the state fire code says one thing
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
and then they go uh to a much deeper
 
00:31:51.950 --> 00:31:51.960 align:start position:0%
level the ad administrative stuff that
 
00:31:54.830 --> 00:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
we think about is um what I think about
 
00:31:57.110 --> 00:31:57.120 align:start position:0%
it is the the pole station for the fire
 
00:31:59.029 --> 00:31:59.039 align:start position:0%
alarm that's out by the exit out here
 
00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:01.200 align:start position:0%
what type of key is it the what's what
 
00:32:03.830 --> 00:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
cylinder should it be uh the fire
 
00:32:05.190 --> 00:32:05.200 align:start position:0%
department connection for a sprinkler
 
00:32:07.230 --> 00:32:07.240 align:start position:0%
system is it a 4 in is it a 5 in is it
 
00:32:09.909 --> 00:32:09.919 align:start position:0%
two two you know two two and a halfs or
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
um uh you know the the key box that we
 
00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:17.679 align:start position:0%
the nox boxes is the common one but
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
there's different manufacturers key
 
00:32:21.269 --> 00:32:21.279 align:start position:0%
secure you know things like that just
 
00:32:23.789 --> 00:32:23.799 align:start position:0%
trying to be CL transparent with the the
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
people the you the end users of the
 
00:32:26.950 --> 00:32:26.960 align:start position:0%
codes I think some of that being there
 
00:32:28.830 --> 00:32:28.840 align:start position:0%
whether we call it regul what we call it
 
00:32:30.750 --> 00:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
but I think that's helpful for the end
 
00:32:32.669 --> 00:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
users that that's transparent at the
 
00:32:35.350 --> 00:32:35.360 align:start position:0%
local level um and the the current fire
 
00:32:38.230 --> 00:32:38.240 align:start position:0%
code says it's kind of up to the HJ so
 
00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
it I think that's the up to the HJ is a
 
00:32:42.710 --> 00:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
concern for a lot of people out there
 
00:32:44.509 --> 00:32:44.519 align:start position:0%
because it's like well I say one thing
 
00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:45.679 align:start position:0%
and another Fire official might say
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
another thing but if we can be more
 
00:32:49.230 --> 00:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
transparent of what the intent is at a
 
00:32:52.029 --> 00:32:52.039 align:start position:0%
local level uh that's I think that's
 
00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
important uh so does that mean that the
 
00:32:56.830 --> 00:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rules would be uh
 
00:32:58.990 --> 00:32:59.000 align:start position:0%
unamendable across the the entire State
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
and the technical uh codes would be the
 
00:33:03.870 --> 00:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
ones that would be amendable so uh thank
 
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
you so the technical codes would any
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
technical requests for changes would
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
come up through the State Building the
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
board of Fire Control and then so the
 
00:33:12.430 --> 00:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
board of Fire Control would receive an
 
00:33:14.549 --> 00:33:14.559 align:start position:0%
amendment have a public
 
00:33:16.830 --> 00:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
hearing decide whether it's makes sense
 
00:33:18.629 --> 00:33:18.639 align:start position:0%
or not to amend the state fire code it
 
00:33:20.070 --> 00:33:20.080 align:start position:0%
will come back to the general court for
 
00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
ratification in in that
 
00:33:24.310 --> 00:33:24.320 align:start position:0%
process administrative Amendment what
 
00:33:25.549 --> 00:33:25.559 align:start position:0%
kind of key you want for your pole
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
station or fire alarm panel could be
 
00:33:31.149 --> 00:33:31.159 align:start position:0%
handled with local level um that's sort
 
00:33:32.629 --> 00:33:32.639 align:start position:0%
of what we've been thinking about how to
 
00:33:34.509 --> 00:33:34.519 align:start position:0%
exactly phrase that still working I
 
00:33:35.549 --> 00:33:35.559 align:start position:0%
think we're still trying to figure that
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
out but um in the spirit of what's
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
trying to be done here just trying to
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
reserve some ability I think for some
 
00:33:43.509 --> 00:33:43.519 align:start position:0%
transparency at the local level so I'll
 
00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
use keep using the firearm example you
 
00:33:47.789 --> 00:33:47.799 align:start position:0%
come in and put all the wrong keys in
 
00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:49.960 align:start position:0%
right that and the fire alarm come say
 
00:33:51.870 --> 00:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
well we don't really have that key uh we
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
have this type of key and all the other
 
00:33:56.110 --> 00:33:56.120 align:start position:0%
buildings in the community um it you
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
know I think from a ease of use in
 
00:33:59.909 --> 00:33:59.919 align:start position:0%
operational efficiency perspective it
 
00:34:01.750 --> 00:34:01.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense to standardize key if the
 
00:34:03.149 --> 00:34:03.159 align:start position:0%
contractors know about that ahead of
 
00:34:04.590 --> 00:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
time they can say they can spe I want
 
00:34:07.509 --> 00:34:07.519 align:start position:0%
this cylinder and it's easy similar to a
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
a sprinkler connection or something like
 
00:34:11.790 --> 00:34:11.800 align:start position:0%
that um I can think of some examples on
 
00:34:13.629 --> 00:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
the fire system for the water supply to
 
00:34:16.109 --> 00:34:16.119 align:start position:0%
say like we we would like you know we
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
want a 20,000 or 30,000 gallon tank
 
00:34:19.829 --> 00:34:19.839 align:start position:0%
instead of being kind of all over the
 
00:34:22.550 --> 00:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
place some of those types of
 
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:28.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
I get that far Phil's wh right here so
 
00:34:33.069 --> 00:34:33.079 align:start position:0%
there's an international fire code that
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
a few of the bigger cities adopt right
 
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:38.240 align:start position:0%
now that's similar to NFPA 1 but it
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
helps with their local enforcement a
 
00:34:41.349 --> 00:34:41.359 align:start position:0%
little easier because it ties in the
 
00:34:45.190 --> 00:34:45.200 align:start position:0%
local standards we've uh we have allowed
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh as long as it doesn't conflict with
 
00:34:48.669 --> 00:34:48.679 align:start position:0%
the state fire code allow the
 
00:34:50.230 --> 00:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
communities to currently adopt that at
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
the local level similar to as we talked
 
00:34:54.349 --> 00:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
about like the property maintenance code
 
00:34:56.430 --> 00:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
that a it's up to leave it up to you
 
00:35:02.109 --> 00:35:02.119 align:start position:0%
guys as far as you know as policy-wise
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:10.910 --> 00:35:10.920 align:start position:0%
but okay so um amending the fire code
 
00:35:12.950 --> 00:35:12.960 align:start position:0%
placement um
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
language um you had mentioned that
 
00:35:17.829 --> 00:35:17.839 align:start position:0%
there's a Senate bill that may be more
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do your Amendment through
 
00:35:22.030 --> 00:35:22.040 align:start position:0%
is that correct instead of the one we're
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
working on here yeah thank you so
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow there's a senate uh Hearing in
 
00:35:30.710 --> 00:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
Edna um the Senate Bill 94 I believe
 
00:35:33.310 --> 00:35:33.320 align:start position:0%
that has uh is doing a very similar
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
thing to restrict local amendments it
 
00:35:37.270 --> 00:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
does specifically call the fire code in
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
that bill so um this where this one
 
00:35:41.910 --> 00:35:41.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't it just fire code I think is
 
00:35:43.230 --> 00:35:43.240 align:start position:0%
sort of in there but it doesn't
 
00:35:44.750 --> 00:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
explicitly talk about the fire code
 
00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:45.920 align:start position:0%
maybe that would be a more appropriate
 
00:35:47.150 --> 00:35:47.160 align:start position:0%
place we can do it and then would clean
 
00:35:49.109 --> 00:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
up in the end through through the
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
process I'm happy to work with the uh
 
00:35:53.910 --> 00:35:53.920 align:start position:0%
Senate on that thank you thank you are
 
00:35:55.950 --> 00:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
00:36:01.510 --> 00:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
you a discussion on this particular
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment sounds like sounds to me like
 
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.400 align:start position:0%
at a minimum we got to change the uh
 
00:36:12.430 --> 00:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
that effective date of the paragraph As
 
00:36:14.710 --> 00:36:14.720 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Sherman said just as a as a
 
00:36:18.630 --> 00:36:18.640 align:start position:0%
technical change to the bill but uh he
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
seems done a pretty good job as far as
 
00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:21.430 align:start position:0%
seems done a pretty good job as far as
I'm

00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:24.560 align:start position:0%
concerned uh are there copies of the uh
 
00:36:26.750 --> 00:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
the bill up front or there's copies of
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
the bill but not what of his amend
 
00:36:31.630 --> 00:36:31.640 align:start position:0%
changes I got this off the where did I
 
00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
get it I sent it to you oh you yeah okay
 
00:36:36.670 --> 00:36:36.680 align:start position:0%
that's right because I don't have
 
00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:39.000 align:start position:0%
legislative email I got to go to it to
 
00:36:42.230 --> 00:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
get that straightened out um I can email
 
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:43.960 align:start position:0%
you it yes that would be appreciate
 
00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
thank you okay um are you comfortable
 
00:36:49.950 --> 00:36:49.960 align:start position:0%
voting before you get the copy do you
 
00:36:52.870 --> 00:36:52.880 align:start position:0%
understand enough to I don't know
 
00:36:54.349 --> 00:36:54.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily if I would feel comfortable
 
00:36:56.550 --> 00:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
voting before I had an opportunity to
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
fully read everything
 
00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:01.160 align:start position:0%
okay so you're not comfortable making a
 
00:37:03.750 --> 00:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh at this moment no I I
 
00:37:06.109 --> 00:37:06.119 align:start position:0%
mean personally I think like uh it it
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be beneficial to have an
 
00:37:09.910 --> 00:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to read everything first so
 
00:37:11.910 --> 00:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
uh maybe if we could come back to this
 
00:37:14.069 --> 00:37:14.079 align:start position:0%
uh if if we could have an emailed out
 
00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%
now and then uh come back to this a
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
little bit later so that we can kind of
 
00:37:19.870 --> 00:37:19.880 align:start position:0%
read it
 
00:37:22.230 --> 00:37:22.240 align:start position:0%
uh at least sometime before we finish
 
00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.550 --> 00:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay um I might suggest that
 
00:37:35.990 --> 00:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
we have a standup meeting before regular
 
00:37:38.870 --> 00:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh Edna meeting to because I don't think
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative Howard is going to be
 
00:37:42.790 --> 00:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
surprised or upset but I think we should
 
00:37:45.430 --> 00:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
observe due process and we want this
 
00:37:48.390 --> 00:37:48.400 align:start position:0%
we'd like this changed so it'll I'm
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
suggesting a standup meeting before our
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
next Edna meeting to to wrap this up but
 
00:37:57.990 --> 00:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm satisfied with it I don't see
 
00:38:00.510 --> 00:38:00.520 align:start position:0%
representative dargy or Davis jumping up
 
00:38:03.030 --> 00:38:03.040 align:start position:0%
and down and I think we should
 
00:38:05.829 --> 00:38:05.839 align:start position:0%
accommodate representative Howard so
 
00:38:08.990 --> 00:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
agree I I I do agree with your uh your
 
00:38:10.790 --> 00:38:10.800 align:start position:0%
comments representative scitech I don't
 
00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:12.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily think that there's going to
 
00:38:14.510 --> 00:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
be too much of an issue it's just again
 
00:38:25.390 --> 00:38:25.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:28.990 --> 00:38:29.000 align:start position:0%
you yes can we ask Mr Sherman to uh take
 
00:38:31.510 --> 00:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
a walk over to OS and do our work for us
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
and get
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
a oh no we have to do it don't we yes so
 
00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:38.520 align:start position:0%
I will I will take a walk over and then
 
00:38:40.910 --> 00:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
we will schedule um another meeting
 
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:43.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting before we bring it
 
00:38:45.510 --> 00:38:45.520 align:start position:0%
before the whole committee does that
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
sound good okay thank
 
00:39:02.950 --> 00:39:02.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:04.470 --> 00:39:04.480 align:start position:0%
Mr Sherman would you like to come back
 
00:39:10.630 --> 00:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:13.390 --> 00:39:13.400 align:start position:0%
you madam chair members of the committee
 
00:39:14.950 --> 00:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
Phil Sherman chair of the building code
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
review board
 
00:39:21.870 --> 00:39:21.880 align:start position:0%
um I'll refer today to the 67x series
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
just because it uses fewer syllables but
 
00:39:27.670 --> 00:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
it's basically 6 RSA 671 through
 
00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359 align:start position:0%
wherever it ends
 
00:39:33.950 --> 00:39:33.960 align:start position:0%
679 um back in the day before
 
00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:36.160 align:start position:0%
2002 uh when the first Statewide
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
building code was adopted much of the
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
municipal actions uh to adopt a building
 
00:39:45.630 --> 00:39:45.640 align:start position:0%
code were splattered through the 67x
 
00:39:49.030 --> 00:39:49.040 align:start position:0%
series many of those still remain today
 
00:39:51.109 --> 00:39:51.119 align:start position:0%
so the enforcement mechanism we talked
 
00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
about on the last bill um appeals Roots
 
00:39:58.150 --> 00:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh that kind of stuff just is all over
 
00:40:02.230 --> 00:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
the place in there uh we heard from many
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
of the building officials that there is
 
00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:07.319 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion in the enforcement
 
00:40:07.319 --> 00:40:08.510 align:start position:0%
a lot of confusion in the enforcement
Community

00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
Community
 
00:40:11.589 --> 00:40:11.599 align:start position:0%
particularly um especially because some
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
of these folks wear two hats they
 
00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:15.240 align:start position:0%
they're both the building inspector and
 
00:40:17.750 --> 00:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
the zoning administrator and it's
 
00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:19.800 align:start position:0%
difficult to parse out when you're
 
00:40:22.990 --> 00:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
operating in which Arena uh furthermore
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
some of the municipal actions sit in 67x
 
00:40:28.510 --> 00:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
and some sit in
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
155a so this was an exercise that that
 
00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.240 align:start position:0%
at a at a global level was intended to
 
00:40:37.150 --> 00:40:37.160 align:start position:0%
be nothing but editorial to take all the
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
building code stuff out of the 67x
 
00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:42.200 align:start position:0%
series and find a home in some kind of
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
order in
 
00:40:46.870 --> 00:40:46.880 align:start position:0%
155a some of those sections we propose
 
00:40:49.589 --> 00:40:49.599 align:start position:0%
moving ahead of time just in in
 
00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:52.400 align:start position:0%
428 um so that's all this bill was
 
00:40:54.470 --> 00:40:54.480 align:start position:0%
intended to do as I understand it and
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
I'm not digested the other stuff that
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
was added into the actual bill but
 
00:41:01.150 --> 00:41:01.160 align:start position:0%
there's some other tentacles in there
 
00:41:02.910 --> 00:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
that got added by someone somewhere
 
00:41:04.910 --> 00:41:04.920 align:start position:0%
along the way that I'm not here to talk
 
00:41:07.430 --> 00:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
about but the general intent is to
 
00:41:09.790 --> 00:41:09.800 align:start position:0%
Simply take the building you know
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
building inspector building codes
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
building code Boards of appeal things
 
00:41:19.510 --> 00:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
like that and move it into uh 155a
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
without changing anybody's
 
00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:24.200 align:start position:0%
responsibilities so this bill is if we
 
00:41:26.349 --> 00:41:26.359 align:start position:0%
got it right does not change anybody's
 
00:41:26.359 --> 00:41:28.430 align:start position:0%
got it right does not change anybody's
responsibilities

00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
here's the issue that I see um it
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
resulted in about 20s something pages of
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
ink that got added to
 
00:41:38.829 --> 00:41:38.839 align:start position:0%
155a and in my reading of it I don't
 
00:41:41.589 --> 00:41:41.599 align:start position:0%
think we need a lot of that the land use
 
00:41:44.910 --> 00:41:44.920 align:start position:0%
chapters have you know a long history of
 
00:41:47.109 --> 00:41:47.119 align:start position:0%
of a legal context that's grown up
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
around zoning appeals and all that kind
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
of stuff much of which may not be
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
necessary for a building code appeal uh
 
00:41:58.670 --> 00:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
particularly on the appeal side so I
 
00:42:01.390 --> 00:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
think that with the time to put a lot of
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%
eyes on this because we need we need
 
00:42:05.950 --> 00:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
educated eyes from the landu side from
 
00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:07.560 align:start position:0%
the enforcement community and from the
 
00:42:09.870 --> 00:42:09.880 align:start position:0%
code writing Community to make sure we
 
00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
get it right uh we can shrink that down
 
00:42:14.670 --> 00:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
and give everybody a package that they
 
00:42:16.950 --> 00:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
want and the zoning stuff stays the way
 
00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:19.240 align:start position:0%
it is all we did was just edit out
 
00:42:21.990 --> 00:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
building code stuff as we went along uh
 
00:42:25.589 --> 00:42:25.599 align:start position:0%
if we got it right um so I I I certainly
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
would support you know defer ing this
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
TimeWise to where we have time to to
 
00:42:32.870 --> 00:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
just get a lot of people to look at this
 
00:42:35.150 --> 00:42:35.160 align:start position:0%
the municipal Association has offered
 
00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
some time uh with their people who
 
00:42:40.390 --> 00:42:40.400 align:start position:0%
really get into both sides of this thing
 
00:42:43.150 --> 00:42:43.160 align:start position:0%
to look at it um but they indicate to me
 
00:42:44.510 --> 00:42:44.520 align:start position:0%
that that's going to take some number of
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
months to you know to come up with that
 
00:42:47.079 --> 00:42:47.990 align:start position:0%
months to you know to come up with that
that

00:42:47.990 --> 00:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
support so that's where we are on this
 
00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
today any questions or
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
discussion so you're we're suggest
 
00:43:01.910 --> 00:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
putting uh putting this not um to in
 
00:43:04.470 --> 00:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
study well I'm suggesting that perhaps
 
00:43:07.309 --> 00:43:07.319 align:start position:0%
we um recommend to retain this bill
 
00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119 align:start position:0%
retain sorry so that more eyes can look
 
00:43:12.910 --> 00:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
at it and you know edit
 
00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:15.440 align:start position:0%
it yeah I think if we could work on this
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
over the summer uh we would come out of
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
it with a with a good package
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
that I haven't heard anybody who's
 
00:43:24.270 --> 00:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
disagreed with the premise of it but
 
00:43:26.390 --> 00:43:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of ink moving around in
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:46.349 --> 00:43:46.359 align:start position:0%
um um so could we vote uh do a vote to
 
00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:56.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:00.109 --> 00:44:00.119 align:start position:0%
bill second that okay uh representative
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.390 align:start position:0%
 
to

00:44:07.390 --> 00:44:07.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
oh we'll vote out to show a hand so 5 Z
 
00:44:19.190 --> 00:44:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:27.750 --> 00:44:27.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:29.790 --> 00:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
the last bill to discuss today is House
 
00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:30.750 align:start position:0%
the last bill to discuss today is House
Bill

00:44:30.750 --> 00:44:30.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:44:34.670 --> 00:44:34.680 align:start position:0%
96 oh actually with respect to our very
 
00:44:38.390 --> 00:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
first bill do we what where is what is
 
00:44:40.990 --> 00:44:41.000 align:start position:0%
its status because we didn't really vote
 
00:44:43.150 --> 00:44:43.160 align:start position:0%
that we just we're going to have another
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting so correct I'm
 
00:44:49.390 --> 00:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
going toing bring it to OS to have a um
 
00:44:52.230 --> 00:44:52.240 align:start position:0%
an official draft Amendment and then we
 
00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
will look at it discuss it and uh take a
 
00:44:57.069 --> 00:44:57.079 align:start position:0%
vote to bring back to the committee
 
00:44:57.079 --> 00:44:58.790 align:start position:0%
vote to bring back to the committee
recessed

00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
recessed
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
here move to
 
00:45:07.910 --> 00:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:10.950 --> 00:45:10.960 align:start position:0%
hb9 once again I'd like to call uh Mr
 
00:45:15.910 --> 00:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:18.270 --> 00:45:18.280 align:start position:0%
table Phil Sherman chair of the building
 
00:45:20.470 --> 00:45:20.480 align:start position:0%
code review board
 
00:45:23.069 --> 00:45:23.079 align:start position:0%
um I'm not here to take a position on
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
this bill uh I'm here to provide uh
 
00:45:30.030 --> 00:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
technical backup for you all um and the
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
one thing that I was asked to just
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
explain to the to the committee here
 
00:45:37.549 --> 00:45:37.559 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is our cycle of reviewing
 
00:45:40.270 --> 00:45:40.280 align:start position:0%
the updated energy code so we are are as
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
of this coming month starting our review
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:48.200 align:start position:0%
2024 uh ICC codes building code and so
 
00:45:51.750 --> 00:45:51.760 align:start position:0%
forth energy code among that um the
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
schedule would lead to a submittal to
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
The Advisory the legislative advisory
 
00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:57.710 align:start position:0%
The Advisory the legislative advisory
committee

00:45:57.710 --> 00:45:57.720 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:46:01.030 --> 00:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
uh around November 1st shortly before
 
00:46:03.790 --> 00:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
that uh and then through the next spring
 
00:46:06.549 --> 00:46:06.559 align:start position:0%
of 2026 the legislature does their thing
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
and then the codes presumably would be
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
updated or not U the following July 1 um
 
00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
so that's that's just information for
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
you so um in looking at this um perhaps
 
00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is a little premature in
 
00:46:25.589 --> 00:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
nature because you're still reviewing it
 
00:46:27.790 --> 00:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
you you'll still have another year or so
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
to go through the
 
00:46:33.589 --> 00:46:33.599 align:start position:0%
process of looking at this
 
00:46:37.670 --> 00:46:37.680 align:start position:0%
code this code proposes to adopt a 2021
 
00:46:40.069 --> 00:46:40.079 align:start position:0%
Edition you you may remember we're on
 
00:46:44.069 --> 00:46:44.079 align:start position:0%
the 2018 now we held it back last year
 
00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:46.920 align:start position:0%
it's published every three years um so
 
00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:50.200 align:start position:0%
this this proposes the 2021
 
00:46:52.549 --> 00:46:52.559 align:start position:0%
International energy conservation code
 
00:46:55.309 --> 00:46:55.319 align:start position:0%
we're reviewing the 2024 we reviewed
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
2021 last year here so effectively our
 
00:47:01.510 --> 00:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
our committee within the bcrb is is
 
00:47:04.069 --> 00:47:04.079 align:start position:0%
looking at a jump of of two additions
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
and the impact of
 
00:47:09.670 --> 00:47:09.680 align:start position:0%
that is the energy code part of the
 
00:47:12.430 --> 00:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
building code or is
 
00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:20.309 align:start position:0%
building code or is
separate

00:47:20.309 --> 00:47:20.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.829 --> 00:47:22.839 align:start position:0%
yes the the New Hampshire State Building
 
00:47:25.309 --> 00:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
Code consists of eight codes seven of
 
00:47:27.990 --> 00:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
them uh prom ated by the International
 
00:47:29.589 --> 00:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
Code Council the building code the
 
00:47:31.829 --> 00:47:31.839 align:start position:0%
residential code the energy code among
 
00:47:34.510 --> 00:47:34.520 align:start position:0%
those the electrical code is p published
 
00:47:36.190 --> 00:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
by the National Fire Protection
 
00:47:38.390 --> 00:47:38.400 align:start position:0%
Association that's the eighth code that
 
00:47:39.910 --> 00:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
we're actually updating with other
 
00:47:44.470 --> 00:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
legislation this year um within that
 
00:47:47.309 --> 00:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
pile of codes though there's a hierarchy
 
00:47:49.349 --> 00:47:49.359 align:start position:0%
where things flow out of the building
 
00:47:52.870 --> 00:47:52.880 align:start position:0%
code so if if I go to the electrical
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
code they don't have some of the
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
administrative functions on permitting
 
00:47:58.589 --> 00:47:58.599 align:start position:0%
and things things like that that's
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
located in the in the building code so
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
by Statute there's eight codes in the in
 
00:48:07.470 --> 00:48:07.480 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code eight model
 
00:48:11.549 --> 00:48:11.559 align:start position:0%
codes but in in practice in the field
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
they come through a hierarchy where the
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
building code then says go here go here
 
00:48:15.839 --> 00:48:16.710 align:start position:0%
building code then says go here go here
go

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
here mostly for the administrative
 
00:48:23.510 --> 00:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
stuff is that confusing enough and where
 
00:48:26.150 --> 00:48:26.160 align:start position:0%
does energy fit into that energy is one
 
00:48:28.750 --> 00:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
of these codes that's published by the
 
00:48:31.349 --> 00:48:31.359 align:start position:0%
International Code Council So currently
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
we're on the
 
00:48:36.109 --> 00:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
2021 ICC codes except for energy which
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
we held back you all held back at at the
 
00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:41.470 align:start position:0%
we held back you all held back at at the
2018

00:48:41.470 --> 00:48:41.480 align:start position:0%
2018
 
00:48:44.710 --> 00:48:44.720 align:start position:0%
code right so if we'll just say if this
 
00:48:47.470 --> 00:48:47.480 align:start position:0%
bill passes and goes into effect um it
 
00:48:49.510 --> 00:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
would only be in effect for a year is
 
00:48:53.109 --> 00:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
that correct if the if the 2024 code
 
00:48:55.670 --> 00:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
predes it would be in effect for roughly
 
00:48:57.430 --> 00:48:57.440 align:start position:0%
a year yeah
 
00:48:57.440 --> 00:48:59.030 align:start position:0%
a year yeah
okay

00:48:59.030 --> 00:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:49:01.589 --> 00:49:01.599 align:start position:0%
thank representative
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
darg uh during the testimony uh various
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
people uh discussed uh the cost of going
 
00:49:12.349 --> 00:49:12.359 align:start position:0%
from 2018 to 2021 there were different
 
00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
uh opinions as to what the the added
 
00:49:19.589 --> 00:49:19.599 align:start position:0%
cost is does your group have a an idea
 
00:49:23.789 --> 00:49:23.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:28.109 --> 00:49:28.119 align:start position:0%
is so my my function primarily is to
 
00:49:31.510 --> 00:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
manage the process
 
00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
um we we took when during the discussion
 
00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760 align:start position:0%
about whether to adopt the 2021 code we
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
took testimony through the committee and
 
00:49:43.670 --> 00:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
then at the board uh through numerous
 
00:49:46.589 --> 00:49:46.599 align:start position:0%
people from every side of the equation
 
00:49:48.670 --> 00:49:48.680 align:start position:0%
and all I can can report is that the
 
00:49:54.109 --> 00:49:54.119 align:start position:0%
vote was N9 to4 to stay on the 2018 code
 
00:49:56.390 --> 00:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
so there were there were opposing views
 
00:50:00.069 --> 00:50:00.079 align:start position:0%
Pres presented as they continue to be um
 
00:50:00.079 --> 00:50:00.870 align:start position:0%
Pres presented as they continue to be um
were

00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
were
 
00:50:05.069 --> 00:50:05.079 align:start position:0%
there various discrepancies on uh cost
 
00:50:07.630 --> 00:50:07.640 align:start position:0%
estimates at that time
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
also there were differences of of what
 
00:50:13.829 --> 00:50:13.839 align:start position:0%
was being reported
 
00:50:16.349 --> 00:50:16.359 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
you R scitec um basically I I've thought
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
about I took the minutes for it I
 
00:50:24.750 --> 00:50:24.760 align:start position:0%
listened to people and I don't really
 
00:50:27.950 --> 00:50:27.960 align:start position:0%
know whom to trust
 
00:50:27.960 --> 00:50:29.710 align:start position:0%
know whom to trust
because

00:50:29.710 --> 00:50:29.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
um there's more than with most bills it
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
seems that there's stuff that I will
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
never know really what's going on I
 
00:50:42.829 --> 00:50:42.839 align:start position:0%
heard one person say 177,000 another
 
00:50:45.230 --> 00:50:45.240 align:start position:0%
person said 2300 and they were both
 
00:50:48.549 --> 00:50:48.559 align:start position:0%
quoting repres Senator Shaheen if this
 
00:50:50.430 --> 00:50:50.440 align:start position:0%
bill really costs
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
$2,300 none of us would be here we'd be
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
all at Dunkin Donuts nobody believe I
 
00:50:57.549 --> 00:50:57.559 align:start position:0%
don't believe $2,300 I don't know if I
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
can believe
 
00:51:01.309 --> 00:51:01.319 align:start position:0%
177,000 so I
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
am uh I am basically
 
00:51:11.109 --> 00:51:11.119 align:start position:0%
suspicious that this is um that this is
 
00:51:14.789 --> 00:51:14.799 align:start position:0%
a good measure if this is only intended
 
00:51:17.630 --> 00:51:17.640 align:start position:0%
to save energy we're not talking about
 
00:51:20.670 --> 00:51:20.680 align:start position:0%
1955 with single pane windows we're
 
00:51:24.030 --> 00:51:24.040 align:start position:0%
chasing the last few percent even in
 
00:51:27.309 --> 00:51:27.319 align:start position:0%
2018 people were very ener she conscious
 
00:51:30.230 --> 00:51:30.240 align:start position:0%
ever since the oil embargo we've been
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
watching energy and I don't know that
 
00:51:37.549 --> 00:51:37.559 align:start position:0%
the state needs to tell consumers we're
 
00:51:40.230 --> 00:51:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to chase your last everyone we're
 
00:51:42.349 --> 00:51:42.359 align:start position:0%
going to chase now I'm not talking I'm
 
00:51:43.950 --> 00:51:43.960 align:start position:0%
not talking to you Mr Sherman I'm
 
00:51:46.990 --> 00:51:47.000 align:start position:0%
talking to the committee really that I
 
00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:48.390 align:start position:0%
talking to the committee really that I
just

00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:51:51.230 --> 00:51:51.240 align:start position:0%
don't I have I don't know whom to trust
 
00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
I think we're chasing the last few
 
00:51:55.789 --> 00:51:55.799 align:start position:0%
percent and I'll let the cons my
 
00:51:58.069 --> 00:51:58.079 align:start position:0%
personal opinion is let the consumer
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
Chase it for himself and his Builder
 
00:52:03.630 --> 00:52:03.640 align:start position:0%
we're not we're not talking 19 again
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
1956 with single pain drafty windows so
 
00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
here I am it's just a I don't I don't
 
00:52:13.549 --> 00:52:13.559 align:start position:0%
believe the bill or believe I don't know
 
00:52:16.589 --> 00:52:16.599 align:start position:0%
whom to trust thank
 
00:52:19.710 --> 00:52:19.720 align:start position:0%
you yes representative uh thank you for
 
00:52:22.630 --> 00:52:22.640 align:start position:0%
taking my uh question so I understand
 
00:52:24.789 --> 00:52:24.799 align:start position:0%
that you've been kind of uh suggesting
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
that we move over to the 2024 energy
 
00:52:30.390 --> 00:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
code no please don't misunderstand me
 
00:52:32.910 --> 00:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
our board is only starting the review of
 
00:52:36.030 --> 00:52:36.040 align:start position:0%
the 2024 which is required by Statute
 
00:52:38.549 --> 00:52:38.559 align:start position:0%
okay so no decisions no recommendations
 
00:52:40.589 --> 00:52:40.599 align:start position:0%
are coming out of either me or the board
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
at this point so let let me let me
 
00:52:46.270 --> 00:52:46.280 align:start position:0%
clarify uh so I understand that you're
 
00:52:49.589 --> 00:52:49.599 align:start position:0%
reviewing the uh the 2024 uh codes right
 
00:52:53.150 --> 00:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
now and that you're going to produce a
 
00:52:55.870 --> 00:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh after you finish those
 
00:52:58.990 --> 00:52:59.000 align:start position:0%
so my question is would you prefer that
 
00:53:01.230 --> 00:53:01.240 align:start position:0%
we wait until those recommendations come
 
00:53:04.589 --> 00:53:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
action I I would prefer to bypass that
 
00:53:10.750 --> 00:53:10.760 align:start position:0%
question I I think it's a decision for
 
00:53:12.710 --> 00:53:12.720 align:start position:0%
you thank you appreciate that walking a
 
00:53:16.150 --> 00:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
bit of a tight rope here so thank you Mr
 
00:53:18.829 --> 00:53:18.839 align:start position:0%
Sherman thank you any other questions
 
00:53:21.750 --> 00:53:21.760 align:start position:0%
for Mr Sherman no thank you thank you
 
00:53:24.549 --> 00:53:24.559 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that um you know you've
 
00:53:27.030 --> 00:53:27.040 align:start position:0%
made a good point as there still re
 
00:53:29.630 --> 00:53:29.640 align:start position:0%
reviewing 2024 I think that you've made
 
00:53:32.910 --> 00:53:32.920 align:start position:0%
good points especially that uh we do
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
know that we are in a housing crisis in
 
00:53:39.069 --> 00:53:39.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and adding any extra costs
 
00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
in a mandate form um is not going to
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
help the the crisis especially since
 
00:53:47.230 --> 00:53:47.240 align:start position:0%
people are free to you know incorporate
 
00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:49.640 align:start position:0%
these codes when they're building their
 
00:53:54.030 --> 00:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:03.990 --> 00:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.150 --> 00:54:06.160 align:start position:0%
um I think he did that during the
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:13.309 --> 00:54:13.319 align:start position:0%
ahead yes this is this is exp parte
 
00:54:16.150 --> 00:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
we're hearing him we're not hearing is
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
we either have a full hearing or not let
 
00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.470 align:start position:0%
we either have a full hearing or not let
him

00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
him
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
speak uh my name is Paul beus I'm
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
ex-president of the ashray New Hampshire
 
00:54:27.630 --> 00:54:27.640 align:start position:0%
ashray organization I'm not a lobbyist
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.150 align:start position:0%
 
information

00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:54:37.030 --> 00:54:37.040 align:start position:0%
yes I have substantiation documentation
 
00:54:39.230 --> 00:54:39.240 align:start position:0%
here on substantiating that I'd like to
 
00:54:40.630 --> 00:54:40.640 align:start position:0%
share the I you shared that with the
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
committee already didn't you in your
 
00:54:44.150 --> 00:54:44.160 align:start position:0%
testim Shar it with the chair yeah and I
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
think she um distributed it yes okay so
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
if you have if are there any different
 
00:54:51.190 --> 00:54:51.200 align:start position:0%
numbers that you have for us today or is
 
00:54:52.510 --> 00:54:52.520 align:start position:0%
there's a couple different reports
 
00:54:54.349 --> 00:54:54.359 align:start position:0%
there's also a report that compares the
 
00:54:55.870 --> 00:54:55.880 align:start position:0%
two methods that were used for cost
 
00:54:55.880 --> 00:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
two methods that were used for cost
analysis

00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:54:59.109 --> 00:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
that I think would be
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
Germain Mr beamus do you think it's
 
00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:02.589 align:start position:0%
Germain Mr beamus do you think it's
worth

00:55:02.589 --> 00:55:02.599 align:start position:0%
worth
 
00:55:06.109 --> 00:55:06.119 align:start position:0%
$2,300 uh to have a
 
00:55:09.270 --> 00:55:09.280 align:start position:0%
bill mandating this for everybody
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
through this for all new housing in the
 
00:55:13.030 --> 00:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
state if that is that why you're here
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
for2 yes yes I'm here to for one thing
 
00:55:18.870 --> 00:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
get the codes consistent right now we
 
00:55:21.710 --> 00:55:21.720 align:start position:0%
have 2018 for energy in 2021 for
 
00:55:24.470 --> 00:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
everything else Energy Efficiency is
 
00:55:27.150 --> 00:55:27.160 align:start position:0%
important it's actually a 15%
 
00:55:29.630 --> 00:55:29.640 align:start position:0%
uh Improvement in Energy Efficiency not
 
00:55:31.829 --> 00:55:31.839 align:start position:0%
small numbers it's a 15% Improvement in
 
00:55:34.309 --> 00:55:34.319 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and it also is
 
00:55:36.270 --> 00:55:36.280 align:start position:0%
important for for the health of the
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
individuals which is not included in a
 
00:55:40.950 --> 00:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
simple six-year payback cost kind of
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
analysis health of the occupants is uh
 
00:55:46.549 --> 00:55:46.559 align:start position:0%
important here and this 2021 code
 
00:55:48.230 --> 00:55:48.240 align:start position:0%
improves The Vapor Barrier which
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
improves human health by providing
 
00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:53.000 align:start position:0%
better indoor air quality thank you I
 
00:55:54.670 --> 00:55:54.680 align:start position:0%
think you mentioned that in your
 
00:55:58.150 --> 00:55:58.160 align:start position:0%
testimony at the hearing mhm
 
00:56:01.670 --> 00:56:01.680 align:start position:0%
so I U will pass these out I guess to
 
00:56:02.829 --> 00:56:02.839 align:start position:0%
make sure sure you can pass them out
 
00:56:02.839 --> 00:56:38.829 align:start position:0%
make sure sure you can pass them out
sure

00:56:38.829 --> 00:56:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
part of my point here is information
 
00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
equality everybody getting the same
 
00:56:45.510 --> 00:56:45.520 align:start position:0%
level of information I'm not sure this
 
00:56:47.109 --> 00:56:47.119 align:start position:0%
level of information was known when the
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
discussion took place at the building
 
00:56:51.829 --> 00:56:51.839 align:start position:0%
review board originally there are two
 
00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:54.000 align:start position:0%
documents here the first one is
 
00:56:56.349 --> 00:56:56.359 align:start position:0%
from the Department of energy talking
 
00:56:58.109 --> 00:56:58.119 align:start position:0%
about costs associated with this you'll
 
00:57:01.430 --> 00:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
notice the cost of $2,300 is actually an
 
00:57:03.549 --> 00:57:03.559 align:start position:0%
average it's actually lower than that
 
00:57:07.150 --> 00:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
for our climate zone and uh also the
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
original report that was cited by um the
 
00:57:14.270 --> 00:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
committee subcommittee was uh
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
overstating cost quite a bit
 
00:57:20.870 --> 00:57:20.880 align:start position:0%
y thank you for taking my question so I
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
know that in uh some of these documents
 
00:57:25.630 --> 00:57:25.640 align:start position:0%
it's referencing 30 years for a lot of
 
00:57:26.750 --> 00:57:26.760 align:start position:0%
the numberers
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
uh is there an estimated uh average
 
00:57:31.670 --> 00:57:31.680 align:start position:0%
return as to how much somebody would be
 
00:57:33.510 --> 00:57:33.520 align:start position:0%
likely to save over that
 
00:57:36.510 --> 00:57:36.520 align:start position:0%
period yes um there's quite a bit of
 
00:57:38.309 --> 00:57:38.319 align:start position:0%
savings over the period I mean you're
 
00:57:40.630 --> 00:57:40.640 align:start position:0%
looking at an individual cost in the
 
00:57:42.109 --> 00:57:42.119 align:start position:0%
range of $
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
11,200 if you uh actually use a mortgage
 
00:57:48.589 --> 00:57:48.599 align:start position:0%
and and borrow money to to do these you
 
00:57:50.750 --> 00:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
know if the incremental cost were added
 
00:57:53.309 --> 00:57:53.319 align:start position:0%
to your mortgage your payback uh in
 
00:57:54.990 --> 00:57:55.000 align:start position:0%
terms of cash would take place within
 
00:57:57.950 --> 00:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
two years uh typically six years a
 
00:58:00.870 --> 00:58:00.880 align:start position:0%
simple payback but simple payback is not
 
00:58:02.829 --> 00:58:02.839 align:start position:0%
a great method to use here because it
 
00:58:06.109 --> 00:58:06.119 align:start position:0%
does not include life cycle savings like
 
00:58:07.829 --> 00:58:07.839 align:start position:0%
life cycle savings over the life of the
 
00:58:10.470 --> 00:58:10.480 align:start position:0%
home or building are in more of the
 
00:58:13.430 --> 00:58:13.440 align:start position:0%
range of $30,000 20 to $30,000 over the
 
00:58:15.670 --> 00:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
life let me let me also just point out
 
00:58:17.150 --> 00:58:17.160 align:start position:0%
that this extends the life of the
 
00:58:20.430 --> 00:58:20.440 align:start position:0%
building uh upwards of about 30 years
 
00:58:23.470 --> 00:58:23.480 align:start position:0%
because it eliminates the ability for
 
00:58:25.870 --> 00:58:25.880 align:start position:0%
the building to absorb moisture in both
 
00:58:27.390 --> 00:58:27.400 align:start position:0%
Direction directions which causes mold
 
00:58:30.390 --> 00:58:30.400 align:start position:0%
and rot so proper Vapor Barrier is very
 
00:58:32.630 --> 00:58:32.640 align:start position:0%
important in terms of being able to
 
00:58:35.870 --> 00:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
manage not only indoor air quality but
 
00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
also extend the life of the building
 
00:58:39.470 --> 00:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
through the elimination of moisture
 
00:58:41.670 --> 00:58:41.680 align:start position:0%
coming in and out of the
 
00:58:43.990 --> 00:58:44.000 align:start position:0%
walls representative
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
scitec Mr beamus I'm thinking about this
 
00:58:51.829 --> 00:58:51.839 align:start position:0%
and my uh sense is you've made those
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
points and I really have to think about
 
00:58:59.190 --> 00:58:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:02.309 --> 00:59:02.319 align:start position:0%
I as you can tell I'm not fan of this
 
00:59:06.630 --> 00:59:06.640 align:start position:0%
but I'm not sitting here because I don't
 
00:59:09.349 --> 00:59:09.359 align:start position:0%
want to listen have to listen to people
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
I think my feeling on this is uh not
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
personally is not yet I really want to
 
00:59:18.950 --> 00:59:18.960 align:start position:0%
know more about this I'm hearing you I
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
want to I'm not sure what kind of
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
research I'm going to do uh but I'd like
 
00:59:25.510 --> 00:59:25.520 align:start position:0%
to get you and Maybury in the same room
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
and see who comes out on top basically
 
00:59:33.150 --> 00:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
is kind of we're okay in some sense I I
 
00:59:35.549 --> 00:59:35.559 align:start position:0%
mean I know where you both are I'm
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
certainly willing to do that I'm not I'm
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
not prepared for this yet I uh I want to
 
00:59:41.280 --> 00:59:42.829 align:start position:0%
not prepared for this yet I uh I want to
give

00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
give
 
00:59:45.870 --> 00:59:45.880 align:start position:0%
this I have to think about this I
 
00:59:47.910 --> 00:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate that consideration is really
 
00:59:50.109 --> 00:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
what I think makes sense I'm trying to
 
00:59:52.309 --> 00:59:52.319 align:start position:0%
Simply make sure everybody has the same
 
00:59:55.109 --> 00:59:55.119 align:start position:0%
information uh on the topic yeah we do
 
01:00:03.109 --> 01:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.390 --> 01:00:06.400 align:start position:0%
all right um I understand but this isn't
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
a hearing so we're going to cut off test
 
01:00:10.950 --> 01:00:10.960 align:start position:0%
testimony right we're not going to be
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:27.430 --> 01:00:27.440 align:start position:0%
discussion oh I I mean I think that it's
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
there there have been some key points
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
that have been brought up I mean a we
 
01:00:33.029 --> 01:00:33.039 align:start position:0%
have to consider the fact that the uh
 
01:00:35.430 --> 01:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
building code review board is looking at
 
01:00:38.430 --> 01:00:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh the 2024 codes right now and they are
 
01:00:40.230 --> 01:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
going to be providing recommendations
 
01:00:44.390 --> 01:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
next year so it is something where uh do
 
01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
we want to hold off but at the same time
 
01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know looking at how we have pass
 
01:00:52.630 --> 01:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
a number of the other codes up to the
 
01:00:56.309 --> 01:00:56.319 align:start position:0%
2021 uh time period it is kind of
 
01:00:57.990 --> 01:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
something where we have lagged behind a
 
01:01:00.349 --> 01:01:00.359 align:start position:0%
little bit on this I do think that there
 
01:01:02.470 --> 01:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
are some good points that have been made
 
01:01:04.230 --> 01:01:04.240 align:start position:0%
in terms of the total potential lifetime
 
01:01:08.430 --> 01:01:08.440 align:start position:0%
savings and uh it is potentially worth
 
01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:18.670 --> 01:01:18.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.670 --> 01:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
Tech are you making a motion because my
 
01:01:24.029 --> 01:01:24.039 align:start position:0%
motions are going to be if if I make the
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
motion it's either going to be itl
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
retain yeah I mean I I guess I'll move
 
01:01:31.910 --> 01:01:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh OTP
 
01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.750 align:start position:0%
uh OTP
then

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:34.760 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:42.910 align:start position:0%
 
second

01:01:42.910 --> 01:01:42.920 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:01:45.230 --> 01:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
um would you like to speak to your
 
01:01:48.390 --> 01:01:48.400 align:start position:0%
motion uh I mean as as I said I feel
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
like this is something where uh it would
 
01:01:53.589 --> 01:01:53.599 align:start position:0%
be good to have an affirmative motion
 
01:01:55.990 --> 01:01:56.000 align:start position:0%
going into our discussion as a full
 
01:01:58.150 --> 01:01:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee I think that this is something
 
01:02:00.870 --> 01:02:00.880 align:start position:0%
where we should be uh thinking of this
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
in a positive mindset and not
 
01:02:04.750 --> 01:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily thinking that we should just
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
reject it immediately uh that's
 
01:02:08.829 --> 01:02:08.839 align:start position:0%
partially why I I think that we need to
 
01:02:12.069 --> 01:02:12.079 align:start position:0%
move forward with an OTP motion uh so
 
01:02:12.079 --> 01:02:14.230 align:start position:0%
move forward with an OTP motion uh so
with

01:02:14.230 --> 01:02:14.240 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:02:18.029 --> 01:02:18.039 align:start position:0%
that um I will just say that I will be
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
voting against the a to pass motion
 
01:02:22.829 --> 01:02:22.839 align:start position:0%
because I think it's premature I think
 
01:02:24.750 --> 01:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
that uh we've heard that the building
 
01:02:27.589 --> 01:02:27.599 align:start position:0%
code review board is still working on
 
01:02:31.670 --> 01:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
that and uh reviewing it and
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be voting against that motion
 
01:02:35.079 --> 01:02:37.390 align:start position:0%
um so I'll be voting against that motion
and

01:02:37.390 --> 01:02:37.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:02:39.630 --> 01:02:39.640 align:start position:0%
recommending no on that
 
01:02:43.269 --> 01:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
motion um representative scitech call
 
01:02:46.670 --> 01:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
for the vote Yes that'd be great
 
01:02:51.829 --> 01:02:51.839 align:start position:0%
U no is uh ought to pass on I'm voting
 
01:02:54.230 --> 01:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
no on ought to pass
 
01:02:57.710 --> 01:02:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay I'm voting no no
 
01:03:01.309 --> 01:03:01.319 align:start position:0%
yes yes
 
01:03:04.309 --> 01:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
three2 okay recommend that and we will
 
01:03:08.029 --> 01:03:08.039 align:start position:0%
speak to um the minority uh opinion on
 
01:03:10.109 --> 01:03:10.119 align:start position:0%
that well we we'll discuss it in yeah at
 
01:03:12.390 --> 01:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:03:14.910 --> 01:03:14.920 align:start position:0%
sure so uh
 
01:03:18.789 --> 01:03:18.799 align:start position:0%
we uh have no other bills to discuss
 
01:03:24.069 --> 01:03:24.079 align:start position:0%
this morning and um we've recessed uh on
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill 428 while I go to OSS and get
 
01:03:31.230 --> 01:03:31.240 align:start position:0%
that Amendment drafted and um there'll
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
be a notice in the calendar when our
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
next subcommittee we are in recess on
 
01:03:37.630 --> 01:03:37.640 align:start position:0%
that Bill yes
 
01:03:40.789 --> 01:03:40.799 align:start position:0%
okay so I will close the subcommittee
 
01:03:56.670 --> 01:03:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:54.630 align:start position:0%
 
clear

01:04:54.630 --> 01:04:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.640 --> 01:05:24.630 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
