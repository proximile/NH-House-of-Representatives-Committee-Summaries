00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:39.749 align:start position:0%
 
have

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
sure all right well uh welcome everybody
 
00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:10.479 align:start position:0%
to the solid waste subcommittee uh we're
 
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
going to get started now and I guess
 
00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
I'll be clerking as well as chairing um
 
00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 align:start position:0%
I've already got uh my outline set up so
 
00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
um it's pretty much going to be a
 
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 align:start position:0%
free-for-all there's only four of us
 
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe five of us today so you don't need
 
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
to ask me to um call on you to to talk I
 
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
think anybody who has something to say
 
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 align:start position:0%
is welcome to uh say it um that being
 
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:34.640 align:start position:0%
said we I guess we'll start with HB
 
00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 align:start position:0%
171 um and um I'll uh hand the Reigns
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
over to uh to uh representative gerna
 
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:43.400 align:start position:0%
he's got some stuff to say on that and
 
00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll discuss it
 
00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 align:start position:0%
then thank you Mr chair and so I just
 
00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
sent everyone a on this subcommittee a
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
copy of some language representative
 
00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 align:start position:0%
guber and I have been going back and
 
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 align:start position:0%
forth with uh director wh whap we very
 
00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 align:start position:0%
much appreciate his help at the hearing
 
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 align:start position:0%
for that bill we received some feedback
 
00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
about some tightening of the language
 
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:12.920 align:start position:0%
that would make it more technically uh
 
00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 align:start position:0%
accurate and so if you're able to find
 
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
the document I just sent you and open it
 
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
you can get an idea of some of the
 
00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 align:start position:0%
changes that we're looking to make to
 
00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
the language and they're
 
00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
really very straightforward uh
 
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
you can do you have that uh Mr chair
 
00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm pulling it up right now we'll
 
00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
see if my we have it here we have it
 
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
here too okay okay yeah um I found that
 
00:03:43.149 --> 00:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
often times attachments don't open up in
 
00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
my I need to take it down to um to the
 
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
um Technical Services so I may need to
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
peek over somebody else's shoulder to
 
00:03:52.429 --> 00:03:52.439 align:start position:0%
look at it because I I can't see it on
 
00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 align:start position:0%
my computer so well I'll move okay
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%
closer to you
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
that's so you can see the changes that
 
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
were we're looking at making here in the
 
00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 align:start position:0%
first paragraph again it's really some
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
technical language changes right so the
 
00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 align:start position:0%
department May accept applications and
 
00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 align:start position:0%
one of the things that the that the
 
00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:21.239 align:start position:0%
director suggested is that we may want
 
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 align:start position:0%
to amend the original Bill to allow for
 
00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
the review of applications for
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
completeness uh that's not getting into
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
the kind of technical specifics of uh of
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
an application uh looking at you know
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
the geology of the site Etc this would
 
00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
be to make sure that uh
 
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 align:start position:0%
the application is complete so that way
 
00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
at the end of the moratorium you would
 
00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
be if there is an application you could
 
00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:51.639 align:start position:0%
begin review of the application because
 
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:53.680 align:start position:0%
the file would be complete so we changed
 
00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 align:start position:0%
the language here as you can see uh the
 
00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
department May accept
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
applications um evaluate them for
 
00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
completeness and request more
 
00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:04.720 align:start position:0%
information to make an application
 
00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 align:start position:0%
complete but shall not proceed to
 
00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 align:start position:0%
further evaluation or process any
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
application so that was intended to um
 
00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:16.160 align:start position:0%
uh address that issue then you can see
 
00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:19.280 align:start position:0%
that notwithstanding RSA 541 that
 
00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 align:start position:0%
another another good suggestion the
 
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
director made was that under current
 
00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120 align:start position:0%
statute if an application is received
 
00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:26.919 align:start position:0%
and it's not acted upon within I think
 
00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
okay uh but so if it's complete and it's
 
00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 align:start position:0%
not acted upon within a certain period
 
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
of time it's automatically approved so
 
00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:46.479 align:start position:0%
at the director's suggestion we uh added
 
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 align:start position:0%
this notwithstanding clause which means
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
that this becomes an exception to that
 
00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 align:start position:0%
rule we removed the word fully in second
 
00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
uh the second paragraph and again that
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
just makes it more accurate uh in terms
 
00:06:02.629 --> 00:06:02.639 align:start position:0%
of the permitting process and then in
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph three we would be eliminating
 
00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:08.960 align:start position:0%
a I'm not sure how or why that reference
 
00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 align:start position:0%
to Perennial B water bodies traversing a
 
00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:16.000 align:start position:0%
footprint not sure why it was there uh
 
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
but at the director's suggestion um we
 
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 align:start position:0%
would eliminate that because they
 
00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:23.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't site a landfill in a place if
 
00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:25.639 align:start position:0%
you had a a perennial body uh water body
 
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 align:start position:0%
traversing the footprint of the the
 
00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:30.039 align:start position:0%
proposed site okay so the text in B that
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
we're seeing on here is removed or yes
 
00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:35.759 align:start position:0%
you'll see that that will cut exactly
 
00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
that starting with perennial water
 
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
bodies and ending with will cut that
 
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
whole bold section has uh been removed
 
00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
okay so yeah as I said this does three
 
00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
things number one allows the department
 
00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:50.520 align:start position:0%
to receive applications and evaluate
 
00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:52.599 align:start position:0%
them only for
 
00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 align:start position:0%
completeness so that they'd be ready to
 
00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:56.639 align:start position:0%
review when the moratorium ends number
 
00:06:59.629 --> 00:06:59.639 align:start position:0%
two added the not add added the not
 
00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.670 align:start position:0%
two added the not add added the not
withstanding

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
withstanding
 
00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
clause number
 
00:07:07.029 --> 00:07:07.039 align:start position:0%
three got rid got rid of the word fully
 
00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
uh and number four eliminates the
 
00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 align:start position:0%
unnecessary language later in the bill I
 
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 align:start position:0%
have one one question uh my one question
 
00:07:17.309 --> 00:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
is um if um DS says a application is
 
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
fully complete speak in the microphone y
 
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:23.560 align:start position:0%
get here if uh Dees says thank you it's
 
00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:26.240 align:start position:0%
fully complete and during the moratorium
 
00:07:28.909 --> 00:07:28.919 align:start position:0%
there's some additional changes uh could
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
the applicant say well you said it was
 
00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:31.800 align:start position:0%
complete so we you can't require
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
anything more from us now so the
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
question is fully complete or towards
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
completion for example see what I mean I
 
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
I any uh any thoughts about that that's
 
00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
an excellent question if we could ask
 
00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:47.000 align:start position:0%
perhaps uh the
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
director uh I think that's an excellent
 
00:07:50.749 --> 00:07:50.759 align:start position:0%
question because obviously the point of
 
00:07:52.670 --> 00:07:52.680 align:start position:0%
the moratorium is for us to take our
 
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
time to pass some legislation there may
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
be some additional requirements that we
 
00:07:58.749 --> 00:07:58.759 align:start position:0%
don't have initially so if it's that's
 
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:05.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh good morning for the record Mike whim
 
00:08:08.589 --> 00:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
director of the waste division from New
 
00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees uh yeah I think that's a
 
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
very relevant question um I think that
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh you know certainly as I was uh trying
 
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
to assist the sponsor with the language
 
00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:22.280 align:start position:0%
for this it occurred to me that
 
00:08:26.230 --> 00:08:26.240 align:start position:0%
um if changes in policy through law or
 
00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
administrative rule were made during
 
00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:31.280 align:start position:0%
that time um that it would be necessary
 
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
for the landfill applicant permit
 
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
applicant to amend the application so
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
the the purpose of the comments that I
 
00:08:40.469 --> 00:08:40.479 align:start position:0%
made were that it can take a very long
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
time to get to a complete application
 
00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
particularly for a newly cited landfill
 
00:08:47.389 --> 00:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
and if we were to just simply receive an
 
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:50.560 align:start position:0%
an application and do nothing with it um
 
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.120 align:start position:0%
then basically until the end of the
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
moratorium which I understand this build
 
00:08:56.829 --> 00:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
is set at 2030 we would not even have
 
00:08:58.949 --> 00:08:58.959 align:start position:0%
begun that process so it could be
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
several years after that before a
 
00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.790 align:start position:0%
several years after that before a
complete

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
complete
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
application was was was an application
 
00:09:07.269 --> 00:09:07.279 align:start position:0%
was deemed complete and then the
 
00:09:10.269 --> 00:09:10.279 align:start position:0%
application was act subject to review
 
00:09:12.269 --> 00:09:12.279 align:start position:0%
and then acted on and so this would
 
00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:14.800 align:start position:0%
basically just give um an opportunity to
 
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:16.600 align:start position:0%
at least make sure that the things that
 
00:09:19.710 --> 00:09:19.720 align:start position:0%
are clearly um missing from an
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
application could be brought in during
 
00:09:24.430 --> 00:09:24.440 align:start position:0%
that moratorium period but my view would
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
be and again I think it would be a
 
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:28.720 align:start position:0%
question for attorneys but is that if
 
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:30.640 align:start position:0%
there were policy changes made in that
 
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:33.440 align:start position:0%
interim period before the app before the
 
00:09:36.509 --> 00:09:36.519 align:start position:0%
application review began that and they
 
00:09:38.269 --> 00:09:38.279 align:start position:0%
were deemed to be applicable to that
 
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
application that the applicant would
 
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:43.160 align:start position:0%
then it would be incumbent on them to um
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
augment their application further to
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
make it complete to comply with those
 
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:49.320 align:start position:0%
new requirements that didn't exist at
 
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.829 --> 00:09:55.839 align:start position:0%
application yeah it's just a that would
 
00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
be from my perspective really that one
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
sentence would be ideal to add it to
 
00:10:02.230 --> 00:10:02.240 align:start position:0%
so that you have more
 
00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:04.760 align:start position:0%
flexibility I I I I guess I would offer
 
00:10:08.069 --> 00:10:08.079 align:start position:0%
it certainly to be clear a uh I I
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
suppose the bill could be amended to
 
00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:13.160 align:start position:0%
explicitly state that any changes in
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
policy or in law or rule that occurred
 
00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:18.399 align:start position:0%
during that moratorium period would be
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
applicable to any applications that were
 
00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
pending you know that that had been
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
submitted during the moratorium period
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
so that it would be clear that the
 
00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:28.760 align:start position:0%
applicant would need to then amend the
 
00:10:31.110 --> 00:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
application further a augment the
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
application further to comply with those
 
00:10:35.269 --> 00:10:35.279 align:start position:0%
new laws or
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
rules please thank you I let me ask is
 
00:10:41.230 --> 00:10:41.240 align:start position:0%
that effectively already the case now
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
for example if you had an application
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
that was pending at the time that the
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
new rules were adopted uh and wouldn't
 
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
it at this point already in order for
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
that permit application to be complete
 
00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:00.560 align:start position:0%
it would have to meet this the new rules
 
00:11:02.389 --> 00:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
um doesn't I mean isn't that already
 
00:11:04.590 --> 00:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
effectively the way that I understand it
 
00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
it it could it could depend upon the
 
00:11:08.829 --> 00:11:08.839 align:start position:0%
circumstances it could depend on what
 
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
particular rule was amended whether or
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
not that rule would apply and that's a
 
00:11:15.430 --> 00:11:15.440 align:start position:0%
question that we would engage with the
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
Department of Justice on at the time
 
00:11:20.269 --> 00:11:20.279 align:start position:0%
that it happened I'm not sure and again
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
I'm not I'm not legally trained so this
 
00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
is my understanding but my understanding
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
is that it isn't absolutely clear that
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
any rule change that occurs or even any
 
00:11:30.670 --> 00:11:30.680 align:start position:0%
law La change that
 
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.040 align:start position:0%
occurs subsequent to an application
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
being submitted will automatically be
 
00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:37.480 align:start position:0%
applicable in many cases we believe it
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
is um but but it's not
 
00:11:43.710 --> 00:11:43.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily an absolute uh deter you
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
know absolutely the case in every
 
00:11:48.509 --> 00:11:48.519 align:start position:0%
case so maybe wording like
 
00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:50.240 align:start position:0%
representative grber suggested might be
 
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.440 align:start position:0%
helpful here just to clarify that in
 
00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:53.310 align:start position:0%
helpful here just to clarify that in
this

00:11:53.310 --> 00:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
case that that would be my sense right
 
00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:56.920 align:start position:0%
if that's the will of the legislature
 
00:11:58.670 --> 00:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
then stating it explicitly is an
 
00:11:59.870 --> 00:11:59.880 align:start position:0%
effective way to to make sure that
 
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:02.480 align:start position:0%
that's implemented can I read a proposed
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
uh insert at this point it could read
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
any changes in policy or rules during
 
00:12:10.910 --> 00:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
this moratorium period would also be
 
00:12:15.110 --> 00:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
would be also applicable to the uh
 
00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.069 align:start position:0%
would be also applicable to the uh
permitting

00:12:17.069 --> 00:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
permitting
 
00:12:20.790 --> 00:12:20.800 align:start position:0%
process that I would offer substitute
 
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
law for the world word policy so any
 
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:31.120 align:start position:0%
clearer so um two questions for
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
representative jamna do you feel are you
 
00:12:36.069 --> 00:12:36.079 align:start position:0%
happy with the the language of the
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
amendment you have do you feel that it
 
00:12:40.470 --> 00:12:40.480 align:start position:0%
Waters down the bill um too much or are
 
00:12:42.110 --> 00:12:42.120 align:start position:0%
you happy with it and then it sounds
 
00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
like my second question is it sounds
 
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:46.440 align:start position:0%
like there still needs to be potentially
 
00:12:49.949 --> 00:12:49.959 align:start position:0%
another amendment made to further fix
 
00:12:52.230 --> 00:12:52.240 align:start position:0%
this issue of you know applicants that
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
apply Before the bill Tes takes effect
 
00:12:57.470 --> 00:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
and things like that um do you do you
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
intend to to make another amendment to
 
00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:02.120 align:start position:0%
address that issue or do you want to go
 
00:13:05.949 --> 00:13:05.959 align:start position:0%
forward as it is uh thank you I I am
 
00:13:08.069 --> 00:13:08.079 align:start position:0%
very comfortable with with the suggested
 
00:13:10.990 --> 00:13:11.000 align:start position:0%
changes and the inclusion um of
 
00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
Representative gruber's suggestion and
 
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
we haven't actually submitted the
 
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment yet because we've just been
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
talking about the language and haven't
 
00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:19.639 align:start position:0%
had time and I figured we would talk
 
00:13:21.189 --> 00:13:21.199 align:start position:0%
about it this morning and this is a good
 
00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
example is why we didn't submit it so we
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
were planning on today representative
 
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:27.680 align:start position:0%
guber is going to uh submit the
 
00:13:29.750 --> 00:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
amendment so uh
 
00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I'm comfortable with it and I
 
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:34.160 align:start position:0%
think the timing is good we can get an
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
amendment sent to OS today if that's the
 
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:40.160 align:start position:0%
case then do you believe we'd need to um
 
00:13:41.870 --> 00:13:41.880 align:start position:0%
meet or have another subcommittee
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
meeting for that or do you feel
 
00:13:45.110 --> 00:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
confident that once the amendment is
 
00:13:47.230 --> 00:13:47.240 align:start position:0%
done it could just be brought forward
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
for you know during executive session
 
00:13:52.189 --> 00:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
and then you know given to everybody
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
briefly reviewed and then voted on
 
00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:56.800 align:start position:0%
during executive session my sense is
 
00:13:58.230 --> 00:13:58.240 align:start position:0%
that we could just take it straight to
 
00:14:00.069 --> 00:14:00.079 align:start position:0%
an executive session I don't know if
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
representative Scully has any uh
 
00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
thoughts or concerns you know as long as
 
00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
we have consensus on the subcommittee I
 
00:14:07.910 --> 00:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
think the amended version could go
 
00:14:09.670 --> 00:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
straight to Executive
 
00:14:12.670 --> 00:14:12.680 align:start position:0%
session well if you're soliciting my
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
opinion on this matter I personally
 
00:14:17.389 --> 00:14:17.399 align:start position:0%
think that this legislation is
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
ill-advised however I think what the
 
00:14:23.230 --> 00:14:23.240 align:start position:0%
Amendments you're proposing is a market
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
Improvement on the original legislation
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
itself so that being said I I would much
 
00:14:32.350 --> 00:14:32.360 align:start position:0%
prefer that this be brought before our
 
00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:35.160 align:start position:0%
uh committee rather than the original
 
00:14:38.189 --> 00:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
language you know legislation
 
00:14:41.150 --> 00:14:41.160 align:start position:0%
itself okay well thank you then uh if
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
that's the case um I think you're doing
 
00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:45.120 align:start position:0%
a good job with that bill and you should
 
00:14:46.470 --> 00:14:46.480 align:start position:0%
just continue doing what you're doing
 
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:49.000 align:start position:0%
and then we'll uh we'll bring it before
 
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:50.920 align:start position:0%
the entire committee so we'll we'll
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
close hb7 171 for today uh question for
 
00:14:57.870 --> 00:14:57.880 align:start position:0%
you representative gerana um you might
 
00:15:00.430 --> 00:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
know better than I do um but I was given
 
00:15:03.990 --> 00:15:04.000 align:start position:0%
some um paperwork here for the clerk um
 
00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:06.399 align:start position:0%
to you know if we have any motions or
 
00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
anything like that for the subcommittee
 
00:15:09.670 --> 00:15:09.680 align:start position:0%
is that necessary do we need to do we
 
00:15:11.590 --> 00:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
need to do anything with this I mean
 
00:15:13.509 --> 00:15:13.519 align:start position:0%
we're not making any motions to OTP or
 
00:15:15.629 --> 00:15:15.639 align:start position:0%
anything like that at least on this bill
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
but maybe on another bill if we have
 
00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
like a if we recommend an OTP there
 
00:15:21.790 --> 00:15:21.800 align:start position:0%
might be something we vote on but I
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
think at least for this bill we don't
 
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
have to do that yeah no I don't think so
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
because the amendment hasn't been worked
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
up yet I think that we can explain to
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
the committee later that we will have an
 
00:15:31.949 --> 00:15:31.959 align:start position:0%
amendment that the consensus of the
 
00:15:35.309 --> 00:15:35.319 align:start position:0%
committee is that it can go to Executive
 
00:15:37.389 --> 00:15:37.399 align:start position:0%
session okay great well in that case
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
we'll uh we'll be done with HB 171 for
 
00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
today and we'll move over to uh HB 2115
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
you ready to discuss that I am and again
 
00:15:48.629 --> 00:15:48.639 align:start position:0%
um my apologies for not having hard
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
copies they that we're having some
 
00:15:52.389 --> 00:15:52.399 align:start position:0%
issues with the photo copy upstairs but
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
I did again I emailed the um hp215 to
 
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.710 --> 00:16:19.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
computer you guys have it there yeah we
 
00:16:25.949 --> 00:16:25.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:28.040 align:start position:0%
yep okay and I have it as well if you
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
want to discuss it okay thank you Mr
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
chair so again I want to thank director
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
whimet he and I spent quite a bit of
 
00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:38.800 align:start position:0%
time going back and forth on what the
 
00:16:40.990 --> 00:16:41.000 align:start position:0%
language would look like here and and if
 
00:16:44.309 --> 00:16:44.319 align:start position:0%
my colleagues recall we had some
 
00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:46.560 align:start position:0%
questions uh about the initial bill that
 
00:16:48.749 --> 00:16:48.759 align:start position:0%
we wanted to to get clarified one has to
 
00:16:51.829 --> 00:16:51.839 align:start position:0%
do with how the third independent third
 
00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:54.480 align:start position:0%
party would be contracted and I'll point
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
out to the specific language that we uh
 
00:17:00.389 --> 00:17:00.399 align:start position:0%
included to explain that process uh and
 
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:05.640 align:start position:0%
then another question was uh if we
 
00:17:09.309 --> 00:17:09.319 align:start position:0%
might have the review of possible net
 
00:17:12.669 --> 00:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
benefits as an initial screening stage
 
00:17:15.069 --> 00:17:15.079 align:start position:0%
right so that it would be reviewed for
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
possible net
 
00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:18.919 align:start position:0%
benefits first before it would then
 
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:22.160 align:start position:0%
progress to the kind of review that that
 
00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
Dees does for the uh looking at the site
 
00:17:27.150 --> 00:17:27.160 align:start position:0%
so as I walk you through the amendment
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
and it's taking the original bill and
 
00:17:33.310 --> 00:17:33.320 align:start position:0%
fleshing it out a little bit so um you
 
00:17:36.470 --> 00:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
can see uh Roman noral 3 prior to
 
00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:38.200 align:start position:0%
completing its full technical review of
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
an application the department shall
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
determine whether a proposed solid waste
 
00:17:45.909 --> 00:17:45.919 align:start position:0%
facility provides a net public benefit
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
through an initial process and here we
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
Define net public benefit net public
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
benefit exists if potential benefits for
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
a proposed project are determined to be
 
00:17:59.549 --> 00:17:59.559 align:start position:0%
greater than the potential Harms
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
and then you see only if the department
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
determines that a net public benefit
 
00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
exists shall the the application proceed
 
00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
for further review so this sets up that
 
00:18:12.909 --> 00:18:12.919 align:start position:0%
two-stage process it defines net
 
00:18:16.909 --> 00:18:16.919 align:start position:0%
benefit you look at a B and C from lines
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
11 to
 
00:18:22.630 --> 00:18:22.640 align:start position:0%
18 already exis in current statute where
 
00:18:27.190 --> 00:18:27.200 align:start position:0%
we have added is language now about how
 
00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:29.320 align:start position:0%
the evaluation will take place
 
00:18:30.750 --> 00:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
to assist the department in the
 
00:18:33.070 --> 00:18:33.080 align:start position:0%
determination of a net public benefit an
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
assessment shall be conducted on behalf
 
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the host Community Andor other abing
 
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
municipalities by an independent
 
00:18:41.870 --> 00:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
third-party contractor and the costs for
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
such assessment shall be borne by the
 
00:18:45.909 --> 00:18:45.919 align:start position:0%
applicant and this is where director
 
00:18:47.669 --> 00:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
whims and I work together to figure out
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
what that process looks like the
 
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
applicant shall submit a list of no
 
00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:53.559 align:start position:0%
fewer than three independent thirdparty
 
00:18:56.070 --> 00:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
contracts to the department the
 
00:18:57.270 --> 00:18:57.280 align:start position:0%
department shall review the
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications of the contract
 
00:19:00.789 --> 00:19:00.799 align:start position:0%
and provided that it finds them
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
qualified shall work in consultation
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
with the host community and the
 
00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:07.520 align:start position:0%
applicant to select a mutually agreeable
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
contractor which uh which lines are you
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
on we are I'm reading from um and Roman
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
or u letter D from 19 to 28 yeah line
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
number we have line numbers in ours we
 
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
about line number 24 thank
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
you and this is a line 25 if the
 
00:19:26.029 --> 00:19:26.039 align:start position:0%
department determines that one or more
 
00:19:27.789 --> 00:19:27.799 align:start position:0%
of the submitted contractors is not
 
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:30.280 align:start position:0%
qualified it shall require the applicant
 
00:19:33.190 --> 00:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
to identify additional contractors if a
 
00:19:35.110 --> 00:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
mutually agreeable third party has not
 
00:19:37.070 --> 00:19:37.080 align:start position:0%
been identified within 60 days the
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner shall choose from the
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
submitted list so we felt that this was
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
a fair way to choose a contractor the um
 
00:19:46.830 --> 00:19:46.840 align:start position:0%
the applicant would submit a list Dees
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
would work with the contractor and the
 
00:19:50.669 --> 00:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
host Community to try to find a mutually
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
acceptable thirdparty contractor and if
 
00:19:57.149 --> 00:19:57.159 align:start position:0%
that can't happen if a mutually agreed
 
00:19:59.310 --> 00:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
upon contractor isn't
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
you know arrived at within 60 days then
 
00:20:03.750 --> 00:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
the commissioner would choose from the
 
00:20:06.909 --> 00:20:06.919 align:start position:0%
list uh submitted by the uh the
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
applicant I have a question who um what
 
00:20:13.190 --> 00:20:13.200 align:start position:0%
is the host Community how how would that
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
be defined are we going to be citizen
 
00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:17.480 align:start position:0%
activist groups which are not
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily a bad thing but uh is it
 
00:20:22.590 --> 00:20:22.600 align:start position:0%
going to be the uh elected officials of
 
00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
of a town in which it it is located um I
 
00:20:29.270 --> 00:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
guess that's obviously open broad term
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
and perhaps open to interpretation what
 
00:20:34.470 --> 00:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
what are your thoughts regarding that uh
 
00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:36.000 align:start position:0%
and I think the director can speak to
 
00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:37.760 align:start position:0%
that uh relations with the host
 
00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960 align:start position:0%
Community are already defined in statute
 
00:20:44.270 --> 00:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
so it is uh is a public body that
 
00:20:45.909 --> 00:20:45.919 align:start position:0%
represents the host Community but
 
00:20:48.190 --> 00:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps the director could provide more
 
00:20:49.710 --> 00:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
clarity about
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
that good
 
00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.549 --> 00:21:05.559 align:start position:0%
yes typically anytime we're dealing with
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
a host Community we would anticipate
 
00:21:09.870 --> 00:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
that that is the you know if it's a town
 
00:21:11.630 --> 00:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
um or a city it would be the governing
 
00:21:13.950 --> 00:21:13.960 align:start position:0%
body within that town or city either a
 
00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
board of selectman or city council and
 
00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:17.919 align:start position:0%
that they would make you know to the
 
00:21:20.350 --> 00:21:20.360 align:start position:0%
extent that that governing body decided
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
to appoint a certain group of citizens
 
00:21:24.909 --> 00:21:24.919 align:start position:0%
they could certainly do that um but
 
00:21:27.430 --> 00:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
basically we we defer to the governing
 
00:21:29.110 --> 00:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
body of the municipality when we're
 
00:21:32.110 --> 00:21:32.120 align:start position:0%
dealing with a with a host
 
00:21:34.750 --> 00:21:34.760 align:start position:0%
Community thank you thank you now
 
00:21:38.310 --> 00:21:38.320 align:start position:0%
excellent question representative so we
 
00:21:40.269 --> 00:21:40.279 align:start position:0%
as I said that that was uh came out of a
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
discussion between myself and the
 
00:21:46.390 --> 00:21:46.400 align:start position:0%
director if you look at line 29 letter e
 
00:21:49.070 --> 00:21:49.080 align:start position:0%
another uh I think very productive thing
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
that came out of our discussion was
 
00:21:54.909 --> 00:21:54.919 align:start position:0%
trying to arrive at a fair balance
 
00:21:58.029 --> 00:21:58.039 align:start position:0%
between benefits and potential harm so
 
00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
ourr current statute only defines
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
benefit in well not only but primarily
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
in terms of capacity need right uh and
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
as the Director has pointed out in the
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
past actually members of Industry have
 
00:22:12.029 --> 00:22:12.039 align:start position:0%
uh argued that other things should be
 
00:22:15.110 --> 00:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
considered under potential benefits so
 
00:22:17.390 --> 00:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
uh I think that what we've arrived at
 
00:22:20.029 --> 00:22:20.039 align:start position:0%
here is language that really seeks to
 
00:22:22.830 --> 00:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
balance potential harms and pet
 
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:25.720 align:start position:0%
potential uh benefits because you know
 
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
contrary to what has been suggested by
 
00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:29.520 align:start position:0%
some the purpose of this legislation is
 
00:22:30.909 --> 00:22:30.919 align:start position:0%
not to make it impossible to site
 
00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:35.320 align:start position:0%
landfills anywhere uh so paragraph e
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
here the lines 29 down to five on the
 
00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:41.360 align:start position:0%
next page are really meant to balance
 
00:22:43.630 --> 00:22:43.640 align:start position:0%
potential harms and needs so you'll
 
00:22:47.230 --> 00:22:47.240 align:start position:0%
see uh at line 30 potential harm shall
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
include any potentially harmful impacts
 
00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
on human health property values tourism
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
outdoor recreation and Wildlife such
 
00:22:57.870 --> 00:22:57.880 align:start position:0%
impacts may include noise goes on but
 
00:22:59.630 --> 00:22:59.640 align:start position:0%
then a line three you say potential
 
00:23:02.430 --> 00:23:02.440 align:start position:0%
benefits shall include in addition to
 
00:23:04.750 --> 00:23:04.760 align:start position:0%
capacity need as described in a previous
 
00:23:07.190 --> 00:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
subparagraph potential economic benefits
 
00:23:09.430 --> 00:23:09.440 align:start position:0%
to the local area and potential
 
00:23:11.310 --> 00:23:11.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure improvements associated
 
00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:13.919 align:start position:0%
with proposed project and other factors
 
00:23:16.350 --> 00:23:16.360 align:start position:0%
as identified by the contractor so the
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
purpose of fleshing that out is to
 
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:21.640 align:start position:0%
provide guidance for a more balanced
 
00:23:25.029 --> 00:23:25.039 align:start position:0%
comparison of harms and benefits rather
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
than one that might lean too far in the
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
direction of Simply
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
arms a quick question first um uh rep J
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
did you send this um Amendment email to
 
00:23:39.950 --> 00:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
representative Penza yes okay so
 
00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:42.360 align:start position:0%
representative paten Penza we're on um
 
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
hp215 right now and uh we're discussing
 
00:23:48.510 --> 00:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
an amendment that uh rep J has gone over
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
so it's in your
 
00:23:53.789 --> 00:23:53.799 align:start position:0%
email uh yeah the one question it might
 
00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
be in here is the um doing this
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
assessment is not for offsite benefits
 
00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:01.520 align:start position:0%
like a a new murf in another town or
 
00:24:03.630 --> 00:24:03.640 align:start position:0%
something is that right is that still in
 
00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:07.480 align:start position:0%
here the offsite benefits yes thank you
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
very much uh that I'm glad you brought
 
00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
that up that needs to be
 
00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
let's thank you for bringing that to my
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
attention actually that does remain in
 
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:23.520 align:start position:0%
fact I I remember putting that in the
 
00:24:26.870 --> 00:24:26.880 align:start position:0%
email to OSS that what we are looking at
 
00:24:29.389 --> 00:24:29.399 align:start position:0%
is the only part of the bill that would
 
00:24:32.310 --> 00:24:32.320 align:start position:0%
be amended from the introduced version
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
so the other two components of the bill
 
00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
that have to remain this would just if
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
we looked at the original bill this
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
would just replace this section of the
 
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:42.640 align:start position:0%
bill the other two sections remain
 
00:24:45.310 --> 00:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
number one it applies to only one
 
00:24:48.269 --> 00:24:48.279 align:start position:0%
facility and number two capacity need is
 
00:24:50.990 --> 00:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
determined by at least one half of the
 
00:24:52.870 --> 00:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
lifespan of the proposed
 
00:24:54.950 --> 00:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
facility okay thank you because I wasn't
 
00:24:56.350 --> 00:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
certain like that's a great question
 
00:24:57.669 --> 00:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
we'll build a new road through the state
 
00:24:59.830 --> 00:24:59.840 align:start position:0%
to get the trucks and you know how far
 
00:25:02.190 --> 00:25:02.200 align:start position:0%
can that road count towards the benefits
 
00:25:04.230 --> 00:25:04.240 align:start position:0%
so do I understand correctly that OS was
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
supposed to take out a certain part and
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
they didn't or are you happy with the
 
00:25:10.549 --> 00:25:10.559 align:start position:0%
amendment as is uh no they will actually
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
have to add back in some original
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
material okay so this isn't going to be
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
the final draft of your Amendment you've
 
00:25:18.110 --> 00:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
got more work to to do on it well I just
 
00:25:19.510 --> 00:25:19.520 align:start position:0%
need to have them add back in the
 
00:25:21.310 --> 00:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
original material but yes that was I'm
 
00:25:22.830 --> 00:25:22.840 align:start position:0%
glad representative guber pointed that
 
00:25:26.110 --> 00:25:26.120 align:start position:0%
out because I did tell them specifically
 
00:25:28.470 --> 00:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
th this should substitute for the first
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
part and then the other two parts of the
 
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
bill were supposed to remain the same
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
and they're not included here so yes I
 
00:25:37.029 --> 00:25:37.039 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that they put that
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
back in there are no changes from the
 
00:25:40.590 --> 00:25:40.600 align:start position:0%
introduced bill in those
 
00:25:42.549 --> 00:25:42.559 align:start position:0%
sections does anybody else have any
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
comments on the proposed amendment as is
 
00:25:48.149 --> 00:25:48.159 align:start position:0%
if I could just a couple more things to
 
00:25:51.750 --> 00:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
add um so one of the questions that was
 
00:25:53.789 --> 00:25:53.799 align:start position:0%
brought up in the hearing was you know
 
00:25:57.269 --> 00:25:57.279 align:start position:0%
how would Dees do this Dees has certain
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
um expertise there other kinds of
 
00:26:02.070 --> 00:26:02.080 align:start position:0%
expertise that they don't have uh that
 
00:26:03.669 --> 00:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
they would need to ask for some
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
assistance on particularly around
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
tourism and impact on infrastructure Etc
 
00:26:10.029 --> 00:26:10.039 align:start position:0%
so again language that the director and
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
I discussed as hopefully being helpful
 
00:26:17.549 --> 00:26:17.559 align:start position:0%
to Dees this is uh letter F line six on
 
00:26:20.549 --> 00:26:20.559 align:start position:0%
page two to assist in the review of the
 
00:26:22.710 --> 00:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
third- party assessment the department
 
00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
shall consult as needed with the
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation to evaluate
 
00:26:27.470 --> 00:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
impacts on local traffic and
 
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:29.360 align:start position:0%
infrastructure the Department of
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
Business and economic Affairs to
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
evaluate impacts on the local economy
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
and the Department of Natural and
 
00:26:37.110 --> 00:26:37.120 align:start position:0%
cultural resources to evaluate impacts
 
00:26:39.990 --> 00:26:40.000 align:start position:0%
on tourism and local and natural local
 
00:26:42.870 --> 00:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
natural and cultural resources and what
 
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:45.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't want to do was to create some
 
00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:49.520 align:start position:0%
big formal new structure like the site
 
00:26:52.669 --> 00:26:52.679 align:start position:0%
evaluation committee but to keep this as
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
much as possible within Dees and through
 
00:26:58.870 --> 00:26:58.880 align:start position:0%
the discussions with the director we
 
00:27:02.149 --> 00:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
came you know at with his uh assistance
 
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
I came up with this language which is
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
intended to give
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
Dees the ability to consult with other
 
00:27:12.750 --> 00:27:12.760 align:start position:0%
departments uh to get expertise that
 
00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:14.600 align:start position:0%
they may find helpful quick question uh
 
00:27:17.389 --> 00:27:17.399 align:start position:0%
for director whims uh is this is that
 
00:27:20.549 --> 00:27:20.559 align:start position:0%
normal behavior for uh one Department
 
00:27:23.230 --> 00:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
director to be in communicate or one
 
00:27:24.710 --> 00:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
Department to be in communication with
 
00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
other departments in this sort of a way
 
00:27:29.710 --> 00:27:29.720 align:start position:0%
uh yes both formally and informally so
 
00:27:32.190 --> 00:27:32.200 align:start position:0%
certainly there are a number of laws
 
00:27:35.549 --> 00:27:35.559 align:start position:0%
across the New Hampshire statutes that
 
00:27:38.190 --> 00:27:38.200 align:start position:0%
give uh individual Department a
 
00:27:41.350 --> 00:27:41.360 align:start position:0%
directive to consult with um another
 
00:27:43.669 --> 00:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
department head or another department on
 
00:27:45.430 --> 00:27:45.440 align:start position:0%
particular items that where they have
 
00:27:47.950 --> 00:27:47.960 align:start position:0%
expertise and we certainly do that we
 
00:27:49.630 --> 00:27:49.640 align:start position:0%
also you know there's nothing to prevent
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
us from seeking guidance and un taking
 
00:27:53.909 --> 00:27:53.919 align:start position:0%
advantage of the knowledge and the
 
00:27:55.950 --> 00:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
expertise of our other departments so we
 
00:27:58.269 --> 00:27:58.279 align:start position:0%
we do that informally what what this
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
would do as I read is it would um
 
00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:02.840 align:start position:0%
because we're now being given uh the the
 
00:28:05.149 --> 00:28:05.159 align:start position:0%
directive and the authority to evaluate
 
00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
additional concerns relative to citing
 
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
of a landfill this would uh essentially
 
00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320 align:start position:0%
make it clear that in that process of
 
00:28:14.549 --> 00:28:14.559 align:start position:0%
reviewing this report that's that's
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
envisioned by this this bill uh that we
 
00:28:19.070 --> 00:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
that we would be given a directive to
 
00:28:21.070 --> 00:28:21.080 align:start position:0%
say hey if you need guidance on these
 
00:28:23.389 --> 00:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
particular topics go to the experts on
 
00:28:26.350 --> 00:28:26.360 align:start position:0%
it thank you um representative Jana do
 
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:28.200 align:start position:0%
you feel that this language is
 
00:28:31.310 --> 00:28:31.320 align:start position:0%
sufficient in as much as you know the
 
00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:34.120 align:start position:0%
department of Dees needs to they need to
 
00:28:37.230 --> 00:28:37.240 align:start position:0%
consult with other other entities about
 
00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
really big issues do you think that
 
00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
other departments are sufficient or do
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
you think there could be uh nonprofits
 
00:28:46.149 --> 00:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
or activist organizations or local
 
00:28:48.269 --> 00:28:48.279 align:start position:0%
farmers or whatever that needs to be
 
00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:49.880 align:start position:0%
consulted as well do you think that this
 
00:28:52.590 --> 00:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
is sufficient language I do thank you Mr
 
00:28:55.509 --> 00:28:55.519 align:start position:0%
chair I do because another step in this
 
00:28:57.750 --> 00:28:57.760 align:start position:0%
process right is that there would be
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
public public information sessions held
 
00:29:02.630 --> 00:29:02.640 align:start position:0%
in the host community and I I think that
 
00:29:05.389 --> 00:29:05.399 align:start position:0%
the third-party report that would be
 
00:29:07.269 --> 00:29:07.279 align:start position:0%
contracted I think is a huge benefit
 
00:29:09.509 --> 00:29:09.519 align:start position:0%
because right now the host Community can
 
00:29:10.950 --> 00:29:10.960 align:start position:0%
have these kind of public hearing
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
sessions but they may not have had the
 
00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
resources to pay for any comprehensive
 
00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
survey on their own behalf right they're
 
00:29:23.909 --> 00:29:23.919 align:start position:0%
usually operating um you know well
 
00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
behind the applicant right who has paid
 
00:29:29.070 --> 00:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
somebody to put together a report
 
00:29:31.830 --> 00:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
arguing for the for the benefit so um as
 
00:29:34.110 --> 00:29:34.120 align:start position:0%
I see it that report which is available
 
00:29:35.710 --> 00:29:35.720 align:start position:0%
to the host
 
00:29:38.149 --> 00:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
Community as it carries out its public
 
00:29:40.110 --> 00:29:40.120 align:start position:0%
information session serves some of that
 
00:29:42.710 --> 00:29:42.720 align:start position:0%
purpose and uh in terms of the review
 
00:29:45.230 --> 00:29:45.240 align:start position:0%
process here for net public benefits uh
 
00:29:47.909 --> 00:29:47.919 align:start position:0%
I think this provides Dees the
 
00:29:51.149 --> 00:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
additional expertise they need any other
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
any other comment question one comment
 
00:29:56.470 --> 00:29:56.480 align:start position:0%
is I think um this we're not putting
 
00:29:58.149 --> 00:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
more financial burden on a potential
 
00:30:00.029 --> 00:30:00.039 align:start position:0%
host Community by this process here
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
which is important because local
 
00:30:03.549 --> 00:30:03.559 align:start position:0%
communties just don't have the
 
00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
resources uh I do have a comment SL
 
00:30:09.549 --> 00:30:09.559 align:start position:0%
question and I'm assuming that uh the
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
department would have to create a whole
 
00:30:12.830 --> 00:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
set of rules regarding how how net
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
benefit would be evaluated and it also
 
00:30:17.870 --> 00:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
does look like we're bringing in other
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
departments in here in terms of the
 
00:30:22.549 --> 00:30:22.559 align:start position:0%
evaluation process would it do you think
 
00:30:24.470 --> 00:30:24.480 align:start position:0%
as a practical matter it's going to be
 
00:30:27.149 --> 00:30:27.159 align:start position:0%
possible to create a system of
 
00:30:29.470 --> 00:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation that it's clear enough that
 
00:30:32.230 --> 00:30:32.240 align:start position:0%
somebody who wanted to potentially site
 
00:30:34.669 --> 00:30:34.679 align:start position:0%
a landfill would be able to look at this
 
00:30:36.269 --> 00:30:36.279 align:start position:0%
and say okay we've got a good chance
 
00:30:39.430 --> 00:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
going in to go forward as opposed to
 
00:30:40.630 --> 00:30:40.640 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend this time and
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
effort and this could be shot down in so
 
00:30:45.509 --> 00:30:45.519 align:start position:0%
many different places because of the of
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
the vaguery of the process that it would
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
have a chilling effect on maybe creating
 
00:30:52.630 --> 00:30:52.640 align:start position:0%
something that could be needed in the
 
00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:55.480 align:start position:0%
future uh thank you for the question I I
 
00:30:57.669 --> 00:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
don't see it as something that would you
 
00:30:59.310 --> 00:30:59.320 align:start position:0%
know sort of make it look like the deck
 
00:31:01.789 --> 00:31:01.799 align:start position:0%
was stacked against an applicant uh it
 
00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:04.240 align:start position:0%
seems to me that just looking at it and
 
00:31:07.029 --> 00:31:07.039 align:start position:0%
and working with the sponsor uh that you
 
00:31:10.029 --> 00:31:10.039 align:start position:0%
know it would basically give it makes it
 
00:31:11.549 --> 00:31:11.559 align:start position:0%
clear that there are additional
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
considerations that we don't normally
 
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:15.200 align:start position:0%
really consider in our application
 
00:31:17.470 --> 00:31:17.480 align:start position:0%
process review process that we would now
 
00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200 align:start position:0%
be empowered and and in fact directed to
 
00:31:22.549 --> 00:31:22.559 align:start position:0%
to consider and yeah I think we would
 
00:31:24.950 --> 00:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
very likely uh establish some rules that
 
00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
would give at least some basic
 
00:31:28.110 --> 00:31:28.120 align:start position:0%
guidelines so with respect to the
 
00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
content of an application maybe some
 
00:31:32.669 --> 00:31:32.679 align:start position:0%
additional information about these other
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
potential impacts um that would uh allow
 
00:31:38.190 --> 00:31:38.200 align:start position:0%
the applicant to make its arguments
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
about what the the extent of those
 
00:31:42.830 --> 00:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
impacts are and how they are presumably
 
00:31:44.350 --> 00:31:44.360 align:start position:0%
the applicant would argue that they were
 
00:31:45.909 --> 00:31:45.919 align:start position:0%
outweighed by the benefits that the
 
00:31:48.430 --> 00:31:48.440 align:start position:0%
facility provided um and then that
 
00:31:50.029 --> 00:31:50.039 align:start position:0%
combined with this third-party
 
00:31:53.669 --> 00:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
contractor evaluation would give um
 
00:31:56.669 --> 00:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
everybody an opportunity to provide uh
 
00:31:58.310 --> 00:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
the input that they think is appropriate
 
00:32:00.629 --> 00:32:00.639 align:start position:0%
for the Department to consider so I
 
00:32:02.389 --> 00:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
don't know if I've answered your
 
00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:04.600 align:start position:0%
question I think that does may ask one
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
other question please I like this
 
00:32:08.430 --> 00:32:08.440 align:start position:0%
actually in principle in terms of what
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do here I do think it
 
00:32:11.629 --> 00:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
makes sense to look at this from a you
 
00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:16.760 align:start position:0%
know a holistic standpoint um H has
 
00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:18.320 align:start position:0%
anybody looked into whether this has
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
working thank you I also would like to
 
00:32:27.149 --> 00:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
add real quickly that in terms of U
 
00:32:29.029 --> 00:32:29.039 align:start position:0%
trying to
 
00:32:32.070 --> 00:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
not have this process appear as if it's
 
00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:33.880 align:start position:0%
intended to just stop landfills that's
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
also why we've expanded what could be
 
00:32:38.430 --> 00:32:38.440 align:start position:0%
considered under potential benefits
 
00:32:40.430 --> 00:32:40.440 align:start position:0%
because as the Director pointed out one
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
concern they've heard from applicants in
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
the past is that they don't believe that
 
00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:46.880 align:start position:0%
potential benefit is defined broadly
 
00:32:49.389 --> 00:32:49.399 align:start position:0%
enough right so hopefully that also you
 
00:32:50.789 --> 00:32:50.799 align:start position:0%
know the intention is to make it more
 
00:32:54.350 --> 00:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
balanced uh I'm not aware of there are
 
00:32:56.029 --> 00:32:56.039 align:start position:0%
lots of States I know representative
 
00:32:58.269 --> 00:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
paten has done a lot of work on this a
 
00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
lot of states have a two in fact we're
 
00:33:03.029 --> 00:33:03.039 align:start position:0%
to some extent I think an exception in
 
00:33:05.149 --> 00:33:05.159 align:start position:0%
not having some form of
 
00:33:07.389 --> 00:33:07.399 align:start position:0%
two-stage process where there is some
 
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:10.320 align:start position:0%
preliminary set of requirements that
 
00:33:12.070 --> 00:33:12.080 align:start position:0%
have to be met and I think that varies
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
from state to state but I know
 
00:33:14.909 --> 00:33:14.919 align:start position:0%
represented pend has done a lot of
 
00:33:19.389 --> 00:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
research into that yeah so most um in
 
00:33:22.110 --> 00:33:22.120 align:start position:0%
regards with landfill permits um most
 
00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:25.080 align:start position:0%
have either a two-stage or a three-stage
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
process or phase process um
 
00:33:33.029 --> 00:33:33.039 align:start position:0%
so which can eliminate like a you know
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
um like a bad location or whatever right
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
off the bat so in a sense the um the
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
person's not putting in the time or the
 
00:33:42.190 --> 00:33:42.200 align:start position:0%
company's not putting in the time the
 
00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
energy and effort and that um the ones
 
00:33:47.909 --> 00:33:47.919 align:start position:0%
that have a one phase there's only one
 
00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
other one that I found but it's really
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
not a one phase it's it's like it's like
 
00:33:55.470 --> 00:33:55.480 align:start position:0%
phases within the one so um and I think
 
00:33:57.389 --> 00:33:57.399 align:start position:0%
that was like Vermont but you can't even
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
I mean you can't even site a landfill
 
00:34:03.110 --> 00:34:03.120 align:start position:0%
right now in Vermont at all so um this
 
00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:05.240 align:start position:0%
in a sense helps because this is these
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
are the types of things that you would
 
00:34:09.909 --> 00:34:09.919 align:start position:0%
be looking at um as well you
 
00:34:13.109 --> 00:34:13.119 align:start position:0%
know cost net benefit analysis has been
 
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:16.520 align:start position:0%
going on for you know since for you know
 
00:34:18.629 --> 00:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
decades so it's something that's very
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
standard in the country and um that we
 
00:34:24.869 --> 00:34:24.879 align:start position:0%
should be doing that now I put in a bill
 
00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh last term to for a two-phase and um I
 
00:34:31.869 --> 00:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
didn't renew that one but we've got this
 
00:34:33.950 --> 00:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
now and maybe maybe that's something
 
00:34:37.389 --> 00:34:37.399 align:start position:0%
that we think about in um in 2026
 
00:34:39.310 --> 00:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
because that it's it's really helpful in
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
that sense because if you make it
 
00:34:44.510 --> 00:34:44.520 align:start position:0%
through the first phase it it you know
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
that that gives a a good kind of thumbs
 
00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
up to who wherever is looking to to move
 
00:34:51.990 --> 00:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
forward that all the you you've checked
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
all the boxes first location wise all of
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
that kind of stuff um um benefit
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
analysis and all of that
 
00:35:03.630 --> 00:35:03.640 align:start position:0%
so thank you and if I could just the
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
very last section g starting page two
 
00:35:10.030 --> 00:35:10.040 align:start position:0%
lines 11 to 16 that just formally spells
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
out the stages and like how this is a
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
two-stage process so the department
 
00:35:16.910 --> 00:35:16.920 align:start position:0%
shall issue its determination of whether
 
00:35:19.470 --> 00:35:19.480 align:start position:0%
the proposed facility provides a net
 
00:35:21.670 --> 00:35:21.680 align:start position:0%
public benefit prior to completing a
 
00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
full technical review of the application
 
00:35:26.109 --> 00:35:26.119 align:start position:0%
if the department determines that the
 
00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
facility does provide the net public
 
00:35:30.150 --> 00:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
benefit it shall notify the applicant in
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
writing Etc if the department determines
 
00:35:34.990 --> 00:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
that the pro proposed facility does not
 
00:35:37.750 --> 00:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
provide a nut net public benefit it
 
00:35:40.109 --> 00:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
shall issue a written denial of the
 
00:35:42.510 --> 00:35:42.520 align:start position:0%
application so that just very clearly
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
spells out if a net benefit has been
 
00:35:47.750 --> 00:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
determined to exist it moves forward to
 
00:35:49.670 --> 00:35:49.680 align:start position:0%
technical review if it has not been
 
00:35:51.990 --> 00:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
determined to exist then the department
 
00:35:54.829 --> 00:35:54.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
denial one other question so I think the
 
00:36:00.069 --> 00:36:00.079 align:start position:0%
the law is being proposed does not have
 
00:36:02.910 --> 00:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
an appeal process it's if the dees finds
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560 align:start position:0%
yes do you feel there should be any sort
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
of appeal
 
00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
process I mean I would defer i' be
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
interested to hear what the director
 
00:36:19.990 --> 00:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
thinks here I mean I think that the
 
00:36:22.829 --> 00:36:22.839 align:start position:0%
department will be I have no doubt the
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
department would be extremely diligent
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
they're well aware of you know the
 
00:36:27.870 --> 00:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
likelihood of litigation uh which they
 
00:36:29.550 --> 00:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
certainly would be not interested in
 
00:36:31.750 --> 00:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
being caught up in so I have confidence
 
00:36:33.309 --> 00:36:33.319 align:start position:0%
that they would approach the review in a
 
00:36:34.750 --> 00:36:34.760 align:start position:0%
way that would minimize the risk of
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
litigation but the question of appeals
 
00:36:38.230 --> 00:36:38.240 align:start position:0%
is not one that we've discussed so I
 
00:36:40.829 --> 00:36:40.839 align:start position:0%
defer to the director yeah again um
 
00:36:43.390 --> 00:36:43.400 align:start position:0%
unhindered by legal training um my
 
00:36:45.589 --> 00:36:45.599 align:start position:0%
understanding is that the the law is
 
00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
relatively clear that whenever the
 
00:36:49.510 --> 00:36:49.520 align:start position:0%
department makes a decision it is
 
00:36:50.990 --> 00:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
appealable to the waste management
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
Council that's in the stat so I think
 
00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
that this
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
would this first stage decision on net
 
00:36:59.750 --> 00:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
public benefit would be categor my sense
 
00:37:01.550 --> 00:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
would be categorized as a department
 
00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:04.599 align:start position:0%
decision and as such the applicant or or
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
or another agreed party would have uh
 
00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:08.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to appeal the
 
00:37:11.750 --> 00:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
Department's decision on this okay so
 
00:37:13.550 --> 00:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
the appeal process is baked into the
 
00:37:16.030 --> 00:37:16.040 align:start position:0%
code already just not right here in this
 
00:37:18.390 --> 00:37:18.400 align:start position:0%
this bill that that's my uneducated
 
00:37:21.349 --> 00:37:21.359 align:start position:0%
assessment yes okay I I just would be
 
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing whether the this
 
00:37:26.069 --> 00:37:26.079 align:start position:0%
language wouldn't effect negate the the
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
prior uh language of the the appeals
 
00:37:32.349 --> 00:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
process that exists so that that would
 
00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:34.480 align:start position:0%
be the only thing i' I'd like to see
 
00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
that we make sure that the rights of the
 
00:37:42.030 --> 00:37:42.040 align:start position:0%
applicant you know are not unknowingly
 
00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:44.069 align:start position:0%
applicant you know are not unknowingly
taken

00:37:44.069 --> 00:37:44.079 align:start position:0%
taken
 
00:37:46.829 --> 00:37:46.839 align:start position:0%
away yeah I we AB oh I'm sorry yeah I we
 
00:37:48.270 --> 00:37:48.280 align:start position:0%
can verify that when we bring this to
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
the executive session make sure we have
 
00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:50.670 align:start position:0%
the executive session make sure we have
that

00:37:50.670 --> 00:37:50.680 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:37:53.750 --> 00:37:53.760 align:start position:0%
but yeah and and um I just wanted to
 
00:37:58.470 --> 00:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:00.750 --> 00:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
the rules piece of that is never in any
 
00:38:03.670 --> 00:38:03.680 align:start position:0%
of the bills that I've seen so um so it
 
00:38:05.470 --> 00:38:05.480 align:start position:0%
shouldn't negate it because if it's if
 
00:38:07.349 --> 00:38:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's something that's in in rules
 
00:38:10.910 --> 00:38:10.920 align:start position:0%
versus in a statute then it it this
 
00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:12.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't egate that if you know what I'm
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
saying they always thought statute
 
00:38:16.990 --> 00:38:17.000 align:start position:0%
fromed rules so if we said they can't
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
you're done that would negate any the
 
00:38:22.270 --> 00:38:22.280 align:start position:0%
rules the existing
 
00:38:26.349 --> 00:38:26.359 align:start position:0%
rules if I may uh the the law relative
 
00:38:28.190 --> 00:38:28.200 align:start position:0%
to the council EST lishes that the
 
00:38:31.910 --> 00:38:31.920 align:start position:0%
council has um the role of hearing
 
00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:34.280 align:start position:0%
appeals of any Department decisions
 
00:38:36.109 --> 00:38:36.119 align:start position:0%
that's baked into the statute so that's
 
00:38:38.550 --> 00:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
why what I would Envision is that the
 
00:38:40.790 --> 00:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
the written denial or approval that the
 
00:38:42.870 --> 00:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
department is instructed to write after
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
it makes this first stage decision would
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
look a lot like an approval or a denial
 
00:38:49.470 --> 00:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
letter that we write right now and at
 
00:38:51.630 --> 00:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
the very last paragraph of that says if
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
you if any are appealed or if you are
 
00:38:55.190 --> 00:38:55.200 align:start position:0%
agreed by this decision you may appeal
 
00:38:56.990 --> 00:38:57.000 align:start position:0%
to the council within the next number of
 
00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.270 align:start position:0%
to the council within the next number of
days

00:38:58.270 --> 00:38:58.280 align:start position:0%
days
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just going to say that when
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
the denial letter comes from you it says
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
that on there so that's why I it doesn't
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
need to necessarily be in here okay okay
 
00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
thanks can I ask one question about um
 
00:39:14.109 --> 00:39:14.119 align:start position:0%
so what was left um did when OLS did the
 
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
amendment they you had them do a full
 
00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.870 align:start position:0%
amendment they you had them do a full
rewrite

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
rewrite
 
00:39:21.829 --> 00:39:21.839 align:start position:0%
right there was a confusion I explain to
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
them that we were only replacing the
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
first section of the bill and the next
 
00:39:28.870 --> 00:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
two sections were to me remain untouched
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
what they sent us back was didn't
 
00:39:33.630 --> 00:39:33.640 align:start position:0%
include the next two sections which have
 
00:39:36.550 --> 00:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
to do with the only one facility and
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
defining capacity needs so that needs to
 
00:39:40.470 --> 00:39:40.480 align:start position:0%
be added back by OS okay all right
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
sounds good okay uh we do need to wrap
 
00:39:44.750 --> 00:39:44.760 align:start position:0%
things up here we have one more Bill to
 
00:39:47.990 --> 00:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
look at um I would say from as far as
 
00:39:50.270 --> 00:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
this bill is concerned um and your
 
00:39:51.910 --> 00:39:51.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment thank you for doing all the
 
00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
work you've done with the amendment
 
00:39:55.430 --> 00:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
sounds like you do need to contact OSS
 
00:39:58.109 --> 00:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
to add some stuff back in um
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
representative Penza you came a little
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
late to this amendment where uh
 
00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:03.680 align:start position:0%
representative gerana was going through
 
00:40:05.829 --> 00:40:05.839 align:start position:0%
it so I would just recommend uh reading
 
00:40:07.270 --> 00:40:07.280 align:start position:0%
that on your own time if you have any
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
questions or comments direct them to rep
 
00:40:13.910 --> 00:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
ger uh later um and then what we'll do
 
00:40:17.230 --> 00:40:17.240 align:start position:0%
is um I think we're we're all pretty
 
00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
happy at least for whoever supports the
 
00:40:21.030 --> 00:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
bill pretty happy with the process we
 
00:40:24.230 --> 00:40:24.240 align:start position:0%
don't need to discuss this bill again in
 
00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359 align:start position:0%
another solid way subcommittee meeting
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
it can just go to the executive session
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
with the finalized Amendment are you are
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
you happy with that idea yes thank you
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
okay so if that's the case then we'll go
 
00:40:37.750 --> 00:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
ahead and we'll we'll close the uh
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
discussion on um on HB 215 and we'll
 
00:40:42.710 --> 00:40:42.720 align:start position:0%
move on
 
00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
to uh looks like HB 566 right
 
00:40:50.390 --> 00:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
now okay uh thank you Mr chair and so
 
00:40:54.190 --> 00:40:54.200 align:start position:0%
this is should be a fully worked out uh
 
00:40:56.670 --> 00:40:56.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment uh based on again feedback
 
00:40:59.910 --> 00:40:59.920 align:start position:0%
from the director conversations he and I
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
had I also had some conversations with
 
00:41:04.630 --> 00:41:04.640 align:start position:0%
the operations director at the uh
 
00:41:07.390 --> 00:41:07.400 align:start position:0%
TurnKey facility in in Rochester to get
 
00:41:09.630 --> 00:41:09.640 align:start position:0%
a better sense of exactly how lee8
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
management currently Works uh and then
 
00:41:13.589 --> 00:41:13.599 align:start position:0%
we talked about it a little bit in one
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
of our committee sessions uh and so what
 
00:41:19.550 --> 00:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
you can see here is the bill is really
 
00:41:21.589 --> 00:41:21.599 align:start position:0%
um divided
 
00:41:24.470 --> 00:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
in two when I showed it to the committee
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
for visual purposes I split it into two
 
00:41:26.720 --> 00:41:27.950 align:start position:0%
for visual purposes I split it into two
paragraphs

00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
paragraphs
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
the first part which is lines five
 
00:41:33.990 --> 00:41:34.000 align:start position:0%
through about 12 that has to do with a
 
00:41:37.230 --> 00:41:37.240 align:start position:0%
plan when you're applying for a
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
permit there are components that are
 
00:41:43.790 --> 00:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
required to be part of that plan right a
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
detailed plan this is at line seven
 
00:41:48.349 --> 00:41:48.359 align:start position:0%
where lee8 management that provides for
 
00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:50.560 align:start position:0%
safe and effective management of leech
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
eight throughout the entire life of the
 
00:41:54.109 --> 00:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
facility including the post closure
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
period the lee8 management plan shall
 
00:41:58.150 --> 00:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
include at minimum a description of how
 
00:42:00.790 --> 00:42:00.800 align:start position:0%
lee8 will be collected stored on site
 
00:42:02.589 --> 00:42:02.599 align:start position:0%
how it will be transported off site the
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
location and type of disposal processing
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
a statement of projected frequency of
 
00:42:10.309 --> 00:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
Lee transports per week and contingency
 
00:42:13.069 --> 00:42:13.079 align:start position:0%
plans for capacity
 
00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:15.280 align:start position:0%
constraints the management plan shall
 
00:42:17.109 --> 00:42:17.119 align:start position:0%
also include details of contractual
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
Arrangements between the applicant and
 
00:42:21.549 --> 00:42:21.559 align:start position:0%
all entities that will have that will be
 
00:42:23.950 --> 00:42:23.960 align:start position:0%
engaged in the transport uh and the
 
00:42:25.670 --> 00:42:25.680 align:start position:0%
processing of of leech and I think
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
that's important because as the director
 
00:42:32.390 --> 00:42:32.400 align:start position:0%
testified uh right now uh the the the
 
00:42:34.430 --> 00:42:34.440 align:start position:0%
companies who operate these facilities
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
have to uh demonstrate that they have
 
00:42:39.349 --> 00:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
contracts but they're not required to
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
provide specific details about those
 
00:42:45.069 --> 00:42:45.079 align:start position:0%
contracts uh and this amended version of
 
00:42:47.069 --> 00:42:47.079 align:start position:0%
the bill would require that the
 
00:42:49.150 --> 00:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
contractual Arrangements shall
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that the expected daily
 
00:42:53.589 --> 00:42:53.599 align:start position:0%
production of leech 8 can and will be
 
00:42:55.390 --> 00:42:55.400 align:start position:0%
transported off site in a manner that
 
00:42:57.589 --> 00:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
will minimize the possibility of on site
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
contamination and it goes on from there
 
00:43:02.510 --> 00:43:02.520 align:start position:0%
so uh it's actually about line 14 the
 
00:43:03.870 --> 00:43:03.880 align:start position:0%
top part is about what they have to have
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:10.079 align:start position:0%
plan and then from 14 to 20 deal with
 
00:43:12.190 --> 00:43:12.200 align:start position:0%
what the contracts have to be able to
 
00:43:14.069 --> 00:43:14.079 align:start position:0%
demonstrate right so when you're putting
 
00:43:17.710 --> 00:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
in an application uh for a landfill
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
permit you have to have this plan which
 
00:43:25.870 --> 00:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
shows that you are uh you have prepared
 
00:43:30.030 --> 00:43:30.040 align:start position:0%
for the long-term leech eight management
 
00:43:33.589 --> 00:43:33.599 align:start position:0%
onsite Transportation disposal for the
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
lifetime of the facility and for the
 
00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
Post closure period and then kind of the
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
second half starting at line 14 says the
 
00:43:45.069 --> 00:43:45.079 align:start position:0%
contracts must contain certain details
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
and what this amendment does is it moved
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
some things that were originally in that
 
00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
contract piece it moved them up into the
 
00:43:57.150 --> 00:43:57.160 align:start position:0%
top section because we can't require
 
00:43:59.549 --> 00:43:59.559 align:start position:0%
contracts to last 20 years right we
 
00:44:02.510 --> 00:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
can't determine we can't require uh
 
00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
certain kinds of contractual
 
00:44:06.589 --> 00:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
Arrangements instead what we do is we
 
00:44:09.390 --> 00:44:09.400 align:start position:0%
say if you end up with a different
 
00:44:10.630 --> 00:44:10.640 align:start position:0%
contract than the one you're currently
 
00:44:12.430 --> 00:44:12.440 align:start position:0%
operating under you have to provide
 
00:44:14.910 --> 00:44:14.920 align:start position:0%
details of the new contract to the
 
00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:17.960 align:start position:0%
department but so um all of the original
 
00:44:20.589 --> 00:44:20.599 align:start position:0%
material is here as you said some was
 
00:44:22.230 --> 00:44:22.240 align:start position:0%
just moved into the
 
00:44:24.549 --> 00:44:24.559 align:start position:0%
plan because legally it couldn't be in
 
00:44:29.150 --> 00:44:29.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:30.870 --> 00:44:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative gerana I had
 
00:44:34.190 --> 00:44:34.200 align:start position:0%
a couple uh questions I understand that
 
00:44:36.150 --> 00:44:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh already in New Hampshire some of the
 
00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:38.720 align:start position:0%
leate is being treated on site and I
 
00:44:40.950 --> 00:44:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't see the word treatment here at all
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
that may be something you may want to
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
consider including for example on line
 
00:44:48.030 --> 00:44:48.040 align:start position:0%
10 stored on site how it would be
 
00:44:50.549 --> 00:44:50.559 align:start position:0%
transported offsite location and type of
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps treatment and Disposal
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
processing because some of them are
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
doing osmosis prior to removal so
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
they're actually treating on
 
00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.109 align:start position:0%
they're actually treating on
site

00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
site
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
um the um the other suggestion to
 
00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:07.240 align:start position:0%
consider is under line
 
00:45:10.870 --> 00:45:10.880 align:start position:0%
16 the possibility onsite contamination
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
should be on-site and offsite
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
contamination so if there's no treatment
 
00:45:16.270 --> 00:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
and it goes to a treatment plant without
 
00:45:18.910 --> 00:45:18.920 align:start position:0%
proper treatment you'll have uh off-site
 
00:45:21.109 --> 00:45:21.119 align:start position:0%
uh contamination too so I think the
 
00:45:23.390 --> 00:45:23.400 align:start position:0%
question is treatment may may be one to
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
be included both on and then the issue
 
00:45:28.349 --> 00:45:28.359 align:start position:0%
of onsite and offside ination might be
 
00:45:32.390 --> 00:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:35.589 --> 00:45:35.599 align:start position:0%
that yes I I I like the idea of
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
referring to somewhere
 
00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
around from 9 or eight down right the
 
00:45:43.190 --> 00:45:43.200 align:start position:0%
lee8 management plan shall include at
 
00:45:45.549 --> 00:45:45.559 align:start position:0%
minimum a description of how the lee8
 
00:45:47.549 --> 00:45:47.559 align:start position:0%
will be collected and stored on site
 
00:45:49.309 --> 00:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
perhaps there is a phrase that can be
 
00:45:52.349 --> 00:45:52.359 align:start position:0%
put on there put at that point to the
 
00:45:55.470 --> 00:45:55.480 align:start position:0%
extent of um and any
 
00:45:58.150 --> 00:45:58.160 align:start position:0%
on-site treatment plans uh because
 
00:45:59.430 --> 00:45:59.440 align:start position:0%
that's what they do at Rochester they're
 
00:46:01.750 --> 00:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
doing that right now yeah yeah U so I
 
00:46:03.470 --> 00:46:03.480 align:start position:0%
can see putting that in there and then
 
00:46:05.069 --> 00:46:05.079 align:start position:0%
where was your suggestion around the
 
00:46:07.870 --> 00:46:07.880 align:start position:0%
offsite line 16 line 16 the possibility
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
onsite and offsite contamination because
 
00:46:14.349 --> 00:46:14.359 align:start position:0%
um contamination could take place off
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
site if not managed
 
00:46:18.069 --> 00:46:18.079 align:start position:0%
properly example without the
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
pre-treatment with a facility a
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
Wastewater Plant that doesn't right
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
remove the past things like that that is
 
00:46:26.510 --> 00:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
something perhaps we could ask the
 
00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:27.430 align:start position:0%
something perhaps we could ask the
director

00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:27.440 align:start position:0%
director
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
views on I what I don't know is
 
00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
um if it's
 
00:46:37.589 --> 00:46:37.599 align:start position:0%
the operator if the operator's
 
00:46:39.069 --> 00:46:39.079 align:start position:0%
responsibility so let's say you have a
 
00:46:42.390 --> 00:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
contract with somebody to transport the
 
00:46:46.470 --> 00:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
Lee offsite um I I depends on the
 
00:46:48.270 --> 00:46:48.280 align:start position:0%
details of the contract I suppose but it
 
00:46:50.950 --> 00:46:50.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be the facility operator who
 
00:46:52.950 --> 00:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for an
 
00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:55.520 align:start position:0%
offsite spill it would be whoever is
 
00:46:58.069 --> 00:46:58.079 align:start position:0%
contracted to provide that service
 
00:47:00.470 --> 00:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
correct uh I I suppose that would depend
 
00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
on the details of the event but my
 
00:47:04.870 --> 00:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that perhaps and I
 
00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:06.480 align:start position:0%
maybe I'm misunderstanding but I thought
 
00:47:08.710 --> 00:47:08.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps the representative was asking
 
00:47:11.670 --> 00:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
about the possibility of a release
 
00:47:13.270 --> 00:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
happening on the site but then that
 
00:47:16.030 --> 00:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
resulting also in offsite contamination
 
00:47:19.309 --> 00:47:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
yeah well I mean where I then I what I
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
think that makes a little bit confusing
 
00:47:28.150 --> 00:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
is this section of the bill has is
 
00:47:30.630 --> 00:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
referenced to
 
00:47:32.829 --> 00:47:32.839 align:start position:0%
Transportation not a spill that occurs
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
on site and then goes off site okay well
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
trans I mean I believe we already
 
00:47:45.549 --> 00:47:45.559 align:start position:0%
have rules that deal with with that
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
scenario right if we have an on-site
 
00:47:51.790 --> 00:47:51.800 align:start position:0%
lee8 oh sure yeah there are extensive
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
rules about requiring how leech a is
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
collected and transported and and
 
00:47:59.870 --> 00:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
transferred to uh Transportation
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
vehicles and then transport it off
 
00:48:05.230 --> 00:48:05.240 align:start position:0%
site yeah and we also have there's
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
extensive information if there is um
 
00:48:09.910 --> 00:48:09.920 align:start position:0%
with what needs to happen with reporting
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
when there is a a breach or a leak or
 
00:48:13.710 --> 00:48:13.720 align:start position:0%
anything that's correct all right
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
regardless of where the leech at is
 
00:48:17.589 --> 00:48:17.599 align:start position:0%
released if there's a lee8 release
 
00:48:19.069 --> 00:48:19.079 align:start position:0%
there's report they're reporting and
 
00:48:20.990 --> 00:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
response requirements associated with
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
that all right I I have I suggest
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
Amendment for language for you which I
 
00:48:29.030 --> 00:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
can give to you but regarding the issue
 
00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:32.680 align:start position:0%
of treatment on site and and or just you
 
00:48:34.630 --> 00:48:34.640 align:start position:0%
know transportation to treatment offsite
 
00:48:36.670 --> 00:48:36.680 align:start position:0%
we could in line nine say how leate will
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
be collected and sto and stored and
 
00:48:42.750 --> 00:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
treated on site Andor how it will be
 
00:48:45.309 --> 00:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
treated off site for disposal in
 
00:48:47.710 --> 00:48:47.720 align:start position:0%
location so I I think I can give you
 
00:48:48.990 --> 00:48:49.000 align:start position:0%
I'll give you a copy of this you can
 
00:48:51.270 --> 00:48:51.280 align:start position:0%
decide if that language works for you um
 
00:48:54.990 --> 00:48:55.000 align:start position:0%
the other uh issue or question I have so
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
we're basically having the applicant
 
00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:00.480 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that they found a company
 
00:49:02.510 --> 00:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
that could treat this leech a and that
 
00:49:04.510 --> 00:49:04.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to go into a contractual
 
00:49:07.710 --> 00:49:07.720 align:start position:0%
arrange with with them I would also I
 
00:49:09.150 --> 00:49:09.160 align:start position:0%
hate that think the idea that they've
 
00:49:11.990 --> 00:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
tied their tail to just one place and
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
that the stuff is going to be generating
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
continually and if and if some reason
 
00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:20.200 align:start position:0%
their contracted company has problems or
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
shuts down then now we've got a real
 
00:49:25.349 --> 00:49:25.359 align:start position:0%
problem so it it would be nice if we
 
00:49:27.670 --> 00:49:27.680 align:start position:0%
could ask them to certainly demonstrate
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
that they get into a contractual
 
00:49:31.430 --> 00:49:31.440 align:start position:0%
relationship with one and that there are
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
alternatives currently available that
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
they could quickly switch to in case
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
something shuts down and suddenly we've
 
00:49:41.349 --> 00:49:41.359 align:start position:0%
got a problem yeah my understanding and
 
00:49:42.789 --> 00:49:42.799 align:start position:0%
perhaps the director can speak this when
 
00:49:45.549 --> 00:49:45.559 align:start position:0%
I spoke to the folks at at Rochester is
 
00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
that that that is the practice uh and
 
00:49:50.829 --> 00:49:50.839 align:start position:0%
that that that will be in the plan so
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
they have a a current contract with
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
someone and they have contingency PL so
 
00:49:58.710 --> 00:49:58.720 align:start position:0%
that if the person with whom they've
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
contracted all of a sudden doesn't have
 
00:50:04.390 --> 00:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
disposal capacity that there is a
 
00:50:06.789 --> 00:50:06.799 align:start position:0%
secondary and as I understand even a
 
00:50:10.589 --> 00:50:10.599 align:start position:0%
tertiary uh plan for uh contingencies
 
00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:12.520 align:start position:0%
the current rules require that each
 
00:50:14.829 --> 00:50:14.839 align:start position:0%
Facility have at least two contracted
 
00:50:17.950 --> 00:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
outlets for their um for their leech a
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
and in practice we we're aware that most
 
00:50:23.589 --> 00:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
facilities have actually more than two
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
identified um but they're required at
 
00:50:27.630 --> 00:50:27.640 align:start position:0%
minimum to have a contract ual
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
arrangement with at least two
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
facilities okay so based on again
 
00:50:33.390 --> 00:50:33.400 align:start position:0%
current rules that we don't need to add
 
00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
that language into this I would only I
 
00:50:37.589 --> 00:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
think it's an excellent question I would
 
00:50:40.190 --> 00:50:40.200 align:start position:0%
only do it if if the director felt it
 
00:50:41.950 --> 00:50:41.960 align:start position:0%
strengthened the
 
00:50:44.789 --> 00:50:44.799 align:start position:0%
Department's work uh because as the
 
00:50:46.750 --> 00:50:46.760 align:start position:0%
Director has pointed out before there is
 
00:50:49.030 --> 00:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
overlap between this bill and existing
 
00:50:50.870 --> 00:50:50.880 align:start position:0%
rules but we've written in it a way that
 
00:50:52.750 --> 00:50:52.760 align:start position:0%
the department feels it strengthens what
 
00:50:54.510 --> 00:50:54.520 align:start position:0%
they're able to do so if that was
 
00:50:56.630 --> 00:50:56.640 align:start position:0%
something that the director felt would
 
00:50:58.750 --> 00:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
would be abused to Dees I wouldn't be
 
00:51:00.630 --> 00:51:00.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to it at all if he doesn't think
 
00:51:02.829 --> 00:51:02.839 align:start position:0%
it's necessary then I would defer to his
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
judgment okay just so we all know we uh
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
need to wrap it up here really quickly
 
00:51:08.870 --> 00:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
um representative Penza you have one
 
00:51:11.510 --> 00:51:11.520 align:start position:0%
more question yes so it's for
 
00:51:14.190 --> 00:51:14.200 align:start position:0%
representative Don as well as um Mr
 
00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.589 align:start position:0%
representative Don as well as um Mr
whims

00:51:16.589 --> 00:51:16.599 align:start position:0%
whims
 
00:51:19.829 --> 00:51:19.839 align:start position:0%
um I I think the point is taken because
 
00:51:23.309 --> 00:51:23.319 align:start position:0%
there are so where it says
 
00:51:27.390 --> 00:51:27.400 align:start position:0%
um uh a statement of how where is it
 
00:51:29.470 --> 00:51:29.480 align:start position:0%
okay here it is how Lee will be
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
collected and stored on site um which
 
00:51:36.069 --> 00:51:36.079 align:start position:0%
line it's line it's line 9 to 10 will be
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
collected and stored on site because
 
00:51:40.510 --> 00:51:40.520 align:start position:0%
there are some locations that might do
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
treatment on site so I think that it
 
00:51:45.430 --> 00:51:45.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense to add that in just because
 
00:51:47.910 --> 00:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
of that and you could it could basically
 
00:51:50.870 --> 00:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
be um
 
00:51:53.549 --> 00:51:53.559 align:start position:0%
um you know treatment onsite in
 
00:51:55.990 --> 00:51:56.000 align:start position:0%
parenthesis if you know if applicable
 
00:51:58.510 --> 00:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
because some people don't of course or
 
00:52:00.549 --> 00:52:00.559 align:start position:0%
some places don't and then and then it
 
00:52:01.870 --> 00:52:01.880 align:start position:0%
can continue on how it will be
 
00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:03.880 align:start position:0%
transported offsite for treatment
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
whatever I I agree I think that you
 
00:52:07.510 --> 00:52:07.520 align:start position:0%
could put that in there just because it
 
00:52:10.190 --> 00:52:10.200 align:start position:0%
would apply for anyone that is treating
 
00:52:11.230 --> 00:52:11.240 align:start position:0%
it on
 
00:52:13.630 --> 00:52:13.640 align:start position:0%
site yeah agree that wouldn't hurt
 
00:52:15.910 --> 00:52:15.920 align:start position:0%
anything right no I don't believe so
 
00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:18.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay so it sounds like there's been
 
00:52:20.789 --> 00:52:20.799 align:start position:0%
some um interesting questions brought up
 
00:52:22.549 --> 00:52:22.559 align:start position:0%
about this and it sounds like this one
 
00:52:24.750 --> 00:52:24.760 align:start position:0%
needs maybe a little bit more work uh
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative gerna than the
 
00:52:29.510 --> 00:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
others um and I'm wondering I mean this
 
00:52:32.069 --> 00:52:32.079 align:start position:0%
is an FN bill so it needs to be acted on
 
00:52:35.069 --> 00:52:35.079 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly um and I'm wondering if
 
00:52:37.470 --> 00:52:37.480 align:start position:0%
maybe whatever work you do on the
 
00:52:40.030 --> 00:52:40.040 align:start position:0%
amendment maybe we should have one more
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
quick um Solid Waste committee meeting
 
00:52:44.510 --> 00:52:44.520 align:start position:0%
before it gets presented to Executive
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
session or do you feel confident that
 
00:52:48.270 --> 00:52:48.280 align:start position:0%
maybe you can be in discussion with
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
Representatives uh Penza Scully and
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
grber about the the tweaks you need to
 
00:52:54.910 --> 00:52:54.920 align:start position:0%
make and then and then it can just go
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
straight to Executive session what are
 
00:52:57.710 --> 00:52:57.720 align:start position:0%
your thoughts on that well I think we
 
00:52:59.270 --> 00:52:59.280 align:start position:0%
should talk to the chair and the ranking
 
00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:01.920 align:start position:0%
member about the timeline my sense is
 
00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720 align:start position:0%
that we may not have time for another uh
 
00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting before we have to
 
00:53:08.349 --> 00:53:08.359 align:start position:0%
report this out so I think we should
 
00:53:09.510 --> 00:53:09.520 align:start position:0%
just have a discussion with the chair
 
00:53:13.589 --> 00:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
and the ranking member um if we have the
 
00:53:15.789 --> 00:53:15.799 align:start position:0%
time then I think it makes sense to have
 
00:53:18.230 --> 00:53:18.240 align:start position:0%
another meeting to discuss it uh if we
 
00:53:20.270 --> 00:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
do not uh it sounds like we've got
 
00:53:22.510 --> 00:53:22.520 align:start position:0%
consensus over the changes that we want
 
00:53:25.829 --> 00:53:25.839 align:start position:0%
and so I could have those changes made
 
00:53:28.150 --> 00:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
circulate it and we could agree among
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
ourselves prior to the executive session
 
00:53:32.870 --> 00:53:32.880 align:start position:0%
next week okay so you think we can avoid
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
another Solid Waste subcommittee meeting
 
00:53:35.990 --> 00:53:36.000 align:start position:0%
I do it sounds like we've got good
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
consensus about changes that we would
 
00:53:41.309 --> 00:53:41.319 align:start position:0%
agree on okay good happy to hear that uh
 
00:53:44.829 --> 00:53:44.839 align:start position:0%
if that's the case then uh We've um
 
00:53:46.270 --> 00:53:46.280 align:start position:0%
we've discussed all three bills that
 
00:53:49.270 --> 00:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
were on our docket today and um if I'll
 
00:53:50.950 --> 00:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to adjourn our
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
meeting so
 
00:53:58.910 --> 00:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
moved okay um all in favor I I motion um
 
00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:25.349 align:start position:0%
moved okay um all in favor I I motion um

01:02:19.670 --> 01:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
you so this morning we uh we have before
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
us a work session for a number of bills
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
and um I just kind of want to catch up
 
01:02:31.150 --> 01:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
as to the status of each of these what
 
01:02:35.630 --> 01:02:35.640 align:start position:0%
we're doing with them and of Thoughts by
 
01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:36.309 align:start position:0%
we're doing with them and of Thoughts by
the

01:02:36.309 --> 01:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:02:42.829 --> 01:02:42.839 align:start position:0%
committee so we can start um with HP4
 
01:02:45.470 --> 01:02:45.480 align:start position:0%
479 establishing a committee to study
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
the use and problems associated with
 
01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
regulating and distribution and disposal
 
01:02:52.710 --> 01:02:52.720 align:start position:0%
of certain Solid Waste within landfills
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
and transfer
 
01:02:58.510 --> 01:02:58.520 align:start position:0%
centers uh does anybody who was at the
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
hearing would anybody like to share
 
01:03:03.109 --> 01:03:03.119 align:start position:0%
their thoughts on that uh hearing uh
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
representative um Bixby yeah so I
 
01:03:09.710 --> 01:03:09.720 align:start position:0%
thought that the um the testimony was
 
01:03:12.109 --> 01:03:12.119 align:start position:0%
convincing uh in terms of their needs to
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
be well first of all that the bill was
 
01:03:17.870 --> 01:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
not actually about just sort of random
 
01:03:19.510 --> 01:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
waste but it was actually specifically
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
about plastic bags um and that uh the
 
01:03:26.549 --> 01:03:26.559 align:start position:0%
that I think they were ConEd ining that
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
uh plastic bags are really a problem I I
 
01:03:33.190 --> 01:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
was particularly struck by the cost of
 
01:03:36.390 --> 01:03:36.400 align:start position:0%
uh of having plastic bags in the system
 
01:03:38.829 --> 01:03:38.839 align:start position:0%
to in in terms of how much that costs
 
01:03:40.910 --> 01:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
communities when it gums up the works
 
01:03:44.269 --> 01:03:44.279 align:start position:0%
and how that uh that cost is sent back
 
01:03:47.109 --> 01:03:47.119 align:start position:0%
to the to the community basically
 
01:03:48.910 --> 01:03:48.920 align:start position:0%
penalizing them for send for having
 
01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:50.720 align:start position:0%
plastic bags in their waste stream in
 
01:03:53.990 --> 01:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
their recycling stream uh that's you
 
01:03:56.269 --> 01:03:56.279 align:start position:0%
know and it's also a very it's a large
 
01:03:58.630 --> 01:03:58.640 align:start position:0%
cost to Industry as well so I I think
 
01:04:01.789 --> 01:04:01.799 align:start position:0%
that's that really struck me uh so I
 
01:04:04.390 --> 01:04:04.400 align:start position:0%
think that we need to do something um
 
01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
but I'm not convinced that the best
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
approach is to do a study committee and
 
01:04:12.069 --> 01:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
the suggestion came up to see if the
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group would be
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
willing to work on that I just got off
 
01:04:19.109 --> 01:04:19.119 align:start position:0%
the phone with Karen eel and she said
 
01:04:23.309 --> 01:04:23.319 align:start position:0%
that um the swag isn't working uh isn't
 
01:04:25.950 --> 01:04:25.960 align:start position:0%
meeting uh for again until the the end
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
of March uh so she can't speak for the
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
whole committee but she would be willing
 
01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:34.440 align:start position:0%
to bring it up to the committee um and
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
she agreed that it it would fall within
 
01:04:39.870 --> 01:04:39.880 align:start position:0%
the purview of the committee uh so it
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
seems Seems like she is she is certainly
 
01:04:44.230 --> 01:04:44.240 align:start position:0%
willing to you know for her part to to
 
01:04:46.029 --> 01:04:46.039 align:start position:0%
have the committee look at that but is
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
not going to you know speak for the
 
01:04:50.950 --> 01:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
committee um but I suggested that maybe
 
01:04:52.670 --> 01:04:52.680 align:start position:0%
we could as a committee could write a
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
letter to the solid waste working group
 
01:04:57.829 --> 01:04:57.839 align:start position:0%
request that they do this and providing
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit of um background for why
 
01:05:02.910 --> 01:05:02.920 align:start position:0%
this is important uh that you based on
 
01:05:04.670 --> 01:05:04.680 align:start position:0%
what we heard in testimony and she
 
01:05:06.510 --> 01:05:06.520 align:start position:0%
thought that was a great
 
01:05:08.990 --> 01:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
idea oh and she also suggested that
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to retain the bill rather
 
01:05:12.510 --> 01:05:12.520 align:start position:0%
than just itl
 
01:05:16.309 --> 01:05:16.319 align:start position:0%
it uh well I'll lend my thoughts
 
01:05:18.190 --> 01:05:18.200 align:start position:0%
especially as a member of the solid
 
01:05:20.430 --> 01:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
waste working group I concur with much
 
01:05:23.309 --> 01:05:23.319 align:start position:0%
of what you've said uh I don't believe
 
01:05:25.029 --> 01:05:25.039 align:start position:0%
the study committee would be the best
 
01:05:27.549 --> 01:05:27.559 align:start position:0%
use of our time especially since the
 
01:05:30.589 --> 01:05:30.599 align:start position:0%
people who came to testify uh especially
 
01:05:33.029 --> 01:05:33.039 align:start position:0%
with regard to single-use plastic bags
 
01:05:35.069 --> 01:05:35.079 align:start position:0%
have already done all the research and
 
01:05:37.349 --> 01:05:37.359 align:start position:0%
all the work and all the study and I
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
think if they bring that information to
 
01:05:43.589 --> 01:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group that um
 
01:05:43.599 --> 01:05:44.589 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group that um
they

01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:05:49.230 --> 01:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
can possibly work fairly quickly on um
 
01:05:51.789 --> 01:05:51.799 align:start position:0%
formulating some sort of language that
 
01:05:56.990 --> 01:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
may be um able to be submitted did for a
 
01:06:00.670 --> 01:06:00.680 align:start position:0%
for a bill um I don't know that I would
 
01:06:03.910 --> 01:06:03.920 align:start position:0%
want to retain the bill per se
 
01:06:06.269 --> 01:06:06.279 align:start position:0%
because again I don't I don't really see
 
01:06:08.710 --> 01:06:08.720 align:start position:0%
a need for a study committee because all
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
the study and all the work has already
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
been done but I do agree that if we
 
01:06:15.510 --> 01:06:15.520 align:start position:0%
write a letter as a committee to the
 
01:06:18.710 --> 01:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
solid waste working group and um
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
indicate who are the individuals that
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
came who had the research and the
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
information that they Solid Waste
 
01:06:28.349 --> 01:06:28.359 align:start position:0%
working group should um incorporate
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
their work and their comments uh and
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
into whatever uh they can put together
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
as language for a bill to come forward
 
01:06:40.829 --> 01:06:40.839 align:start position:0%
perhaps next year so that's my thought
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
on this bill I don't I I wouldn't
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
necessarily itl because I think it's a
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
horrible idea I think we itl this bill
 
01:06:54.510 --> 01:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
um because there is a another means by
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
which we can get something
 
01:07:00.349 --> 01:07:00.359 align:start position:0%
accomplished and uh I don't think a
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
study committee is the best use of that
 
01:07:06.029 --> 01:07:06.039 align:start position:0%
representative guber uh thank you uh
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
chair um I really uh fully support your
 
01:07:11.910 --> 01:07:11.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation to proceed in that way
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
I'm a co-sponsor on this and I I think
 
01:07:16.670 --> 01:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
that approach is much more logical
 
01:07:18.150 --> 01:07:18.160 align:start position:0%
there's the plastic working group has
 
01:07:20.190 --> 01:07:20.200 align:start position:0%
lots of data for a number of years I
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
think that's the way to go so I support
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
that fully okay thank you any other
 
01:07:26.950 --> 01:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
comments on represent
 
01:07:29.710 --> 01:07:29.720 align:start position:0%
Penza I um I strongly agree with your
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
recommendations so are you thinking that
 
01:07:35.670 --> 01:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
um basically a letter comes from
 
01:07:37.589 --> 01:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
possibly the the people that sponsored
 
01:07:39.470 --> 01:07:39.480 align:start position:0%
the bill about what they're looking at
 
01:07:41.309 --> 01:07:41.319 align:start position:0%
to be discussed in the solid waste
 
01:07:42.910 --> 01:07:42.920 align:start position:0%
working group is that what you're
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
thinking or a letter from you I wanted
 
01:07:48.029 --> 01:07:48.039 align:start position:0%
to kind of understand I I I would
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
suggest uh as representative Bixby
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
suggested that a letter be drafted um on
 
01:07:57.430 --> 01:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
behalf of the committee and perhaps you
 
01:08:00.109 --> 01:08:00.119 align:start position:0%
would like to draft that letter oh I
 
01:08:00.970 --> 01:08:00.980 align:start position:0%
guess I just did yeah
 
01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:04.750 align:start position:0%
guess I just did yeah
[Laughter]

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:04.760 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:08:07.549 --> 01:08:07.559 align:start position:0%
sure okay representative
 
01:08:11.069 --> 01:08:11.079 align:start position:0%
Howard would it um help the to advances
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
to be specific about plastic bags rather
 
01:08:16.070 --> 01:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
than the that sort of General phrase of
 
01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
of yeah yeah
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
yeah any other questions or
 
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:31.630 --> 01:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
all right uh so our I guess our plan is
 
01:08:34.070 --> 01:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh to then itl that
 
01:08:37.070 --> 01:08:37.080 align:start position:0%
bill we could do that today if folks
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
wouldn't mind um and then I don't
 
01:08:45.229 --> 01:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
know think that if we have time I'm not
 
01:08:47.749 --> 01:08:47.759 align:start position:0%
sure I don't sorry go ahead I don't
 
01:08:49.950 --> 01:08:49.960 align:start position:0%
think that fits into the current way of
 
01:08:52.349 --> 01:08:52.359 align:start position:0%
noticing I think you you you if a bill
 
01:08:55.990 --> 01:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
has heard the you can you can do a exec
 
01:08:58.510 --> 01:08:58.520 align:start position:0%
on a bill that is heard the same day but
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not uh if it's not in a hearing
 
01:09:03.269 --> 01:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
for that day then it has to be noticed
 
01:09:05.550 --> 01:09:05.560 align:start position:0%
as a separate executive session no I was
 
01:09:07.709 --> 01:09:07.719 align:start position:0%
under the understanding that if any of
 
01:09:11.349 --> 01:09:11.359 align:start position:0%
the bills that are in before us we could
 
01:09:14.669 --> 01:09:14.679 align:start position:0%
uh exact as long as everybody agreed to
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
it yeah I I think that it I think it
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
makes more sense I it's not going to be
 
01:09:20.110 --> 01:09:20.120 align:start position:0%
a very okay it's not going to be long
 
01:09:22.229 --> 01:09:22.239 align:start position:0%
exact in any case so I think we we
 
01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:23.480 align:start position:0%
should just do it we'll put it on the
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
docket for next week then next week
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
thank you okay no worries um I'm good
 
01:09:29.159 --> 01:09:30.149 align:start position:0%
thank you okay no worries um I'm good
with

01:09:30.149 --> 01:09:30.159 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:09:34.950 --> 01:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
that next we have HB 658 raising the cap
 
01:09:36.709 --> 01:09:36.719 align:start position:0%
on certain reimbursements from oil
 
01:09:40.349 --> 01:09:40.359 align:start position:0%
discharge and Disposal cleanup fund I
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
believe that there is um some work being
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:49.789 --> 01:09:49.799 align:start position:0%
bill uh represent Biby no this this was
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
actually the one that didn't need any
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
work at all oh okay um oh right right
 
01:09:58.709 --> 01:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
right this this one is uh the fees yeah
 
01:10:02.550 --> 01:10:02.560 align:start position:0%
right so uh the what this bill does is
 
01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:03.310 align:start position:0%
right so uh the what this bill does is
it

01:10:03.310 --> 01:10:03.320 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:10:05.669 --> 01:10:05.679 align:start position:0%
reauthorizes the
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%
um the oil discharge and Disposal
 
01:10:12.070 --> 01:10:12.080 align:start position:0%
cleanup fund and what that fund does is
 
01:10:14.590 --> 01:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
uh if there has been an oil spill
 
01:10:17.110 --> 01:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
somewhere in the State uh right which is
 
01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
very often the result of a failed tank
 
01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh but sometimes the result of a a
 
01:10:26.550 --> 01:10:26.560 align:start position:0%
traffic accident um then uh the cost of
 
01:10:28.830 --> 01:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
the cleanup for that is covered by this
 
01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:34.440 align:start position:0%
fund and uh and the fund also provides
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
uh a uh re partial help for uh people
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
who don't have the money to replace
 
01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
their oil tanks when those oil tanks are
 
01:10:45.990 --> 01:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
getting towards the end of their life uh
 
01:10:48.390 --> 01:10:48.400 align:start position:0%
it will provide assistance with that
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
right and uh which is and um I think we
 
01:10:54.830 --> 01:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
can all agree that it's much better to
 
01:10:58.510 --> 01:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh help someone with the cost of uh of
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
replacing the tank rather than having to
 
01:11:01.950 --> 01:11:01.960 align:start position:0%
deal with what happens when the tank
 
01:11:07.070 --> 01:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
fails y uh so uh the reimbursement rates
 
01:11:10.790 --> 01:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
um had not uh needed to be increased
 
01:11:12.550 --> 01:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
because things like the cost of Steel
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
have increased recently uh and uh so the
 
01:11:20.189 --> 01:11:20.199 align:start position:0%
bill the bill makes that reimbursement
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
rate increase it also readjusts the
 
01:11:28.390 --> 01:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
particular uh rates on the the fees uh
 
01:11:32.630 --> 01:11:32.640 align:start position:0%
to balance it uh in terms of uh what
 
01:11:34.709 --> 01:11:34.719 align:start position:0%
sources of oil coming into the state are
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
most prominent and uh so that it uh it
 
01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
it's geared towards making sure that the
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
fund the monies in the fund are
 
01:11:47.229 --> 01:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
sufficient to cover the costs but don't
 
01:11:49.350 --> 01:11:49.360 align:start position:0%
exceed what what's really needed yep
 
01:11:52.110 --> 01:11:52.120 align:start position:0%
thank you for that summary of uh of that
 
01:11:55.950 --> 01:11:55.960 align:start position:0%
bill I I Concur and um
 
01:11:58.790 --> 01:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
look forward to an autop pass motion
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
when we go into exec session um we'll
 
01:12:02.990 --> 01:12:03.000 align:start position:0%
have to work out uh who's making the
 
01:12:05.229 --> 01:12:05.239 align:start position:0%
motions but otherwise okay we're good
 
01:12:09.750 --> 01:12:09.760 align:start position:0%
any other comments on that all right
 
01:12:12.470 --> 01:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
another bill uh that I wanted to discuss
 
01:12:15.149 --> 01:12:15.159 align:start position:0%
with the members of the committee is
 
01:12:17.470 --> 01:12:17.480 align:start position:0%
hb77 requiring the Department of
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services to establish a
 
01:12:21.310 --> 01:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
site specific setback distance for
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
proposed new landfills we heard that
 
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:26.030 align:start position:0%
proposed new landfills we heard that
bill

01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:28.120 align:start position:0%
um last
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
week and uh I know that there is some
 
01:12:35.229 --> 01:12:35.239 align:start position:0%
work that needs to be done to make some
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
changes to that bill um it is was not
 
01:12:40.790 --> 01:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
discussed in the subcommittee this
 
01:12:45.270 --> 01:12:45.280 align:start position:0%
morning but is that that is one that um
 
01:12:47.669 --> 01:12:47.679 align:start position:0%
yeah that we uh we going to be working
 
01:12:52.110 --> 01:12:52.120 align:start position:0%
on now um I do know this
 
01:12:55.470 --> 01:12:55.480 align:start position:0%
morning I I had made a request to the
 
01:12:57.470 --> 01:12:57.480 align:start position:0%
Department of Environmental Services

Department of Environmental Services
director

01:12:58.430 --> 01:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
whimet um to provide us with a map of
 
01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.550 align:start position:0%
whimet um to provide us with a map of
New

01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um based on the criteria set
 
01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:10.080 align:start position:0%
in the current version of
 
01:13:15.430 --> 01:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
hb77 um to show places in New Hampshire
 
01:13:18.910 --> 01:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
where a landfill could be cited and
 
01:13:22.270 --> 01:13:22.280 align:start position:0%
could not be cited based on the criteria
 
01:13:26.669 --> 01:13:26.679 align:start position:0%
in the bill and so he uh was able to
 
01:13:29.870 --> 01:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
provide us with
 
01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
maps that
 
01:13:35.790 --> 01:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
show if there was a 3,000 foot buffer on
 
01:13:39.229 --> 01:13:39.239 align:start position:0%
surface water um the first map which is
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
being distributed the the um maps are
 
01:13:46.550 --> 01:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
being distributed uh shows where in
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
blue um landfills would not be able to
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
be cited based on that surface water um
 
01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:55.629 align:start position:0%
be cited based on that surface water um
criteria

01:13:55.629 --> 01:13:55.639 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:13:59.550 --> 01:13:59.560 align:start position:0%
the second map shows the 10 Mile buffer
 
01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.830 align:start position:0%
the second map shows the 10 Mile buffer
on

01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:06.199 align:start position:0%
um uh what is it the uh uh Brownfield
 
01:14:10.310 --> 01:14:10.320 align:start position:0%
sites or uh or uh current landfill sites
 
01:14:14.310 --> 01:14:14.320 align:start position:0%
or super fun sites and that also shows
 
01:14:17.430 --> 01:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
in white places where landfills would be
 
01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
able to be uh put if you combine both
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
Maps uh you will see the last map shows
 
01:14:28.669 --> 01:14:28.679 align:start position:0%
uh very small areas where a landfill
 
01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
would be able to be cited under the um
 
01:14:36.510 --> 01:14:36.520 align:start position:0%
criteria set forth in this bill so that
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't leave a lot of whole lot of
 
01:14:40.310 --> 01:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
places for landfills to be cited in New
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire apparently um and that's just
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
with the buffer on surface water and
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
buffer on current L
 
01:14:51.629 --> 01:14:51.639 align:start position:0%
landfills so I want the committee to
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
take a look at this we can have a
 
01:14:55.950 --> 01:14:55.960 align:start position:0%
discussion about perh perhaps uh if
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's any changes that should or could
 
01:15:01.830 --> 01:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
be made to uh to the uh current
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
legislation I know um that
 
01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative Penza was looking at
 
01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:11.600 align:start position:0%
making changes to the 10- mile buffer uh
 
01:15:15.750 --> 01:15:15.760 align:start position:0%
between uh npl on npl and landfill sites
 
01:15:17.709 --> 01:15:17.719 align:start position:0%
so I don't know would you like to speak
 
01:15:22.629 --> 01:15:22.639 align:start position:0%
to uh the changes that you're looking at
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:32.030 --> 01:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
yes so um we can start with that
 
01:15:36.189 --> 01:15:36.199 align:start position:0%
one so that's on page two line starts on
 
01:15:36.199 --> 01:15:37.830 align:start position:0%
one so that's on page two line starts on
line

01:15:37.830 --> 01:15:37.840 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:40.270 align:start position:0%
line
34

01:15:40.270 --> 01:15:40.280 align:start position:0%
34
 
01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:43.239 align:start position:0%
um I didn't realize the impact that it
 
01:15:46.229 --> 01:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
would have um there were certain um
 
01:15:49.750 --> 01:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
certain sites that um have been
 
01:15:52.709 --> 01:15:52.719 align:start position:0%
decommissioned for a long time um you
 
01:15:54.590 --> 01:15:54.600 align:start position:0%
know it was more so just trying to
 
01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:55.629 align:start position:0%
know it was more so just trying to
protect

01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:55.639 align:start position:0%
protect
 
01:15:58.709 --> 01:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
of course um any sort of groundwater
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
contamination um that that whole area
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
could probably be um removed so also
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
with um just talking with other uh
 
01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
entities here
 
01:16:18.310 --> 01:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
the the 3,000 foot buffer could possibly
 
01:16:20.790 --> 01:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
change because we have if we're going to
 
01:16:23.590 --> 01:16:23.600 align:start position:0%
use one or the other so if we've got
 
01:16:25.350 --> 01:16:25.360 align:start position:0%
time of travel that we're using using we
 
01:16:27.550 --> 01:16:27.560 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily need to have the
 
01:16:30.669 --> 01:16:30.679 align:start position:0%
3,000ft buffer so um that could also
 
01:16:34.750 --> 01:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
change as well um we were just kind of
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
throwing a lot of things out here so and
 
01:16:40.510 --> 01:16:40.520 align:start position:0%
then of course um on the back of the
 
01:16:45.910 --> 01:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
bill uh page three um in
 
01:16:52.430 --> 01:16:52.440 align:start position:0%
regards uh starts online I believe um 18
 
01:16:57.510 --> 01:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
and goes into line 30 on page three um
 
01:16:58.709 --> 01:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:17:02.430 --> 01:17:02.440 align:start position:0%
violations um because right now you're
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
not able to um you're not able to
 
01:17:09.390 --> 01:17:09.400 align:start position:0%
actually put a permit in if you have if
 
01:17:12.510 --> 01:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
there's like active if there's an active
 
01:17:15.149 --> 01:17:15.159 align:start position:0%
legal lawsuit going on we could probably
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
just mirror that language specifically
 
01:17:20.430 --> 01:17:20.440 align:start position:0%
um and I will get that language directly
 
01:17:24.270 --> 01:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
from director whims um so that's just
 
01:17:29.189 --> 01:17:29.199 align:start position:0%
mirroring that in here um and maybe in
 
01:17:31.590 --> 01:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
in regards with you know if you know if
 
01:17:33.550 --> 01:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
we wanted to say something about
 
01:17:36.030 --> 01:17:36.040 align:start position:0%
violations um you know if there was
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
repeated violations or um issuance from
 
01:17:41.310 --> 01:17:41.320 align:start position:0%
let's say from the attorney's General's
 
01:17:43.629 --> 01:17:43.639 align:start position:0%
office or something like that of someone
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
that's like completely in non-compliance
 
01:17:48.350 --> 01:17:48.360 align:start position:0%
and that stays in non-compliance against
 
01:17:50.310 --> 01:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
the state and the authority of the state
 
01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
we could maybe say something like that
 
01:17:54.350 --> 01:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
um but that would be an extreme type of
 
01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:55.750 align:start position:0%
um but that would be an extreme type of
situation

01:17:55.750 --> 01:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:18:00.350 --> 01:18:00.360 align:start position:0%
viations and's mple viations and then
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
fixed and we don't want don't want that
 
01:18:05.629 --> 01:18:05.639 align:start position:0%
we're not um being um a little
 
01:18:08.310 --> 01:18:08.320 align:start position:0%
ridiculous over the top um mistakes
 
01:18:12.229 --> 01:18:12.239 align:start position:0%
happen these are you know big huge um
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
multi-million dollar facilities and um
 
01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:16.320 align:start position:0%
and certain things happen and they get
 
01:18:18.070 --> 01:18:18.080 align:start position:0%
fixed so
 
01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.430 align:start position:0%
fixed so
[Music]

01:18:19.430 --> 01:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:18:23.229 --> 01:18:23.239 align:start position:0%
um the now I would also remind the
 
01:18:25.270 --> 01:18:25.280 align:start position:0%
committee this is not an early bill so
 
01:18:27.750 --> 01:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
we do have some time to work on it yeah
 
01:18:30.390 --> 01:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
that's what I was hoping okay y um we
 
01:18:32.910 --> 01:18:32.920 align:start position:0%
already talked about um just in the
 
01:18:36.590 --> 01:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
beginning of the bill uh which was um
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
about where is it at adding in a a
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
potable water piece um that was like
 
01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:50.360 align:start position:0%
in uh around line 16 correct thank
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
you um and
 
01:18:59.750 --> 01:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
that was those are pretty much all of
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's pretty much all of the
 
01:19:07.149 --> 01:19:07.159 align:start position:0%
issues that I had here um
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
and I already had told you about the
 
01:19:16.030 --> 01:19:16.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:18.830 --> 01:19:18.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah that's that's pretty much all of
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
them if there's anything else um
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
director whimet is there anything else
 
01:19:29.900 --> 01:19:29.910 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:32.590 align:start position:0%
 
[Laughter]

01:19:32.590 --> 01:19:32.600 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:19:35.709 --> 01:19:35.719 align:start position:0%
okay all right representative
 
01:19:38.550 --> 01:19:38.560 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair um I
 
01:19:41.070 --> 01:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate the um work the director has
 
01:19:43.830 --> 01:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
put in and giving us this map that being
 
01:19:47.629 --> 01:19:47.639 align:start position:0%
said you know the way I feel like this
 
01:19:50.790 --> 01:19:50.800 align:start position:0%
work should be done is that irrespective
 
01:19:53.870 --> 01:19:53.880 align:start position:0%
of any state or location there should be
 
01:19:57.629 --> 01:19:57.639 align:start position:0%
some general principles around sighting
 
01:20:00.870 --> 01:20:00.880 align:start position:0%
of landfills that are really Universal
 
01:20:03.030 --> 01:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
and in my mind's eye we come up with
 
01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
these ideas of where a a landfill should
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
or shouldn't be and then we determine
 
01:20:11.390 --> 01:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
whether or not it would fit in our state
 
01:20:13.910 --> 01:20:13.920 align:start position:0%
and my attitude is is that if we've come
 
01:20:16.590 --> 01:20:16.600 align:start position:0%
up with what what we believe are good
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
recommendations on landfill sighting and
 
01:20:21.510 --> 01:20:21.520 align:start position:0%
then we find out that it wouldn't fit in
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
our state my attitude is well then it
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in our state
 
01:20:28.870 --> 01:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
um so you know you I'm looking at this
 
01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:30.920 align:start position:0%
map and I'm seeing yeah there's a lot of
 
01:20:33.149 --> 01:20:33.159 align:start position:0%
groundwater all over the state and when
 
01:20:35.390 --> 01:20:35.400 align:start position:0%
I think of landfills I think landfills
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
and groundwater are incompatible with
 
01:20:42.390 --> 01:20:42.400 align:start position:0%
one another so so my concern is is that
 
01:20:46.110 --> 01:20:46.120 align:start position:0%
um my concern is that I don't I hope we
 
01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
I mean it's not my bill I'm a co-sponsor
 
01:20:49.629 --> 01:20:49.639 align:start position:0%
but I'm not going to hijack it it's not
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
my baby but I I would be remiss if we
 
01:20:55.229 --> 01:20:55.239 align:start position:0%
started weakening the bill
 
01:20:59.790 --> 01:20:59.800 align:start position:0%
in order to allow for a landfill to be
 
01:21:02.310 --> 01:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
put in our state you know we're a small
 
01:21:03.790 --> 01:21:03.800 align:start position:0%
state groundwater is everywhere it's
 
01:21:07.510 --> 01:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
heavily forested um you know places like
 
01:21:10.629 --> 01:21:10.639 align:start position:0%
Florida they do they have a ton of waste
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
to energy plants a ton of incineration
 
01:21:14.790 --> 01:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
plants because their groundwater is
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
literally under their feet everywhere in
 
01:21:18.790 --> 01:21:18.800 align:start position:0%
the state they just can't do landfills
 
01:21:21.590 --> 01:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
like other states can so you know we
 
01:21:24.310 --> 01:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
have a slightly different reason but
 
01:21:26.110 --> 01:21:26.120 align:start position:0%
maybe it's just the reason is we just
 
01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have landfills for other
 
01:21:30.030 --> 01:21:30.040 align:start position:0%
reasons and so I just hope that we don't
 
01:21:32.990 --> 01:21:33.000 align:start position:0%
we don't neuter the bill in order to you
 
01:21:35.629 --> 01:21:35.639 align:start position:0%
know cave to some idea that we're
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
supposed to have landfills because it it
 
01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
could just be that our state is
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
incompatible with landfills so okay
 
01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.149 align:start position:0%
incompatible with landfills so okay
representative

01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:21:47.229 --> 01:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
Miner thank you madam chairman uh a
 
01:21:48.750 --> 01:21:48.760 align:start position:0%
question that pops into my mind looking
 
01:21:52.149 --> 01:21:52.159 align:start position:0%
at this map this topography map this
 
01:21:53.790 --> 01:21:53.800 align:start position:0%
just didn't happen all of a sudden I
 
01:21:56.070 --> 01:21:56.080 align:start position:0%
mean this is obviously is a is a
 
01:21:58.070 --> 01:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
creation that's been go that's we got
 
01:21:59.950 --> 01:21:59.960 align:start position:0%
from the ice ages so the question that I
 
01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
have is how do we have landfills in uh
 
01:22:03.950 --> 01:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire anyways to begin with
 
01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:05.560 align:start position:0%
it appears they can't be anywhere how
 
01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:08.480 align:start position:0%
how were they permitted to begin
 
01:22:11.870 --> 01:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
with well um you know certainly the
 
01:22:17.229 --> 01:22:17.239 align:start position:0%
issue is um making coming up with
 
01:22:17.239 --> 01:22:19.430 align:start position:0%
issue is um making coming up with
criteria

01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:22:22.830 --> 01:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
and based on the criteria in this bill
 
01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:25.440 align:start position:0%
this is what the maps look like
 
01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
and so I mean to representative King's
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
Point but may may I cut in but sure but
 
01:22:36.430 --> 01:22:36.440 align:start position:0%
this criteria this topography map like I
 
01:22:39.629 --> 01:22:39.639 align:start position:0%
say has been with us um forever let's
 
01:22:42.110 --> 01:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
say and I don't think the criteria maybe
 
01:22:43.470 --> 01:22:43.480 align:start position:0%
the criteria was different when land
 
01:22:44.910 --> 01:22:44.920 align:start position:0%
Fields were put in I'm not certain of
 
01:22:47.470 --> 01:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah they were absolutely were okay
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah represent Penza and
 
01:22:51.669 --> 01:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
representative sofikitis yeah I just
 
01:22:53.950 --> 01:22:53.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to answer that so as you know
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
just with of course technology and all
 
01:22:58.950 --> 01:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
of that and just um and and just the
 
01:23:02.830 --> 01:23:02.840 align:start position:0%
science has come a long way we know um
 
01:23:05.550 --> 01:23:05.560 align:start position:0%
you know before people were you know
 
01:23:07.790 --> 01:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
digging holes in the ground there's lots
 
01:23:09.669 --> 01:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
of holes that were dug in the ground in
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
Rochester for example before we had a
 
01:23:13.790 --> 01:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
state-of-the-art landfall that was put
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
in and so as you know as we get more
 
01:23:20.110 --> 01:23:20.120 align:start position:0%
information as we have um of course more
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
expertise in this and as we've come
 
01:23:25.790 --> 01:23:25.800 align:start position:0%
forward we realize um you know the the
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
different ways that technology has come
 
01:23:30.669 --> 01:23:30.679 align:start position:0%
forward so I love the analogy of Florida
 
01:23:34.430 --> 01:23:34.440 align:start position:0%
I also um I'm not going to we're
 
01:23:36.590 --> 01:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
definitely not going to weaken this so
 
01:23:39.790 --> 01:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
that um in any way shape or form it
 
01:23:42.790 --> 01:23:42.800 align:start position:0%
impacts um it impacts public health or
 
01:23:45.430 --> 01:23:45.440 align:start position:0%
anything like that so looking at this
 
01:23:48.310 --> 01:23:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know um it just shows you know our
 
01:23:50.830 --> 01:23:50.840 align:start position:0%
our great little State and you know all
 
01:23:53.590 --> 01:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
that all that blue and uh just from that
 
01:23:55.390 --> 01:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
article that just came came out recently
 
01:23:58.350 --> 01:23:58.360 align:start position:0%
in Epsom with um what's going to have to
 
01:24:00.990 --> 01:24:01.000 align:start position:0%
happen with the p in the in the drinking
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
water is just it's crazy so we have to
 
01:24:06.430 --> 01:24:06.440 align:start position:0%
be careful I just I I want this build to
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
be smart um if if we're basically taking
 
01:24:12.590 --> 01:24:12.600 align:start position:0%
care of you know time of travel in one
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
area we don't necessarily need to have
 
01:24:16.910 --> 01:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
something that doesn't make sense with a
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
3,000 foot buffer um it's one or the
 
01:24:21.550 --> 01:24:21.560 align:start position:0%
other they're both would be in a sense
 
01:24:25.229 --> 01:24:25.239 align:start position:0%
somewhat of the same so I just um um I
 
01:24:26.470 --> 01:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
might have been a little aggressive
 
01:24:29.149 --> 01:24:29.159 align:start position:0%
first but in no way am I you know you
 
01:24:30.110 --> 01:24:30.120 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about it
 
01:24:32.350 --> 01:24:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative King I'm I'm not going to
 
01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:35.280 align:start position:0%
back down on it um if it means that we
 
01:24:37.189 --> 01:24:37.199 align:start position:0%
can't you know there might be only one
 
01:24:39.550 --> 01:24:39.560 align:start position:0%
other sighted landfill uh for the next
 
01:24:41.350 --> 01:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
hundred years in New Hampshire well
 
01:24:43.550 --> 01:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's one thing but we also have to
 
01:24:46.310 --> 01:24:46.320 align:start position:0%
start looking at the the the technology
 
01:24:48.470 --> 01:24:48.480 align:start position:0%
that we are not using in New Hampshire
 
01:24:51.669 --> 01:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
at all um it's just from from everything
 
01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
we've we've had a lot of bills that have
 
01:24:56.270 --> 01:24:56.280 align:start position:0%
come through in the last um in the last
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
five six years um those things haven't
 
01:25:00.790 --> 01:25:00.800 align:start position:0%
moved forward uh just with the food
 
01:25:03.229 --> 01:25:03.239 align:start position:0%
waste alone we're just starting that now
 
01:25:05.950 --> 01:25:05.960 align:start position:0%
there's so much composting uh
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
incineration um smart recycling we just
 
01:25:10.830 --> 01:25:10.840 align:start position:0%
there's so much stuff that we could do
 
01:25:13.270 --> 01:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
and I hope that we really move forward
 
01:25:15.709 --> 01:25:15.719 align:start position:0%
um with these Technologies and possibly
 
01:25:18.350 --> 01:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
bringing in an industry that we could to
 
01:25:20.910 --> 01:25:20.920 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to help with that um to
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
take care of our own waste
 
01:25:27.590 --> 01:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
so I agree representative sofikitis the
 
01:25:29.709 --> 01:25:29.719 align:start position:0%
other problem is that our bordering
 
01:25:33.149 --> 01:25:33.159 align:start position:0%
states most specifically at this moment
 
01:25:36.750 --> 01:25:36.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has um put in so many
 
01:25:38.629 --> 01:25:38.639 align:start position:0%
regulations down there that landfills
 
01:25:42.910 --> 01:25:42.920 align:start position:0%
are no longer accepting XY and Z so it's
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
created a business model for companies
 
01:25:50.189 --> 01:25:50.199 align:start position:0%
to pick up that X Y and Z and sell it or
 
01:25:53.510 --> 01:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
whatever they do into New Hampshire so
 
01:25:55.270 --> 01:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
you're no longer allowed to put
 
01:25:57.910 --> 01:25:57.920 align:start position:0%
mattresses in Massachusetts into the
 
01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:01.360 align:start position:0%
landfills and I I'm remiss at the moment
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
to say what else but we now they want us
 
01:26:08.310 --> 01:26:08.320 align:start position:0%
our small towns to accept trash from out
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
of the state and I have a huge problem
 
01:26:13.550 --> 01:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
with that
 
01:26:17.550 --> 01:26:17.560 align:start position:0%
because I worked in Massachusetts for 35
 
01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:21.199 align:start position:0%
years but commuted from here and I've
 
01:26:23.390 --> 01:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
seen all the medical waste come up in
 
01:26:27.590 --> 01:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
trucks and um it just bothers me that it
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
becomes a a a a business problem and um
 
01:26:35.629 --> 01:26:35.639 align:start position:0%
they have
 
01:26:39.070 --> 01:26:39.080 align:start position:0%
unscrupulous business practices to offer
 
01:26:42.990 --> 01:26:43.000 align:start position:0%
small towns free garbage
 
01:26:48.709 --> 01:26:48.719 align:start position:0%
um um removal and towns with no zoning
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
across the Great North from Vermont
 
01:26:54.669 --> 01:26:54.679 align:start position:0%
across uh New Hampshire and into to main
 
01:26:57.070 --> 01:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
there's a a lot of small towns that
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't have zoning and they go in there
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
and they divide the
 
01:27:03.870 --> 01:27:03.880 align:start position:0%
population and
 
01:27:06.910 --> 01:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
um I think it's really rough to tell a
 
01:27:09.790 --> 01:27:09.800 align:start position:0%
town that can manage their own
 
01:27:13.470 --> 01:27:13.480 align:start position:0%
garbage suddenly that they need to
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
accept garbage from out of state into
 
01:27:21.430 --> 01:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
these small towns and um we got to stop
 
01:27:25.669 --> 01:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
that companies I believe do not have the
 
01:27:30.189 --> 01:27:30.199 align:start position:0%
right to get rich on our on our on the
 
01:27:33.109 --> 01:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
backs of our small towns representa
 
01:27:35.149 --> 01:27:35.159 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair I just
 
01:27:37.070 --> 01:27:37.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to share a little anecdote I was
 
01:27:38.990 --> 01:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
um up in the Upper Valley yesterday and
 
01:27:42.149 --> 01:27:42.159 align:start position:0%
listening to uh Vermont public radio and
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
they are doing a special on landfills
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
they have one one landfill in Vermont
 
01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:49.600 align:start position:0%
and um the they when they talked about R
 
01:27:52.510 --> 01:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
six they sounded envious so I just
 
01:27:55.070 --> 01:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh to let you know that uh
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
there are different perspectives I guess
 
01:27:59.229 --> 01:27:59.239 align:start position:0%
the distance you have from the the
 
01:28:02.910 --> 01:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
landfill makes you feel more fond of it
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
so I just want to add to our
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
conversation to say that you know the
 
01:28:09.430 --> 01:28:09.440 align:start position:0%
solid waste management plan for the
 
01:28:13.149 --> 01:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
state is that um the very last resort is
 
01:28:16.510 --> 01:28:16.520 align:start position:0%
to landfill something to that end I know
 
01:28:19.310 --> 01:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group is working
 
01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:20.669 align:start position:0%
the solid waste working group is working
towards

01:28:20.669 --> 01:28:20.679 align:start position:0%
towards
 
01:28:25.350 --> 01:28:25.360 align:start position:0%
different um points or different uh
 
01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:27.189 align:start position:0%
different um points or different uh
goals

01:28:27.189 --> 01:28:27.199 align:start position:0%
goals
 
01:28:30.229 --> 01:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
regarding taking things out or or you
 
01:28:32.070 --> 01:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
know making sure certain things don't
 
01:28:34.350 --> 01:28:34.360 align:start position:0%
get in our landfills um we've already
 
01:28:36.990 --> 01:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
done the the the uh you know food food
 
01:28:39.790 --> 01:28:39.800 align:start position:0%
waste to be composted and so forth they
 
01:28:43.510 --> 01:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
are actively looking at um not being
 
01:28:46.470 --> 01:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
putting paint there um we have a bill
 
01:28:48.790 --> 01:28:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's before the house right now that
 
01:28:50.950 --> 01:28:50.960 align:start position:0%
that um Commerce is considering
 
01:28:53.189 --> 01:28:53.199 align:start position:0%
regarding paint recycling which I think
 
01:28:55.910 --> 01:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
is a is a great move forward we're I
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
think next going to be tackling um
 
01:29:01.430 --> 01:29:01.440 align:start position:0%
keeping mattresses out of our out of our
 
01:29:03.550 --> 01:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
landfills and doing some recycling
 
01:29:05.750 --> 01:29:05.760 align:start position:0%
programs with that so there's a number
 
01:29:07.430 --> 01:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
of things that we're doing and we're
 
01:29:10.629 --> 01:29:10.639 align:start position:0%
moving forward to reduce the amount of
 
01:29:12.550 --> 01:29:12.560 align:start position:0%
stuff that we're putting in landfills to
 
01:29:14.709 --> 01:29:14.719 align:start position:0%
begin with and I also think that you
 
01:29:17.390 --> 01:29:17.400 align:start position:0%
know if we move if we try and make some
 
01:29:19.990 --> 01:29:20.000 align:start position:0%
movement to you know keeping as much
 
01:29:22.629 --> 01:29:22.639 align:start position:0%
plastic out of our landfills I mean
 
01:29:26.830 --> 01:29:26.840 align:start position:0%
that's going to go a long way too so I
 
01:29:30.870 --> 01:29:30.880 align:start position:0%
think my thought my thought is that um
 
01:29:34.629 --> 01:29:34.639 align:start position:0%
you know seeing that we we're trying to
 
01:29:37.229 --> 01:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
reduce what we're putting in landfills
 
01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:40.119 align:start position:0%
yes the demand for landfills is going to
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:47.070 --> 01:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
um that being said you know we don't I
 
01:29:49.070 --> 01:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
think don't want to be so restrictive
 
01:29:51.870 --> 01:29:51.880 align:start position:0%
that you can't have a landfill anywhere
 
01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:54.639 align:start position:0%
I agree with representative King
 
01:29:56.790 --> 01:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
about using some newer Technologies
 
01:29:59.510 --> 01:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
where we can do things like incineration
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
and also smart recycling centers and
 
01:30:04.350 --> 01:30:04.360 align:start position:0%
there's a host of other things that can
 
01:30:07.070 --> 01:30:07.080 align:start position:0%
help us get to that place where we don't
 
01:30:11.030 --> 01:30:11.040 align:start position:0%
need to put landfills anywhere but for
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
now you know this is this is a reality
 
01:30:15.870 --> 01:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
and unless we want to truck everything
 
01:30:18.550 --> 01:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
that we have out of New Hampshire at the
 
01:30:21.109 --> 01:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
cost of our taxpayers and our
 
01:30:23.109 --> 01:30:23.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities um that could be pretty
 
01:30:25.510 --> 01:30:25.520 align:start position:0%
expensive too and while I understand
 
01:30:26.990 --> 01:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
that you know we don't want to pollute
 
01:30:28.950 --> 01:30:28.960 align:start position:0%
en the environment that's a forever
 
01:30:32.870 --> 01:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
thing that can be just as more even more
 
01:30:35.990 --> 01:30:36.000 align:start position:0%
expensive to our taxpayers um the
 
01:30:38.830 --> 01:30:38.840 align:start position:0%
reality is you know there's there's got
 
01:30:41.070 --> 01:30:41.080 align:start position:0%
to be some places that makes
 
01:30:44.070 --> 01:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
sense if we need a landfill for the next
 
01:30:47.070 --> 01:30:47.080 align:start position:0%
100 years we'll only need probably just
 
01:30:50.310 --> 01:30:50.320 align:start position:0%
one so anyway representative Bixby yeah
 
01:30:52.790 --> 01:30:52.800 align:start position:0%
i' I'd just like to get um briefly back
 
01:30:54.910 --> 01:30:54.920 align:start position:0%
to representative Miner's point about or
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
question about um how did how did we
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
site landfills in the past so
 
01:31:02.590 --> 01:31:02.600 align:start position:0%
historically the way you site a landfill
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
is you take it out in the woods and you
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
dump it yeah and and at some point um
 
01:31:14.310 --> 01:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
that uh when uh that came to shifted to
 
01:31:17.390 --> 01:31:17.400 align:start position:0%
well you have a company and you don't
 
01:31:20.310 --> 01:31:20.320 align:start position:0%
know or you don't want to use the proper
 
01:31:22.310 --> 01:31:22.320 align:start position:0%
cost of disposal you know the way it
 
01:31:24.870 --> 01:31:24.880 align:start position:0%
should be disposed of so so you send it
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire and you dump it so that
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
way we get the koki landfill in uh um
 
01:31:35.350 --> 01:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
just outside in Portsmouth uh which is a
 
01:31:39.910 --> 01:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
um a major toxic waste site and uh there
 
01:31:41.910 --> 01:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
is still wrangling about how to deal
 
01:31:44.189 --> 01:31:44.199 align:start position:0%
with the stuff that's seeping out of
 
01:31:47.870 --> 01:31:47.880 align:start position:0%
that uh it was an unlined landfill uh so
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
at some point there was a recognition
 
01:31:51.990 --> 01:31:52.000 align:start position:0%
that you needed to put a liner under a
 
01:31:54.950 --> 01:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
landfill now it's up to it really makes
 
01:31:57.310 --> 01:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
sense to have two liners under landfill
 
01:31:59.270 --> 01:31:59.280 align:start position:0%
so the there's been a progression in
 
01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:02.840 align:start position:0%
terms of uh what it makes you know how
 
01:32:05.590 --> 01:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
you need the precautions that you need
 
01:32:09.149 --> 01:32:09.159 align:start position:0%
to take in order to uh put a landfill in
 
01:32:12.669 --> 01:32:12.679 align:start position:0%
place and one of the what we're working
 
01:32:15.109 --> 01:32:15.119 align:start position:0%
on right now is that it's not just how
 
01:32:16.629 --> 01:32:16.639 align:start position:0%
you build the landfill but it's where
 
01:32:18.350 --> 01:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
you build the landfill and there are
 
01:32:19.830 --> 01:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
some places that it just doesn't make
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
sense to to BU build a landfill I we we
 
01:32:25.390 --> 01:32:25.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to go back to the days where
 
01:32:27.229 --> 01:32:27.239 align:start position:0%
you just take whatever you have out in
 
01:32:28.669 --> 01:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
the woods and dump it because that's
 
01:32:32.149 --> 01:32:32.159 align:start position:0%
clearly bad for everybody but um so I
 
01:32:34.870 --> 01:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
think that um when you say there are
 
01:32:36.350 --> 01:32:36.360 align:start position:0%
restrictions on where it makes sense to
 
01:32:38.189 --> 01:32:38.199 align:start position:0%
site it it doesn't mean you can't site
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
it anywhere it's so for instance M Mount
 
01:32:45.149 --> 01:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
carbury is on uh solid bedrock and Clay
 
01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
uh it's uh the uh there the the time of
 
01:32:53.830 --> 01:32:53.840 align:start position:0%
travel at Mount carbury from that land
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
fill to um the nearest water body is you
 
01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:00.400 align:start position:0%
know Way Beyond what we would require in
 
01:33:03.310 --> 01:33:03.320 align:start position:0%
this bill uh so there are sites that
 
01:33:05.790 --> 01:33:05.800 align:start position:0%
would there are there there physically
 
01:33:08.189 --> 01:33:08.199 align:start position:0%
exist sites that would fit the
 
01:33:10.629 --> 01:33:10.639 align:start position:0%
requirements that we are uh considering
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
here uh it's it's just a matter of we
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that when if there is
 
01:33:18.910 --> 01:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
a landfill cited then it gets cited
 
01:33:23.510 --> 01:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
correctly and um and and then to uh the
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
point point of diversion makes more
 
01:33:28.830 --> 01:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
sense yes I think that uh when we talk
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
about you
 
01:33:33.189 --> 01:33:33.199 align:start position:0%
know uh moving ahead with the composting
 
01:33:35.830 --> 01:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
program uh what we really need right now
 
01:33:38.790 --> 01:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
is some entrepreneurs who want to set up
 
01:33:41.550 --> 01:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
large composting operations in the State
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
uh and because there is going to there
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
is a the demand for that is now there by
 
01:33:52.510 --> 01:33:52.520 align:start position:0%
law so we need to we need people who are
 
01:33:55.310 --> 01:33:55.320 align:start position:0%
uh willing to uh get into that business
 
01:33:57.189 --> 01:33:57.199 align:start position:0%
and I think that they would do well to
 
01:34:02.430 --> 01:34:02.440 align:start position:0%
do so um and uh and as we progress with
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
other things other methods of diversion
 
01:34:10.350 --> 01:34:10.360 align:start position:0%
uh increasing recycling rates uh and uh
 
01:34:14.430 --> 01:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
and uh reducing the use of some things
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh and establishing uh epr programs that
 
01:34:23.270 --> 01:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
uh where uh the manufacturer will take
 
01:34:25.109 --> 01:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
those things back at their at the end of
 
01:34:26.790 --> 01:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
the life particularly things you know
 
01:34:28.350 --> 01:34:28.360 align:start position:0%
like Electronics have valuable
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
ingredients in them and uh it it really
 
01:34:34.350 --> 01:34:34.360 align:start position:0%
makes sense for the manufacturers to
 
01:34:37.750 --> 01:34:37.760 align:start position:0%
figure out a way to uh reuse those
 
01:34:39.270 --> 01:34:39.280 align:start position:0%
ingredients rather than dump them in the
 
01:34:44.430 --> 01:34:44.440 align:start position:0%
ground y so so I think that um we
 
01:34:46.149 --> 01:34:46.159 align:start position:0%
certainly don't want to go back to The
 
01:34:49.310 --> 01:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
unregulated Dumping of things right but
 
01:34:52.550 --> 01:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
um and I I think that uh the points that
 
01:34:54.430 --> 01:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
uh representative tenza and
 
01:34:57.629 --> 01:34:57.639 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron made about ways of
 
01:35:00.109 --> 01:35:00.119 align:start position:0%
um reducing Demand on landfills are also
 
01:35:03.070 --> 01:35:03.080 align:start position:0%
you entirely to the point Thank you and
 
01:35:06.870 --> 01:35:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
that this is not a standalone
 
01:35:12.390 --> 01:35:12.400 align:start position:0%
legislation the fact that we're working
 
01:35:14.790 --> 01:35:14.800 align:start position:0%
on other things like leech eight
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
management and um you know other other
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation I know that there
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
are some things that are maybe coming
 
01:35:25.510 --> 01:35:25.520 align:start position:0%
from the other side of the wall too um
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
those things all together I think make a
 
01:35:30.960 --> 01:35:32.750 align:start position:0%
those things all together I think make a
good

01:35:32.750 --> 01:35:32.760 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:35:35.990 --> 01:35:36.000 align:start position:0%
framework um for for landfill sighting
 
01:35:39.390 --> 01:35:39.400 align:start position:0%
in general and um and I'm happy that you
 
01:35:41.189 --> 01:35:41.199 align:start position:0%
know there we're we're addressing these
 
01:35:43.149 --> 01:35:43.159 align:start position:0%
things and we're working on them and
 
01:35:45.790 --> 01:35:45.800 align:start position:0%
trying to come up with something
 
01:35:49.750 --> 01:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
that will make sense and um so I I
 
01:35:51.350 --> 01:35:51.360 align:start position:0%
appreciate everybody's comments
 
01:35:53.870 --> 01:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you madam sure
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
I just say very quickly with respect to
 
01:35:58.870 --> 01:35:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative King's comments before I
 
01:36:02.350 --> 01:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
also agree you know the point isn't to
 
01:36:04.510 --> 01:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh you know find the map that's going to
 
01:36:07.990 --> 01:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
allow us to site a landfill but on quite
 
01:36:09.430 --> 01:36:09.440 align:start position:0%
the reverse to find the map that allows
 
01:36:11.550 --> 01:36:11.560 align:start position:0%
us to site a landfill if it's
 
01:36:13.189 --> 01:36:13.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do so to find the right
 
01:36:16.390 --> 01:36:16.400 align:start position:0%
place um I I will say however it it's
 
01:36:18.189 --> 01:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
important for us to keep in mind that
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
statute requires that Dees kind of make
 
01:36:24.030 --> 01:36:24.040 align:start position:0%
sure that we do have capacity to deal
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
with our own trash right so we are going
 
01:36:30.669 --> 01:36:30.679 align:start position:0%
to continue to to uh produce solid waste
 
01:36:32.430 --> 01:36:32.440 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't think we should become a
 
01:36:34.149 --> 01:36:34.159 align:start position:0%
state like a lot of other states that
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
try to push as much of that onto other
 
01:36:38.350 --> 01:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
people so whatever we come up with we
 
01:36:41.189 --> 01:36:41.199 align:start position:0%
are going to need ways to deal with new
 
01:36:43.109 --> 01:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
pardon me New Hampshire produce solid
 
01:36:46.270 --> 01:36:46.280 align:start position:0%
waste and hopefully we can use the best
 
01:36:48.390 --> 01:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
technology available to minimize the
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
amount of that uh but uh I will only
 
01:36:53.709 --> 01:36:53.719 align:start position:0%
throw in my my pitch from last year to
 
01:36:55.189 --> 01:36:55.199 align:start position:0%
that this is one of the reasons why I
 
01:36:57.390 --> 01:36:57.400 align:start position:0%
think having a publicly owned
 
01:36:59.669 --> 01:36:59.679 align:start position:0%
state-owned landfill is the way to go
 
01:37:02.310 --> 01:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
because the profit motive is not what's
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
driving the process it allows you to put
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
a significant number of restrictions on
 
01:37:10.470 --> 01:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
what you do with the waste and what is
 
01:37:12.430 --> 01:37:12.440 align:start position:0%
what is brought in there and it allows
 
01:37:15.229 --> 01:37:15.239 align:start position:0%
you to go looking for the most
 
01:37:17.550 --> 01:37:17.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate site as the primary
 
01:37:19.950 --> 01:37:19.960 align:start position:0%
Criterion that you use to decide where
 
01:37:22.109 --> 01:37:22.119 align:start position:0%
it's going to go as opposed to the
 
01:37:24.430 --> 01:37:24.440 align:start position:0%
primary motivation for a for for-profit
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
Corporation is of course to be for
 
01:37:28.750 --> 01:37:28.760 align:start position:0%
profit so uh I just wanted to throw in
 
01:37:32.590 --> 01:37:32.600 align:start position:0%
those comments any other questions or
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
comments so oh representative H Haskins
 
01:37:37.550 --> 01:37:37.560 align:start position:0%
thank you and good morning good morning
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to reiterate
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
what we heard in testimony we don't
 
01:37:44.830 --> 01:37:44.840 align:start position:0%
really have a capacity problem we
 
01:37:47.310 --> 01:37:47.320 align:start position:0%
needn't worry that there's no place to
 
01:37:50.270 --> 01:37:50.280 align:start position:0%
site a landfill what we're doing in this
 
01:37:53.990 --> 01:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
bill is making sure that site specific
 
01:37:57.310 --> 01:37:57.320 align:start position:0%
means that there are sand and gravel
 
01:37:59.790 --> 01:37:59.800 align:start position:0%
pits that are not appropriate for a
 
01:38:02.189 --> 01:38:02.199 align:start position:0%
landfill but we have carbery we have
 
01:38:05.109 --> 01:38:05.119 align:start position:0%
TurnKey we have uh landfills that have
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
been properly cited and as our capacity
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
is um as our need is limited going
 
01:38:17.229 --> 01:38:17.239 align:start position:0%
forward we certainly don't have to worry
 
01:38:19.629 --> 01:38:19.639 align:start position:0%
that there's no place to put a landfill
 
01:38:21.910 --> 01:38:21.920 align:start position:0%
I think we're making good progress I
 
01:38:23.910 --> 01:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
Echo all the good comments that have
 
01:38:26.390 --> 01:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
been made and I look forward to what
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
this bill gives us thank you anybody
 
01:38:32.390 --> 01:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
else represent Penza yeah I just I do
 
01:38:35.390 --> 01:38:35.400 align:start position:0%
want to um just because it's TurnKey is
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
course in Rochester that TurnKey has um
 
01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:42.760 align:start position:0%
enough capacity to have taken all of New
 
01:38:45.870 --> 01:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's trash and more um so I just
 
01:38:47.589 --> 01:38:47.599 align:start position:0%
you know if it's if we're just talking
 
01:38:50.709 --> 01:38:50.719 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire um that has ever
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
generated that New Hampshire has ever
 
01:38:55.270 --> 01:38:55.280 align:start position:0%
generated so um we have to be looking at
 
01:38:57.070 --> 01:38:57.080 align:start position:0%
that and the most important thing on
 
01:38:59.669 --> 01:38:59.679 align:start position:0%
every single permit is New Hampshire
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
trash comes first and that's where the
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
push back has to start happening we we
 
01:39:07.709 --> 01:39:07.719 align:start position:0%
don't I don't want to talk about you
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
know the um the Clauses and the FED all
 
01:39:12.350 --> 01:39:12.360 align:start position:0%
of that kind of stuff because when it
 
01:39:13.950 --> 01:39:13.960 align:start position:0%
comes right down to it when we are
 
01:39:16.390 --> 01:39:16.400 align:start position:0%
giving when we're permitting a landfill
 
01:39:18.510 --> 01:39:18.520 align:start position:0%
we are saying that you have to the New
 
01:39:20.709 --> 01:39:20.719 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's the priority and we have to
 
01:39:22.709 --> 01:39:22.719 align:start position:0%
start making New Hampshire the priority
 
01:39:25.589 --> 01:39:25.599 align:start position:0%
because right now Massachusetts has
 
01:39:27.870 --> 01:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
basically got a ban on landfills and if
 
01:39:29.070 --> 01:39:29.080 align:start position:0%
you look at
 
01:39:32.990 --> 01:39:33.000 align:start position:0%
their Geographics I've talked to um a
 
01:39:34.589 --> 01:39:34.599 align:start position:0%
very very Spar scientist in
 
01:39:38.870 --> 01:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts recently and they have
 
01:39:41.709 --> 01:39:41.719 align:start position:0%
they have massive amounts of of land
 
01:39:44.310 --> 01:39:44.320 align:start position:0%
where they could have a landfill that's
 
01:39:46.629 --> 01:39:46.639 align:start position:0%
out into the birk Shear area and all of
 
01:39:48.070 --> 01:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
that they don't want that they don't
 
01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.239 align:start position:0%
want to touch any of that beautiful uh a
 
01:39:52.629 --> 01:39:52.639 align:start position:0%
property that they have but they don't
 
01:39:54.030 --> 01:39:54.040 align:start position:0%
have any problem
 
01:39:55.950 --> 01:39:55.960 align:start position:0%
in in having that in New Hampshire and
 
01:39:58.510 --> 01:39:58.520 align:start position:0%
we are so much smaller so these are the
 
01:40:01.189 --> 01:40:01.199 align:start position:0%
things to think about um in that first
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
map there is a lot of white on this
 
01:40:05.790 --> 01:40:05.800 align:start position:0%
first map if we just looked at the 3,000
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
foot buffer and um in
 
01:40:12.030 --> 01:40:12.040 align:start position:0%
86% of the state right now has clay so I
 
01:40:14.070 --> 01:40:14.080 align:start position:0%
just wanted to talk about a couple of
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
those things um you know sorry if I got
 
01:40:18.910 --> 01:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
a little aggressive in the bill I think
 
01:40:22.790 --> 01:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
that we'll get to where um um Dees as
 
01:40:25.709 --> 01:40:25.719 align:start position:0%
well as the committee um can settle on
 
01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
it but um I'm I'm glad that we're it
 
01:40:30.550 --> 01:40:30.560 align:start position:0%
seems as if everybody's kind of moving
 
01:40:32.310 --> 01:40:32.320 align:start position:0%
in the right direction on where we're
 
01:40:34.870 --> 01:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
headed so appreciate that yep thank you
 
01:40:36.229 --> 01:40:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative Howard thank you madam
 
01:40:40.149 --> 01:40:40.159 align:start position:0%
chair um I think that uh there um if
 
01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:42.159 align:start position:0%
there is any sense of urgency around
 
01:40:44.669 --> 01:40:44.679 align:start position:0%
this bill it um it h it doesn't have to
 
01:40:46.790 --> 01:40:46.800 align:start position:0%
do necessarily with the capacity it has
 
01:40:49.950 --> 01:40:49.960 align:start position:0%
to do with um the getting these things
 
01:40:51.589 --> 01:40:51.599 align:start position:0%
in place before the
 
01:40:55.229 --> 01:40:55.239 align:start position:0%
permitting happens right right so
 
01:40:57.830 --> 01:40:57.840 align:start position:0%
um so I just I just wanted to add that
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
because I think that I think that we
 
01:41:03.790 --> 01:41:03.800 align:start position:0%
um I think we need to have a realistic
 
01:41:07.070 --> 01:41:07.080 align:start position:0%
sense of of urgency and and the and
 
01:41:09.629 --> 01:41:09.639 align:start position:0%
capacity I don't think is it right now
 
01:41:13.189 --> 01:41:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions comments
 
01:41:17.709 --> 01:41:17.719 align:start position:0%
okay so the bill needs some work we have
 
01:41:19.470 --> 01:41:19.480 align:start position:0%
representative Penza working on some
 
01:41:23.350 --> 01:41:23.360 align:start position:0%
changes and I guess we'll do that in um
 
01:41:27.030 --> 01:41:27.040 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the solid waste uh
 
01:41:30.629 --> 01:41:30.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can do that yep okay so you
 
01:41:33.070 --> 01:41:33.080 align:start position:0%
guys can possibly get together at some
 
01:41:36.270 --> 01:41:36.280 align:start position:0%
point and discuss that and see where you
 
01:41:38.950 --> 01:41:38.960 align:start position:0%
can uh maybe come up with a with an
 
01:41:41.430 --> 01:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh
 
01:41:44.189 --> 01:41:44.199 align:start position:0%
would be more of what we were discussing
 
01:41:46.470 --> 01:41:46.480 align:start position:0%
this morning and that and incorporate a
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
lot of the points that were
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
discussed yep if I may one more comment
 
01:41:54.070 --> 01:41:54.080 align:start position:0%
you may one more comment comment thank
 
01:41:58.109 --> 01:41:58.119 align:start position:0%
you the um experience that a couple of
 
01:42:01.550 --> 01:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
us had um when the rules were being
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
adopted and jel car didn't allow Our
 
01:42:08.070 --> 01:42:08.080 align:start position:0%
Testimony reminds me that the rules that
 
01:42:10.189 --> 01:42:10.199 align:start position:0%
are currently in
 
01:42:10.199 --> 01:42:12.430 align:start position:0%
are currently in
place

01:42:12.430 --> 01:42:12.440 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:42:16.350 --> 01:42:16.360 align:start position:0%
um I think are terribly weak and really
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's where the urgency comes from
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%
current rules do not give us the kind of
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
things we're talking about today
 
01:42:25.430 --> 01:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
so I would like
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
to just Echo the fact that um time is
 
01:42:31.750 --> 01:42:31.760 align:start position:0%
important for this reason well I liked
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
the um testimony that the attorney from
 
01:42:38.430 --> 01:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
North Country ABC brought that showed
 
01:42:41.310 --> 01:42:41.320 align:start position:0%
the chart where she thought um there
 
01:42:44.270 --> 01:42:44.280 align:start position:0%
were places she compared the old rules
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
to the new rules and showing in places
 
01:42:49.589 --> 01:42:49.599 align:start position:0%
where they were stronger and places
 
01:42:51.790 --> 01:42:51.800 align:start position:0%
where they were the same somewhat and
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
places where they were weaker
 
01:42:56.870 --> 01:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm hoping that uh some of the
 
01:42:59.589 --> 01:42:59.599 align:start position:0%
changes that we are looking at with this
 
01:43:02.750 --> 01:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
bill will in fact make those places that
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
were weaker A Little Bit Stronger so
 
01:43:08.589 --> 01:43:08.599 align:start position:0%
that's that's my uh anticipation
 
01:43:11.310 --> 01:43:11.320 align:start position:0%
representative bxby yes also to the to
 
01:43:14.229 --> 01:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
the um aspect of rules uh one of the
 
01:43:16.790 --> 01:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
points that Jael car made when they
 
01:43:20.790 --> 01:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
approved the rules in December was that
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh the the points that were were of
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
issue were policy uh policy issues that
 
01:43:30.629 --> 01:43:30.639 align:start position:0%
the that Jael card didn't have the
 
01:43:33.470 --> 01:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
capacity to rule on that really needed
 
01:43:36.750 --> 01:43:36.760 align:start position:0%
to be clarified in statute and that's
 
01:43:40.510 --> 01:43:40.520 align:start position:0%
what this bill is doing yep yep
 
01:43:43.830 --> 01:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
agree okay any other discussion on
 
01:43:47.550 --> 01:43:47.560 align:start position:0%
hb77 so what we're looking at is um a
 
01:43:50.109 --> 01:43:50.119 align:start position:0%
forthcoming amendments for that bill and
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
work in the uh solid waste subcommittee
 
01:43:54.669 --> 01:43:54.679 align:start position:0%
uh to that
 
01:43:59.350 --> 01:43:59.360 align:start position:0%
end um moving along to
 
01:44:01.910 --> 01:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
hr10 so this is recognizing the
 
01:44:03.790 --> 01:44:03.800 align:start position:0%
fundamental right to have clean air
 
01:44:06.709 --> 01:44:06.719 align:start position:0%
clean water and a healthy environment I
 
01:44:10.390 --> 01:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
have worked up an amendment to that um
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
house resolution I'm passing it around
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
now I did send an email to everybody
 
01:44:17.510 --> 01:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
with it
 
01:44:21.709 --> 01:44:21.719 align:start position:0%
electronically and um my thoughts um as
 
01:44:23.910 --> 01:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
I expressed
 
01:44:25.790 --> 01:44:25.800 align:start position:0%
uh with some of the questions I had at
 
01:44:29.790 --> 01:44:29.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing was that
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that you know to to say that
 
01:44:38.750 --> 01:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
well there there was a sort of
 
01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.350 align:start position:0%
well there there was a sort of
a

01:44:40.350 --> 01:44:40.360 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:44:43.270 --> 01:44:43.280 align:start position:0%
disagreement on uh what is considered a
 
01:44:46.390 --> 01:44:46.400 align:start position:0%
right and what is not considered a right
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
and I um I don't know I felt very
 
01:44:53.950 --> 01:44:53.960 align:start position:0%
strongly that you know I believe that
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
clean and healthy environment is
 
01:44:58.950 --> 01:44:58.960 align:start position:0%
important it impacts human health um I
 
01:45:00.830 --> 01:45:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe without good health our ability
 
01:45:03.030 --> 01:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
to enjoy our fundamental rights to life
 
01:45:06.030 --> 01:45:06.040 align:start position:0%
liberty and the pursuit of happiness is
 
01:45:09.109 --> 01:45:09.119 align:start position:0%
diminished and I think that we as a
 
01:45:10.830 --> 01:45:10.840 align:start position:0%
house should make the statement that we
 
01:45:13.669 --> 01:45:13.679 align:start position:0%
recognize and highly value clean air
 
01:45:16.270 --> 01:45:16.280 align:start position:0%
clean water and a healthy environment
 
01:45:18.189 --> 01:45:18.199 align:start position:0%
and we support goals and policies that
 
01:45:22.390 --> 01:45:22.400 align:start position:0%
will promote those values so that's my
 
01:45:24.550 --> 01:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment to this uh
 
01:45:27.229 --> 01:45:27.239 align:start position:0%
hr10 I hope that that would be uh
 
01:45:30.750 --> 01:45:30.760 align:start position:0%
considered for our exec session um I'd
 
01:45:32.990 --> 01:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
like to open it up for some discussion
 
01:45:35.430 --> 01:45:35.440 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
01:45:37.430 --> 01:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
chair I really like the change I like
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
the amendment um it it's
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
non-controversial I believe I think
 
01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:43.480 align:start position:0%
everybody could agree with that the
 
01:45:46.310 --> 01:45:46.320 align:start position:0%
original language um when you're dealing
 
01:45:47.910 --> 01:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
with rights different people have
 
01:45:50.109 --> 01:45:50.119 align:start position:0%
different ideas of what a right is um
 
01:45:51.350 --> 01:45:51.360 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't to been able to support
 
01:45:53.669 --> 01:45:53.679 align:start position:0%
that language even though I empathize
 
01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
with the the
 
01:45:58.709 --> 01:45:58.719 align:start position:0%
sponsors um my only concern is that you
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
know by by changing the amendment to
 
01:46:02.589 --> 01:46:02.599 align:start position:0%
what it is even though I agree with it
 
01:46:06.189 --> 01:46:06.199 align:start position:0%
and and will vote for it um it's not
 
01:46:06.199 --> 01:46:07.830 align:start position:0%
and and will vote for it um it's not
terribly

01:46:07.830 --> 01:46:07.840 align:start position:0%
terribly
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what's the word I'm
 
01:46:10.870 --> 01:46:10.880 align:start position:0%
looking for it's definitely not
 
01:46:13.510 --> 01:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
controversial but it's sort of like are
 
01:46:15.550 --> 01:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
we really stay are we really stating
 
01:46:17.709 --> 01:46:17.719 align:start position:0%
anything to the World by saying this
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
because I'm not sure anybody would
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
disagree with it um and I just remember
 
01:46:26.430 --> 01:46:26.440 align:start position:0%
um being on the house floor last term
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
and sometimes bills similar to this hr's
 
01:46:32.830 --> 01:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
Sim similar to this it's like okay
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
thanks you know because you know we're
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
just like I believe in life okay
 
01:46:39.270 --> 01:46:39.280 align:start position:0%
everybody believes in life you know I
 
01:46:41.709 --> 01:46:41.719 align:start position:0%
don't know I just I just feel like it's
 
01:46:43.950 --> 01:46:43.960 align:start position:0%
it's not really uh stating anything
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
profound even though I agree with it
 
01:46:49.430 --> 01:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
completely well I think it just it does
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
in a sense that we are as a house say
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
saying that
 
01:46:59.350 --> 01:46:59.360 align:start position:0%
we value things like clean air clean
 
01:47:00.910 --> 01:47:00.920 align:start position:0%
water and a healthy environment we
 
01:47:03.390 --> 01:47:03.400 align:start position:0%
highly value those things as a house
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
that we will um support goals and
 
01:47:10.589 --> 01:47:10.599 align:start position:0%
policies that will bring those things to
 
01:47:13.390 --> 01:47:13.400 align:start position:0%
fruition and um I think that's a pretty
 
01:47:15.030 --> 01:47:15.040 align:start position:0%
strong statement I
 
01:47:17.510 --> 01:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
mean the fact that we are working on
 
01:47:21.149 --> 01:47:21.159 align:start position:0%
language um regarding landfill sighting
 
01:47:23.430 --> 01:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
regarding uh you know
 
01:47:24.669 --> 01:47:24.679 align:start position:0%
all of the
 
01:47:28.350 --> 01:47:28.360 align:start position:0%
different aspects of how we handle solid
 
01:47:33.550 --> 01:47:33.560 align:start position:0%
waste and other waste um is that's
 
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
something that's a goal for for our
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
house to strive for our legislature it's
 
01:47:41.910 --> 01:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
important to us to have those things
 
01:47:43.629 --> 01:47:43.639 align:start position:0%
whether we believe those are rights or
 
01:47:46.390 --> 01:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
not rights it's important for us as a
 
01:47:49.430 --> 01:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
legislature to pursue um and have the
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
take the
 
01:47:53.470 --> 01:47:53.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility uh as a as a
 
01:47:57.229 --> 01:47:57.239 align:start position:0%
a governing body to work to make sure
 
01:47:59.669 --> 01:47:59.679 align:start position:0%
that these things uh for clean air clean
 
01:48:02.470 --> 01:48:02.480 align:start position:0%
water a healthy environment and so forth
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
that we we promote policies that that
 
01:48:08.510 --> 01:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
achieve those ends and that's why I I
 
01:48:11.189 --> 01:48:11.199 align:start position:0%
think that this is uh a statement that's
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
important for our house to
 
01:48:16.790 --> 01:48:16.800 align:start position:0%
make representative Howard and then ger
 
01:48:20.669 --> 01:48:20.679 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I I I I like
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
the way that this re uh refers
 
01:48:25.589 --> 01:48:25.599 align:start position:0%
to already established rights that that
 
01:48:27.990 --> 01:48:28.000 align:start position:0%
are you know and so so I think that you
 
01:48:31.030 --> 01:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
sort of cover that there um and I know
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
we don't word Smith in committee but um
 
01:48:36.189 --> 01:48:36.199 align:start position:0%
as a House of Representatives that that
 
01:48:39.030 --> 01:48:39.040 align:start position:0%
produces legislation could we say we
 
01:48:41.030 --> 01:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
support legislation policies and
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
legislation that will promote these
 
01:48:45.910 --> 01:48:45.920 align:start position:0%
values um instead of goals because I
 
01:48:48.910 --> 01:48:48.920 align:start position:0%
think um like like uh representative
 
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
King I think it would tighten you know
 
01:48:53.430 --> 01:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's not quite as Loose as
 
01:48:55.229 --> 01:48:55.239 align:start position:0%
would tighten it up a little bit about
 
01:48:57.589 --> 01:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
what what we do as a
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
legislature okay well we'll think about
 
01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:04.840 align:start position:0%
it I mean we're we're looking to exec
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
this you know in uh about a half hour or
 
01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
so and so we don't really have much time
 
01:49:13.750 --> 01:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
to change that language
 
01:49:20.030 --> 01:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
but hr3 not HR oh okay sorry my my uh my
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
mistake sorry yep oh well we may have
 
01:49:26.109 --> 01:49:26.119 align:start position:0%
some time to change make a change
 
01:49:28.189 --> 01:49:28.199 align:start position:0%
representative ger uh thank you madam
 
01:49:29.790 --> 01:49:29.800 align:start position:0%
chair and I want to say that you know I
 
01:49:32.189 --> 01:49:32.199 align:start position:0%
very much respect and appreciate my
 
01:49:34.910 --> 01:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
friend the chair and uh we disagree in
 
01:49:36.870 --> 01:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
this case on what constitutes a right
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
but I do really appreciate even though I
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
won't vote for uh the amendment uh
 
01:49:44.589 --> 01:49:44.599 align:start position:0%
because it's in the right spirit and and
 
01:49:46.669 --> 01:49:46.679 align:start position:0%
I and I think that her point is very
 
01:49:48.629 --> 01:49:48.639 align:start position:0%
well taken about this the statement it
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
makes about how extraordinarily United
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
this committee is Behind These values
 
01:49:56.709 --> 01:49:56.719 align:start position:0%
and it's a statement on behalf of the
 
01:49:57.910 --> 01:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
house so as I said even though I won't
 
01:50:01.109 --> 01:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
vote for the amendment um I applaud the
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
chair for working toward admirable goals
 
01:50:06.510 --> 01:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
I I'll just make my pitch this is going
 
01:50:09.870 --> 01:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
to be my exact my exact speech but I'll
 
01:50:12.350 --> 01:50:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll shorten it I'll shorten it
 
01:50:14.750 --> 01:50:14.760 align:start position:0%
wait and you know use for now I just you
 
01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:16.239 align:start position:0%
the the chair referred to you know the
 
01:50:18.629 --> 01:50:18.639 align:start position:0%
pursuit of of happiness and that you
 
01:50:20.070 --> 01:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
know kind of that kind of reference
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
remains in uh the amendment but in terms
 
01:50:25.070 --> 01:50:25.080 align:start position:0%
of in my mind what makes us the right
 
01:50:26.430 --> 01:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
and the chair and I talked about this
 
01:50:30.189 --> 01:50:30.199 align:start position:0%
over the phone is uh a right is not only
 
01:50:31.510 --> 01:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
something as I've said which is inherent
 
01:50:33.870 --> 01:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
to your dignity as a person but is also
 
01:50:36.750 --> 01:50:36.760 align:start position:0%
does obligate the state to take action
 
01:50:39.990 --> 01:50:40.000 align:start position:0%
to defend right that's what our founding
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
documents are meant to do is to say that
 
01:50:44.390 --> 01:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
these are the rights to which you are
 
01:50:46.109 --> 01:50:46.119 align:start position:0%
entitled and which the government is
 
01:50:48.830 --> 01:50:48.840 align:start position:0%
obligated to defend and if we think
 
01:50:51.430 --> 01:50:51.440 align:start position:0%
about life and Liberty the first two in
 
01:50:53.589 --> 01:50:53.599 align:start position:0%
that sequence right we have the right to
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
bear arms to protect
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
ourselves and of course we have the
 
01:50:59.390 --> 01:50:59.400 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms to defend our Liberty
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
to to defend our freedom but we also
 
01:51:05.149 --> 01:51:05.159 align:start position:0%
have a positive responsibility on the
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
part of the government to defend our
 
01:51:09.709 --> 01:51:09.719 align:start position:0%
life and Liberty we have a police force
 
01:51:12.669 --> 01:51:12.679 align:start position:0%
we have military because it's not only
 
01:51:14.229 --> 01:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
the right of the individual to defend
 
01:51:15.669 --> 01:51:15.679 align:start position:0%
their own life and Liberty the
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
government has a positive responsibility
 
01:51:19.229 --> 01:51:19.239 align:start position:0%
also to defend those rights because
 
01:51:20.990 --> 01:51:21.000 align:start position:0%
they're fundamental rights and I think
 
01:51:23.350 --> 01:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
that is true of the right to a healthy
 
01:51:25.149 --> 01:51:25.159 align:start position:0%
and clean environment as well and the
 
01:51:26.629 --> 01:51:26.639 align:start position:0%
example I'll use is what happened at
 
01:51:29.229 --> 01:51:29.239 align:start position:0%
Love Canal in the late 1970s right this
 
01:51:31.750 --> 01:51:31.760 align:start position:0%
horrific environmental disaster it's not
 
01:51:34.189 --> 01:51:34.199 align:start position:0%
only the government's responsibility to
 
01:51:36.149 --> 01:51:36.159 align:start position:0%
hold accountable the
 
01:51:38.510 --> 01:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
perpetrators uh in that case it's not
 
01:51:41.430 --> 01:51:41.440 align:start position:0%
only the government's responsibility to
 
01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
remediate after the uh disaster took
 
01:51:45.870 --> 01:51:45.880 align:start position:0%
place it was the government's
 
01:51:47.830 --> 01:51:47.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility to prevent that from
 
01:51:50.790 --> 01:51:50.800 align:start position:0%
happening in the first place and we have
 
01:51:53.390 --> 01:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
a bill in our committee this session
 
01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
that happens to be about for example the
 
01:51:59.430 --> 01:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
oil uh the dis disposal fees right but
 
01:52:00.870 --> 01:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we talked about
 
01:52:02.910 --> 01:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
was underground gas
 
01:52:05.950 --> 01:52:05.960 align:start position:0%
tanks right at a gas station we don't
 
01:52:07.550 --> 01:52:07.560 align:start position:0%
simply say that it's the government's
 
01:52:09.550 --> 01:52:09.560 align:start position:0%
job to hold somebody accountable if
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
those tanks leak it's not just the
 
01:52:14.270 --> 01:52:14.280 align:start position:0%
government's responsibility to provide
 
01:52:16.629 --> 01:52:16.639 align:start position:0%
for remediation if those gas tanks leak
 
01:52:17.950 --> 01:52:17.960 align:start position:0%
it's the government's responsibility to
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
make sure they don't leak in the first
 
01:52:22.589 --> 01:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
place we pass laws we have rules in
 
01:52:25.990 --> 01:52:26.000 align:start position:0%
place to protect people to provide a
 
01:52:27.990 --> 01:52:28.000 align:start position:0%
healthy environment that is a positive
 
01:52:30.790 --> 01:52:30.800 align:start position:0%
obligation of the state to protect what
 
01:52:34.310 --> 01:52:34.320 align:start position:0%
I regard as uh an absolutely fundamental
 
01:52:36.189 --> 01:52:36.199 align:start position:0%
right so if we have the right to defend
 
01:52:36.199 --> 01:52:37.629 align:start position:0%
right so if we have the right to defend
ourselves

01:52:37.629 --> 01:52:37.639 align:start position:0%
ourselves
 
01:52:39.669 --> 01:52:39.679 align:start position:0%
personally for example with the Second
 
01:52:41.550 --> 01:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
Amendment and if the government has a
 
01:52:43.830 --> 01:52:43.840 align:start position:0%
positive responsibility to also help
 
01:52:45.310 --> 01:52:45.320 align:start position:0%
defend our life and Liberty through the
 
01:52:47.910 --> 01:52:47.920 align:start position:0%
use of force if necessary why is the
 
01:52:50.109 --> 01:52:50.119 align:start position:0%
government not also responsible to make
 
01:52:53.990 --> 01:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
sure that the environment isn't killing
 
01:52:57.830 --> 01:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
US Representative ktoa thank you madam
 
01:53:01.830 --> 01:53:01.840 align:start position:0%
chair um so in listening to both of
 
01:53:05.270 --> 01:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
these arguments I would say that the
 
01:53:07.470 --> 01:53:07.480 align:start position:0%
government has already taken
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility for a lot of this by we
 
01:53:12.510 --> 01:53:12.520 align:start position:0%
have the Department of Environmental
 
01:53:15.510 --> 01:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
Services we create laws and legislation
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
to try and protect our air to Pro
 
01:53:20.550 --> 01:53:20.560 align:start position:0%
protect our water we're already doing
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
that and I therefore the government's
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
already taking that and to say and in a
 
01:53:30.270 --> 01:53:30.280 align:start position:0%
lot of their sites they say what they do
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
to protect our drinking water to protect
 
01:53:35.950 --> 01:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
things and things are evolving we learn
 
01:53:40.069 --> 01:53:40.079 align:start position:0%
things all the time and you know plastic
 
01:53:43.430 --> 01:53:43.440 align:start position:0%
bags you know 20 plus years ago I was
 
01:53:45.669 --> 01:53:45.679 align:start position:0%
against them right and I was demonized
 
01:53:47.950 --> 01:53:47.960 align:start position:0%
because I wanted paper bags because I
 
01:53:49.589 --> 01:53:49.599 align:start position:0%
was told I was destroying the
 
01:53:52.990 --> 01:53:53.000 align:start position:0%
environment by wanting paper bags fast
 
01:53:56.229 --> 01:53:56.239 align:start position:0%
forward to today P you know plastic bags
 
01:53:57.950 --> 01:53:57.960 align:start position:0%
are destroying the environment through
 
01:54:00.830 --> 01:54:00.840 align:start position:0%
pafs and everything else so we have to
 
01:54:02.870 --> 01:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
recognize that technology and our
 
01:54:05.510 --> 01:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
departments are ever evolving as we
 
01:54:07.830 --> 01:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
learn new things and science is catching
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
up with what we're doing so I think
 
01:54:13.669 --> 01:54:13.679 align:start position:0%
we're already being proactive um and
 
01:54:16.430 --> 01:54:16.440 align:start position:0%
that these agencies that we've created
 
01:54:19.750 --> 01:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
as part of our government are protecting
 
01:54:22.550 --> 01:54:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know and valuing what we are saying
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
value so I believe that um
 
01:54:28.470 --> 01:54:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron statement is just a
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
reiteration of what we as the as the
 
01:54:35.069 --> 01:54:35.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:38.550 --> 01:54:38.560 align:start position:0%
today uh anybody else before you
 
01:54:38.560 --> 01:54:39.589 align:start position:0%
today uh anybody else before you
representative

01:54:39.589 --> 01:54:39.599 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
Howard um with all due respect to to uh
 
01:54:44.950 --> 01:54:44.960 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa I think this is a a
 
01:54:48.990 --> 01:54:49.000 align:start position:0%
value statement not necessarily A A A an
 
01:54:52.830 --> 01:54:52.840 align:start position:0%
action um a call to action so um I think
 
01:54:54.470 --> 01:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
that even though we are to the extent
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
that we are doing things to protect the
 
01:54:58.270 --> 01:54:58.280 align:start position:0%
environment that represent these values
 
01:55:02.390 --> 01:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
already this is meant to be a a you know
 
01:55:04.629 --> 01:55:04.639 align:start position:0%
a very clear statement of our values
 
01:55:06.149 --> 01:55:06.159 align:start position:0%
yeah you may answer and then
 
01:55:07.870 --> 01:55:07.880 align:start position:0%
representative thank you and I do agree
 
01:55:10.350 --> 01:55:10.360 align:start position:0%
with representative Aaron's amendment is
 
01:55:13.189 --> 01:55:13.199 align:start position:0%
what I was trying to say okay
 
01:55:15.310 --> 01:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
representative ger thank you and I want
 
01:55:16.910 --> 01:55:16.920 align:start position:0%
to preface by saying what what I'm going
 
01:55:20.830 --> 01:55:20.840 align:start position:0%
to say is not meant to in any way deride
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
anything that has been said or introduce
 
01:55:24.709 --> 01:55:24.719 align:start position:0%
another controversial argument but
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
simply to try to explain why I see that
 
01:55:29.229 --> 01:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
as a right the I I agree with the things
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
that you said representative coma on the
 
01:55:33.470 --> 01:55:33.480 align:start position:0%
other hand I would say I don't think
 
01:55:35.189 --> 01:55:35.199 align:start position:0%
many people in our chamber would be
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
satisfied with that same explanation
 
01:55:39.109 --> 01:55:39.119 align:start position:0%
about the right to bear arms that we
 
01:55:41.270 --> 01:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
don't need to have a statement of a
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
fundamental right as long as we have a
 
01:55:45.950 --> 01:55:45.960 align:start position:0%
commitment on the part of governing
 
01:55:48.709 --> 01:55:48.719 align:start position:0%
bodies to protect a right they want a
 
01:55:50.229 --> 01:55:50.239 align:start position:0%
fundamental statement and I don't
 
01:55:51.790 --> 01:55:51.800 align:start position:0%
disagree with that second amendment
 
01:55:54.550 --> 01:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
fundamental right uh but so I I would
 
01:55:57.310 --> 01:55:57.320 align:start position:0%
just I would offer that I don't think
 
01:56:01.510 --> 01:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
that the same argument would be accepted
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
if we were talking about the right to
 
01:56:04.709 --> 01:56:04.719 align:start position:0%
bear arms and that's why fundamental
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
rights have to be recognized as
 
01:56:09.109 --> 01:56:09.119 align:start position:0%
fundamental rights thank you okay
 
01:56:11.550 --> 01:56:11.560 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
01:56:13.910 --> 01:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
chair um I think the the problem if I
 
01:56:13.920 --> 01:56:15.310 align:start position:0%
chair um I think the the problem if I
may

01:56:15.310 --> 01:56:15.320 align:start position:0%
may
 
01:56:18.069 --> 01:56:18.079 align:start position:0%
um explain the difference is that
 
01:56:20.990 --> 01:56:21.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's a real struggle we have
 
01:56:24.870 --> 01:56:24.880 align:start position:0%
with what is it means to have a right so
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
while while we agree that people have a
 
01:56:29.790 --> 01:56:29.800 align:start position:0%
right to keep in bare arms um I think
 
01:56:33.390 --> 01:56:33.400 align:start position:0%
even the most uh conservative Among Us
 
01:56:36.550 --> 01:56:36.560 align:start position:0%
would also agree that the government
 
01:56:38.390 --> 01:56:38.400 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not so much a right that
 
01:56:40.189 --> 01:56:40.199 align:start position:0%
the government has to buy your weapons
 
01:56:42.910 --> 01:56:42.920 align:start position:0%
for you and provide you your weapons um
 
01:56:45.589 --> 01:56:45.599 align:start position:0%
but then we have other so-called rights
 
01:56:48.750 --> 01:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
like the right to a an education and now
 
01:56:50.430 --> 01:56:50.440 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden it's the government's
 
01:56:53.229 --> 01:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
job to take money from taxpayers pirs to
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
pay for the education and provide the
 
01:56:59.750 --> 01:56:59.760 align:start position:0%
education for children as opposed to
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
nobody can stop you from you know in my
 
01:57:03.790 --> 01:57:03.800 align:start position:0%
opinion the right would be you have the
 
01:57:05.470 --> 01:57:05.480 align:start position:0%
right to read books and educate yourself
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
and and go to the school of your choice
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
but but there's there is a a rift
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
because there's a heavy portion of the
 
01:57:14.270 --> 01:57:14.280 align:start position:0%
population that thinks oh no because it
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
is a right now all of a sudden it's the
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
government's job to provide it for you
 
01:57:20.149 --> 01:57:20.159 align:start position:0%
and and that's really where the problem
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
comes in is is um you know you might be
 
01:57:25.870 --> 01:57:25.880 align:start position:0%
able to convince me on things that are
 
01:57:28.510 --> 01:57:28.520 align:start position:0%
rights but not what that entails and the
 
01:57:30.510 --> 01:57:30.520 align:start position:0%
problem is is that in this country we
 
01:57:33.430 --> 01:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
have a real hard disagreement on what
 
01:57:35.750 --> 01:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
exactly that entails thank
 
01:57:38.589 --> 01:57:38.599 align:start position:0%
you and for
 
01:57:41.669 --> 01:57:41.679 align:start position:0%
me because I know that there
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
are members of our legislature
 
01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.870 align:start position:0%
are members of our legislature
who

01:57:46.870 --> 01:57:46.880 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:57:50.870 --> 01:57:50.880 align:start position:0%
um have a strong feeling about what a
 
01:57:54.550 --> 01:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
right is versus what right is not um
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps based on the Bill of Rights the
 
01:58:00.589 --> 01:58:00.599 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights spell out specific rights
 
01:58:02.510 --> 01:58:02.520 align:start position:0%
that we have right to free speech right
 
01:58:07.390 --> 01:58:07.400 align:start position:0%
to uh freedom to assemble um and so
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
forth and I I just feel
 
01:58:13.069 --> 01:58:13.079 align:start position:0%
like a
 
01:58:15.510 --> 01:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
resolution Bas the amendment that I
 
01:58:19.470 --> 01:58:19.480 align:start position:0%
brought forward would be something that
 
01:58:22.430 --> 01:58:22.440 align:start position:0%
uh the majority of the house would be
 
01:58:26.910 --> 01:58:26.920 align:start position:0%
able to support as opposed to
 
01:58:31.950 --> 01:58:31.960 align:start position:0%
um stating specifically that um the the
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
right to clean air clean water and a
 
01:58:36.910 --> 01:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
healthy environment you know stipulating
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
that those are rights um because I I
 
01:58:41.229 --> 01:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
know that there will be a significant
 
01:58:42.750 --> 01:58:42.760 align:start position:0%
significant amount of people who would
 
01:58:45.350 --> 01:58:45.360 align:start position:0%
disagree with that representative um
 
01:58:47.910 --> 01:58:47.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby so uh I'm just looking at the
 
01:58:52.310 --> 01:58:52.320 align:start position:0%
clock and I'm thinking that um the
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
discussion of what constitutes rights is
 
01:58:57.589 --> 01:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
extremely complicated it's been going on
 
01:58:59.629 --> 01:58:59.639 align:start position:0%
since the 17th
 
01:59:02.149 --> 01:59:02.159 align:start position:0%
century uh that's a lot of territory to
 
01:59:03.790 --> 01:59:03.800 align:start position:0%
cover I don't think we're going to cover
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
it in an hour y uh so um or half an
 
01:59:13.149 --> 01:59:13.159 align:start position:0%
hour so I think maybe we should uh move
 
01:59:15.870 --> 01:59:15.880 align:start position:0%
on move on we will probably have not
 
01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
entirely agree when we come to a voting
 
01:59:19.709 --> 01:59:19.719 align:start position:0%
on the amendment but I think that we'll
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
probably be able to come to
 
01:59:24.910 --> 01:59:24.920 align:start position:0%
agreement on the final resolution okay
 
01:59:27.950 --> 01:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you appreciate
 
01:59:31.229 --> 01:59:31.239 align:start position:0%
that thank you for watching the clock I
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
did not uh so we'll we'll End discussion
 
01:59:37.510 --> 01:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
on that um there may be uh an amendment
 
01:59:39.390 --> 01:59:39.400 align:start position:0%
to the amendment based on uh what
 
01:59:41.990 --> 01:59:42.000 align:start position:0%
representative Howard has expressed but
 
01:59:44.790 --> 01:59:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh we'll we'll see where that goes um HB
 
01:59:47.189 --> 01:59:47.199 align:start position:0%
2115 requiring a landfill permit
 
01:59:49.030 --> 01:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
applicant to submit a report listing
 
01:59:51.270 --> 01:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
potential harms and benefits of the
 
01:59:55.510 --> 01:59:55.520 align:start position:0%
project um that is um a bill that was
 
01:59:57.950 --> 01:59:57.960 align:start position:0%
discussed uh and it is also an early
 
02:00:01.950 --> 02:00:01.960 align:start position:0%
bill so we we do have a little bit of um
 
02:00:05.790 --> 02:00:05.800 align:start position:0%
uh need to address this uh that was
 
02:00:07.830 --> 02:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
discussed this morning in the uh
 
02:00:09.550 --> 02:00:09.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and representative king
 
02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
would you like to bring us up to date on
 
02:00:12.750 --> 02:00:12.760 align:start position:0%
what was
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
discussed actually uh I'd like to punt
 
02:00:17.910 --> 02:00:17.920 align:start position:0%
to representative German uh to uh
 
02:00:20.830 --> 02:00:20.840 align:start position:0%
Explain If he if he would be so willing
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
it is punted
 
02:00:24.910 --> 02:00:24.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative King and thank
 
02:00:26.950 --> 02:00:26.960 align:start position:0%
you madam chair so uh we had a good
 
02:00:29.550 --> 02:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
discussion of 215 this morning what we
 
02:00:33.430 --> 02:00:33.440 align:start position:0%
realized was that when I asked OS for an
 
02:00:35.830 --> 02:00:35.840 align:start position:0%
amendment what I asked them to do was to
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
rep to
 
02:00:39.910 --> 02:00:39.920 align:start position:0%
replace the section number one and leave
 
02:00:43.790 --> 02:00:43.800 align:start position:0%
sections two and three untouched uh what
 
02:00:46.870 --> 02:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
they gave us back was just section one
 
02:00:49.189 --> 02:00:49.199 align:start position:0%
they have left out the second and third
 
02:00:52.270 --> 02:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
sections so um I believe that we had
 
02:00:54.950 --> 02:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
consensus about the amendment uh we just
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
needed to ask OS to restore the sections
 
02:00:59.830 --> 02:00:59.840 align:start position:0%
that were left out and then we would be
 
02:01:01.709 --> 02:01:01.719 align:start position:0%
ready to bring it to the executive
 
02:01:05.030 --> 02:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
executive session next week okay awesome
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you could you
 
02:01:09.310 --> 02:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
just speak to what the amendment is
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
based on the original bill please thank
 
02:01:15.030 --> 02:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
you very much representative ktoa um
 
02:01:17.189 --> 02:01:17.199 align:start position:0%
I've got three landfill bills in my head
 
02:01:20.189 --> 02:01:20.199 align:start position:0%
at the moment um this your head's full
 
02:01:22.510 --> 02:01:22.520 align:start position:0%
of trash right it is that's right it is
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
it is uh man I set you up for
 
02:01:29.229 --> 02:01:29.239 align:start position:0%
that uh so what we did based on
 
02:01:30.990 --> 02:01:31.000 align:start position:0%
discussion that we had had in a previous
 
02:01:33.790 --> 02:01:33.800 align:start position:0%
work session was number one to define a
 
02:01:36.109 --> 02:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
process whereby a third party would be
 
02:01:39.629 --> 02:01:39.639 align:start position:0%
contracted so what uh Dees would have
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
the applicant submit a list of at least
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
three potential parties Dees would work
 
02:01:49.910 --> 02:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
with the uh the um host community and
 
02:01:52.069 --> 02:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
the applicant to try to find a mutually
 
02:01:56.310 --> 02:01:56.320 align:start position:0%
acceptable third party um if the clock
 
02:01:58.629 --> 02:01:58.639 align:start position:0%
if after 60 days an agreement hasn't
 
02:01:59.950 --> 02:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
been reached the commissioner will
 
02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:00.990 align:start position:0%
been reached the commissioner will
choose

02:02:00.990 --> 02:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
choose
 
02:02:01.000 --> 02:02:02.510 align:start position:0%
choose
one

02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:02:04.510 --> 02:02:04.520 align:start position:0%
uh the other thing that we did in the
 
02:02:06.750 --> 02:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
amendment which I I I am also I feel
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
very good about is that we have also
 
02:02:11.310 --> 02:02:11.320 align:start position:0%
added some things that can be factored
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
in for potential benefits uh right now
 
02:02:17.270 --> 02:02:17.280 align:start position:0%
the primary potential benefit is defined
 
02:02:19.189 --> 02:02:19.199 align:start position:0%
in statute is capacity need there are a
 
02:02:20.270 --> 02:02:20.280 align:start position:0%
couple of other things but it's
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
primarily capacity need
 
02:02:25.470 --> 02:02:25.480 align:start position:0%
this amendment will actually add in the
 
02:02:28.069 --> 02:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
consideration of possible economic
 
02:02:30.189 --> 02:02:30.199 align:start position:0%
benefits for the host Community as well
 
02:02:32.229 --> 02:02:32.239 align:start position:0%
as potential improvements to
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and the purpose is to um
 
02:02:36.830 --> 02:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
really to provide a true balance if
 
02:02:38.550 --> 02:02:38.560 align:start position:0%
we're looking at what are the possible
 
02:02:41.550 --> 02:02:41.560 align:start position:0%
benefits what are the possible uh harms
 
02:02:44.350 --> 02:02:44.360 align:start position:0%
that we are you the purpose of the bill
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
is not to say that you can never site a
 
02:02:47.750 --> 02:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
landfill and we're only going to pay
 
02:02:50.350 --> 02:02:50.360 align:start position:0%
attention to harms so it develops a list
 
02:02:52.229 --> 02:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
of potential benefits that is meant to
 
02:02:55.990 --> 02:02:56.000 align:start position:0%
provide a true balance between um
 
02:02:58.069 --> 02:02:58.079 align:start position:0%
between harms and benefits and then
 
02:03:00.270 --> 02:03:00.280 align:start position:0%
finally it
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
articulates how a first stage of review
 
02:03:05.189 --> 02:03:05.199 align:start position:0%
would take place the net benefit
 
02:03:07.390 --> 02:03:07.400 align:start position:0%
analysis would be an initial stage of
 
02:03:10.870 --> 02:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
review Dees would be able to seek
 
02:03:13.069 --> 02:03:13.079 align:start position:0%
guidance from some other agencies and
 
02:03:15.030 --> 02:03:15.040 align:start position:0%
that's a language that I worked out with
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh uh with director whimet in order to
 
02:03:19.589 --> 02:03:19.599 align:start position:0%
be able to come to a judgment about
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
whether or not net benefit exists
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
uh and then whether or not the proposal
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
could go forward from there uh and the
 
02:03:30.030 --> 02:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
other thing that and this uh goes to
 
02:03:31.470 --> 02:03:31.480 align:start position:0%
something a very helpful point that
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa made in our
 
02:03:34.750 --> 02:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
discussions in terms of defining net
 
02:03:36.910 --> 02:03:36.920 align:start position:0%
benefit in the first paragraph of the
 
02:03:39.790 --> 02:03:39.800 align:start position:0%
bill we have a specific definition of
 
02:03:42.030 --> 02:03:42.040 align:start position:0%
what it would mean for the Department to
 
02:03:44.629 --> 02:03:44.639 align:start position:0%
determine that a net benefit
 
02:03:48.149 --> 02:03:48.159 align:start position:0%
exists uh Madam J could you tell me what
 
02:03:54.510 --> 02:03:54.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:56.109 --> 02:03:56.119 align:start position:0%
I apologize for not having it on hand
 
02:03:58.109 --> 02:03:58.119 align:start position:0%
when I went to get it printed The copier
 
02:04:00.950 --> 02:04:00.960 align:start position:0%
upstairs was not working this
 
02:04:04.109 --> 02:04:04.119 align:start position:0%
morning so I'm trying to find it in my
 
02:04:06.310 --> 02:04:06.320 align:start position:0%
emails you can blame that on me I gave
 
02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
them a copy and it jammed that's right
 
02:04:09.920 --> 02:04:10.790 align:start position:0%
them a copy and it jammed that's right
it

02:04:10.790 --> 02:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:04:13.669 --> 02:04:13.679 align:start position:0%
was it was
 
02:04:24.750 --> 02:04:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:28.790 --> 02:04:28.800 align:start position:0%
trying to find it uh I think this is
 
02:04:32.790 --> 02:04:32.800 align:start position:0%
it we're on 215 correct
 
02:04:36.109 --> 02:04:36.119 align:start position:0%
correct so uh the the language says a
 
02:04:39.189 --> 02:04:39.199 align:start position:0%
net public benefit exists if potential
 
02:04:41.549 --> 02:04:41.559 align:start position:0%
benefits for a proposed project are
 
02:04:43.390 --> 02:04:43.400 align:start position:0%
determined to be greater than the
 
02:04:43.400 --> 02:04:47.790 align:start position:0%
determined to be greater than the
potential

02:04:47.790 --> 02:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.430 --> 02:04:50.440 align:start position:0%
harms did you get
 
02:04:54.270 --> 02:04:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
and I can send this around uh yeah to
 
02:04:59.189 --> 02:04:59.199 align:start position:0%
the committee I intended to have a hard
 
02:05:02.589 --> 02:05:02.599 align:start position:0%
copy uh to give to everybody today okay
 
02:05:05.709 --> 02:05:05.719 align:start position:0%
all right so you're working on that um
 
02:05:08.229 --> 02:05:08.239 align:start position:0%
we will discuss it again in work session
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
next week and hopefully um we'll have a
 
02:05:16.430 --> 02:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
an amendment in hand that we can um vote
 
02:05:19.870 --> 02:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
on um in an exec session next week as
 
02:05:23.549 --> 02:05:23.559 align:start position:0%
well if we in the work session we see
 
02:05:25.950 --> 02:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
that there's something in the amendment
 
02:05:28.830 --> 02:05:28.840 align:start position:0%
that we feel needs further work or
 
02:05:31.030 --> 02:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
whatever we could push off that exec to
 
02:05:34.589 --> 02:05:34.599 align:start position:0%
February 19th but um the bill does need
 
02:05:38.310 --> 02:05:38.320 align:start position:0%
to be out by March 6th I believe y so it
 
02:05:41.549 --> 02:05:41.559 align:start position:0%
is an early Bill we need to um make sure
 
02:05:43.990 --> 02:05:44.000 align:start position:0%
we get that taken care
 
02:05:48.350 --> 02:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
of okay um next is HB 566 requiring
 
02:05:50.510 --> 02:05:50.520 align:start position:0%
permit applications for new landfills to
 
02:05:53.109 --> 02:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
contain a det detailed plan for lee8
 
02:05:55.310 --> 02:05:55.320 align:start position:0%
management that's another bill that I
 
02:05:58.549 --> 02:05:58.559 align:start position:0%
believe the subcommittee was working on
 
02:06:00.750 --> 02:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
we have a uh yes I'd like to once again
 
02:06:03.390 --> 02:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
punt to representative gerana you're a

you and uh we had a a good discussion uh
 
02:06:11.229 --> 02:06:11.239 align:start position:0%
in this uh works or in the the
 
02:06:14.069 --> 02:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and had some excellent the
 
02:06:16.229 --> 02:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
the language uh in the
 
02:06:18.709 --> 02:06:18.719 align:start position:0%
amendment uh which I can share with the
 
02:06:21.549 --> 02:06:21.559 align:start position:0%
committee uh where it stands now
 
02:06:23.910 --> 02:06:23.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives Gruber and Scully had a
 
02:06:26.470 --> 02:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
couple of recommendations for some very
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
small changes but important changes so
 
02:06:32.270 --> 02:06:32.280 align:start position:0%
uh I'll show I'll share with you what we
 
02:06:34.830 --> 02:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
currently have um and then as I said
 
02:06:37.549 --> 02:06:37.559 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of very minor
 
02:06:41.229 --> 02:06:41.239 align:start position:0%
changes one would address the fact that
 
02:06:43.229 --> 02:06:43.239 align:start position:0%
uh some facilities oh yeah some
 
02:06:46.589 --> 02:06:46.599 align:start position:0%
facilities like TurnKey do some onsite
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
treatment so it would make reference not
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
just to on-site storage but on-site
 
02:06:50.920 --> 02:06:52.350 align:start position:0%
just to on-site storage but on-site
treatment

02:06:52.350 --> 02:06:52.360 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
02:06:55.310 --> 02:06:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and then also uh representative
 
02:06:57.430 --> 02:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
Scully had a good suggestion about
 
02:07:00.310 --> 02:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
adding in some language that indicates
 
02:07:00.320 --> 02:07:01.790 align:start position:0%
adding in some language that indicates
that

02:07:01.790 --> 02:07:01.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:07:04.830 --> 02:07:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh that people applying for a permit
 
02:07:08.709 --> 02:07:08.719 align:start position:0%
would have to have um alternate uh
 
02:07:11.750 --> 02:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
potential operators for disposal right
 
02:07:13.669 --> 02:07:13.679 align:start position:0%
so if you've got your current operator
 
02:07:15.270 --> 02:07:15.280 align:start position:0%
that you would have under contract that
 
02:07:16.870 --> 02:07:16.880 align:start position:0%
you would demonstrate that you are
 
02:07:19.310 --> 02:07:19.320 align:start position:0%
prepared with alternative at least a
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
couple of alternative possibilities if
 
02:07:24.990 --> 02:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
your primary dis you know operator was
 
02:07:26.750 --> 02:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
unable to fulfill the terms of the
 
02:07:26.760 --> 02:07:28.629 align:start position:0%
unable to fulfill the terms of the
contract

02:07:28.629 --> 02:07:28.639 align:start position:0%
contract
 
02:07:30.990 --> 02:07:31.000 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
02:07:32.910 --> 02:07:32.920 align:start position:0%
comment on the
 
02:07:35.270 --> 02:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
amendment that we just shared I guess
 
02:07:37.910 --> 02:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
people need some time to look at it and
 
02:07:40.669 --> 02:07:40.679 align:start position:0%
sort of digest it whatever but um
 
02:07:43.830 --> 02:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing this forward and
 
02:07:46.030 --> 02:07:46.040 align:start position:0%
the work that um the subcommittee has
 
02:07:51.830 --> 02:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
done on this very good so um and there's
 
02:07:54.430 --> 02:07:54.440 align:start position:0%
any other further discussion about it I
 
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
think we can uh we can assume that next
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
week we'll be able to EXA the bill yes
 
02:08:03.910 --> 02:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
yeah represent Bixby yeah this is
 
02:08:06.830 --> 02:08:06.840 align:start position:0%
something I think came up in um in a
 
02:08:10.990 --> 02:08:11.000 align:start position:0%
different Bill uh does this so one of
 
02:08:11.000 --> 02:08:12.790 align:start position:0%
different Bill uh does this so one of
the

02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:08:18.750 --> 02:08:18.760 align:start position:0%
um dangers in terms of uh the the
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
sighting of a landfill that was
 
02:08:23.790 --> 02:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
discussed was whether the leachate
 
02:08:29.030 --> 02:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
transfer location was uh uh was located
 
02:08:31.870 --> 02:08:31.880 align:start position:0%
in a place or built in a manner that
 
02:08:33.990 --> 02:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
would prevent a spill from going into
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%
the ground into the groundwater uh and
 
02:08:42.910 --> 02:08:42.920 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know if that's here uh so uh
 
02:08:45.470 --> 02:08:45.480 align:start position:0%
if but there should part of that
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
leachate man management should include
 
02:08:50.510 --> 02:08:50.520 align:start position:0%
the fact the handling of the leech heate
 
02:08:53.310 --> 02:08:53.320 align:start position:0%
at the site is positioned in such a way
 
02:08:56.830 --> 02:08:56.840 align:start position:0%
that it will not uh hit ground that is
 
02:09:00.109 --> 02:09:00.119 align:start position:0%
not protected by some sort of uh liner
 
02:09:04.669 --> 02:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
or uh or other um other means other
 
02:09:06.709 --> 02:09:06.719 align:start position:0%
means of pre preent preventing it from
 
02:09:10.830 --> 02:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.910 --> 02:09:12.920 align:start position:0%
groundwater I don't know if we're able
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
to ask you know advice from from the
 
02:09:17.629 --> 02:09:17.639 align:start position:0%
director on this I'm not sure to what ex
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
I genuinely do not know to what extent
 
02:09:22.830 --> 02:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
we can make requirements about the terms
 
02:09:27.390 --> 02:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
of the contract in that regard represent
 
02:09:30.229 --> 02:09:30.239 align:start position:0%
um sorry director whims would
 
02:09:37.830 --> 02:09:37.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:39.990 --> 02:09:40.000 align:start position:0%
discussion good morning for the record
 
02:09:41.750 --> 02:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
my name is Mike whims service director
 
02:09:43.310 --> 02:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
of the waste management division for New
 
02:09:46.430 --> 02:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Dees and and could you re uh
 
02:09:48.830 --> 02:09:48.840 align:start position:0%
restate the question representative
 
02:09:51.549 --> 02:09:51.559 align:start position:0%
jamano you want me to or represent so
 
02:09:56.350 --> 02:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
the qu so I guess the the issue is that
 
02:10:00.350 --> 02:10:00.360 align:start position:0%
um the currently it uh to my
 
02:10:01.910 --> 02:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
understanding there is nothing that says
 
02:10:06.149 --> 02:10:06.159 align:start position:0%
that the location where the lee8 gets
 
02:10:10.510 --> 02:10:10.520 align:start position:0%
transferred to the um to off-site
 
02:10:14.030 --> 02:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
Transportation or the uh place or or
 
02:10:17.229 --> 02:10:17.239 align:start position:0%
where it is stored on site is in a
 
02:10:19.510 --> 02:10:19.520 align:start position:0%
location that where the groundwater is
 
02:10:23.109 --> 02:10:23.119 align:start position:0%
protected from in from a
 
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
spill thank you for the question the new
 
02:10:28.669 --> 02:10:28.679 align:start position:0%
rules that were recently enacted do um
 
02:10:30.950 --> 02:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
subject um all areas where leech a is
 
02:10:33.270 --> 02:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
handled including transfer areas to the
 
02:10:36.709 --> 02:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
setback standards um and the and of that
 
02:10:39.149 --> 02:10:39.159 align:start position:0%
that apply to the landfill footprint as
 
02:10:41.149 --> 02:10:41.159 align:start position:0%
well as um there are increased and
 
02:10:43.990 --> 02:10:44.000 align:start position:0%
augmented design standards for the
 
02:10:45.990 --> 02:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
design and construction and operation of
 
02:10:49.030 --> 02:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
those lee8 Loadout areas okay so it
 
02:10:50.870 --> 02:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like that would not be something
 
02:10:52.629 --> 02:10:52.639 align:start position:0%
that's NE to add to this
 
02:10:55.149 --> 02:10:55.159 align:start position:0%
bill in my estimation I don't think it
 
02:10:56.910 --> 02:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
would be be necessary thank you that
 
02:10:59.470 --> 02:10:59.480 align:start position:0%
makes our job easier okay thank you very
 
02:11:01.830 --> 02:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
much you're welcome any other questions
 
02:11:04.669 --> 02:11:04.679 align:start position:0%
or comments regarding HP
 
02:11:07.390 --> 02:11:07.400 align:start position:0%
566 okay I think I think we will be
 
02:11:11.549 --> 02:11:11.559 align:start position:0%
ready to um to exec that bill next week
 
02:11:15.990 --> 02:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:19.589 --> 02:11:19.599 align:start position:0%
presented moving on to hb1 153 requiring
 
02:11:21.310 --> 02:11:21.320 align:start position:0%
that two or more law enforcement off
 
02:11:23.310 --> 02:11:23.320 align:start position:0%
officers in each County receive training
 
02:11:25.430 --> 02:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
regarding animal cruelty and I believe
 
02:11:27.510 --> 02:11:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa was working on that
 
02:11:30.549 --> 02:11:30.559 align:start position:0%
bill uh thank you madam chair uh we are
 
02:11:32.870 --> 02:11:32.880 align:start position:0%
having a uh subcommittee meeting
 
02:11:36.589 --> 02:11:36.599 align:start position:0%
starting at 9:00 a.m. on Friday uh going
 
02:11:40.510 --> 02:11:40.520 align:start position:0%
to have a a work session on that uh to
 
02:11:43.470 --> 02:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
further discuss uh the best way to go
 
02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
about doing
 
02:11:45.440 --> 02:11:48.589 align:start position:0%
about doing
this

02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:51.229 --> 02:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
okay all right any questions or comments
 
02:11:52.950 --> 02:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
ments regarding that
 
02:11:55.750 --> 02:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh this is representative repres
 
02:11:58.270 --> 02:11:58.280 align:start position:0%
Scully yeah well thank you uh I did have
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
one question um I think this is a good
 
02:12:02.950 --> 02:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
idea that we have people trained to be
 
02:12:06.189 --> 02:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
able to look at these things um was have
 
02:12:06.199 --> 02:12:06.990 align:start position:0%
able to look at these things um was have
we

02:12:06.990 --> 02:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:12:09.510 --> 02:12:09.520 align:start position:0%
considered just involving the state
 
02:12:11.589 --> 02:12:11.599 align:start position:0%
veterinaries office since they are the
 
02:12:13.589 --> 02:12:13.599 align:start position:0%
experts and making sure that they are
 
02:12:16.390 --> 02:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
consulted rather than trying to tr train
 
02:12:18.310 --> 02:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
police officers to you know I the sense
 
02:12:20.549 --> 02:12:20.559 align:start position:0%
I got was that they were saying that you
 
02:12:22.069 --> 02:12:22.079 align:start position:0%
know even with some additional training
 
02:12:23.709 --> 02:12:23.719 align:start position:0%
it's very difficult for them to be
 
02:12:27.830 --> 02:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
experts in all areas is is has the the
 
02:12:30.350 --> 02:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
idea of just getting the expert directly
 
02:12:32.229 --> 02:12:32.239 align:start position:0%
involved with law enforcement been
 
02:12:35.270 --> 02:12:35.280 align:start position:0%
considered sure sure representative coma
 
02:12:36.709 --> 02:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
we've had discussions about that
 
02:12:39.950 --> 02:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
actually yes uh thank you for the
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
question um the state veterinarian is
 
02:12:45.870 --> 02:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
not a law enforcement does has nothing
 
02:12:48.350 --> 02:12:48.360 align:start position:0%
to do with law enforcement they are
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
advisory they have to uh send someone or
 
02:12:54.629 --> 02:12:54.639 align:start position:0%
an approved veterinarian to a company
 
02:12:57.390 --> 02:12:57.400 align:start position:0%
but they cannot go on they don't they
 
02:12:59.510 --> 02:12:59.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the ability to do a warrant
 
02:13:01.750 --> 02:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
or any of that information this is
 
02:13:06.069 --> 02:13:06.079 align:start position:0%
actually a Law Enforcement issue
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
specifically if I may sure you may
 
02:13:10.589 --> 02:13:10.599 align:start position:0%
follow question all right so I do
 
02:13:12.270 --> 02:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
understand they would perhaps have the
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
power of arrest but they could be
 
02:13:16.470 --> 02:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
brought by people who do have the power
 
02:13:19.310 --> 02:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
of arrest to and to consult to them say
 
02:13:20.830 --> 02:13:20.840 align:start position:0%
yes this is the appropriate use of that
 
02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:24.239 align:start position:0%
power yeah represent to our followup yep
 
02:13:27.750 --> 02:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to um we're going to be
 
02:13:30.790 --> 02:13:30.800 align:start position:0%
hearing a lot about this um is that next
 
02:13:32.669 --> 02:13:32.679 align:start position:0%
week Madam chair we're going to be
 
02:13:34.910 --> 02:13:34.920 align:start position:0%
hearing about that next week we have a
 
02:13:37.430 --> 02:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
lot of bills coming forth about this uh
 
02:13:41.030 --> 02:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
with some issues um I know that a few of
 
02:13:42.669 --> 02:13:42.679 align:start position:0%
us on this committee have worked
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
diligently to get the laws to where they
 
02:13:47.669 --> 02:13:47.679 align:start position:0%
are improving them and we're going to
 
02:13:49.030 --> 02:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
hopefully make more
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
improvements uh but this has been an
 
02:13:56.270 --> 02:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
ongoing issue between um but when
 
02:13:58.669 --> 02:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
somebody calls and
 
02:14:01.149 --> 02:14:01.159 align:start position:0%
has an animal cruelty case that they
 
02:14:03.950 --> 02:14:03.960 align:start position:0%
want to report it's a Law Enforcement
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
issue and therefore as one person sat
 
02:14:09.149 --> 02:14:09.159 align:start position:0%
here and said we said do you realize you
 
02:14:11.549 --> 02:14:11.559 align:start position:0%
have to have a licensed veterinarian
 
02:14:14.629 --> 02:14:14.639 align:start position:0%
accompany you they said no so these are
 
02:14:16.629 --> 02:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
the things that law enforcement needs to
 
02:14:18.790 --> 02:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
understand they need to understand what
 
02:14:22.510 --> 02:14:22.520 align:start position:0%
they need to do in order to
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
um for to make these cases move forward
 
02:14:26.709 --> 02:14:26.719 align:start position:0%
and what their responsibility is and
 
02:14:29.549 --> 02:14:29.559 align:start position:0%
what they're not responsible for so
 
02:14:32.910 --> 02:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby yeah so uh sort of
 
02:14:36.030 --> 02:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
carrying on from what representative kto
 
02:14:40.750 --> 02:14:40.760 align:start position:0%
was saying um the one of the key aspects
 
02:14:43.430 --> 02:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
of this bill is making sure that law
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement really understands the law
 
02:14:50.189 --> 02:14:50.199 align:start position:0%
about animal cruelty and understands
 
02:14:52.669 --> 02:14:52.679 align:start position:0%
what resources they can draw on with
 
02:14:54.350 --> 02:14:54.360 align:start position:0%
this is not about teaching law
 
02:14:58.669 --> 02:14:58.679 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh officers how to diagnose
 
02:15:02.310 --> 02:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh a an animal and determine whether it
 
02:15:06.350 --> 02:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
is uh lactating or malnourished right uh
 
02:15:10.390 --> 02:15:10.400 align:start position:0%
it is um it's a matter of uh making sure
 
02:15:13.030 --> 02:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
that law enforcement knows where the
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
correct uh advice should be coming from
 
02:15:20.270 --> 02:15:20.280 align:start position:0%
and knows what uh what the due process
 
02:15:23.589 --> 02:15:23.599 align:start position:0%
rights are that are that exist in law
 
02:15:26.109 --> 02:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
and make sure that they follow the law
 
02:15:28.950 --> 02:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
correct are they know how the law works
 
02:15:31.310 --> 02:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
so that they can follow it correctly and
 
02:15:33.270 --> 02:15:33.280 align:start position:0%
there have been changes in the statute
 
02:15:37.549 --> 02:15:37.559 align:start position:0%
in the last few years uh not everyone
 
02:15:40.589 --> 02:15:40.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily uh has looks at all the
 
02:15:43.390 --> 02:15:43.400 align:start position:0%
changes in statute that for the
 
02:15:46.589 --> 02:15:46.599 align:start position:0%
voluminous amount of uh statute there is
 
02:15:50.430 --> 02:15:50.440 align:start position:0%
for for um that law enforcement needs to
 
02:15:53.910 --> 02:15:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh keep up up with uh so uh there needs
 
02:15:56.589 --> 02:15:56.599 align:start position:0%
to be some way of making sure that uh
 
02:15:58.709 --> 02:15:58.719 align:start position:0%
people know what the current statute is
 
02:16:01.950 --> 02:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
and that is that all goes into making
 
02:16:04.270 --> 02:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
sure that we have people who are
 
02:16:08.149 --> 02:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
trained uh in that in the state and are
 
02:16:12.510 --> 02:16:12.520 align:start position:0%
able to keep up on changes and uh and
 
02:16:16.109 --> 02:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
and then uh be a resource for other law
 
02:16:18.950 --> 02:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
enforcement uh in order to uh deal with
 
02:16:21.270 --> 02:16:21.280 align:start position:0%
these cases
 
02:16:24.390 --> 02:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
thank you okay thank
 
02:16:27.030 --> 02:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
you okay so there will be a subcommittee
 
02:16:30.910 --> 02:16:30.920 align:start position:0%
meeting on Friday regarding HB 153 and I
 
02:16:34.230 --> 02:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
look forward to uh whatever discussions
 
02:16:36.549 --> 02:16:36.559 align:start position:0%
they have and whatever amendments they
 
02:16:40.030 --> 02:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
may come up with for that this bill um
 
02:16:42.790 --> 02:16:42.800 align:start position:0%
HB 153 is an early Bill we do need to
 
02:16:45.349 --> 02:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
get that out by March 6th just so you
 
02:16:48.589 --> 02:16:48.599 align:start position:0%
guys know um moving on to
 
02:16:51.349 --> 02:16:51.359 align:start position:0%
hr13 opposing the permitting of landfill
 
02:16:53.309 --> 02:16:53.319 align:start position:0%
next to Forest Lake Park in Dalton New
 
02:16:56.150 --> 02:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and I believe um
 
02:16:58.709 --> 02:16:58.719 align:start position:0%
representative King you may have some
 
02:17:01.030 --> 02:17:01.040 align:start position:0%
updated information for us on work you
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
were doing on that particular Bill well
 
02:17:06.830 --> 02:17:06.840 align:start position:0%
I can't take any credit for the work um
 
02:17:09.070 --> 02:17:09.080 align:start position:0%
um there were others that did much more
 
02:17:10.830 --> 02:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
work than myself but um so I'm going to
 
02:17:13.669 --> 02:17:13.679 align:start position:0%
punt once more to representative gerana
 
02:17:16.589 --> 02:17:16.599 align:start position:0%
if you would like to do
 
02:17:16.599 --> 02:17:18.349 align:start position:0%
if you would like to do
that

02:17:18.349 --> 02:17:18.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:17:21.309 --> 02:17:21.319 align:start position:0%
yeah uh yeah so I we've had a number of
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
conversations I know that representative
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
King spoke with representative ktoa and
 
02:17:27.549 --> 02:17:27.559 align:start position:0%
we we heard concerns about the in
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
particular the length of the
 
02:17:33.669 --> 02:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
whereases uh and also the um the desire
 
02:17:36.910 --> 02:17:36.920 align:start position:0%
to have the whereases be specific to
 
02:17:39.910 --> 02:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
Dalton as opposed to about the state in
 
02:17:42.750 --> 02:17:42.760 align:start position:0%
general or tourism in general Etc so uh
 
02:17:46.030 --> 02:17:46.040 align:start position:0%
what I have from those conversations uh
 
02:17:47.830 --> 02:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
worked on and I emailed it to the
 
02:17:50.389 --> 02:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
committee as some language for us to to
 
02:17:50.399 --> 02:17:51.709 align:start position:0%
committee as some language for us to to
consider

02:17:51.709 --> 02:17:51.719 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:17:53.469 --> 02:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
it hasn't gone to the amendment process
 
02:17:56.030 --> 02:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
yet it's got five wear ases which are
 
02:18:00.070 --> 02:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
specific to Forest Lake uh and would
 
02:18:03.589 --> 02:18:03.599 align:start position:0%
instead of that section about encourage
 
02:18:05.669 --> 02:18:05.679 align:start position:0%
you know various agencies to pursue all
 
02:18:08.870 --> 02:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
legal remedies uh instead would conclude
 
02:18:11.030 --> 02:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
resolved by the House of Representatives
 
02:18:12.549 --> 02:18:12.559 align:start position:0%
it is the position of the house that no
 
02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
landfill should be located in the
 
02:18:17.469 --> 02:18:17.479 align:start position:0%
vicinity of Forest Lake State Park so it
 
02:18:19.349 --> 02:18:19.359 align:start position:0%
it makes it much shorter it makes the
 
02:18:22.190 --> 02:18:22.200 align:start position:0%
whereases specific to Dalton and
 
02:18:25.190 --> 02:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
concludes with this is the statement of
 
02:18:27.990 --> 02:18:28.000 align:start position:0%
the house okay um but that amendment is
 
02:18:30.990 --> 02:18:31.000 align:start position:0%
not ready for uh it is not ready for
 
02:18:33.910 --> 02:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
today okay so then we um we will
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
probably have to exec that next week
 
02:18:40.509 --> 02:18:40.519 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah Representatives King yeah I
 
02:18:42.150 --> 02:18:42.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to say that this wasn't any
 
02:18:43.389 --> 02:18:43.399 align:start position:0%
this wasn't a bill that we worked on
 
02:18:45.349 --> 02:18:45.359 align:start position:0%
during the subcommittee oh I'm sorry I
 
02:18:46.750 --> 02:18:46.760 align:start position:0%

02:18:49.509 --> 02:18:49.519 align:start position:0%

02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
people of Dalton and the North country
 
02:19:17.629 --> 02:19:17.639 align:start position:0%
and the fact that Forest Lake is the
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
only public park in the North country
 
02:19:24.990 --> 02:19:25.000 align:start position:0%

you representative ktoa thank you madam
 
02:19:38.429 --> 02:19:38.439 align:start position:0%
chair um I'm just wondering if we'll
 
02:19:41.070 --> 02:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
have a chance to look at the amendment
 
02:19:43.870 --> 02:19:43.880 align:start position:0%
before we get to the exec session no we
 
02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
are going to exec that next week I'm
 
02:19:48.030 --> 02:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
going to recess it till next week right
 
02:19:53.910 --> 02:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:56.670 --> 02:19:56.680 align:start position:0%
around I sent around the language uh and
 
02:19:59.750 --> 02:19:59.760 align:start position:0%
so perhaps even today representative
 
02:20:01.630 --> 02:20:01.640 align:start position:0%
coma if if you have an opportunity to
 
02:20:02.990 --> 02:20:03.000 align:start position:0%
look at and just give me your feedback
 
02:20:04.750 --> 02:20:04.760 align:start position:0%
because I try to incorporate some of the
 
02:20:05.830 --> 02:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
things that I know that you were
 
02:20:08.110 --> 02:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
interested in into this change so before
 
02:20:11.030 --> 02:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
I send it to OSS if we could just have a
 
02:20:14.550 --> 02:20:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:14.560 --> 02:20:16.429 align:start position:0%
 
today

02:20:16.429 --> 02:20:16.439 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
okay so um we have an amendment
 
02:20:21.990 --> 02:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
forthcoming for that
 
02:20:24.790 --> 02:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
and uh it's not it is not going to be
 
02:20:27.630 --> 02:20:27.640 align:start position:0%
available for us for this week so hr13
 
02:20:29.670 --> 02:20:29.680 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
um the exec for that will be postponed
 
02:20:35.910 --> 02:20:35.920 align:start position:0%
or recessed for next week and that
 
02:20:37.190 --> 02:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
brings us
 
02:20:41.429 --> 02:20:41.439 align:start position:0%
to HB 179 which I
 
02:20:44.510 --> 02:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
believe represent ktoa thank you madam
 
02:20:47.710 --> 02:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
chair um representative Bixby just ran
 
02:20:49.710 --> 02:20:49.720 align:start position:0%
upstairs to get the amendment for this
 
02:20:51.670 --> 02:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:20:54.950 --> 02:20:54.960 align:start position:0%
we made some changes to it I think that
 
02:20:57.830 --> 02:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm hoping that we all can agree with
 
02:21:00.429 --> 02:21:00.439 align:start position:0%
and uh I would just like to wait for him
 
02:21:02.750 --> 02:21:02.760 align:start position:0%
to bring that Amendment
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we're gonna we're
 
02:21:07.190 --> 02:21:07.200 align:start position:0%
going to just kind of skip that until uh
 
02:21:08.790 --> 02:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby returns with the
 
02:21:11.469 --> 02:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
amendment that we can discuss uh and
 
02:21:13.710 --> 02:21:13.720 align:start position:0%
that leaves us with HB
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
171 establishing a moratorium on the
 
02:21:20.670 --> 02:21:20.680 align:start position:0%

02:21:44.070 --> 02:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
of tightening of language uh issues to
 
02:21:46.510 --> 02:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
to to make it more accurate for example
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
instead of saying fully permitted which
 
02:21:51.630 --> 02:21:51.640 align:start position:0%
is not a a useful term in this case is
 
02:21:53.870 --> 02:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
simply to say permitted we also are
 
02:21:56.550 --> 02:21:56.560 align:start position:0%
adding a notwithstanding Clause there is
 
02:21:58.550 --> 02:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
that part of RSA right now that says if
 
02:22:00.270 --> 02:22:00.280 align:start position:0%
a permit is not acted upon within a
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time it's approved so
 
02:22:04.550 --> 02:22:04.560 align:start position:0%
we had to add a notwithstanding clause
 
02:22:06.150 --> 02:22:06.160 align:start position:0%
and there were a couple of lines at the
 
02:22:08.389 --> 02:22:08.399 align:start position:0%
end that we struck out they were in
 
02:22:12.710 --> 02:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
reference to um a perennial body of
 
02:22:16.070 --> 02:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
water transversing the footprint of the
 
02:22:18.030 --> 02:22:18.040 align:start position:0%
uh of the proposed site and director
 
02:22:19.830 --> 02:22:19.840 align:start position:0%
whimet said well you know we would
 
02:22:22.190 --> 02:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
obviously never uh permit in that case
 
02:22:24.110 --> 02:22:24.120 align:start position:0%
so there's some unnecessary language
 
02:22:26.469 --> 02:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
being struck out that representative
 
02:22:28.670 --> 02:22:28.680 align:start position:0%
guber is going to submit the amendment
 
02:22:30.550 --> 02:22:30.560 align:start position:0%
and it will be ready for the committee
 
02:22:31.870 --> 02:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
to exact next
 
02:22:37.990 --> 02:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
week okay and that's the moratorium Bill
 
02:22:38.000 --> 02:22:40.389 align:start position:0%
week okay and that's the moratorium Bill
yes

02:22:40.389 --> 02:22:40.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:22:42.670 --> 02:22:42.680 align:start position:0%
okay so there'll be an amendment
 
02:22:45.150 --> 02:22:45.160 align:start position:0%
forthcoming for next
 
02:22:49.070 --> 02:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
week and we can discuss that in the work
 
02:22:52.790 --> 02:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
session all right great okay so we are
 
02:22:55.630 --> 02:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
back now with HB
 
02:22:58.950 --> 02:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
179 um representative Bixby would you
 
02:23:02.389 --> 02:23:02.399 align:start position:0%
like to explain how you came about with
 
02:23:07.710 --> 02:23:07.720 align:start position:0%
this amendment okay so um I think we uh
 
02:23:09.950 --> 02:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
in our work session last week we were in
 
02:23:11.670 --> 02:23:11.680 align:start position:0%
full agreement that something needed to
 
02:23:15.870 --> 02:23:15.880 align:start position:0%
be done uh and we also had some concerns
 
02:23:20.830 --> 02:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
with uh the um the way that the uh
 
02:23:23.070 --> 02:23:23.080 align:start position:0%
original bill and the the proposed
 
02:23:26.110 --> 02:23:26.120 align:start position:0%
amendment uh had been put together uh
 
02:23:29.150 --> 02:23:29.160 align:start position:0%
one of those concerns was that uh the
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
flat rate of $1,000 per day didn't give
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
the uh claimant any leeway for uh uh
 
02:23:42.309 --> 02:23:42.319 align:start position:0%
making for uh negotiating or um
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
providing encouragement to the um uh the
 
02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
uh responsible party um so uh by
 
02:23:53.590 --> 02:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
changing it to no greater than it means
 
02:23:58.190 --> 02:23:58.200 align:start position:0%
that the um the claimant has uh a fair
 
02:24:01.150 --> 02:24:01.160 align:start position:0%
amount of leeway in terms of uh what
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
they're going to how they're going to uh
 
02:24:08.150 --> 02:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
use that find as as encouragement um the
 
02:24:12.030 --> 02:24:12.040 align:start position:0%
uh other thing is that um if there if it
 
02:24:16.469 --> 02:24:16.479 align:start position:0%
was completely open-ended then uh then
 
02:24:18.670 --> 02:24:18.680 align:start position:0%
con conceivably the fines could pile up
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
to be many times the uh actual cost of
 
02:24:26.510 --> 02:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
the um of the damage as uh and which
 
02:24:30.750 --> 02:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
would be uh unreasonably punitive uh and
 
02:24:32.710 --> 02:24:32.720 align:start position:0%
if you say that the communal penalty
 
02:24:34.990 --> 02:24:35.000 align:start position:0%
can't be more than 100% of the cost of
 
02:24:40.469 --> 02:24:40.479 align:start position:0%
the uh of the damages then uh the
 
02:24:44.750 --> 02:24:44.760 align:start position:0%
responsible party would not be uh would
 
02:24:47.429 --> 02:24:47.439 align:start position:0%
have a maximum amount to pay of twice
 
02:24:49.070 --> 02:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
the amount of the damage they caused
 
02:24:52.030 --> 02:24:52.040 align:start position:0%
which is um pretty hefty amount
 
02:24:54.030 --> 02:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
especially since these are these cases
 
02:24:56.269 --> 02:24:56.279 align:start position:0%
are usually brought in the case where
 
02:25:00.190 --> 02:25:00.200 align:start position:0%
the original amount is substantial um so
 
02:25:01.349 --> 02:25:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh we thought that that would be a
 
02:25:04.910 --> 02:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
reasonable um stopping point for where
 
02:25:08.150 --> 02:25:08.160 align:start position:0%
the end where the penalties should uh
 
02:25:10.349 --> 02:25:10.359 align:start position:0%
should not increase Beyond and the other
 
02:25:12.670 --> 02:25:12.680 align:start position:0%
thing we wanted to make sure was that if
 
02:25:14.790 --> 02:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
there was if the claimant and the
 
02:25:18.110 --> 02:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
responsible party had a
 
02:25:21.150 --> 02:25:21.160 align:start position:0%
um an agreement so that the responsible
 
02:25:24.110 --> 02:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
party could pay that over time then as
 
02:25:26.510 --> 02:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
long as the responsible party was
 
02:25:29.110 --> 02:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
keeping up on their end of that uh
 
02:25:32.110 --> 02:25:32.120 align:start position:0%
bargain and paying consistently they
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
would not be subject to more penalties
 
02:25:37.830 --> 02:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
uh so we think that that's all um within
 
02:25:39.790 --> 02:25:39.800 align:start position:0%
the scope of
 
02:25:42.830 --> 02:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
using uh this penalty as a way of
 
02:25:45.110 --> 02:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
encouraging compliance rather than in
 
02:25:48.710 --> 02:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
terms of making it creating suffering so
 
02:25:51.030 --> 02:25:51.040 align:start position:0%
which is the way we want our we want
 
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
penalties to be encouragement for
 
02:25:55.230 --> 02:25:55.240 align:start position:0%
compliance we don't want them to be just
 
02:25:55.240 --> 02:25:56.870 align:start position:0%
compliance we don't want them to be just
retribution

02:25:56.870 --> 02:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
retribution
 
02:25:59.710 --> 02:25:59.720 align:start position:0%
right yeah question representative King
 
02:26:01.670 --> 02:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um my apologies if
 
02:26:02.870 --> 02:26:02.880 align:start position:0%
you already said this but have you
 
02:26:05.790 --> 02:26:05.800 align:start position:0%
discussed this with um representative P
 
02:26:08.110 --> 02:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
about about whether or not he was
 
02:26:12.230 --> 02:26:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:12.240 --> 02:26:14.230 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:26:14.230 --> 02:26:14.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:26:17.070 --> 02:26:17.080 align:start position:0%
okay all right uh so it looks like we
 
02:26:19.870 --> 02:26:19.880 align:start position:0%
have this amendment to consider um for
 
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
our exact session today and uh I'd also
 
02:26:27.630 --> 02:26:27.640 align:start position:0%
like to thank Representatives um Freeman
 
02:26:31.550 --> 02:26:31.560 align:start position:0%
and compa and uh Miner for helping to
 
02:26:34.389 --> 02:26:34.399 align:start position:0%
come up with this fairly neat resolution
 
02:26:36.870 --> 02:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah thank you to everybody who's
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
been working on all of these bills uh
 
02:26:41.269 --> 02:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of lot of stuff being
 
02:26:44.070 --> 02:26:44.080 align:start position:0%
thrown at us and um I really appreciate
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
all the time and effort and work that
 
02:26:47.550 --> 02:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's been putting into them
 
02:26:49.550 --> 02:26:49.560 align:start position:0%
because uh we do have some very
 
02:26:52.990 --> 02:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
important issues to deal with and um
 
02:26:54.750 --> 02:26:54.760 align:start position:0%
certainly the devil's in the details on
 
02:26:57.309 --> 02:26:57.319 align:start position:0%
many of them so thank you all for your
 
02:27:00.309 --> 02:27:00.319 align:start position:0%
your due diligence on um on putting
 
02:27:05.070 --> 02:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
together good and reasonable pieces of
 
02:27:08.469 --> 02:27:08.479 align:start position:0%
legislation um so with that does anybody
 
02:27:10.469 --> 02:27:10.479 align:start position:0%
have any other questions or comments
 
02:27:12.230 --> 02:27:12.240 align:start position:0%
regarding any of the bills that we've
 
02:27:15.670 --> 02:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
discussed or that are before
 
02:27:19.790 --> 02:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
us seeing none oh representative Penza
 
02:27:22.750 --> 02:27:22.760 align:start position:0%
um just a quick question about um this
 
02:27:25.670 --> 02:27:25.680 align:start position:0%
um HB 179 that you just talked about so
 
02:27:27.750 --> 02:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
is that on the is it on the calendar
 
02:27:31.750 --> 02:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
today or today for exec session at 114
 
02:27:31.760 --> 02:27:32.830 align:start position:0%
today or today for exec session at 114
what

02:27:32.830 --> 02:27:32.840 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
11:45 okay so we'll accept this
 
02:27:37.750 --> 02:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
amendment and okay perfect and by the
 
02:27:39.190 --> 02:27:39.200 align:start position:0%
way I just think this is fabulous
 
02:27:41.710 --> 02:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
because there was so much um there was a
 
02:27:43.429 --> 02:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
lot of discussion on this and this
 
02:27:46.190 --> 02:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
really seems like a wonderful balance so
 
02:27:49.349 --> 02:27:49.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for the work on that yep so um
 
02:27:51.469 --> 02:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
again we had three bills that we were
 
02:27:55.030 --> 02:27:55.040 align:start position:0%
going to exec between 11:45 and noon and
 
02:27:58.870 --> 02:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
hr13 will be recessed for next week so
 
02:28:01.469 --> 02:28:01.479 align:start position:0%
we actually will have we we will we are
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
planning on executing HB 179 HB 658 HB
 
02:28:08.269 --> 02:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
658 is an early bill so I'm glad to be
 
02:28:12.269 --> 02:28:12.279 align:start position:0%
getting that off our our plate um and I
 
02:28:17.309 --> 02:28:17.319 align:start position:0%
guess now we can um sort of recess for
 
02:28:21.790 --> 02:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
our our um a 15 minutes for our caucuses
 
02:28:26.030 --> 02:28:26.040 align:start position:0%
to uh discuss the two bills and um
 
02:28:27.790 --> 02:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps to talk about who's going to
 
02:28:32.469 --> 02:28:32.479 align:start position:0%
move what and yes so um I think um we
 
02:28:34.950 --> 02:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
caucused yesterday afternoon so we don't
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
I I don't think we need to discuss
 
02:28:40.950 --> 02:28:40.960 align:start position:0%
anything more so um my folks have 15
 
02:28:45.469 --> 02:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:48.670 --> 02:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
okay no rep uh that's the other thing I
 
02:28:50.469 --> 02:28:50.479 align:start position:0%
wanted to also say repres representative
 
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
Freeman is out sick today as is
 
02:28:55.389 --> 02:28:55.399 align:start position:0%
representative Kenny I don't know um I
 
02:28:57.269 --> 02:28:57.279 align:start position:0%
know representative wheeler was having
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
some car issues he emailed me I'm sure
 
02:29:03.030 --> 02:29:03.040 align:start position:0%
he emailed you as well so we have three
 
02:29:06.710 --> 02:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
people who are out um right now for uh
 
02:29:13.870 --> 02:29:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:19.269 --> 02:29:19.279 align:start position:0%
exac yeah yeah all right um well I don't
 
02:29:22.910 --> 02:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
know you know even if if everybody's
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
okay then I guess we don't even need to
 
02:29:29.230 --> 02:29:29.240 align:start position:0%
go into caucus but uh the the exec was
 
02:29:32.710 --> 02:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
advertised for 11:45 so we do have uh
 
02:29:36.550 --> 02:29:36.560 align:start position:0%
you know till 11:45 to kind of relax a
 
02:29:39.349 --> 02:29:39.359 align:start position:0%
little bit go for a bio break or a
 
02:29:41.070 --> 02:29:41.080 align:start position:0%
coffee or whatever and we'll see you
 
02:29:46.150 --> 02:29:46.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.950 --> 02:30:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:18.960 --> 02:30:48.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:30:48.910 --> 02:30:48.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:48.920 --> 02:31:18.910 align:start position:0%

speak to your motion uh thank you madam
 
02:44:48.670 --> 02:44:48.680 align:start position:0%
chair I think uh with the amendment it
 
02:44:50.670 --> 02:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
makes things
 
02:44:54.190 --> 02:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
um the penalty it brings it in line and
 
02:44:57.870 --> 02:44:57.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't make it um it's a workaround and
 
02:45:00.469 --> 02:45:00.479 align:start position:0%
it makes it's a reasonable Amendment uh
 
02:45:01.870 --> 02:45:01.880 align:start position:0%
so if you're going to pay a penalty you
 
02:45:03.910 --> 02:45:03.920 align:start position:0%
don't pay more than the bill it also
 
02:45:06.429 --> 02:45:06.439 align:start position:0%
sets up uh and hopefully if someone
 
02:45:08.190 --> 02:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
can't pay it all in full they can set a
 
02:45:10.990 --> 02:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
payment plan uh and therefore will not
 
02:45:13.469 --> 02:45:13.479 align:start position:0%
be charged a penalty I think it's a
 
02:45:13.479 --> 02:45:14.590 align:start position:0%
be charged a penalty I think it's a
reasonable

02:45:14.590 --> 02:45:14.600 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:45:17.070 --> 02:45:17.080 align:start position:0%

04:00:42.469 --> 04:00:42.479 align:start position:0%
hearing I'm going to open up the hearing
 
04:00:44.750 --> 04:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
for HB 279
 
04:00:46.870 --> 04:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study recipe
 
04:00:50.349 --> 04:00:50.359 align:start position:0%
and process approval for Homestead foods
 
04:00:52.990 --> 04:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
and to introduce the bill we have our
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
very own representative Peter Bixby good
 
04:00:58.070 --> 04:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
afternoon for the record for the record
 
04:01:00.229 --> 04:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
Peter Bixby straford
 
04:01:06.790 --> 04:01:06.800 align:start position:0%
13 uh and um so this bill is an act Comm
 
04:01:08.630 --> 04:01:08.640 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study recipe
 
04:01:10.910 --> 04:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
and process approval for Homestead
 
04:01:14.670 --> 04:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
Foods uh so last term we had uh a couple
 
04:01:17.630 --> 04:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
of bills that yeah can you CL closer to
 
04:01:20.469 --> 04:01:20.479 align:start position:0%
the mic oh yeah I'm sorry
 
04:01:24.149 --> 04:01:24.159 align:start position:0%
sorry last term we had there we
 
04:01:26.950 --> 04:01:26.960 align:start position:0%
go last ter we had a couple of bills
 
04:01:30.070 --> 04:01:30.080 align:start position:0%
that uh would have substantially
 
04:01:32.710 --> 04:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
reorganized the homestead food statutes
 
04:01:35.149 --> 04:01:35.159 align:start position:0%
and uh as a committee we didn't think
 
04:01:37.070 --> 04:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
that was really the way to deal with it
 
04:01:39.469 --> 04:01:39.479 align:start position:0%
so uh one of them we turned into a bill
 
04:01:43.229 --> 04:01:43.239 align:start position:0%
that simply uh authorized the uh
 
04:01:46.510 --> 04:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
production of uh pickles and relishes
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
Etc under uh the homestead food program
 
04:01:53.229 --> 04:01:53.239 align:start position:0%
uh and uh the other Bill we interim
 
04:01:55.870 --> 04:01:55.880 align:start position:0%
studied and in that interim study we met
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
with various stakeholders and uh the
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
division the um food protect food
 
04:02:04.710 --> 04:02:04.720 align:start position:0%
protective services from
 
04:02:08.269 --> 04:02:08.279 align:start position:0%
HHS and uh out of that came several
 
04:02:11.110 --> 04:02:11.120 align:start position:0%
bills of which this is
 
04:02:13.910 --> 04:02:13.920 align:start position:0%
one uh so the problem that this is
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
dealing with is uh if if you have a
 
04:02:23.149 --> 04:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
homestead food license and you uh then
 
04:02:24.830 --> 04:02:24.840 align:start position:0%
anything that you produce under that
 
04:02:27.429 --> 04:02:27.439 align:start position:0%
license that you sell needs to conform
 
04:02:29.469 --> 04:02:29.479 align:start position:0%
to an existing recipe that has already
 
04:02:32.349 --> 04:02:32.359 align:start position:0%
been tested and there is a database of
 
04:02:35.710 --> 04:02:35.720 align:start position:0%
such recipes that is available if you uh
 
04:02:39.189 --> 04:02:39.199 align:start position:0%
go to the um ha the food protective
 
04:02:40.910 --> 04:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
services website and you can link
 
04:02:43.269 --> 04:02:43.279 align:start position:0%
through those recipes one of the
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
challenges is that uh if you want to
 
04:02:49.950 --> 04:02:49.960 align:start position:0%
alter one of those recipes you need to
 
04:02:51.950 --> 04:02:51.960 align:start position:0%
have a
 
04:02:54.830 --> 04:02:54.840 align:start position:0%
um you need to have a process review
 
04:02:57.429 --> 04:02:57.439 align:start position:0%
done on the recipe and having that
 
04:02:59.950 --> 04:02:59.960 align:start position:0%
process review done can be rather
 
04:03:03.790 --> 04:03:03.800 align:start position:0%
expensive uh and
 
04:03:06.229 --> 04:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:03:09.750 --> 04:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
so uh let's
 
04:03:14.309 --> 04:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
see uh so one example would be
 
04:03:15.990 --> 04:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
04:03:18.870 --> 04:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
you uh I I I haven't memorized which
 
04:03:21.149 --> 04:03:21.159 align:start position:0%
ones are actually there or not but let's
 
04:03:24.710 --> 04:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
say that you are making uh crab apple
 
04:03:27.269 --> 04:03:27.279 align:start position:0%
crab apple jelly uh it is possible to
 
04:03:30.630 --> 04:03:30.640 align:start position:0%
make crab apple jelly either with a long
 
04:03:33.670 --> 04:03:33.680 align:start position:0%
boil method or by adding pectin both of
 
04:03:36.670 --> 04:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
the those recipes exist on the website
 
04:03:39.710 --> 04:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's a traditional um approach thing
 
04:03:41.469 --> 04:03:41.479 align:start position:0%
that one can do with crab apple jelly
 
04:03:43.910 --> 04:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
which is to add some sort of an herb to
 
04:03:48.510 --> 04:03:48.520 align:start position:0%
it that will scent it and uh not all
 
04:03:50.229 --> 04:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
herbs that you can do with this are
 
04:03:53.630 --> 04:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
listed as viable re viable recipe
 
04:03:55.510 --> 04:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
options so one might need to have
 
04:03:57.550 --> 04:03:57.560 align:start position:0%
process review to see if you could in
 
04:04:00.830 --> 04:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
fact uh scent your crab apple jelly with
 
04:04:05.269 --> 04:04:05.279 align:start position:0%
basil um now we know that basil that you
 
04:04:09.950 --> 04:04:09.960 align:start position:0%
know it if you are a home uh jelly maker
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
you know that there is no problem with
 
04:04:14.110 --> 04:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
senting your crab apple jelly with basil
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
is perfectly fine but it's not uh it's
 
04:04:19.110 --> 04:04:19.120 align:start position:0%
not clear that that would be allowable
 
04:04:23.269 --> 04:04:23.279 align:start position:0%
under existing rules uh and in some
 
04:04:26.389 --> 04:04:26.399 align:start position:0%
cases the uh food Protective Services
 
04:04:29.030 --> 04:04:29.040 align:start position:0%
will provide some sort of a waiver for
 
04:04:31.510 --> 04:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
minor variations and recipes if you
 
04:04:34.590 --> 04:04:34.600 align:start position:0%
consult them but the process for doing
 
04:04:36.830 --> 04:04:36.840 align:start position:0%
that is not entirely clear and it's not
 
04:04:41.550 --> 04:04:41.560 align:start position:0%
really laid out in rules uh so uh we
 
04:04:43.870 --> 04:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
need to figure out uh we we need to get
 
04:04:46.990 --> 04:04:47.000 align:start position:0%
a better sense of how the how this rule
 
04:04:49.269 --> 04:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
how the rules for this work how the you
 
04:04:51.790 --> 04:04:51.800 align:start position:0%
know where they are uh authorized in
 
04:04:56.670 --> 04:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
statute and also um what what makes
 
04:05:01.429 --> 04:05:01.439 align:start position:0%
sense in terms of providing leeway uh to
 
04:05:04.510 --> 04:05:04.520 align:start position:0%
recipe rules and process rules in such a
 
04:05:06.070 --> 04:05:06.080 align:start position:0%
way that you won't end up with someone
 
04:05:09.590 --> 04:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
saying well I can can uh tomatoes so why
 
04:05:12.070 --> 04:05:12.080 align:start position:0%
can't I can green beans which is a very
 
04:05:14.990 --> 04:05:15.000 align:start position:0%
different operation and if you can green
 
04:05:17.510 --> 04:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
beans the way you can tomatoes you may
 
04:05:20.389 --> 04:05:20.399 align:start position:0%
well be poisoning people so uh there is
 
04:05:23.389 --> 04:05:23.399 align:start position:0%
a reason for process review but uh there
 
04:05:25.830 --> 04:05:25.840 align:start position:0%
also needs to be uh some clarification
 
04:05:30.910 --> 04:05:30.920 align:start position:0%
about what the leeway is uh and just uh
 
04:05:33.349 --> 04:05:33.359 align:start position:0%
so the uh the the duties of the
 
04:05:35.750 --> 04:05:35.760 align:start position:0%
committee will be to uh look at the
 
04:05:38.030 --> 04:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
current requirements under statute and
 
04:05:42.550 --> 04:05:42.560 align:start position:0%
Rule uh and uh for processes and recipe
 
04:05:47.070 --> 04:05:47.080 align:start position:0%
review and and uh what the uh what the
 
04:05:48.870 --> 04:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
curent processes are for allowing
 
04:05:51.349 --> 04:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
alterations and potentially amend
 
04:05:55.630 --> 04:05:55.640 align:start position:0%
statute to um to make those
 
04:05:55.640 --> 04:05:57.550 align:start position:0%
statute to um to make those
clearer

04:05:57.550 --> 04:05:57.560 align:start position:0%
clearer
 
04:06:00.990 --> 04:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
okay question from representative
 
04:06:03.349 --> 04:06:03.359 align:start position:0%
King thank you madam chair and before
 
04:06:04.870 --> 04:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
you start representative H Haskins would
 
04:06:08.750 --> 04:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
you like to take your seat
 
04:06:12.229 --> 04:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
sure go ahead uh thank you for your
 
04:06:15.269 --> 04:06:15.279 align:start position:0%
testimony quick question you mentioned
 
04:06:17.910 --> 04:06:17.920 align:start position:0%
that in order to you know sell food as a
 
04:06:20.990 --> 04:06:21.000 align:start position:0%
licensed Homesteader you have to follow
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
a known recipe are you specifically
 
04:06:25.790 --> 04:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
talking about canning or all things like
 
04:06:28.269 --> 04:06:28.279 align:start position:0%
casseroles and Breads and everything all
 
04:06:30.790 --> 04:06:30.800 align:start position:0%
things okay thank you cuz your your um
 
04:06:33.269 --> 04:06:33.279 align:start position:0%
examples of uh jelly and green can and
 
04:06:34.670 --> 04:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
green beans I thought maybe this is just
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
narrow so right so uh that's that's just
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
kind of where my brain goes to when I
 
04:06:41.389 --> 04:06:41.399 align:start position:0%
think about Homestead production because
 
04:06:42.550 --> 04:06:42.560 align:start position:0%
I do that kind of thing I don't can
 
04:06:44.510 --> 04:06:44.520 align:start position:0%
green beans I I do can tomatoes and
 
04:06:45.590 --> 04:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
jellies okay thank you for the
 
04:06:48.389 --> 04:06:48.399 align:start position:0%
clarification representative kto thank
 
04:06:51.429 --> 04:06:51.439 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and um I want to thank
 
04:06:53.070 --> 04:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby for bringing this bill
 
04:06:56.189 --> 04:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
forth but I also wanted to um there is a
 
04:06:58.229 --> 04:06:58.239 align:start position:0%
difference between a homestead license
 
04:07:00.750 --> 04:07:00.760 align:start position:0%
and then being able to sell home home
 
04:07:04.149 --> 04:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
food without a license um but I believe
 
04:07:05.830 --> 04:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
do each have to go through a process
 
04:07:08.790 --> 04:07:08.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bixby process review so I
 
04:07:11.389 --> 04:07:11.399 align:start position:0%
believe that and this is my this is
 
04:07:12.670 --> 04:07:12.680 align:start position:0%
something we want to look we should
 
04:07:14.349 --> 04:07:14.359 align:start position:0%
probably look at but but I believe that
 
04:07:17.309 --> 04:07:17.319 align:start position:0%
at this point process is re not process
 
04:07:19.910 --> 04:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
review is not required if you don't have
 
04:07:22.149 --> 04:07:22.159 align:start position:0%
a homestead food license but is if you
 
04:07:25.429 --> 04:07:25.439 align:start position:0%
do have a homestead food license uh and
 
04:07:27.670 --> 04:07:27.680 align:start position:0%
the difference between food Protective
 
04:07:29.469 --> 04:07:29.479 align:start position:0%
Services I believe is here and they can
 
04:07:32.070 --> 04:07:32.080 align:start position:0%
speak to the the details of this but uh
 
04:07:34.990 --> 04:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
the licensing process for the homestead
 
04:07:37.389 --> 04:07:37.399 align:start position:0%
food license involves uh inspection and
 
04:07:40.189 --> 04:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
Advising of the processing area in your
 
04:07:42.269 --> 04:07:42.279 align:start position:0%
house okay thank you representative
 
04:07:42.279 --> 04:07:43.670 align:start position:0%
house okay thank you representative
sofikitis

04:07:43.670 --> 04:07:43.680 align:start position:0%
sofikitis
 
04:07:48.070 --> 04:07:48.080 align:start position:0%
soas I'm sorry thank you um I uh support
 
04:07:50.149 --> 04:07:50.159 align:start position:0%
this bill very much and I'm very glad
 
04:07:53.389 --> 04:07:53.399 align:start position:0%
you brought it Forward I it I think I
 
04:07:55.750 --> 04:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
think that it behooves us as a
 
04:07:59.070 --> 04:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee um to support farmtotable
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
initiatives and that our local farmers
 
04:08:06.670 --> 04:08:06.680 align:start position:0%
can um get another um stream of income
 
04:08:09.429 --> 04:08:09.439 align:start position:0%
for their farms and we can have food
 
04:08:12.469 --> 04:08:12.479 align:start position:0%
that is locally grown thank you okay
 
04:08:15.030 --> 04:08:15.040 align:start position:0%
well I guess um if that was a question I
 
04:08:15.710 --> 04:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
guess I
 
04:08:15.720 --> 04:08:19.670 align:start position:0%
guess I
[Laughter]

04:08:19.670 --> 04:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:08:24.030 --> 04:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
agree okay um so for me I you know I I
 
04:08:28.269 --> 04:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
think in this case um a committee really
 
04:08:30.349 --> 04:08:30.359 align:start position:0%
is warranted because you really have to
 
04:08:33.349 --> 04:08:33.359 align:start position:0%
take a deep dive into this I don't know
 
04:08:36.229 --> 04:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
that uh like putting it into the
 
04:08:39.149 --> 04:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
subcommittee to try and come up with
 
04:08:40.550 --> 04:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of
 
04:08:43.510 --> 04:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
legislation uh an amendment or whatever
 
04:08:59.870 --> 04:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:03.670 --> 04:09:03.680 align:start position:0%
think website how do I find um get into
 
04:09:07.149 --> 04:09:07.159 align:start position:0%
the testimony for each of the bills okay
 
04:09:07.159 --> 04:09:09.070 align:start position:0%
the testimony for each of the bills okay
okay

04:09:09.070 --> 04:09:09.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:09:11.389 --> 04:09:11.399 align:start position:0%

04:09:16.670 --> 04:09:16.680 align:start position:0%
question so again for the clerk uh we

okay I'm going to open up the exec

session for hb34 relative to labeling
 
04:26:07.429 --> 04:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
requirements for food produced in
 
04:26:10.469 --> 04:26:10.479 align:start position:0%
Homestead kitchens and here to introduce
 
04:26:12.870 --> 04:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
this bill is representative
 
04:26:15.750 --> 04:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby our sponsor thank you madam chair
 
04:26:18.229 --> 04:26:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh for the record Peter Bixby straford
 
04:26:22.309 --> 04:26:22.319 align:start position:0%
13 uh do and
 
04:26:24.910 --> 04:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:26:27.590 --> 04:26:27.600 align:start position:0%
uh just as with the previous bill this
 
04:26:31.030 --> 04:26:31.040 align:start position:0%
one came out of um some a couple bills
 
04:26:34.550 --> 04:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
that we had last term that uh would have
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
substantially rearranged the home
 
04:26:39.550 --> 04:26:39.560 align:start position:0%
Homestead food statutes and this is uh
 
04:26:43.030 --> 04:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of discussions uh uh
 
04:26:46.429 --> 04:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
with uh in our um interim
 
04:26:46.439 --> 04:26:47.950 align:start position:0%
with uh in our um interim
study

04:26:47.950 --> 04:26:47.960 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:26:50.309 --> 04:26:50.319 align:start position:0%
and uh there were a couple of concerns
 
04:26:52.950 --> 04:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
that were raised in terms of labeling uh
 
04:26:55.910 --> 04:26:55.920 align:start position:0%
one was that uh current statute requires
 
04:26:57.710 --> 04:26:57.720 align:start position:0%
an address but it wasn't clear whether
 
04:26:59.630 --> 04:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
that had to be a physical address or an
 
04:27:03.670 --> 04:27:03.680 align:start position:0%
email address and uh for some producers
 
04:27:05.510 --> 04:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
putting down a physical address could
 
04:27:09.349 --> 04:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
create security concerns uh because you
 
04:27:11.109 --> 04:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
don't NE if you're selling at at a
 
04:27:13.950 --> 04:27:13.960 align:start position:0%
farmer's market uh you don't necessarily
 
04:27:16.670 --> 04:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
want uh anybody who happens by to be
 
04:27:19.229 --> 04:27:19.239 align:start position:0%
able to say oh that person lives at such
 
04:27:20.990 --> 04:27:21.000 align:start position:0%
and such a dress maybe I'll give her a
 
04:27:24.630 --> 04:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
visit uh and uh in in a way that
 
04:27:28.830 --> 04:27:28.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be necessarily helpful uh so uh
 
04:27:31.070 --> 04:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
the possibility of using an email
 
04:27:34.630 --> 04:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
address uh allows for better security
 
04:27:39.030 --> 04:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
for those who wish it uh
 
04:27:41.710 --> 04:27:41.720 align:start position:0%
so uh one of the things that this bill
 
04:27:44.790 --> 04:27:44.800 align:start position:0%
does is IT addresses that um and
 
04:27:47.469 --> 04:27:47.479 align:start position:0%
clarifies what what a dress means for
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
the for that purpose uh the other issue
 
04:27:53.630 --> 04:27:53.640 align:start position:0%
that was raised was that uh if you are
 
04:27:56.910 --> 04:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
selling uh uh and this is this is
 
04:27:58.510 --> 04:27:58.520 align:start position:0%
specifically for people who are selling
 
04:28:00.870 --> 04:28:00.880 align:start position:0%
from their home or from a farm stand on
 
04:28:04.590 --> 04:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
their own property uh one of the things
 
04:28:07.349 --> 04:28:07.359 align:start position:0%
that some people like to do is uh make
 
04:28:09.790 --> 04:28:09.800 align:start position:0%
sure that their ingredients are really
 
04:28:14.750 --> 04:28:14.760 align:start position:0%
what is the most seasonal um uh and uh
 
04:28:17.750 --> 04:28:17.760 align:start position:0%
so this would uh sometimes involve
 
04:28:21.189 --> 04:28:21.199 align:start position:0%
changing the ingredients uh on what
 
04:28:23.189 --> 04:28:23.199 align:start position:0%
you're selling at your farm stand or at
 
04:28:27.149 --> 04:28:27.159 align:start position:0%
your home uh maybe every week maybe even
 
04:28:29.030 --> 04:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
more frequently depending on what is
 
04:28:31.429 --> 04:28:31.439 align:start position:0%
coming on uh in your garden that you
 
04:28:33.070 --> 04:28:33.080 align:start position:0%
might want to be including in what
 
04:28:37.630 --> 04:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
you're selling uh and that rapid for a
 
04:28:39.870 --> 04:28:39.880 align:start position:0%
small operation like that that rapid
 
04:28:42.990 --> 04:28:43.000 align:start position:0%
change of labeling uh can be really
 
04:28:45.109 --> 04:28:45.119 align:start position:0%
onerous uh because you'd have to be
 
04:28:47.590 --> 04:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
creating new labels like every day or
 
04:28:51.269 --> 04:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
every week um and uh for a relatively
 
04:28:55.550 --> 04:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
small total volume of product uh so uh
 
04:28:58.229 --> 04:28:58.239 align:start position:0%
the suggestion was made that for in that
 
04:29:01.229 --> 04:29:01.239 align:start position:0%
situation uh maybe the full list of
 
04:29:03.550 --> 04:29:03.560 align:start position:0%
ingredients could be done with a QR code
 
04:29:07.469 --> 04:29:07.479 align:start position:0%
that links to a website and as the uh
 
04:29:10.109 --> 04:29:10.119 align:start position:0%
ingredients change the QR code would
 
04:29:12.469 --> 04:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
remain the same but the the ingredients
 
04:29:15.830 --> 04:29:15.840 align:start position:0%
listed on the website could change as uh
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
as the daily changes in the recipe
 
04:29:22.109 --> 04:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
happen uh this would only be available
 
04:29:24.189 --> 04:29:24.199 align:start position:0%
to people who are selling at out of
 
04:29:26.389 --> 04:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
their home or from a Farm Stand if
 
04:29:29.070 --> 04:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
you're selling at a place where someone
 
04:29:31.229 --> 04:29:31.239 align:start position:0%
is going to not have a chance to talk
 
04:29:33.670 --> 04:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
with you about what's in it uh and that
 
04:29:37.229 --> 04:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
sort of thing uh or is might might be
 
04:29:40.030 --> 04:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
likely to just you know um you pay their
 
04:29:42.990 --> 04:29:43.000 align:start position:0%
money and pick it up and go uh such as a
 
04:29:45.149 --> 04:29:45.159 align:start position:0%
retail establishment or even a Farm's
 
04:29:47.790 --> 04:29:47.800 align:start position:0%
Market uh or certainly if it's on the
 
04:29:50.630 --> 04:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
being sold over the internet then that
 
04:29:52.990 --> 04:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
full need full list of ingredients needs
 
04:29:55.710 --> 04:29:55.720 align:start position:0%
to be on it but uh what this bill does
 
04:29:58.550 --> 04:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
is it just changes what needs to be on
 
04:30:01.590 --> 04:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh what can be used with a QR code from
 
04:30:05.870 --> 04:30:05.880 align:start position:0%
a home food from a home uh setting or a
 
04:30:08.750 --> 04:30:08.760 align:start position:0%
um a homebased uh food
 
04:30:12.790 --> 04:30:12.800 align:start position:0%
stand Farm Stand okay any questions from
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
the committee oh oh I'm sorry I I I I
 
04:30:17.750 --> 04:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
just forgot there there's a second there
 
04:30:19.550 --> 04:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
there there is another section of the
 
04:30:21.349 --> 04:30:21.359 align:start position:0%
bill so that's that's a section that
 
04:30:26.030 --> 04:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
deals with uh CH making real changes to
 
04:30:29.870 --> 04:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
law uh what the um sections 2 three and
 
04:30:32.870 --> 04:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
four deal with fixing things that should
 
04:30:36.109 --> 04:30:36.119 align:start position:0%
have been done diff been done
 
04:30:37.910 --> 04:30:37.920 align:start position:0%
differently in the past but needed to be
 
04:30:40.349 --> 04:30:40.359 align:start position:0%
fixed so
 
04:30:45.630 --> 04:30:45.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:49.670 --> 04:30:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh so section two corrects a faulty LIC
 
04:30:52.830 --> 04:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh faulty reference in the licensing
 
04:30:58.510 --> 04:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
statute uh where the uh essentially in
 
04:31:00.630 --> 04:31:00.640 align:start position:0%
current in statute as it stands right
 
04:31:03.149 --> 04:31:03.159 align:start position:0%
now the licensing requirement that's
 
04:31:05.469 --> 04:31:05.479 align:start position:0%
referenced under Homestead food
 
04:31:08.269 --> 04:31:08.279 align:start position:0%
licensing is actually a full Food
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
Service establishment license and I
 
04:31:13.910 --> 04:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
noticed that that faulty reference as I
 
04:31:16.710 --> 04:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
was you know working on this bill and I
 
04:31:18.990 --> 04:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
brought that up and uh food Protective
 
04:31:21.229 --> 04:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
Services said just you know put that
 
04:31:22.790 --> 04:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
into this bill because this is a
 
04:31:25.309 --> 04:31:25.319 align:start position:0%
non-controversial bill and we just need
 
04:31:28.109 --> 04:31:28.119 align:start position:0%
to fix that so this now makes a
 
04:31:29.830 --> 04:31:29.840 align:start position:0%
reference to the correct definition
 
04:31:32.309 --> 04:31:32.319 align:start position:0%
under Homestead food license as opposed
 
04:31:35.910 --> 04:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
to full full service food license uh
 
04:31:38.790 --> 04:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
sections three and four uh correct some
 
04:31:41.870 --> 04:31:41.880 align:start position:0%
up correct some rsas that weren't up
 
04:31:45.149 --> 04:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
updated when we when we remove the cap
 
04:31:48.710 --> 04:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
from uh the total amount you could earn
 
04:31:52.349 --> 04:31:52.359 align:start position:0%
from uh an unlicensed Homestead food
 
04:31:55.109 --> 04:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
operation so it still makes reference to
 
04:31:58.830 --> 04:31:58.840 align:start position:0%
that cap uh and uh that cap no longer
 
04:32:01.670 --> 04:32:01.680 align:start position:0%
exists so this basically removes those
 
04:32:01.680 --> 04:32:03.630 align:start position:0%
exists so this basically removes those
references

04:32:03.630 --> 04:32:03.640 align:start position:0%
references
 
04:32:06.189 --> 04:32:06.199 align:start position:0%
okay and I'm happy to happy to take to
 
04:32:08.630 --> 04:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
take any questions now well thank you
 
04:32:12.030 --> 04:32:12.040 align:start position:0%
for doing the um housekeeping part of
 
04:32:14.750 --> 04:32:14.760 align:start position:0%
this this was uh really helpful that we
 
04:32:15.830 --> 04:32:15.840 align:start position:0%
have this
 
04:32:18.710 --> 04:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
and um when you were when you were going
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
through the uh statute
 
04:32:24.109 --> 04:32:24.119 align:start position:0%
um that's when you noticed that these
 
04:32:26.349 --> 04:32:26.359 align:start position:0%
needed to be fixed or was that brought
 
04:32:28.309 --> 04:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
to your attention I I was going through
 
04:32:30.030 --> 04:32:30.040 align:start position:0%
the statute and trying to figure out how
 
04:32:32.030 --> 04:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
to rewrite things and I saw references
 
04:32:35.030 --> 04:32:35.040 align:start position:0%
to things that didn't ex shouldn't exist
 
04:32:39.590 --> 04:32:39.600 align:start position:0%
anymore so um okay good thank you
 
04:32:42.630 --> 04:32:42.640 align:start position:0%
Representatives um group group
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you chair uh thank you
 
04:32:48.870 --> 04:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
representative FP um I'm all very
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
supportive of anything that supports our
 
04:32:54.269 --> 04:32:54.279 align:start position:0%
local food efforts and and helping it
 
04:32:56.469 --> 04:32:56.479 align:start position:0%
get out in the public um but I have a
 
04:33:00.229 --> 04:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
question on licensing on the last uh
 
04:33:02.229 --> 04:33:02.239 align:start position:0%
three lines this licensing requirements
 
04:33:06.230 --> 04:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
for a homestead um you remove the um
 
04:33:08.709 --> 04:33:08.719 align:start position:0%
exceeding so much in sales so let's say
 
04:33:10.949 --> 04:33:10.959 align:start position:0%
I bake some Breads and I want take it to
 
04:33:13.109 --> 04:33:13.119 align:start position:0%
my local market to sell a dozen loow of
 
04:33:15.590 --> 04:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
breads I would have to get a license now
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
to do
 
04:33:21.390 --> 04:33:21.400 align:start position:0%
that uh so not
 
04:33:27.029 --> 04:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
um so the uh so essentially what that so
 
04:33:31.230 --> 04:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
um under current law I most of that most
 
04:33:34.429 --> 04:33:34.439 align:start position:0%
of that CH that paragraph is current law
 
04:33:34.439 --> 04:33:36.869 align:start position:0%
of that CH that paragraph is current law
so

04:33:36.869 --> 04:33:36.879 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:33:39.789 --> 04:33:39.799 align:start position:0%
um well exceeding the gross my question
 
04:33:41.429 --> 04:33:41.439 align:start position:0%
is exceeding the gross that is there a
 
04:33:43.189 --> 04:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
limit right now in current law on how
 
04:33:44.349 --> 04:33:44.359 align:start position:0%
much you have to make before you have to
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
get a license or is it no so so the
 
04:33:49.109 --> 04:33:49.119 align:start position:0%
current what current law limits is where
 
04:33:53.029 --> 04:33:53.039 align:start position:0%
you can sell it okay so uh under current
 
04:33:55.551 --> 04:33:55.561 align:start position:0%
law if you are making Homestead Foods in
 
04:33:56.629 --> 04:33:56.639 align:start position:0%
an un
 
04:33:59.189 --> 04:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
unlicensed without a license you are
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell your um your jams and
 
04:34:05.269 --> 04:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
jellies and Breads and whatever at you
 
04:34:08.349 --> 04:34:08.359 align:start position:0%
know from your home from a farm stand at
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
the farmers market but you are not
 
04:34:12.629 --> 04:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
allowed to sell them
 
04:34:17.150 --> 04:34:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh through another through a retail food
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
establishment or over the Internet or by
 
04:34:21.910 --> 04:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
mail order or to
 
04:34:25.470 --> 04:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
wholesalers uh so if you want to sell to
 
04:34:29.551 --> 04:34:29.561 align:start position:0%
um uh restaurants to food EST to um
 
04:34:31.869 --> 04:34:31.879 align:start position:0%
retail food establishments over the
 
04:34:33.949 --> 04:34:33.959 align:start position:0%
Internet by mail order or to
 
04:34:36.949 --> 04:34:36.959 align:start position:0%
wholesalers you need to have a license
 
04:34:40.310 --> 04:34:40.320 align:start position:0%
okay uh but if you but but not if you're
 
04:34:42.830 --> 04:34:42.840 align:start position:0%
selling at a farmer's market or at your
 
04:34:44.670 --> 04:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
house at your house or at a food stand
 
04:34:46.869 --> 04:34:46.879 align:start position:0%
oh that that's how it is right now right
 
04:34:48.949 --> 04:34:48.959 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it is right now and
 
04:34:48.959 --> 04:34:50.189 align:start position:0%
that's that's how it is right now and
what

04:34:50.189 --> 04:34:50.199 align:start position:0%
what
 
04:34:54.551 --> 04:34:54.561 align:start position:0%
this the point of this being in the bill
 
04:34:58.869 --> 04:34:58.879 align:start position:0%
is that we used to have a cap about how
 
04:35:01.629 --> 04:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
much you could sell every year so that
 
04:35:04.029 --> 04:35:04.039 align:start position:0%
cap started out I think
 
04:35:04.039 --> 04:35:05.670 align:start position:0%
cap started out I think
at

04:35:05.670 --> 04:35:05.680 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:35:08.429 --> 04:35:08.439 align:start position:0%
um I know I think I think it started out
 
04:35:08.439 --> 04:35:09.470 align:start position:0%
um I know I think I think it started out
as

04:35:09.470 --> 04:35:09.480 align:start position:0%
as
 
04:35:12.470 --> 04:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
2500 uh before I was in the legislature
 
04:35:14.830 --> 04:35:14.840 align:start position:0%
and then in my first year we moved it up
 
04:35:17.789 --> 04:35:17.799 align:start position:0%
to 5,000 and then we moved it up to I
 
04:35:20.789 --> 04:35:20.799 align:start position:0%
think 10,000 and then up to 30,000 and
 
04:35:22.429 --> 04:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
then there was a bill last term to move
 
04:35:23.470 --> 04:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
it up to
 
04:35:27.551 --> 04:35:27.561 align:start position:0%
50,000 and uh we unanimously said this
 
04:35:30.830 --> 04:35:30.840 align:start position:0%
is silly we should just remove the cap
 
04:35:36.070 --> 04:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
so so we did but uh when o OLS was
 
04:35:38.109 --> 04:35:38.119 align:start position:0%
producing the bill they missed a few
 
04:35:40.349 --> 04:35:40.359 align:start position:0%
references so what this what I'm doing
 
04:35:42.590 --> 04:35:42.600 align:start position:0%
in this bill is cleaning up the
 
04:35:45.670 --> 04:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:48.510 --> 04:35:48.520 align:start position:0%
before okay so that's what the strikeout
 
04:35:51.510 --> 04:35:51.520 align:start position:0%
is doing online 16 thanks very much
 
04:35:53.709 --> 04:35:53.719 align:start position:0%
trying to figure it all out
 
04:35:53.719 --> 04:35:54.949 align:start position:0%
trying to figure it all out
representative

04:35:54.949 --> 04:35:54.959 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:35:57.150 --> 04:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
germana thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:35:59.269 --> 04:35:59.279 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so this is just a
 
04:36:01.990 --> 04:36:02.000 align:start position:0%
clarifying question it had to it's uh
 
04:36:04.830 --> 04:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
starting at page one uh
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
line8 and that's that section 8 through
 
04:36:10.070 --> 04:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
13 which includes the QR code and as I
 
04:36:11.990 --> 04:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
said this is just for clarification so
 
04:36:14.429 --> 04:36:14.439 align:start position:0%
in this case it would have a QR code but
 
04:36:16.750 --> 04:36:16.760 align:start position:0%
the physical sign so that would be if
 
04:36:18.189 --> 04:36:18.199 align:start position:0%
you're purchasing the product right
 
04:36:21.109 --> 04:36:21.119 align:start position:0%
there in the store and you have allergy
 
04:36:23.551 --> 04:36:23.561 align:start position:0%
whatever right that the information is
 
04:36:25.551 --> 04:36:25.561 align:start position:0%
there but it is also
 
04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
available you know if you gave it to
 
04:36:29.429 --> 04:36:29.439 align:start position:0%
somebody they could scan the QR code and
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
find so it's it's duplicated for so it's
 
04:36:36.269 --> 04:36:36.279 align:start position:0%
duplicated so so uh if you're and and
 
04:36:37.910 --> 04:36:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is only if you're selling it at
 
04:36:40.269 --> 04:36:40.279 align:start position:0%
your home or at a farm stand on your
 
04:36:42.029 --> 04:36:42.039 align:start position:0%
property so
 
04:36:45.150 --> 04:36:45.160 align:start position:0%
um and so you have the list of
 
04:36:47.189 --> 04:36:47.199 align:start position:0%
ingredients physically there in front of
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
you and you have a QR code on the
 
04:36:52.070 --> 04:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
product and if there's anything any if
 
04:36:54.470 --> 04:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
there are any issues with allergies that
 
04:36:56.869 --> 04:36:56.879 align:start position:0%
has to be explicitly on the product it's
 
04:36:59.510 --> 04:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
not on the it can't just be on the QR
 
04:37:01.629 --> 04:37:01.639 align:start position:0%
code thank you I just wanted a little
 
04:37:03.189 --> 04:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
clarification and I'm glad it's
 
04:37:05.349 --> 04:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
duplicative for a reason but I just
 
04:37:07.029 --> 04:37:07.039 align:start position:0%
wanted the clarification thank you
 
04:37:08.949 --> 04:37:08.959 align:start position:0%
you're welcome any other questions from
 
04:37:08.959 --> 04:37:10.230 align:start position:0%
you're welcome any other questions from
the

04:37:10.230 --> 04:37:10.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:37:13.349 --> 04:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
committee see none thank you for
 
04:37:15.869 --> 04:37:15.879 align:start position:0%
introducing this bill to us thank you
 
04:37:17.349 --> 04:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
and I now
 
04:37:23.910 --> 04:37:23.920 align:start position:0%

hi we need you to be up at the
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
microphone introduce yourself tell us
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
where you're
 
04:37:36.670 --> 04:37:36.680 align:start position:0%
from uh my name is Addie leader zavos um
 
04:37:38.109 --> 04:37:38.119 align:start position:0%
I live in Dunbarton New Hampshire with
 
04:37:40.470 --> 04:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
my husband uh we have a small Market
 
04:37:43.789 --> 04:37:43.799 align:start position:0%
farm and a farm store where we sell
 
04:37:47.429 --> 04:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
Artisan baked goods um I also am the
 
04:37:50.310 --> 04:37:50.320 align:start position:0%
administrator for a discussion group for
 
04:37:52.310 --> 04:37:52.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire homebased food producers
 
04:37:56.189 --> 04:37:56.199 align:start position:0%
that has about 300 members um we're
 
04:37:57.910 --> 04:37:57.920 align:start position:0%
really excited about this bill and I
 
04:38:01.189 --> 04:38:01.199 align:start position:0%
brought a show and tell to explain
 
04:38:04.310 --> 04:38:04.320 align:start position:0%
why if you produce
 
04:38:07.510 --> 04:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
items every week that have blueberries
 
04:38:09.189 --> 04:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
and then they have peaches and then they
 
04:38:10.869 --> 04:38:10.879 align:start position:0%
have raspberries and then you know
 
04:38:12.349 --> 04:38:12.359 align:start position:0%
earlier you had rhubarb and then you're
 
04:38:15.070 --> 04:38:15.080 align:start position:0%
going into cranberries you have a lot of
 
04:38:17.830 --> 04:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
labels it's like a lot we sell five
 
04:38:20.349 --> 04:38:20.359 align:start position:0%
items in our store we have a handpie we
 
04:38:24.709 --> 04:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
have a muffin we have um sticky
 
04:38:27.551 --> 04:38:27.561 align:start position:0%
buns cornbread I need you to speak into
 
04:38:29.869 --> 04:38:29.879 align:start position:0%
the microphone cornbread um and one
 
04:38:32.830 --> 04:38:32.840 align:start position:0%
other thing and then bread um but
 
04:38:34.750 --> 04:38:34.760 align:start position:0%
because we rotate our ingredients
 
04:38:37.470 --> 04:38:37.480 align:start position:0%
seasonally we have hundreds and hundreds
 
04:38:40.629 --> 04:38:40.639 align:start position:0%
and hundreds of labels it is too much I
 
04:38:42.189 --> 04:38:42.199 align:start position:0%
don't know if any of you have ever had a
 
04:38:44.429 --> 04:38:44.439 align:start position:0%
screaming fight with your printer when
 
04:38:47.349 --> 04:38:47.359 align:start position:0%
you are under pressure but it is not fun
 
04:38:49.230 --> 04:38:49.240 align:start position:0%
and it is a huge barrier to being able
 
04:38:52.551 --> 04:38:52.561 align:start position:0%
to do business efficiently so the idea
 
04:38:54.629 --> 04:38:54.639 align:start position:0%
behind this bill was let's make it easy
 
04:38:56.910 --> 04:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
instead of having a rhubarb label a
 
04:38:59.869 --> 04:38:59.879 align:start position:0%
blueberry label it every single label
 
04:39:02.830 --> 04:39:02.840 align:start position:0%
under the planet let me have one label
 
04:39:04.670 --> 04:39:04.680 align:start position:0%
and then I can put on my website oh this
 
04:39:07.590 --> 04:39:07.600 align:start position:0%
week it's you know it's the same exact
 
04:39:09.349 --> 04:39:09.359 align:start position:0%
ingredients except we changed the
 
04:39:12.390 --> 04:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
berry it would make it so much easier
 
04:39:14.789 --> 04:39:14.799 align:start position:0%
and it is such a small thing that really
 
04:39:17.590 --> 04:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't affect consumers in any way
 
04:39:18.949 --> 04:39:18.959 align:start position:0%
first of all they barely ever look at
 
04:39:20.670 --> 04:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
the label secondly if they have an
 
04:39:23.629 --> 04:39:23.639 align:start position:0%
allergy they ask you about it uh thirdly
 
04:39:26.189 --> 04:39:26.199 align:start position:0%
this bill keeps the allergy information
 
04:39:29.551 --> 04:39:29.561 align:start position:0%
on the label um and most New Hampshire
 
04:39:33.150 --> 04:39:33.160 align:start position:0%
IES 93% have internet access at home so
 
04:39:34.830 --> 04:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
even if they miss the opportunity for
 
04:39:36.750 --> 04:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
some reason to ask you because they
 
04:39:39.110 --> 04:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
forgot that their grandkid has a nut
 
04:39:41.788 --> 04:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
allergy it's still on the label and they
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
can still look it up so it's a really
 
04:39:45.788 --> 04:39:45.798 align:start position:0%
simple change that would make such a
 
04:39:48.868 --> 04:39:48.878 align:start position:0%
huge difference for so many people um
 
04:39:50.750 --> 04:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
and it's not just People Like Us who use
 
04:39:52.430 --> 04:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
seasonal ingredients although that is a
 
04:39:55.670 --> 04:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
big focus is making it easier to use New
 
04:39:58.628 --> 04:39:58.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's wonderful produce um it's
 
04:40:01.190 --> 04:40:01.200 align:start position:0%
also people who have like 20 types of
 
04:40:03.628 --> 04:40:03.638 align:start position:0%
cupcakes and you order your cupcakes
 
04:40:04.868 --> 04:40:04.878 align:start position:0%
from them and decide on your three
 
04:40:07.670 --> 04:40:07.680 align:start position:0%
flavors that you want in a box right now
 
04:40:09.190 --> 04:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
to be able to sell that they have to
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
have a label every time a different lab
 
04:40:12.990 --> 04:40:13.000 align:start position:0%
label every time they sell a custom
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
product that's crazy you can't run a
 
04:40:16.788 --> 04:40:16.798 align:start position:0%
business like that and so we're just
 
04:40:19.270 --> 04:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
asking to have a little bit of
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
simplification so we can stop carrying
 
04:40:23.750 --> 04:40:23.760 align:start position:0%
like all these things around and like
 
04:40:25.350 --> 04:40:25.360 align:start position:0%
all of our labels don't even fit into
 
04:40:26.708 --> 04:40:26.718 align:start position:0%
this because it doesn't include the
 
04:40:29.270 --> 04:40:29.280 align:start position:0%
holiday stuff so it's just to simplify
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
things a little bit in a way that is
 
04:40:33.390 --> 04:40:33.400 align:start position:0%
safe for consumers but also makes sense
 
04:40:35.750 --> 04:40:35.760 align:start position:0%
for us as producers um and gives an
 
04:40:38.270 --> 04:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
opportunity to New Hampshire Farmers to
 
04:40:40.030 --> 04:40:40.040 align:start position:0%
like participate more in this part of
 
04:40:42.070 --> 04:40:42.080 align:start position:0%
the economy
 
04:40:44.628 --> 04:40:44.638 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you yes how much
 
04:40:47.868 --> 04:40:47.878 align:start position:0%
money do you believe this would save our
 
04:40:54.350 --> 04:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
uh Farm producers in oh my God a lot um
 
04:40:56.590 --> 04:40:56.600 align:start position:0%
so I will say that the difference
 
04:40:59.310 --> 04:40:59.320 align:start position:0%
between I have like four type four label
 
04:41:01.430 --> 04:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
sizes that I use so just the direct
 
04:41:04.430 --> 04:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
costs of the label size would go from
 
04:41:07.628 --> 04:41:07.638 align:start position:0%
each item being maybe like 7 to 9 cents
 
04:41:10.830 --> 04:41:10.840 align:start position:0%
on label cost to each item being 2 to
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
three cents
 
04:41:13.830 --> 04:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
um which might not sound like a lot to
 
04:41:16.070 --> 04:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
some people but when you are making
 
04:41:17.550 --> 04:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
muffins and you're selling a muffin at a
 
04:41:19.350 --> 04:41:19.360 align:start position:0%
time it's kind of a big deal it starts
 
04:41:22.350 --> 04:41:22.360 align:start position:0%
adding up um the other issue is waste so
 
04:41:25.270 --> 04:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
if I have blueberry muffins and I don't
 
04:41:27.868 --> 04:41:27.878 align:start position:0%
sell an even amount like I don't sell 30
 
04:41:30.550 --> 04:41:30.560 align:start position:0%
blueberry muffins I sell 25 well then I
 
04:41:32.708 --> 04:41:32.718 align:start position:0%
have a whole half sheet of labels that I
 
04:41:35.030 --> 04:41:35.040 align:start position:0%
can't use and that go in the trash and
 
04:41:38.150 --> 04:41:38.160 align:start position:0%
that's like that adds up as well um and
 
04:41:40.750 --> 04:41:40.760 align:start position:0%
then you just factor in the time so I
 
04:41:44.788 --> 04:41:44.798 align:start position:0%
spend hours and hours and
 
04:41:47.990 --> 04:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
hours correcting the labels changing the
 
04:41:49.430 --> 04:41:49.440 align:start position:0%
labels first I have to do it in
 
04:41:51.430 --> 04:41:51.440 align:start position:0%
Photoshop then I have to export it to
 
04:41:53.670 --> 04:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
word then I have to print it then the
 
04:41:55.550 --> 04:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
printer jams then I have to run the like
 
04:41:58.708 --> 04:41:58.718 align:start position:0%
cleaning the nozzle head on the printer
 
04:42:01.030 --> 04:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
it would save me
 
04:42:04.750 --> 04:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
personally three hours a week um and if
 
04:42:06.750 --> 04:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
you kind of extrapolate that to all
 
04:42:08.470 --> 04:42:08.480 align:start position:0%
different producers that's a huge amount
 
04:42:10.070 --> 04:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
of Labor and it for some people
 
04:42:12.030 --> 04:42:12.040 align:start position:0%
especially people with kids which is a
 
04:42:14.590 --> 04:42:14.600 align:start position:0%
huge number of homebased food producers
 
04:42:17.510 --> 04:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
as women with children that can be the
 
04:42:19.270 --> 04:42:19.280 align:start position:0%
difference between being able to
 
04:42:21.390 --> 04:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
actually run a viable business and not
 
04:42:23.030 --> 04:42:23.040 align:start position:0%
being able to run a viable business
 
04:42:25.190 --> 04:42:25.200 align:start position:0%
because it just gets too frustrating to
 
04:42:28.190 --> 04:42:28.200 align:start position:0%
deal with all this like label paperwork
 
04:42:29.910 --> 04:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
which is not even necessary and the
 
04:42:32.750 --> 04:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
consumers don't even care about so
 
04:42:35.270 --> 04:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
04:42:37.070 --> 04:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking questions
 
04:42:38.510 --> 04:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
um can you help address one of my
 
04:42:40.550 --> 04:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
concerns and that is I can understand
 
04:42:43.830 --> 04:42:43.840 align:start position:0%
with like a Goods that is perishable
 
04:42:46.510 --> 04:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
that you know the label is going to be
 
04:42:48.110 --> 04:42:48.120 align:start position:0%
up for a little bit and then it'll be
 
04:42:50.230 --> 04:42:50.240 align:start position:0%
out of date because the p wouldn't stay
 
04:42:51.788 --> 04:42:51.798 align:start position:0%
good that long anyways but what about
 
04:42:53.788 --> 04:42:53.798 align:start position:0%
like canned goods or things that could
 
04:42:55.990 --> 04:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
stay on the shelf for years I'm
 
04:42:57.590 --> 04:42:57.600 align:start position:0%
concerned if that let's say there's only
 
04:42:59.788 --> 04:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
a QR code on there you scan the QR code
 
04:43:01.868 --> 04:43:01.878 align:start position:0%
and it takes you to a link that's dead
 
04:43:03.510 --> 04:43:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know that happens all the time with
 
04:43:05.430 --> 04:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
other things it would be a bummer if
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
you're like oh well I guess I don't get
 
04:43:08.470 --> 04:43:08.480 align:start position:0%
to know what's in this because the link
 
04:43:10.470 --> 04:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
is no longer valid yeah I definitely
 
04:43:11.670 --> 04:43:11.680 align:start position:0%
understand that I think it's important
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
to remember that this only applies to
 
04:43:16.830 --> 04:43:16.840 align:start position:0%
places where the owner is selling it on
 
04:43:18.948 --> 04:43:18.958 align:start position:0%
their property I think is that that's
 
04:43:22.628 --> 04:43:22.638 align:start position:0%
correct um so you know where they live
 
04:43:25.948 --> 04:43:25.958 align:start position:0%
you know um who it is most times you're
 
04:43:27.550 --> 04:43:27.560 align:start position:0%
having a personal interaction with that
 
04:43:30.110 --> 04:43:30.120 align:start position:0%
person when you're buying the product um
 
04:43:31.868 --> 04:43:31.878 align:start position:0%
so I think you can just ask and that is
 
04:43:33.910 --> 04:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
what our customers who have allergies do
 
04:43:36.708 --> 04:43:36.718 align:start position:0%
is they just ask us and you know is this
 
04:43:38.750 --> 04:43:38.760 align:start position:0%
safe is this you know is there any risk
 
04:43:38.760 --> 04:43:39.708 align:start position:0%
safe is this you know is there any risk
of

04:43:39.708 --> 04:43:39.718 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:43:41.948 --> 04:43:41.958 align:start position:0%
cross-contamination do you use this nut
 
04:43:44.390 --> 04:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
in your kitchen I think the consumers
 
04:43:46.270 --> 04:43:46.280 align:start position:0%
that are concerned about allergies are
 
04:43:51.190 --> 04:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
very proactive about dealing with it um
 
04:43:54.270 --> 04:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
and because you're buying a product
 
04:43:57.110 --> 04:43:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's on at the farm standand of the
 
04:43:58.948 --> 04:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
person who's making it you really have a
 
04:44:00.550 --> 04:44:00.560 align:start position:0%
lot of interactions that you would not
 
04:44:03.190 --> 04:44:03.200 align:start position:0%
necessarily have with a producer a
 
04:44:05.550 --> 04:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
larger scale industrial producer who can
 
04:44:08.350 --> 04:44:08.360 align:start position:0%
just as easily make uh mistakes on their
 
04:44:10.030 --> 04:44:10.040 align:start position:0%
label as someone at a in a home
 
04:44:12.510 --> 04:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
situation can and oftentimes even more
 
04:44:14.030 --> 04:44:14.040 align:start position:0%
likely um because they're not so
 
04:44:16.390 --> 04:44:16.400 align:start position:0%
directly connected to the production of
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
the product thanks yeah
 
04:44:24.350 --> 04:44:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay excuse me representative has um
 
04:44:28.628 --> 04:44:28.638 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um so I I I
 
04:44:30.310 --> 04:44:30.320 align:start position:0%
think the bill actually mentions farmers
 
04:44:32.150 --> 04:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
markets in places like that too so so
 
04:44:36.110 --> 04:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
it's not just at the home um and I I
 
04:44:38.550 --> 04:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
sort of see an an inherent risk in not
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
knowing what's in in each dish or each
 
04:44:45.788 --> 04:44:45.798 align:start position:0%
creation um partly because of allergies
 
04:44:47.750 --> 04:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
but also because maybe you don't like
 
04:44:50.150 --> 04:44:50.160 align:start position:0%
certain things or you want or you you I
 
04:44:52.708 --> 04:44:52.718 align:start position:0%
mean a lot of people do read labels so
 
04:44:54.868 --> 04:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
um is there a way for you to simplify
 
04:44:56.510 --> 04:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
your labeling process so that it's not
 
04:44:58.670 --> 04:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
such a hassle for you there really isn't
 
04:45:00.230 --> 04:45:00.240 align:start position:0%
if there was I would have figured that
 
04:45:02.270 --> 04:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
out um but I will remind you that there
 
04:45:05.390 --> 04:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
will be a tag at the point of sale with
 
04:45:07.628 --> 04:45:07.638 align:start position:0%
the ingredients on it so you don't lose
 
04:45:09.628 --> 04:45:09.638 align:start position:0%
access to that information at the point
 
04:45:11.550 --> 04:45:11.560 align:start position:0%
of sale you still can see it
 
04:45:13.190 --> 04:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
um the difference is that it's a lot
 
04:45:15.868 --> 04:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
easier for someone to print a single
 
04:45:18.070 --> 04:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
card that says the ingredients on
 
04:45:19.788 --> 04:45:19.798 align:start position:0%
something rather than trying to deal
 
04:45:22.708 --> 04:45:22.718 align:start position:0%
with printing 20 to 30 labels at a time
 
04:45:25.948 --> 04:45:25.958 align:start position:0%
or dealing with like the the cost of the
 
04:45:28.350 --> 04:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
waste on that so again if you wanted to
 
04:45:30.030 --> 04:45:30.040 align:start position:0%
look at the ingredients at the point of
 
04:45:32.390 --> 04:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
sale you still have that little display
 
04:45:34.550 --> 04:45:34.560 align:start position:0%
that says exactly what's in it and your
 
04:45:36.390 --> 04:45:36.400 align:start position:0%
face to face with either the person who
 
04:45:37.830 --> 04:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
made it or like their husband or their
 
04:45:39.948 --> 04:45:39.958 align:start position:0%
kid and you can still talk to them so
 
04:45:42.550 --> 04:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
there's no loss information here it's
 
04:45:45.830 --> 04:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
really just a loss in paper um rather
 
04:45:48.230 --> 04:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
than a loss in information for the
 
04:45:50.868 --> 04:45:50.878 align:start position:0%
consumer followup
 
04:45:54.230 --> 04:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
yep um well what if you're giving it as
 
04:45:58.830 --> 04:45:58.840 align:start position:0%
a gift I mean I I I'm just I I think
 
04:46:01.070 --> 04:46:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we sort of expect labels on our
 
04:46:04.270 --> 04:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
food and I would just remind you that
 
04:46:06.150 --> 04:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
any of the baked goods that you buy in a
 
04:46:08.430 --> 04:46:08.440 align:start position:0%
cafe do not have labels on them nothing
 
04:46:10.150 --> 04:46:10.160 align:start position:0%
you buy in a restaurant has a label on
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
it nothing you buy at the bakery down
 
04:46:14.190 --> 04:46:14.200 align:start position:0%
the street has a label on it so you
 
04:46:15.990 --> 04:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
actually get more
 
04:46:18.590 --> 04:46:18.600 align:start position:0%
information even after this bill than
 
04:46:22.510 --> 04:46:22.520 align:start position:0%
you would going to your local coffee
 
04:46:24.708 --> 04:46:24.718 align:start position:0%
shop representative
 
04:46:27.310 --> 04:46:27.320 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair uh thank you
 
04:46:30.628 --> 04:46:30.638 align:start position:0%
for being here and testifying um would
 
04:46:33.230 --> 04:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
it be safe to say that with a QR code if
 
04:46:35.310 --> 04:46:35.320 align:start position:0%
you were concerned and you want to give
 
04:46:36.830 --> 04:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
it to a gift and you want to make sure
 
04:46:38.788 --> 04:46:38.798 align:start position:0%
that that person could look at all the
 
04:46:40.030 --> 04:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
ingredients you could print that out on
 
04:46:42.310 --> 04:46:42.320 align:start position:0%
your own computer and and put that in
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
with the food sure you could absolutely
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
do that um I think that's a really nice
 
04:46:48.670 --> 04:46:48.680 align:start position:0%
gesture if you wanted to do that and I
 
04:46:49.948 --> 04:46:49.958 align:start position:0%
really encourage people to give gifts
 
04:46:51.750 --> 04:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
where they know what their recipient
 
04:46:55.070 --> 04:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
likes and um Can tailor it to their
 
04:46:57.070 --> 04:46:57.080 align:start position:0%
preferences um and I think we can also
 
04:46:58.708 --> 04:46:58.718 align:start position:0%
not just a QR code I think it said a a
 
04:47:01.750 --> 04:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
web address as well um and a lot of
 
04:47:04.548 --> 04:47:04.558 align:start position:0%
people have internet access like 93% of
 
04:47:06.788 --> 04:47:06.798 align:start position:0%
New Ham rights um most of us have
 
04:47:08.430 --> 04:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
internet on our phone we we're not
 
04:47:10.430 --> 04:47:10.440 align:start position:0%
trying to like exclude information from
 
04:47:11.948 --> 04:47:11.958 align:start position:0%
the conser we're just trying to do it in
 
04:47:14.350 --> 04:47:14.360 align:start position:0%
a way that makes sense um most of us are
 
04:47:15.910 --> 04:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
not producing
 
04:47:18.990 --> 04:47:19.000 align:start position:0%
100,000 muffins at a time the way
 
04:47:20.948 --> 04:47:20.958 align:start position:0%
someone who's selling it Market Basket
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
would be we're not running these giant
 
04:47:25.310 --> 04:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
machines we're making these things in
 
04:47:28.070 --> 04:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
our homes in very small batches and at a
 
04:47:30.750 --> 04:47:30.760 align:start position:0%
certain point having more regulation on
 
04:47:33.510 --> 04:47:33.520 align:start position:0%
us than there is at like a coffee shop
 
04:47:36.150 --> 04:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of labeling it starts to really
 
04:47:38.270 --> 04:47:38.280 align:start position:0%
um really add up and really take a toll
 
04:47:42.110 --> 04:47:42.120 align:start position:0%
and a cost on people
 
04:47:44.190 --> 04:47:44.200 align:start position:0%
any other questions from the
 
04:47:46.470 --> 04:47:46.480 align:start position:0%

questions you may have regarding the
 
04:48:50.150 --> 04:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
bill um I believe that um representative
 
04:48:54.910 --> 04:48:54.920 align:start position:0%
Bixby um Bill uh I won't reiterate every
 
04:48:57.230 --> 04:48:57.240 align:start position:0%
every point that that's been made um but
 
04:49:00.270 --> 04:49:00.280 align:start position:0%
we do understand um this bill to modify
 
04:49:02.510 --> 04:49:02.520 align:start position:0%
the requirements for labeling um for
 
04:49:06.750 --> 04:49:06.760 align:start position:0%
food products um and what's listed
 
04:49:09.708 --> 04:49:09.718 align:start position:0%
versus what's listed as their physical
 
04:49:13.110 --> 04:49:13.120 align:start position:0%
address and to be their email address we
 
04:49:14.910 --> 04:49:14.920 align:start position:0%
also understand this to allow the
 
04:49:16.788 --> 04:49:16.798 align:start position:0%
ability for a QR code and a physical
 
04:49:19.470 --> 04:49:19.480 align:start position:0%
sign at the point of sale for package
 
04:49:20.990 --> 04:49:21.000 align:start position:0%
products that are being sold from the
 
04:49:24.548 --> 04:49:24.558 align:start position:0%
residents or from the residents Farmers
 
04:49:27.270 --> 04:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh Farm Stand um this bill would also
 
04:49:29.430 --> 04:49:29.440 align:start position:0%
allow for an email address instead of
 
04:49:31.350 --> 04:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
the physical address for products that
 
04:49:35.670 --> 04:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
are being sold to restaurants um farmers
 
04:49:35.680 --> 04:49:37.230 align:start position:0%
are being sold to restaurants um farmers
markets

04:49:37.230 --> 04:49:37.240 align:start position:0%
markets
 
04:49:40.910 --> 04:49:40.920 align:start position:0%
Distributors um and via the Internet
 
04:49:42.830 --> 04:49:42.840 align:start position:0%
this bill as representative Bixby
 
04:49:45.470 --> 04:49:45.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned is also cleanup for language
 
04:49:48.948 --> 04:49:48.958 align:start position:0%
that uh addressed the gross maximum
 
04:49:51.430 --> 04:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
annual sales um in which the monetary
 
04:49:54.070 --> 04:49:54.080 align:start position:0%
limit was removed so this is cleanup
 
04:49:57.230 --> 04:49:57.240 align:start position:0%
language to to make the statute
 
04:49:59.548 --> 04:49:59.558 align:start position:0%
clearer I would like to note that in
 
04:49:59.558 --> 04:50:00.708 align:start position:0%
clearer I would like to note that in
this

04:50:00.708 --> 04:50:00.718 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:50:03.708 --> 04:50:03.718 align:start position:0%
bill it also removes the word kitchen
 
04:50:07.868 --> 04:50:07.878 align:start position:0%
before the word home in RSA 143 a12
 
04:50:09.628 --> 04:50:09.638 align:start position:0%
which would imply the allowance for home
 
04:50:12.708 --> 04:50:12.718 align:start position:0%
SP home food to be produced outside of
 
04:50:14.708 --> 04:50:14.718 align:start position:0%
the residential kitchen and I know that
 
04:50:16.030 --> 04:50:16.040 align:start position:0%
there's a bill coming up later this
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon which which we will offer more
 
04:50:18.040 --> 04:50:19.110 align:start position:0%
afternoon which which we will offer more
information

04:50:19.110 --> 04:50:19.120 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:50:21.788 --> 04:50:21.798 align:start position:0%
on as noted in our fiscal worksheet we
 
04:50:24.470 --> 04:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
do not foresee any fiscal impact uh with
 
04:50:26.390 --> 04:50:26.400 align:start position:0%
this bill and we do not foresee any
 
04:50:28.788 --> 04:50:28.798 align:start position:0%
impact to food safety or increase to
 
04:50:31.390 --> 04:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
food Bor illness due to this change
 
04:50:32.830 --> 04:50:32.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to speak
 
04:50:34.470 --> 04:50:34.480 align:start position:0%

sure uh I have a question for you how
 
04:50:40.390 --> 04:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
many times a day or times a week do you
 
04:50:42.430 --> 04:50:42.440 align:start position:0%
get inquiries regarding what should be
 
04:50:45.910 --> 04:50:45.920 align:start position:0%
included on labeling for products it
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
comes up in in most homec Homestead
 
04:50:53.270 --> 04:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
conversations that we have um we answer
 
04:50:55.590 --> 04:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
a lot of questions regarding Homestead
 
04:50:57.430 --> 04:50:57.440 align:start position:0%
um and we try and give as much
 
04:50:59.868 --> 04:50:59.878 align:start position:0%
information as we can um upfront so
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
people know what their what the
 
04:51:03.948 --> 04:51:03.958 align:start position:0%
requirements are and do you give um
 
04:51:07.990 --> 04:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
examples on the DHHS website we do uh
 
04:51:10.830 --> 04:51:10.840 align:start position:0%
for people to see what is required
 
04:51:16.548 --> 04:51:16.558 align:start position:0%
expected yeah y okay um so the public is
 
04:51:20.470 --> 04:51:20.480 align:start position:0%
aware what what needs to be placed on
 
04:51:22.910 --> 04:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
the labels for food they produce correct
 
04:51:25.990 --> 04:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
okay thank you all right any other
 
04:51:28.430 --> 04:51:28.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative jera thank you
 
04:51:29.590 --> 04:51:29.600 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:51:31.030 --> 04:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
question I have a question and if I'm
 
04:51:34.670 --> 04:51:34.680 align:start position:0%
permitted to followup um just a couple
 
04:51:36.230 --> 04:51:36.240 align:start position:0%
clarifications because this is not an
 
04:51:39.788 --> 04:51:39.798 align:start position:0%
area that I know very well U on line two
 
04:51:42.310 --> 04:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
of the bill page one it says all
 
04:51:46.030 --> 04:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
Homestead food products sold in packages
 
04:51:48.990 --> 04:51:49.000 align:start position:0%
from the home are Farm Stand uh so in
 
04:51:51.150 --> 04:51:51.160 align:start position:0%
this case we're talking about uh it's
 
04:51:54.750 --> 04:51:54.760 align:start position:0%
not necessar it doesn't say made in a
 
04:51:57.230 --> 04:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
home kitchen Etc it has to do with the
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:05.310 --> 04:52:05.320 align:start position:0%
correct yes I would agree with
 
04:52:08.750 --> 04:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
that uh and may I have follow up yeah
 
04:52:10.030 --> 04:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and that kind of leads into my
 
04:52:11.910 --> 04:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
second question question and that if I'm
 
04:52:13.708 --> 04:52:13.718 align:start position:0%
reading this bill correctly and I hope
 
04:52:16.190 --> 04:52:16.200 align:start position:0%
you'll correct me if I'm wrong that um
 
04:52:17.350 --> 04:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
there was a question that has been
 
04:52:19.670 --> 04:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
raised for example about farmers markets
 
04:52:23.830 --> 04:52:23.840 align:start position:0%
right so that the we have a separate
 
04:52:26.788 --> 04:52:26.798 align:start position:0%
section here for if something is sold at
 
04:52:30.910 --> 04:52:30.920 align:start position:0%
say a homestead right as opposed to the
 
04:52:32.390 --> 04:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
there's a separate set of requirements
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
if it's sold from a farmer's market
 
04:52:36.788 --> 04:52:36.798 align:start position:0%
another retail food establishment the
 
04:52:38.948 --> 04:52:38.958 align:start position:0%
internet or mail order correct so it's
 
04:52:41.310 --> 04:52:41.320 align:start position:0%
distinguishing a couple of different
 
04:52:43.390 --> 04:52:43.400 align:start position:0%
standards depending on if it's sold at a
 
04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:50.788 --> 04:52:50.798 align:start position:0%
location sure sorry yes and I'm sorry
 
04:52:52.110 --> 04:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
and for the record my name is Colleen
 
04:52:53.948 --> 04:52:53.958 align:start position:0%
Smith I'm with the division of Public
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
Health Services I know Abby had put her
 
04:52:57.430 --> 04:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
name on the card and I'm happy to amend
 
04:53:00.510 --> 04:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
that card um so I just wanted to clarify
 
04:53:02.430 --> 04:53:02.440 align:start position:0%
that there is a separate section on
 
04:53:06.070 --> 04:53:06.080 align:start position:0%
labeling that speak under section c on
 
04:53:09.430 --> 04:53:09.440 align:start position:0%
line 21 that talks that in subsequent um
 
04:53:12.350 --> 04:53:12.360 align:start position:0%
parts of the the the existing law that
 
04:53:14.910 --> 04:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
talks about labeling that it is either
 
04:53:15.788 --> 04:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
from a
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
licensed residential kitchen or from a
 
04:53:21.110 --> 04:53:21.120 align:start position:0%
an exempt from licensed residential
 
04:53:24.948 --> 04:53:24.958 align:start position:0%
kitchen and and and this does as to your
 
04:53:26.590 --> 04:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
your the second part of your question it
 
04:53:29.110 --> 04:53:29.120 align:start position:0%
clarifies depending on where they are
 
04:53:31.548 --> 04:53:31.558 align:start position:0%
selling it there would be a different
 
04:53:33.030 --> 04:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
requirements when it comes to the
 
04:53:36.070 --> 04:53:36.080 align:start position:0%
labeling section whether a QR code was
 
04:53:38.470 --> 04:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
allowed or if it had to be on the
 
04:53:41.548 --> 04:53:41.558 align:start position:0%
label thank you that's very helpful okay
 
04:53:46.750 --> 04:53:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:50.430 --> 04:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
Howard oh never mind any other questions
 
04:53:51.788 --> 04:53:51.798 align:start position:0%
from the
 
04:53:54.030 --> 04:53:54.040 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
04:53:57.030 --> 04:53:57.040 align:start position:0%

had 47 people in
 
04:54:20.670 --> 04:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
support of um
 
04:54:24.788 --> 04:54:24.798 align:start position:0%
hb34 11 people opposed and one person
 
04:54:29.030 --> 04:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
neutral and on our signup sheet we had
 
04:54:31.390 --> 04:54:31.400 align:start position:0%
zero people sign up
 
04:54:34.270 --> 04:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
anything and with that I'm going to
 
04:54:43.230 --> 04:54:43.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:47.030 --> 04:54:47.040 align:start position:0%

afternoon we could do the we could exec
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
the bill later on today um because the
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
hearing the next hearing is in uh one

tight yeah so uh why don't why don't we
 
04:55:06.670 --> 04:55:06.680 align:start position:0%
uh think about doing the exec later
 
04:55:10.070 --> 04:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
today or if we have time later today
 
04:55:12.628 --> 04:55:12.638 align:start position:0%

chair um my name is repres I'm Judy
 
04:56:13.750 --> 04:56:13.760 align:start position:0%
Aaron I represent svin County District 4

langon lemster and
 
04:56:21.110 --> 04:56:21.120 align:start position:0%
Washington and I'm here today to
 
04:56:22.910 --> 04:56:22.920 align:start position:0%
introduce HB
 
04:56:25.430 --> 04:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
371 relative to the definition of
 
04:56:27.548 --> 04:56:27.558 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service
 
04:56:30.110 --> 04:56:30.120 align:start position:0%
establishment again this is a bill that
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
came out of a study committee that we
 
04:56:36.310 --> 04:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
had regarding Homestead food operations
 
04:56:39.070 --> 04:56:39.080 align:start position:0%
and in speaking with many producers of
 
04:56:41.350 --> 04:56:41.360 align:start position:0%
food um um Department of Health and
 
04:56:43.390 --> 04:56:43.400 align:start position:0%
Human Services food safety
 
04:56:46.868 --> 04:56:46.878 align:start position:0%
Division and legislators other
 
04:56:50.990 --> 04:56:51.000 align:start position:0%
stakeholders Farmers
 
04:56:54.750 --> 04:56:54.760 align:start position:0%
um they people expressed the desire to
 
04:56:57.230 --> 04:56:57.240 align:start position:0%
be able to sell their product on a
 
04:56:59.948 --> 04:56:59.958 align:start position:0%
weekly basis and the current definition
 
04:57:01.830 --> 04:57:01.840 align:start position:0%
of occasional food service was
 
04:57:04.628 --> 04:57:04.638 align:start position:0%
problematic with that we were asked to
 
04:57:08.948 --> 04:57:08.958 align:start position:0%
change the definition in RSA 143 hyphen
 
04:57:12.948 --> 04:57:12.958 align:start position:0%
a colon 3 three section five no Roman
 
04:57:16.310 --> 04:57:16.320 align:start position:0%
numeral 5 so that the statute defines
 
04:57:19.350 --> 04:57:19.360 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service as 4 days during
 
04:57:22.590 --> 04:57:22.600 align:start position:0%
a 28-day period rather than 4 days
 
04:57:24.670 --> 04:57:24.680 align:start position:0%
during a 30-day
 
04:57:27.230 --> 04:57:27.240 align:start position:0%
period we want our food producers to
 
04:57:29.430 --> 04:57:29.440 align:start position:0%
offer a clear messaging about when their
 
04:57:31.788 --> 04:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
product will be available and this
 
04:57:34.310 --> 04:57:34.320 align:start position:0%
allows for more consistent offering of a
 
04:57:37.310 --> 04:57:37.320 align:start position:0%
product on an occasional basis it allows
 
04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
for product to be sold once a week when
 
04:57:42.788 --> 04:57:42.798 align:start position:0%
selling a product is limited to 4 days
 
04:57:45.470 --> 04:57:45.480 align:start position:0%
in a 30-day period it can be difficult
 
04:57:48.190 --> 04:57:48.200 align:start position:0%
for producers to say to their customers
 
04:57:50.310 --> 04:57:50.320 align:start position:0%
that they're open once a week for four
 
04:57:52.670 --> 04:57:52.680 align:start position:0%
weeks and then close the fifth week and
 
04:57:54.230 --> 04:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
then be open again it's kind of
 
04:57:58.030 --> 04:57:58.040 align:start position:0%
confusing that way so by changing RSA
 
04:58:02.548 --> 04:58:02.558 align:start position:0%
143a colon 3 uh section Roman numeral 5
 
04:58:04.670 --> 04:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
so that the statute defines occasional
 
04:58:07.708 --> 04:58:07.718 align:start position:0%
as 4 days in a 28-day period the New
 
04:58:09.310 --> 04:58:09.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legislature would be giving
 
04:58:12.310 --> 04:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
homebased food producers small farmers
 
04:58:14.590 --> 04:58:14.600 align:start position:0%
and budding food entrepreneurs the
 
04:58:16.628 --> 04:58:16.638 align:start position:0%
opportunity to build a larger customer
 
04:58:19.750 --> 04:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
base by providing clearer messaging and
 
04:58:22.390 --> 04:58:22.400 align:start position:0%
more reliable service and specifically
 
04:58:24.230 --> 04:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
being able to offer a product on a
 
04:58:24.240 --> 04:58:25.788 align:start position:0%
being able to offer a product on a
weekly

04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
weekly
 
04:58:28.390 --> 04:58:28.400 align:start position:0%
basis changing this definition does not
 
04:58:30.948 --> 04:58:30.958 align:start position:0%
change any food safety regulations and
 
04:58:32.548 --> 04:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
it doesn't allow for unsafe or
 
04:58:35.470 --> 04:58:35.480 align:start position:0%
unsanitary practices the Department of
 
04:58:37.110 --> 04:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services would retain
 
04:58:39.150 --> 04:58:39.160 align:start position:0%
their current ability to quote inspect
 
04:58:40.628 --> 04:58:40.638 align:start position:0%
when the department has reason to
 
04:58:42.868 --> 04:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
suspect an imminent health hazard as
 
04:58:47.070 --> 04:58:47.080 align:start position:0%
laid out in RSA 143 co uh hyphen a colon
 
04:58:51.110 --> 04:58:51.120 align:start position:0%
5 so that's essentially um the thrust of
 
04:58:53.030 --> 04:58:53.040 align:start position:0%
this bill it's pretty simple
 
04:58:55.150 --> 04:58:55.160 align:start position:0%
straightforward and I think it will go a
 
04:58:57.510 --> 04:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
long way to help our small food
 
04:59:01.110 --> 04:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
producers uh offer their food products
 
04:59:03.750 --> 04:59:03.760 align:start position:0%
on an occasional basis but with more
 
04:59:07.190 --> 04:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
reliability and more stability so that's
 
04:59:09.670 --> 04:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
all I have for you on this particular
 
04:59:09.680 --> 04:59:11.070 align:start position:0%
all I have for you on this particular
bill

04:59:11.070 --> 04:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:59:11.080 --> 04:59:12.430 align:start position:0%
bill
representative

04:59:12.430 --> 04:59:12.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:59:14.788 --> 04:59:14.798 align:start position:0%
Barbara thank you madam chair thank you
 
04:59:20.670 --> 04:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
for uh introducing this bill um as a uh
 
04:59:22.830 --> 04:59:22.840 align:start position:0%
occasional food service provider myself
 
04:59:25.270 --> 04:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
for over 24 years I would do cooking
 
04:59:28.350 --> 04:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
demonstrations in public libraries and
 
04:59:31.150 --> 04:59:31.160 align:start position:0%
give the food to those who are watching
 
04:59:34.868 --> 04:59:34.878 align:start position:0%
I occasionally ran into situations where
 
04:59:39.150 --> 04:59:39.160 align:start position:0%
for example um a a public library had no
 
04:59:40.830 --> 04:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
concerns whatsoever ever and this was
 
04:59:43.150 --> 04:59:43.160 align:start position:0%
often often the case but occasionally I
 
04:59:46.750 --> 04:59:46.760 align:start position:0%
would attend um uh do a program at a
 
04:59:49.548 --> 04:59:49.558 align:start position:0%
public library that would um say that
 
04:59:52.708 --> 04:59:52.718 align:start position:0%
nothing uh could be served that I may
 
04:59:56.390 --> 04:59:56.400 align:start position:0%
have prepared on site will
 
05:00:01.788 --> 05:00:01.798 align:start position:0%
this um Bill F be subject to local uh
 
05:00:06.350 --> 05:00:06.360 align:start position:0%
food regulations uh by the
 
05:00:10.470 --> 05:00:10.480 align:start position:0%
city the the cities that have their own
 
05:00:10.480 --> 05:00:12.548 align:start position:0%
city the the cities that have their own
inspection

05:00:12.548 --> 05:00:12.558 align:start position:0%
inspection
 
05:00:12.558 --> 05:00:14.150 align:start position:0%
inspection
programs

05:00:14.150 --> 05:00:14.160 align:start position:0%
programs
 
05:00:18.230 --> 05:00:18.240 align:start position:0%
um they these this law doesn't fall
 
05:00:19.990 --> 05:00:20.000 align:start position:0%
under that because they make their own
 
05:00:23.070 --> 05:00:23.080 align:start position:0%
laws and regulations having to do with
 
05:00:26.110 --> 05:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh food served and when it's served and
 
05:00:29.430 --> 05:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
how it's served followup Yeah a
 
05:00:32.590 --> 05:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
different question if that's okay um in
 
05:00:36.548 --> 05:00:36.558 align:start position:0%
the bill it says provided for the public
 
05:00:42.030 --> 05:00:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:44.430 --> 05:00:44.440 align:start position:0%
so using my own
 
05:00:47.990 --> 05:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
example if I prepare the food at the
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
library can I then serve it to
 
05:00:53.548 --> 05:00:53.558 align:start position:0%
them or I'm just trying to figure out
 
05:00:56.670 --> 05:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
what provided for the public as a
 
05:00:58.670 --> 05:00:58.680 align:start position:0%
definition could would
 
05:01:01.590 --> 05:01:01.600 align:start position:0%
entail yes I would imagine that if you
 
05:01:05.948 --> 05:01:05.958 align:start position:0%
were if you were preparing something at
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
a place um a soup kitchen or a
 
05:01:13.470 --> 05:01:13.480 align:start position:0%
you know what Pro even a public
 
05:01:16.910 --> 05:01:16.920 align:start position:0%
library as long as you didn't have that
 
05:01:22.070 --> 05:01:22.080 align:start position:0%
local inspection control group um making
 
05:01:24.670 --> 05:01:24.680 align:start position:0%
the rules and regulations uh I think
 
05:01:26.788 --> 05:01:26.798 align:start position:0%
that this would be you would be covered
 
05:01:29.070 --> 05:01:29.080 align:start position:0%
under for this thank you very much
 
05:01:29.080 --> 05:01:30.670 align:start position:0%
under for this thank you very much
representative

05:01:30.670 --> 05:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:01:34.070 --> 05:01:34.080 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair um so would
 
05:01:36.110 --> 05:01:36.120 align:start position:0%
this uh you say four days a month could
 
05:01:37.708 --> 05:01:37.718 align:start position:0%
they be clustered together is that
 
05:01:40.030 --> 05:01:40.040 align:start position:0%
average could you do three you know over
 
05:01:42.708 --> 05:01:42.718 align:start position:0%
the course do 16 days in one month and
 
05:01:44.708 --> 05:01:44.718 align:start position:0%
then not do it for the next three months
 
05:01:49.948 --> 05:01:49.958 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine no because it's it's
 
05:01:51.310 --> 05:01:51.320 align:start position:0%
well I don't know it's four days during
 
05:01:54.788 --> 05:01:54.798 align:start position:0%
a 28 day period so I suppose you could
 
05:01:56.948 --> 05:01:56.958 align:start position:0%
do it in four days in a in a cluster
 
05:01:59.590 --> 05:01:59.600 align:start position:0%
that's a occasional Food
 
05:01:59.600 --> 05:02:02.470 align:start position:0%
that's a occasional Food
Service

05:02:02.470 --> 05:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
Service
 
05:02:04.990 --> 05:02:05.000 align:start position:0%
yep represent
 
05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
King uh thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:02:11.868 --> 05:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
you representative for this bill I'm
 
05:02:14.310 --> 05:02:14.320 align:start position:0%
just curious um and it it adds the new
 
05:02:16.430 --> 05:02:16.440 align:start position:0%
words and served on premises or taken
 
05:02:19.390 --> 05:02:19.400 align:start position:0%
away and consumed off premises is there
 
05:02:21.990 --> 05:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
another option that I'm not seeing here
 
05:02:24.750 --> 05:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
I mean thaty doesn't that pretty much s
 
05:02:26.708 --> 05:02:26.718 align:start position:0%
like wrap up everything possible it's
 
05:02:28.590 --> 05:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
either served on premises or taken off
 
05:02:31.030 --> 05:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
right well we want also uh that was one
 
05:02:32.830 --> 05:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
of the things that people had spoken
 
05:02:35.430 --> 05:02:35.440 align:start position:0%
about during this study committee was
 
05:02:38.470 --> 05:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
that the ability to um to have food
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
being able to be taken away way and not
 
05:02:44.590 --> 05:02:44.600 align:start position:0%
have to be consumed on premises like you
 
05:02:47.430 --> 05:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
know if you're at a at a fair or uh you
 
05:02:49.350 --> 05:02:49.360 align:start position:0%
know local potluck dinner or something
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
like that that you don't necessarily
 
05:02:54.910 --> 05:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
have to consume it there you can take it
 
05:02:56.868 --> 05:02:56.878 align:start position:0%
away and and there are many places that
 
05:02:59.990 --> 05:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
do I guess that uh you know you can
 
05:03:02.788 --> 05:03:02.798 align:start position:0%
purchase something and and take it away
 
05:03:04.390 --> 05:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay okay and before that wasn't
 
05:03:06.830 --> 05:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
specified in the RSA so there was okay
 
05:03:09.230 --> 05:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so much anyone else have any
 
05:03:10.750 --> 05:03:10.760 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
05:03:12.470 --> 05:03:12.480 align:start position:0%

opportunity to speak to you on health

opportunity to speak to you on health
Bill

05:03:58.750 --> 05:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:04:01.670 --> 05:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
371 uh the department is not taking a
 
05:04:03.430 --> 05:04:03.440 align:start position:0%
position on this bill and again are
 
05:04:05.310 --> 05:04:05.320 align:start position:0%
happy to be a resource um to the
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
committee and answer any questions you
 
05:04:11.350 --> 05:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
the occasional uh definition of an
 
05:04:15.150 --> 05:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service establishment as
 
05:04:20.350 --> 05:04:20.360 align:start position:0%
defined in 143 A3 um is an exemption um
 
05:04:22.150 --> 05:04:22.160 align:start position:0%
the exemption for occasional Food
 
05:04:25.270 --> 05:04:25.280 align:start position:0%
Service establishments um currently is
 
05:04:27.830 --> 05:04:27.840 align:start position:0%
that they're allowed to operate no more
 
05:04:30.150 --> 05:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
than 4 days in a 30-day period this
 
05:04:32.510 --> 05:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
change would allow operators to be
 
05:04:33.990 --> 05:04:34.000 align:start position:0%
exempt from licensing under the
 
05:04:36.590 --> 05:04:36.600 align:start position:0%
occasional Food Service um establishment
 
05:04:38.590 --> 05:04:38.600 align:start position:0%
exemption as long as they are operating
 
05:04:42.230 --> 05:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
no more than 4 days in a 28-day period
 
05:04:45.750 --> 05:04:45.760 align:start position:0%
um this would also modify the definition
 
05:04:48.030 --> 05:04:48.040 align:start position:0%
again to clarify and allow food to be
 
05:04:52.030 --> 05:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:54.670 --> 05:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
premise I'm sorry
 
05:04:58.150 --> 05:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
go I thought you were done so I'm sorry
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
please continue okay
 
05:05:03.548 --> 05:05:03.558 align:start position:0%
um so the department doesn't see any any
 
05:05:05.670 --> 05:05:05.680 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact to this and we do not
 
05:05:08.390 --> 05:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
anticipate any impacts to food safety um
 
05:05:10.270 --> 05:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
or an increase in any food born illness
 
05:05:14.548 --> 05:05:14.558 align:start position:0%
associated with changes made in this
 
05:05:17.110 --> 05:05:17.120 align:start position:0%
bill does anyone have any qu represent
 
05:05:21.750 --> 05:05:21.760 align:start position:0%
Bixby yeah so I'm just curious is um
 
05:05:24.030 --> 05:05:24.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes you you testify in favor or
 
05:05:27.310 --> 05:05:27.320 align:start position:0%
against things uh is your current not
 
05:05:29.310 --> 05:05:29.320 align:start position:0%
taking position the result of not having
 
05:05:32.510 --> 05:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
had a chance to talk with the governor
 
05:05:38.910 --> 05:05:38.920 align:start position:0%
yet uh sure I I think we we had there it
 
05:05:41.190 --> 05:05:41.200 align:start position:0%
had no there was no bearing on that
 
05:05:43.548 --> 05:05:43.558 align:start position:0%
decision we just we we again because
 
05:05:46.910 --> 05:05:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal impact there's no um
 
05:05:49.548 --> 05:05:49.558 align:start position:0%
no risk to increase risk of for foodborn
 
05:05:52.868 --> 05:05:52.878 align:start position:0%
illness we we are not taking a position
 
05:05:55.390 --> 05:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
um as representative Aaron had pointed
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
out this does provide Clarity where
 
05:06:01.990 --> 05:06:02.000 align:start position:0%
there is confusion about um about what
 
05:06:05.070 --> 05:06:05.080 align:start position:0%
uh what a 30-day period constitutes if
 
05:06:07.548 --> 05:06:07.558 align:start position:0%
it if it's can be weekly monthly that
 
05:06:08.990 --> 05:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is just providing more
 
05:06:11.910 --> 05:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
clarification on that okay thank
 
05:06:15.350 --> 05:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
you anyone else have any other questions
 
05:06:16.948 --> 05:06:16.958 align:start position:0%
thank you ladies thank
 
05:06:24.150 --> 05:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:33.590 --> 05:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:36.110 --> 05:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
please please introduce yourself and
 
05:06:40.670 --> 05:06:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:43.430 --> 05:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh that would help huh um my name is
 
05:06:46.070 --> 05:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
Michael Williams um Addie and I reside
 
05:06:47.948 --> 05:06:47.958 align:start position:0%
at the same place we have a a farm and
 
05:06:51.788 --> 05:06:51.798 align:start position:0%
farm store in uh Dunbarton and uh we
 
05:06:54.150 --> 05:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
also have a um an artisan bakery that we
 
05:06:57.190 --> 05:06:57.200 align:start position:0%
operate out of there
 
05:07:00.830 --> 05:07:00.840 align:start position:0%
um I think obviously the for us the
 
05:07:05.190 --> 05:07:05.200 align:start position:0%
important piece was the clarity on um
 
05:07:07.190 --> 05:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
the time period
 
05:07:09.990 --> 05:07:10.000 align:start position:0%
between days that you can operate in
 
05:07:12.788 --> 05:07:12.798 align:start position:0%
this fashion um we definitely were
 
05:07:14.628 --> 05:07:14.638 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with the idea of 4 and3
 
05:07:16.830 --> 05:07:16.840 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that um representative
 
05:07:19.350 --> 05:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
Aon stated that uh you know you can't
 
05:07:21.070 --> 05:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
consistently advertise to someone that
 
05:07:24.670 --> 05:07:24.680 align:start position:0%
you are open once a week if you are open
 
05:07:25.990 --> 05:07:26.000 align:start position:0%
once a week for four weeks and then
 
05:07:27.750 --> 05:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
closed a week because you are trying not
 
05:07:29.910 --> 05:07:29.920 align:start position:0%
to violate the 30 days and I know that
 
05:07:32.190 --> 05:07:32.200 align:start position:0%
there was an indication what well I just
 
05:07:34.510 --> 05:07:34.520 align:start position:0%
also wanted to mention that last year um
 
05:07:37.430 --> 05:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
during a similar hearing DHHS also said
 
05:07:40.110 --> 05:07:40.120 align:start position:0%
that they were enforcing it as um as
 
05:07:43.708 --> 05:07:43.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:46.230 --> 05:07:46.240 align:start position:0%
right still there but when she was doing
 
05:07:48.350 --> 05:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
her testimony and explaining this law
 
05:07:50.430 --> 05:07:50.440 align:start position:0%
she said it was once per week um and so
 
05:07:52.350 --> 05:07:52.360 align:start position:0%
that obviously is the way it's being
 
05:07:56.628 --> 05:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
enforced is not um congruent with
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
consistent with um the way the law is
 
05:08:01.670 --> 05:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
written and so part of this is just to
 
05:08:04.548 --> 05:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
clarify that as well um as to make it
 
05:08:08.110 --> 05:08:08.120 align:start position:0%
easier for people to um advertise when
 
05:08:09.708 --> 05:08:09.718 align:start position:0%
they're open and communicate they're
 
05:08:12.948 --> 05:08:12.958 align:start position:0%
doing from their business or their Farm
 
05:08:15.110 --> 05:08:15.120 align:start position:0%
um or their Farm business things like
 
05:08:17.030 --> 05:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
that um and I know there were a couple
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
of questions I wanted to really clarify
 
05:08:21.750 --> 05:08:21.760 align:start position:0%
that this doesn't change it doesn't
 
05:08:24.548 --> 05:08:24.558 align:start position:0%
create an exemption it changes two very
 
05:08:27.670 --> 05:08:27.680 align:start position:0%
tiny parts of an existing exemption so
 
05:08:29.670 --> 05:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
the idea idea of an occasional Food
 
05:08:32.310 --> 05:08:32.320 align:start position:0%
Service establishment already exists in
 
05:08:35.548 --> 05:08:35.558 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law I can make pumpkin pie
 
05:08:38.350 --> 05:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
and I can sell you a slice of it right
 
05:08:40.150 --> 05:08:40.160 align:start position:0%
now you have to eat eat it in my
 
05:08:42.230 --> 05:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
driveway or I have to think that I want
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
you to eat it in my driveway um what
 
05:08:47.230 --> 05:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
this law would change is that I can
 
05:08:49.390 --> 05:08:49.400 align:start position:0%
think that maybe you'll take it home and
 
05:08:52.430 --> 05:08:52.440 align:start position:0%
so it's really a very minor change um
 
05:08:54.470 --> 05:08:54.480 align:start position:0%
that creates a huge impact for
 
05:08:56.510 --> 05:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
businesses like ours um and for other
 
05:08:59.510 --> 05:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
homebased businesses because it is much
 
05:09:02.750 --> 05:09:02.760 align:start position:0%
much much easier and safer to produce
 
05:09:06.190 --> 05:09:06.200 align:start position:0%
food for take-home than it is to produce
 
05:09:08.910 --> 05:09:08.920 align:start position:0%
food that you're going to serve hot um
 
05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
at your
 
05:09:14.190 --> 05:09:14.200 align:start position:0%
farmer or your home um to customers so I
 
05:09:15.628 --> 05:09:15.638 align:start position:0%
think we can all think about
 
05:09:17.510 --> 05:09:17.520 align:start position:0%
Thanksgiving what are the articles that
 
05:09:19.430 --> 05:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
already always always always come out
 
05:09:22.110 --> 05:09:22.120 align:start position:0%
right before Thanksgiving easy make aead
 
05:09:24.310 --> 05:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
recipes the casseroles you can
 
05:09:26.430 --> 05:09:26.440 align:start position:0%
refrigerate and then serve to your
 
05:09:28.510 --> 05:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
family it's all the things that you can
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
do so that you have less stress less
 
05:09:33.750 --> 05:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
hassle and you can really focus on your
 
05:09:35.990 --> 05:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
cooking and what that translates to in
 
05:09:38.948 --> 05:09:38.958 align:start position:0%
businesses is being able to focus on the
 
05:09:40.670 --> 05:09:40.680 align:start position:0%
safety hitting your temperatures
 
05:09:42.430 --> 05:09:42.440 align:start position:0%
correctly making sure that things are
 
05:09:44.590 --> 05:09:44.600 align:start position:0%
cooled properly those are all really
 
05:09:47.670 --> 05:09:47.680 align:start position:0%
hard to do if you are hosting people for
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
us at our farm for a farm dinner and
 
05:09:52.750 --> 05:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
it's chaotic and they have questions I
 
05:09:54.628 --> 05:09:54.638 align:start position:0%
might miss a temperature on a piece of
 
05:09:56.990 --> 05:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
meat um whereas if I'm preparing
 
05:09:58.390 --> 05:09:58.400 align:start position:0%
something that I'm chilling and then
 
05:10:01.430 --> 05:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
selling from the cooler at my um in our
 
05:10:03.670 --> 05:10:03.680 align:start position:0%
farm store by Cooler I mean refrigerator
 
05:10:07.590 --> 05:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
not like cooler um it's really easy to
 
05:10:10.590 --> 05:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
do and it's something that you can and
 
05:10:13.190 --> 05:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
execute well even if you're only doing
 
05:10:16.270 --> 05:10:16.280 align:start position:0%
it a few times a month um and by well I
 
05:10:18.350 --> 05:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
means safely and so that's really
 
05:10:21.750 --> 05:10:21.760 align:start position:0%
important the other issue is reducing
 
05:10:25.350 --> 05:10:25.360 align:start position:0%
the inequities in the law so right now
 
05:10:26.708 --> 05:10:26.718 align:start position:0%
um I'll give you an example one of our
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
neighbors just did this beautiful
 
05:10:30.510 --> 05:10:30.520 align:start position:0%
renovation of their Farm they put in
 
05:10:33.270 --> 05:10:33.280 align:start position:0%
this like amazing Hearth outdoors and
 
05:10:35.830 --> 05:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
they have like heaters and it's gorgeous
 
05:10:37.230 --> 05:10:37.240 align:start position:0%
they have a lot of money to do those
 
05:10:39.470 --> 05:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
Renovations but it means that right now
 
05:10:41.350 --> 05:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
they could take advantage of this law by
 
05:10:43.788 --> 05:10:43.798 align:start position:0%
hosting dinners at their Farm really
 
05:10:45.910 --> 05:10:45.920 align:start position:0%
easily whereas someone who doesn't have
 
05:10:48.628 --> 05:10:48.638 align:start position:0%
those resources would have a hard time
 
05:10:50.788 --> 05:10:50.798 align:start position:0%
even though they can prepare food just
 
05:10:53.270 --> 05:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
as safely and so the idea is to reduce
 
05:10:55.548 --> 05:10:55.558 align:start position:0%
barriers for people who don't have the
 
05:10:57.750 --> 05:10:57.760 align:start position:0%
capital to invest in a ton of Furnishing
 
05:11:00.150 --> 05:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
who don't have a huge parking lot on
 
05:11:02.070 --> 05:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
their property who maybe live in an
 
05:11:04.390 --> 05:11:04.400 align:start position:0%
apartment or a condo and being able to
 
05:11:07.150 --> 05:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
have the same access to opportunities
 
05:11:09.590 --> 05:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
that other people have just because of
 
05:11:14.830 --> 05:11:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.270 --> 05:11:18.280 align:start position:0%
law anyone representative Haskins thank
 
05:11:20.788 --> 05:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you for
 
05:11:23.788 --> 05:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
testifying so eloquently about your farm
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
and the work that you do I appreciate it
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious does anybody ever show
 
05:11:32.150 --> 05:11:32.160 align:start position:0%
up to see that you're following these
 
05:11:35.150 --> 05:11:35.160 align:start position:0%
laws and procedures that you have
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
articulated so well uh no there's a
 
05:11:41.230 --> 05:11:41.240 align:start position:0%
mechanism for DHHS to do like an
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
emergency inspection and if we were
 
05:11:46.230 --> 05:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
selling to F Food Service establishments
 
05:11:48.350 --> 05:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
then you undergo an inspection um we
 
05:11:49.708 --> 05:11:49.718 align:start position:0%
haven't done that yet because you also
 
05:11:51.708 --> 05:11:51.718 align:start position:0%
have to like submit all of your recipes
 
05:11:53.310 --> 05:11:53.320 align:start position:0%
and it's just like a lot of paperwork
 
05:11:56.190 --> 05:11:56.200 align:start position:0%
that I don't want to do so um especially
 
05:11:58.390 --> 05:11:58.400 align:start position:0%
with you know oh blueberry raspberry
 
05:12:02.070 --> 05:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
whatever so um no there I mean there are
 
05:12:03.788 --> 05:12:03.798 align:start position:0%
a lot of consequences if you don't do
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
things correctly like you will lose your
 
05:12:06.990 --> 05:12:07.000 align:start position:0%
business and you don't have any
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
customers anymore and then you lose your
 
05:12:09.910 --> 05:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
house because you can't pay your
 
05:12:11.948 --> 05:12:11.958 align:start position:0%
mortgage so I would say there's a really
 
05:12:13.948 --> 05:12:13.958 align:start position:0%
big incentive for people to
 
05:12:17.270 --> 05:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
follow food food safety practices um I
 
05:12:19.310 --> 05:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
would agree yeah it's a it's like a big
 
05:12:21.270 --> 05:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
deal it's kind of like the ultimate
 
05:12:23.190 --> 05:12:23.200 align:start position:0%
pressure cuz like I like living in my
 
05:12:25.948 --> 05:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
home and like feeding my pets and stuff
 
05:12:29.230 --> 05:12:29.240 align:start position:0%
um more than I even care about what DHHS
 
05:12:30.990 --> 05:12:31.000 align:start position:0%
thinks about how I'm doing things there
 
05:12:34.070 --> 05:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
you go thank you very much anyone else
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
represent Bixby so U I'm just thinking
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
about the the history of this occasional
 
05:12:41.788 --> 05:12:41.798 align:start position:0%
food surfice establishment and um this
 
05:12:42.750 --> 05:12:42.760 align:start position:0%
actually might have been a better
 
05:12:47.830 --> 05:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
question for for um HHS but um was this
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
originally designed for homesteaders or
 
05:12:51.548 --> 05:12:51.558 align:start position:0%
was this originally designed for things
 
05:12:53.150 --> 05:12:53.160 align:start position:0%
like um church
 
05:12:55.910 --> 05:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
suppers I don't know um I've only lived
 
05:12:57.270 --> 05:12:57.280 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire for two years we used
 
05:12:59.788 --> 05:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
to live in Virginia where there's a very
 
05:13:01.310 --> 05:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
different system um where you can make
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
kind of anything you want but there's
 
05:13:06.868 --> 05:13:06.878 align:start position:0%
more inspections um my guess just based
 
05:13:09.150 --> 05:13:09.160 align:start position:0%
on the way that things are written is um
 
05:13:11.830 --> 05:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
um at some point they wanted to probably
 
05:13:15.190 --> 05:13:15.200 align:start position:0%
inst to adopt the FDA Food Code which
 
05:13:16.788 --> 05:13:16.798 align:start position:0%
has a specific provision that you can't
 
05:13:18.708 --> 05:13:18.718 align:start position:0%
make things at home and so I'm guessing
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
that this was a carve out probably
 
05:13:21.510 --> 05:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
around the same time but that's just a
 
05:13:21.520 --> 05:13:22.510 align:start position:0%
around the same time but that's just a
guess

05:13:22.510 --> 05:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
guess
 
05:13:26.190 --> 05:13:26.200 align:start position:0%
not at all um but yeah but right now it
 
05:13:28.430 --> 05:13:28.440 align:start position:0%
applies to everyone so um you can be a
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
homesteader you can be a um a community
 
05:13:34.230 --> 05:13:34.240 align:start position:0%
group I've definitely seen Community
 
05:13:36.510 --> 05:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
groups doing things I would not thank
 
05:13:36.520 --> 05:13:37.390 align:start position:0%

um I think it it's just common sense to
 
05:16:08.990 --> 05:16:09.000 align:start position:0%
to have to know what's in the ingredient
 
05:16:10.190 --> 05:16:10.200 align:start position:0%
what the ingredients of the food that
 
05:16:13.548 --> 05:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
we're buying it are and um and the
 
05:16:16.150 --> 05:16:16.160 align:start position:0%
methods by which they that are offered
 
05:16:19.548 --> 05:16:19.558 align:start position:0%
in this bill are pretty give a lot of
 
05:16:21.830 --> 05:16:21.840 align:start position:0%
flexibility to the C to the cooks and
 
05:16:24.628 --> 05:16:24.638 align:start position:0%
the paraders so I think that it's a good
 
05:16:27.788 --> 05:16:27.798 align:start position:0%
idea to to label a
 
05:16:30.548 --> 05:16:30.558 align:start position:0%
food okay thank you do I hear any
 
05:16:32.350 --> 05:16:32.360 align:start position:0%
further discussion about this bill
 
05:16:35.470 --> 05:16:35.480 align:start position:0%
representative siketus s sorry I was
 
05:16:39.510 --> 05:16:39.520 align:start position:0%
late um some people have very
 
05:16:44.708 --> 05:16:44.718 align:start position:0%
severe uh food board allergies and
 
05:16:46.910 --> 05:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
because of my spinal cord injury I
 
05:16:49.990 --> 05:16:50.000 align:start position:0%
turned Celiac and I have no idea as a
 
05:16:51.430 --> 05:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
nurse that something like that could
 
05:16:54.868 --> 05:16:54.878 align:start position:0%
happen so I think that labeling stuff
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
especially glutenfree is very very
 
05:17:02.270 --> 05:17:02.280 align:start position:0%
important okay any other questions or

consent calendar I'm going to close the
 
05:18:21.350 --> 05:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
exec session for
 
05:18:24.430 --> 05:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
hb34 and open the exec session for HB
 
05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
371 relative to the definition of
 
05:18:28.230 --> 05:18:28.240 align:start position:0%
occasional Food
 
05:18:32.270 --> 05:18:32.280 align:start position:0%
Service um I would like to move OTP on
 
05:18:35.830 --> 05:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
that uh do I hear a second okay I will
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
second that okay um and I'll speak to my
 
05:18:42.708 --> 05:18:42.718 align:start position:0%
motion for aut to pass um certainly we
 
05:18:47.350 --> 05:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
want to make it um easier for our our
 
05:18:49.868 --> 05:18:49.878 align:start position:0%
folks who offer occasional Food Service
 
05:18:53.430 --> 05:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
to be able to do so and uh just changing
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
the um definition of four out of 28 days
 
05:19:00.430 --> 05:19:00.440 align:start position:0%
as opposed to four out of 30 uh makes
 
05:19:03.350 --> 05:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
that a little bit more flexible so that
 
05:19:04.868 --> 05:19:04.878 align:start position:0%
uh they can do something once a week
 
05:19:06.788 --> 05:19:06.798 align:start position:0%
they could do it four days out of a 28
 
05:19:10.590 --> 05:19:10.600 align:start position:0%
day period and um I think that that this
 
05:19:12.868 --> 05:19:12.878 align:start position:0%
uh Bill makes a lot of sense and also
 
05:19:15.510 --> 05:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
adds in the possibility for people to be
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
able to take their food home with them
 
05:19:21.070 --> 05:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
so for all those reasons I am asking you
 
05:19:23.310 --> 05:19:23.320 align:start position:0%
to please support OTP
 
05:19:25.070 --> 05:19:25.080 align:start position:0%

05:19:31.110 --> 05:19:31.120 align:start position:0%
comments representative Bixby um I think
 
05:19:33.190 --> 05:19:33.200 align:start position:0%
I think this bill makes a lot of sense
 
05:19:37.470 --> 05:19:37.480 align:start position:0%
um the the one you 28 days is just
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
really pretty obvious and allowing for
 
05:19:45.070 --> 05:19:45.080 align:start position:0%
um the takeaway as well as on premise uh
 
05:19:47.788 --> 05:19:47.798 align:start position:0%
really makes it uh better for people who
 
05:19:49.670 --> 05:19:49.680 align:start position:0%
have a relatively small premise to work
 
05:19:52.510 --> 05:19:52.520 align:start position:0%

05:19:54.910 --> 05:19:54.920 align:start position:0%

Barnstead um again this is another bill
 
05:27:16.788 --> 05:27:16.798 align:start position:0%
that came out of discussions last uh
 
05:27:19.430 --> 05:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
session regarding uh the
 
05:27:22.670 --> 05:27:22.680 align:start position:0%

operations and this particular bill um
 
05:27:28.590 --> 05:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
came about
 
05:27:31.910 --> 05:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
because on the
 
05:27:35.070 --> 05:27:35.080 align:start position:0%
website it said that you could not use
 
05:27:35.080 --> 05:27:36.230 align:start position:0%
website it said that you could not use
commercial

05:27:36.230 --> 05:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
05:27:38.430 --> 05:27:38.440 align:start position:0%

DHHS food safety thank you and um after
further

05:27:47.430 --> 05:27:47.440 align:start position:0%
further
 
05:27:49.788 --> 05:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
discussion we found out that that was
 
05:27:52.590 --> 05:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
neither in rules or in statute but it
 
05:27:54.948 --> 05:27:54.958 align:start position:0%
was just listed on the
 
05:27:59.190 --> 05:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
website um and so this bill has been put
 
05:28:02.230 --> 05:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
forth um to provide
 
05:28:05.628 --> 05:28:05.638 align:start position:0%
Clarity that a homestead food operation
 
05:28:09.350 --> 05:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
may use commercial kitchen an
 
05:28:12.430 --> 05:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
equipment so long as the equipment is
 
05:28:14.990 --> 05:28:15.000 align:start position:0%
able to be washed and rinsed in the
 
05:28:15.000 --> 05:28:17.430 align:start position:0%
able to be washed and rinsed in the
processing

05:28:17.430 --> 05:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
processing
 
05:28:20.150 --> 05:28:20.160 align:start position:0%
area and I went on to further Define
 
05:28:21.548 --> 05:28:21.558 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment means the
 
05:28:24.310 --> 05:28:24.320 align:start position:0%
specialized tools and appliances used in
 
05:28:27.070 --> 05:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
professional kitchens to prepare cook
 
05:28:29.470 --> 05:28:29.480 align:start position:0%
and store food and that can withstand
 
05:28:32.868 --> 05:28:32.878 align:start position:0%
heavy use in high volume cooking um I
 
05:28:36.230 --> 05:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
had folks that used to prepare bread and
 
05:28:38.110 --> 05:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
because they were prohibited from using
 
05:28:40.910 --> 05:28:40.920 align:start position:0%
a commercial mixer they would have 10 to
 
05:28:43.230 --> 05:28:43.240 align:start position:0%
12 mixers lined up on their
 
05:28:46.590 --> 05:28:46.600 align:start position:0%
counters um needing
 
05:28:46.600 --> 05:28:48.110 align:start position:0%
counters um needing
bread

05:28:48.110 --> 05:28:48.120 align:start position:0%
bread
 
05:28:53.350 --> 05:28:53.360 align:start position:0%
um you know and commercial equipment um
 
05:28:55.948 --> 05:28:55.958 align:start position:0%
sometimes actually it's it's better
 
05:28:58.830 --> 05:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
equipment uh less breakdown probably
 
05:29:01.628 --> 05:29:01.638 align:start position:0%
more energy efficient uh than using you
 
05:29:03.948 --> 05:29:03.958 align:start position:0%
know 12 mixers at
 
05:29:08.350 --> 05:29:08.360 align:start position:0%
once um and so this is just a simple
 
05:29:10.310 --> 05:29:10.320 align:start position:0%
item that we wanted to get clarified
 
05:29:12.990 --> 05:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
into law because there was a lot of
 
05:29:17.310 --> 05:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
confusion over many years that it was
 
05:29:21.270 --> 05:29:21.280 align:start position:0%
prohibited so I am open for
 
05:29:24.708 --> 05:29:24.718 align:start position:0%
questions okay representative
 
05:29:27.150 --> 05:29:27.160 align:start position:0%
Howard thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:29:31.548 --> 05:29:31.558 align:start position:0%
you um representative ktoa I I I um
 
05:29:33.990 --> 05:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
every morning before I come here and or
 
05:29:36.830 --> 05:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
go anywhere I bake at a at a cafe using
 
05:29:38.548 --> 05:29:38.558 align:start position:0%
a large Hobart
 
05:29:41.190 --> 05:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
and um we have a dishwasher big enough
 
05:29:44.150 --> 05:29:44.160 align:start position:0%
to run the run something that size I
 
05:29:46.310 --> 05:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
mean the bowl is you know this this big
 
05:29:48.788 --> 05:29:48.798 align:start position:0%
and the and the paddle that I stir that
 
05:29:51.670 --> 05:29:51.680 align:start position:0%
I use to stir the batter is you know
 
05:29:55.350 --> 05:29:55.360 align:start position:0%
over a foot long and um so so are are
 
05:29:57.830 --> 05:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
you worried at all about
 
05:30:00.270 --> 05:30:00.280 align:start position:0%
keeping getting that kind of stuff clean
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
in a regular kitchen sink
 
05:30:07.030 --> 05:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
so the the the caveat here on what I put
 
05:30:10.750 --> 05:30:10.760 align:start position:0%
in is it is may use commercial equipment
 
05:30:12.990 --> 05:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
so long as the equipment is able to be
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
washed and rinsed in the processing area
 
05:30:18.470 --> 05:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
I don't think you could take a big vat
 
05:30:21.230 --> 05:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
and put it in your sink in a homestead
 
05:30:21.240 --> 05:30:22.430 align:start position:0%
and put it in your sink in a homestead
license

05:30:22.430 --> 05:30:22.440 align:start position:0%
license
 
05:30:25.270 --> 05:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
so that language is there for a very
 
05:30:25.280 --> 05:30:26.830 align:start position:0%
so that language is there for a very
specific

05:30:26.830 --> 05:30:26.840 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:30:29.548 --> 05:30:29.558 align:start position:0%
reason okay any other
 
05:30:32.990 --> 05:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
questions representative uh uh
 
05:30:35.590 --> 05:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
Gruber thank you chair uh thank you
 
05:30:39.070 --> 05:30:39.080 align:start position:0%
representative contest any um bill that
 
05:30:41.430 --> 05:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
makes it easier and more effective for
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
Homestead food operations that do things
 
05:30:45.628 --> 05:30:45.638 align:start position:0%
healthy and carefully and safely is a
 
05:30:47.708 --> 05:30:47.718 align:start position:0%
great ideas so thank you for doing this
 
05:30:50.590 --> 05:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
so uh any ideas you have in the future
 
05:30:52.830 --> 05:30:52.840 align:start position:0%
to help simplify other food operations
 
05:30:55.310 --> 05:30:55.320 align:start position:0%
would be greatly appreciated any comment
 
05:30:57.390 --> 05:30:57.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Gruber for
 
05:30:59.788 --> 05:30:59.798 align:start position:0%
the question and I do agree with you and
 
05:31:01.390 --> 05:31:01.400 align:start position:0%
I think that this committee has been
 
05:31:05.350 --> 05:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
committed in uh to doing
 
05:31:09.708 --> 05:31:09.718 align:start position:0%
that hey representative citis
 
05:31:13.628 --> 05:31:13.638 align:start position:0%
um we work um at our church with a great
 
05:31:15.110 --> 05:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
big huge
 
05:31:19.350 --> 05:31:19.360 align:start position:0%
Hobart and um for our food festival
 
05:31:22.230 --> 05:31:22.240 align:start position:0%
every year and
 
05:31:27.270 --> 05:31:27.280 align:start position:0%
um but I also lived in the Alaska Bush
 
05:31:31.390 --> 05:31:31.400 align:start position:0%
for a while and my sister was a fiend
 
05:31:34.430 --> 05:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
about keeping things clean and she had
 
05:31:37.948 --> 05:31:37.958 align:start position:0%
these big buckets you know you clean
 
05:31:41.190 --> 05:31:41.200 align:start position:0%
urines you bleach and everything but she
 
05:31:43.310 --> 05:31:43.320 align:start position:0%
she managed that their Homestead out
 
05:31:47.750 --> 05:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
there like a a general in the Army and
 
05:31:51.430 --> 05:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
so and don't you think that it's so
 
05:31:56.110 --> 05:31:56.120 align:start position:0%
important to get barriers away so that
 
05:32:00.868 --> 05:32:00.878 align:start position:0%
homesteads can provide food for our
 
05:32:04.230 --> 05:32:04.240 align:start position:0%
people I think it is extremely important
 
05:32:09.070 --> 05:32:09.080 align:start position:0%
in a food insecure state that we do this
 
05:32:11.590 --> 05:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any other
 
05:32:14.708 --> 05:32:14.718 align:start position:0%
questions representative Scully I I have
 
05:32:16.830 --> 05:32:16.840 align:start position:0%
it which is probably what is could be
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
considered a dumb question but if you
 
05:32:22.310 --> 05:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
had a a commercial oven uh that you
 
05:32:24.868 --> 05:32:24.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to you picked up you know in a
 
05:32:27.750 --> 05:32:27.760 align:start position:0%
fire sale and and you brought it home um
 
05:32:29.310 --> 05:32:29.320 align:start position:0%
would that be washed and rinsed would
 
05:32:30.788 --> 05:32:30.798 align:start position:0%
that fall into that definition or would
 
05:32:32.868 --> 05:32:32.878 align:start position:0%
that need to be something
 
05:32:35.868 --> 05:32:35.878 align:start position:0%
different I don't
 
05:32:38.150 --> 05:32:38.160 align:start position:0%
think thank you for the question first
 
05:32:41.830 --> 05:32:41.840 align:start position:0%
off so my understanding and and it could
 
05:32:43.230 --> 05:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
be the same thing with a commercial
 
05:32:45.590 --> 05:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
refrigerator right you don't put a
 
05:32:47.868 --> 05:32:47.878 align:start position:0%
refrigerator even your home refrigerator
 
05:32:50.070 --> 05:32:50.080 align:start position:0%
and your dishwasher and your sink you
 
05:32:53.868 --> 05:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
wash it out by hand basically your oven
 
05:32:56.070 --> 05:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
you clean either it's a self-cleaning or
 
05:32:57.590 --> 05:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
you actually have to physically hand
 
05:32:59.590 --> 05:32:59.600 align:start position:0%
clean that so I would expect that the
 
05:33:01.230 --> 05:33:01.240 align:start position:0%
same would be
 
05:33:03.708 --> 05:33:03.718 align:start position:0%
true okay so you feel like this would
 
05:33:05.190 --> 05:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
not preclude the use of those things
 
05:33:07.390 --> 05:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
this language I feel that that would not
 
05:33:11.190 --> 05:33:11.200 align:start position:0%
preclude them thank you any other
 
05:33:13.548 --> 05:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you
 
05:33:15.548 --> 05:33:15.558 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam

administrator for the food protection
 
05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
section within the Department of Health
 
05:34:05.670 --> 05:34:05.680 align:start position:0%
and Human Services uh the division of
 
05:34:08.628 --> 05:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
public um Health Services
 
05:34:10.150 --> 05:34:10.160 align:start position:0%
um and we're happy to be a resource on
 
05:34:13.430 --> 05:34:13.440 align:start position:0%
this bill um as we understand the the
 
05:34:15.350 --> 05:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
proposed um bill would amend the
 
05:34:18.150 --> 05:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
definition uh of a food Ser uh Homestead
 
05:34:21.868 --> 05:34:21.878 align:start position:0%
food operation in 143a to allow uh for
 
05:34:23.470 --> 05:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
the use of a commercial equipment as
 
05:34:25.190 --> 05:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
long as it can be washed and rinsed in a
 
05:34:27.990 --> 05:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
processing area and then further defines
 
05:34:29.990 --> 05:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
um the definition of commercial
 
05:34:31.868 --> 05:34:31.878 align:start position:0%
equipment the department would like to
 
05:34:35.310 --> 05:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
note that commercial equipment is not
 
05:34:37.868 --> 05:34:37.878 align:start position:0%
prohibited for Homestead food operators
 
05:34:41.030 --> 05:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
in HP 2300 which is the sanitary
 
05:34:43.030 --> 05:34:43.040 align:start position:0%
production and distribution of food
 
05:34:45.350 --> 05:34:45.360 align:start position:0%
rules it states that Homestead food
 
05:34:48.350 --> 05:34:48.360 align:start position:0%
operations shall not be required to have
 
05:34:50.590 --> 05:34:50.600 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment so it opens the
 
05:34:53.230 --> 05:34:53.240 align:start position:0%
door for Homestead producers to use
 
05:34:55.350 --> 05:34:55.360 align:start position:0%
residential equipment instead of being
 
05:34:57.430 --> 05:34:57.440 align:start position:0%
required like retail retail food
 
05:34:59.708 --> 05:34:59.718 align:start position:0%
establishments to have commercial
 
05:35:02.830 --> 05:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
equipment we'd like to note um that the
 
05:35:06.070 --> 05:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
bill as written mentions mentions washed
 
05:35:08.910 --> 05:35:08.920 align:start position:0%
washed and rinsed in a food processing
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
area we would like to note that
 
05:35:14.350 --> 05:35:14.360 align:start position:0%
sanitizing is an important part of uh
 
05:35:18.990 --> 05:35:19.000 align:start position:0%
cleaning and sanitizing equipment um and
 
05:35:22.110 --> 05:35:22.120 align:start position:0%
with we would like to recommend that uh
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
the bill State washed rinsed and
 
05:35:26.990 --> 05:35:27.000 align:start position:0%
sanitizing sanitized in a food
 
05:35:29.628 --> 05:35:29.638 align:start position:0%
processing area provided the equipment
 
05:35:32.030 --> 05:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
can be washed rins and sanitized and for
 
05:35:33.990 --> 05:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
your consideration of adding sanitized
 
05:35:36.310 --> 05:35:36.320 align:start position:0%
to the bill language we do not foresee
 
05:35:39.190 --> 05:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
any food born illness impacts um or
 
05:35:42.830 --> 05:35:42.840 align:start position:0%
impacts to food safety in general I'd be
 
05:35:44.190 --> 05:35:44.200 align:start position:0%
more than happy to take any questions if
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%

thank you madam
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
chairwoman um I would say we would
 
05:36:21.948 --> 05:36:21.958 align:start position:0%
definitely agree with the idea of adding
 
05:36:25.470 --> 05:36:25.480 align:start position:0%
the language of sanitized to the um to
 
05:36:27.590 --> 05:36:27.600 align:start position:0%
the bill I think that's a really
 
05:36:28.948 --> 05:36:28.958 align:start position:0%
something that's really drilled into in
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
food safety is this idea of the three of
 
05:36:33.910 --> 05:36:33.920 align:start position:0%
the you speak closer a process that ends
 
05:36:35.788 --> 05:36:35.798 align:start position:0%
with sanitizing um and I think that
 
05:36:38.470 --> 05:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
would also really help clarify
 
05:36:40.670 --> 05:36:40.680 align:start position:0%
uh the issue with the ovens as well
 
05:36:42.510 --> 05:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
because there are spray sanitizers that
 
05:36:47.190 --> 05:36:47.200 align:start position:0%
are like food food contact surface safe
 
05:36:50.670 --> 05:36:50.680 align:start position:0%
that you use on things like ovens or on
 
05:36:53.868 --> 05:36:53.878 align:start position:0%
um you know countertops or like I have a
 
05:36:55.390 --> 05:36:55.400 align:start position:0%
dough sheeter and that's something that
 
05:36:58.868 --> 05:36:58.878 align:start position:0%
I use on my dough sheeter because the um
 
05:36:59.990 --> 05:37:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's a thing that you use to make
 
05:37:02.110 --> 05:37:02.120 align:start position:0%
croissants so if you don't know what
 
05:37:04.868 --> 05:37:04.878 align:start position:0%
that is um that things that are like too
 
05:37:07.750 --> 05:37:07.760 align:start position:0%
big to fit into a or or are not not the
 
05:37:09.430 --> 05:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
type of equipment that you would wash in
 
05:37:13.310 --> 05:37:13.320 align:start position:0%
a um sink or in a sink or dishwasher so
 
05:37:14.990 --> 05:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
we would definitely I think agree with
 
05:37:18.190 --> 05:37:18.200 align:start position:0%
that yeah um but yeah commercial
 
05:37:22.670 --> 05:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
equipment I think there was a lot
 
05:37:22.680 --> 05:37:24.230 align:start position:0%
equipment I think there was a lot
of

05:37:24.230 --> 05:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:37:26.670 --> 05:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
not unclarity yeah there was a lot of
 
05:37:28.708 --> 05:37:28.718 align:start position:0%
unclarity around commercial equipment
 
05:37:33.590 --> 05:37:33.600 align:start position:0%
for homebased producers in the state um
 
05:37:38.628 --> 05:37:38.638 align:start position:0%
and the website for the D HHS website
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
that gives guidance to Homestead
 
05:37:41.788 --> 05:37:41.798 align:start position:0%
producers for a long time said that
 
05:37:45.430 --> 05:37:45.440 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment was not permitted
 
05:37:47.470 --> 05:37:47.480 align:start position:0%
um even though their own administrative
 
05:37:50.430 --> 05:37:50.440 align:start position:0%
rules said that it was not required and
 
05:37:51.830 --> 05:37:51.840 align:start position:0%
so we're hoping to pass this bill not
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
only to provide Clarity um for us the
 
05:37:56.270 --> 05:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
producers but also to provide Clarity to
 
05:37:59.350 --> 05:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
DHHS that it's not appropriate to make
 
05:38:03.590 --> 05:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
rules um just based on your own whim
 
05:38:06.190 --> 05:38:06.200 align:start position:0%
that their role is to administer the
 
05:38:08.990 --> 05:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
things that the legislature has put into
 
05:38:11.030 --> 05:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
practice um and not just go off on
 
05:38:12.628 --> 05:38:12.638 align:start position:0%
tangents because they don't like home
 
05:38:14.948 --> 05:38:14.958 align:start position:0%
producers or because they think that
 
05:38:17.070 --> 05:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
they have an idea of what they want to
 
05:38:19.788 --> 05:38:19.798 align:start position:0%
do um and to just send a strong message
 
05:38:23.830 --> 05:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
that you cannot just go off book
 
05:38:25.350 --> 05:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
compared to what's in the law and
 
05:38:26.788 --> 05:38:26.798 align:start position:0%
compared to what's in the administrative
 
05:38:30.390 --> 05:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
rules um and tell people to do things
 
05:38:34.110 --> 05:38:34.120 align:start position:0%
that are not in those in in that written
 
05:38:34.120 --> 05:38:35.788 align:start position:0%
that are not in those in in that written
guidance

05:38:35.788 --> 05:38:35.798 align:start position:0%
guidance
 
05:38:39.868 --> 05:38:39.878 align:start position:0%
so just to add on the um the subject of
 
05:38:43.468 --> 05:38:43.478 align:start position:0%
um um sanitizing um you know one of the
 
05:38:45.548 --> 05:38:45.558 align:start position:0%
things that you learn working in
 
05:38:47.190 --> 05:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
commercial food production in any sort
 
05:38:48.708 --> 05:38:48.718 align:start position:0%
of professional environment is that
 
05:38:49.750 --> 05:38:49.760 align:start position:0%
there's a huge difference between
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
cleaning something and wiping it um you
 
05:38:55.310 --> 05:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
can wipe something and it's not clean
 
05:38:56.910 --> 05:38:56.920 align:start position:0%
the idea of cleaning is that you wipe it
 
05:38:59.510 --> 05:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
until it's clean sanitizing kind of is
 
05:39:03.708 --> 05:39:03.718 align:start position:0%
the the stop gap of that um so I
 
05:39:06.150 --> 05:39:06.160 align:start position:0%
definitely understand the desire to add
 
05:39:08.788 --> 05:39:08.798 align:start position:0%
that and totally support it I think the
 
05:39:09.868 --> 05:39:09.878 align:start position:0%
step of
 
05:39:12.990 --> 05:39:13.000 align:start position:0%
sanitization um tends to add uh an
 
05:39:14.510 --> 05:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
assumption that you're going to use some
 
05:39:16.990 --> 05:39:17.000 align:start position:0%
somewhat different products um if you're
 
05:39:19.310 --> 05:39:19.320 align:start position:0%
talking about cleaning and rinsing you
 
05:39:21.750 --> 05:39:21.760 align:start position:0%
literally could be using hot water um
 
05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
but in this case in order to sanitize
 
05:39:25.430 --> 05:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
there's another layer of something you
 
05:39:29.230 --> 05:39:29.240 align:start position:0%
have to add whether it's some whe yeah
 
05:39:32.830 --> 05:39:32.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so there I totally support that um
 
05:39:33.750 --> 05:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
the other thing with the commercial
 
05:39:36.350 --> 05:39:36.360 align:start position:0%
equipment is that um you know when we
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
start talking about food safety and uh I
 
05:39:41.110 --> 05:39:41.120 align:start position:0%
know DHHS in their testimony said that
 
05:39:44.190 --> 05:39:44.200 align:start position:0%
they didn't foresee any changes um
 
05:39:46.670 --> 05:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
affecting food safety which um I have to
 
05:39:49.070 --> 05:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
actually slightly disagree because I
 
05:39:50.868 --> 05:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
think if you make it clear to people
 
05:39:53.070 --> 05:39:53.080 align:start position:0%
that they can use commercial equipment
 
05:39:56.868 --> 05:39:56.878 align:start position:0%
you are improving their opportunity to
 
05:39:59.628 --> 05:39:59.638 align:start position:0%
uh make their food safe
 
05:40:02.150 --> 05:40:02.160 align:start position:0%
significantly because the two most
 
05:40:04.150 --> 05:40:04.160 align:start position:0%
important components in food safety are
 
05:40:07.510 --> 05:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
time and temperature and the thing in
 
05:40:09.350 --> 05:40:09.360 align:start position:0%
any kitchen which affects those two
 
05:40:12.430 --> 05:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
components most is the refrigeration so
 
05:40:14.628 --> 05:40:14.638 align:start position:0%
the ability to install a commercial
 
05:40:16.430 --> 05:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
refrigerator even if you want to throw
 
05:40:17.948 --> 05:40:17.958 align:start position:0%
in a requirement that it be on its own
 
05:40:19.830 --> 05:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
circuit which I think is a good idea as
 
05:40:21.030 --> 05:40:21.040 align:start position:0%
someone who used to work with
 
05:40:21.040 --> 05:40:22.910 align:start position:0%
someone who used to work with
electricity

05:40:22.910 --> 05:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
electricity
 
05:40:25.750 --> 05:40:25.760 align:start position:0%
um I I even if you want to make that
 
05:40:27.510 --> 05:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
requirement having a commercial
 
05:40:29.990 --> 05:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
refrigerator you are increasing by
 
05:40:32.150 --> 05:40:32.160 align:start position:0%
orders of magnitude your ability to cool
 
05:40:34.390 --> 05:40:34.400 align:start position:0%
large amounts of food in a safe time
 
05:40:37.788 --> 05:40:37.798 align:start position:0%
period so um I I definitely
 
05:40:40.270 --> 05:40:40.280 align:start position:0%
think that this is making this clear to
 
05:40:41.868 --> 05:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
people who want to be Homestead food
 
05:40:45.390 --> 05:40:45.400 align:start position:0%
operators saying um saying that they can
 
05:40:47.070 --> 05:40:47.080 align:start position:0%
can use commercial equipment is just
 
05:40:50.310 --> 05:40:50.320 align:start position:0%
encouraging them to be more safe okay
 
05:40:53.590 --> 05:40:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions represent of H
 
05:40:55.468 --> 05:40:55.478 align:start position:0%
Haskins thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:40:57.868 --> 05:40:57.878 align:start position:0%
you again for your testimony I guess
 
05:41:00.270 --> 05:41:00.280 align:start position:0%
I've been doing a lot of wiping down in
 
05:41:03.990 --> 05:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
my own kitchen and I'm not clear is
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
sanitizing in your mind does that
 
05:41:09.070 --> 05:41:09.080 align:start position:0%
involve chemicals rather than heat or
 
05:41:11.708 --> 05:41:11.718 align:start position:0%
what what makes something sanitized
 
05:41:13.868 --> 05:41:13.878 align:start position:0%
Andie made a comment away from the mic
 
05:41:15.910 --> 05:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
that I didn't hear oh oh um there are
 
05:41:17.788 --> 05:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
certain temperatures and times that you
 
05:41:19.788 --> 05:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
can you know like if you think about
 
05:41:21.270 --> 05:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
commercial dishwashers you can either
 
05:41:23.510 --> 05:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
have a hot water dishwasher or you can
 
05:41:26.468 --> 05:41:26.478 align:start position:0%
have a um a
 
05:41:30.868 --> 05:41:30.878 align:start position:0%
um chemical dishwasher um and so there
 
05:41:32.670 --> 05:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
is a lot of guidelines about how to
 
05:41:34.830 --> 05:41:34.840 align:start position:0%
sanitize different types of equipment um
 
05:41:36.670 --> 05:41:36.680 align:start position:0%
and it really depends on what you're
 
05:41:36.680 --> 05:41:38.310 align:start position:0%
and it really depends on what you're
cleaning

05:41:38.310 --> 05:41:38.320 align:start position:0%
cleaning
 
05:41:41.708 --> 05:41:41.718 align:start position:0%
um but yeah I mean I
 
05:41:45.350 --> 05:41:45.360 align:start position:0%
think typically you do use some sort of
 
05:41:48.628 --> 05:41:48.638 align:start position:0%
chemical um but it's not I mean it's not
 
05:41:50.590 --> 05:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
like a heart it's not these are food
 
05:41:53.390 --> 05:41:53.400 align:start position:0%
safe things that are nationally you know
 
05:41:56.310 --> 05:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
certified by yeah there's so so there's
 
05:41:57.708 --> 05:41:57.718 align:start position:0%
a lot of options there's a lot of
 
05:42:01.110 --> 05:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
options for sanitizing um surfaces and
 
05:42:04.190 --> 05:42:04.200 align:start position:0%
Equipment um and there are plenty of
 
05:42:07.270 --> 05:42:07.280 align:start position:0%
biodegradable septic safe sanitizing
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
agents that exist there are naturally
 
05:42:11.670 --> 05:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
occurring agents that um can be had
 
05:42:13.590 --> 05:42:13.600 align:start position:0%
there are whole there's a whole segment
 
05:42:16.830 --> 05:42:16.840 align:start position:0%
of of the cleaning products industry
 
05:42:19.590 --> 05:42:19.600 align:start position:0%
that is geared toward producing that for
 
05:42:22.150 --> 05:42:22.160 align:start position:0%
commercial equipment um so you know you
 
05:42:24.670 --> 05:42:24.680 align:start position:0%
can you can one of the things I used to
 
05:42:26.270 --> 05:42:26.280 align:start position:0%
do working in restaurants is if I was
 
05:42:27.788 --> 05:42:27.798 align:start position:0%
interviewing I would evaluate a place on
 
05:42:29.390 --> 05:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
their commitment to sustainability by
 
05:42:30.708 --> 05:42:30.718 align:start position:0%
looking at the chemicals they used in
 
05:42:33.628 --> 05:42:33.638 align:start position:0%
their kitchen so um there's definitely a
 
05:42:34.670 --> 05:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
lot of options for people that don't
 
05:42:36.110 --> 05:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
want to use harsh chemicals you can
 
05:42:37.510 --> 05:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
spray everything down with bleach also
 
05:42:39.868 --> 05:42:39.878 align:start position:0%
if you'd like um I personally don't work
 
05:42:41.430 --> 05:42:41.440 align:start position:0%
that way I don't think it's I don't
 
05:42:43.628 --> 05:42:43.638 align:start position:0%
think that's the way to go but um you
 
05:42:45.830 --> 05:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
know everybody can kind of set there are
 
05:42:47.628 --> 05:42:47.638 align:start position:0%
a lot of options within what is
 
05:42:49.548 --> 05:42:49.558 align:start position:0%
generally professionally accepted for
 
05:42:52.350 --> 05:42:52.360 align:start position:0%
sanitizing surfaces in kitchens and
 
05:42:54.110 --> 05:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
equipment in kitchens that that allow
 
05:42:56.150 --> 05:42:56.160 align:start position:0%
you to kind of work within your own
 
05:42:58.430 --> 05:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
ethics um so you wouldn't be requiring
 
05:43:00.628 --> 05:43:00.638 align:start position:0%
people to use harsh destructive
 
05:43:03.468 --> 05:43:03.478 align:start position:0%
chemicals um in saying that uh you want
 
05:43:05.708 --> 05:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
them to sanitize and you know um you
 
05:43:07.150 --> 05:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
know to her point I was going to I was
 
05:43:08.270 --> 05:43:08.280 align:start position:0%
actually going to mention that there's
 
05:43:09.910 --> 05:43:09.920 align:start position:0%
high temp and low temp dishwashers and
 
05:43:11.708 --> 05:43:11.718 align:start position:0%
and as someone who worked with wine I
 
05:43:13.190 --> 05:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
don't want chemicals touching the
 
05:43:15.750 --> 05:43:15.760 align:start position:0%
glasswar if it's Crystal it's porous it
 
05:43:17.150 --> 05:43:17.160 align:start position:0%
gets in it and it affects the flavor so
 
05:43:19.110 --> 05:43:19.120 align:start position:0%
we always used high temp dishwashers so
 
05:43:21.110 --> 05:43:21.120 align:start position:0%
you have those options um you know a
 
05:43:22.788 --> 05:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
high temp dishwasher can fit under your
 
05:43:25.468 --> 05:43:25.478 align:start position:0%
counter well yeah and a lot of
 
05:43:27.150 --> 05:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
residential dishwashers now have high
 
05:43:29.590 --> 05:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
temp Cycles so like our dishwasher in
 
05:43:31.628 --> 05:43:31.638 align:start position:0%
our old house had a sanitized cycle
 
05:43:32.788 --> 05:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
where it was definitely going to hit a
 
05:43:35.270 --> 05:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
certain point there's um there's like
 
05:43:37.190 --> 05:43:37.200 align:start position:0%
these little test strips that you can
 
05:43:39.670 --> 05:43:39.680 align:start position:0%
put in with your dishes that will like
 
05:43:41.750 --> 05:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
turn a color if you've reached a certain
 
05:43:43.750 --> 05:43:43.760 align:start position:0%
temperature um there's all kinds of like
 
05:43:45.350 --> 05:43:45.360 align:start position:0%
cool stuff that you can do to make sure
 
05:43:47.948 --> 05:43:47.958 align:start position:0%
that you're sanitizing properly thank
 
05:43:52.070 --> 05:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions from the
 
05:43:54.270 --> 05:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
05:43:57.390 --> 05:43:57.400 align:start position:0%
none thank you I have no other thank you
 
05:43:59.628 --> 05:43:59.638 align:start position:0%
very much sure I have no other pink
 
05:44:02.830 --> 05:44:02.840 align:start position:0%
cards for
 
05:44:02.840 --> 05:44:04.548 align:start position:0%
cards for
hb150

05:44:04.548 --> 05:44:04.558 align:start position:0%
hb150
 
05:44:08.150 --> 05:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
um and I have the blue sheet and
 
05:44:12.510 --> 05:44:12.520 align:start position:0%
also we have support for this bill
 
05:44:17.548 --> 05:44:17.558 align:start position:0%
online 35 in support uh one opposition
 
05:44:17.558 --> 05:44:18.510 align:start position:0%
online 35 in support uh one opposition
one

05:44:18.510 --> 05:44:18.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
05:44:21.468 --> 05:44:21.478 align:start position:0%
neutral and on our pink sheet I believe
 
05:44:23.670 --> 05:44:23.680 align:start position:0%
there is
 
05:44:26.030 --> 05:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
blank thank
 
05:44:31.310 --> 05:44:31.320 align:start position:0%
you okay any I'm going to close the
 
05:44:34.788 --> 05:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:38.390 --> 05:44:38.400 align:start position:0%
hb150 and again um we've
 
05:44:40.510 --> 05:44:40.520 align:start position:0%
uh We've
 
05:44:42.548 --> 05:44:42.558 align:start position:0%
uh got 10
 
05:44:45.350 --> 05:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
minutes this bill is I guess going to
 
05:44:48.590 --> 05:44:48.600 align:start position:0%
have an amendment to add the
 
05:44:51.030 --> 05:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
sanitization uh probably can't get in
 
05:44:53.910 --> 05:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
which we can't get in 10 minutes so I'm
 
05:44:57.868 --> 05:44:57.878 align:start position:0%
going to recommend that um we amend this
 
05:45:01.830 --> 05:45:01.840 align:start position:0%
bill to add uh the sanitizing thing to
 
05:45:05.750 --> 05:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
it sanitization wording to it uh we
 
05:45:07.468 --> 05:45:07.478 align:start position:0%
bring this back for our committee work
 
05:45:09.590 --> 05:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
session next week and I'm believe we
 
05:45:12.350 --> 05:45:12.360 align:start position:0%
will be able to EXA that bill along with
 
05:45:14.070 --> 05:45:14.080 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of others tomorrow uh next
 
05:45:16.548 --> 05:45:16.558 align:start position:0%
week as well that sound like a
 
05:45:21.030 --> 05:45:21.040 align:start position:0%
plan alrighty okay so uh let us take a
 
05:45:24.270 --> 05:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
break again for a good 10 minutes uh
 
05:45:27.310 --> 05:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
stretch your legs and we will come back
 
05:45:35.910 --> 05:45:35.920 align:start position:0%

HB

05:58:21.110 --> 05:58:21.120 align:start position:0%
HB
 
05:58:24.030 --> 05:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
307 relative to the food production area
 
05:58:26.590 --> 05:58:26.600 align:start position:0%
for Homestead food and here to introduce
 
05:58:29.430 --> 05:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
the bill to us is representative Bixby
 
05:58:31.430 --> 05:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair for the record
 
05:58:33.910 --> 05:58:33.920 align:start position:0%
Peter Bixby straford County
 
05:58:37.190 --> 05:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
13 uh Dober New Hampshire
 
05:58:41.788 --> 05:58:41.798 align:start position:0%
and uh as with uh the other bills that
 
05:58:43.430 --> 05:58:43.440 align:start position:0%
we've been hearing today this came out
 
05:58:47.990 --> 05:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
of the same interim study uh uh relative
 
05:58:51.468 --> 05:58:51.478 align:start position:0%
to um Homestead foods and one of the
 
05:58:53.788 --> 05:58:53.798 align:start position:0%
questions that was raised during that
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
those uh sessions was uh why uh why the
 
05:59:02.468 --> 05:59:02.478 align:start position:0%
kitchen is the only uh place in the home
 
05:59:04.510 --> 05:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
where one could be producing Homestead
 
05:59:06.670 --> 05:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
Foods um and
 
05:59:10.510 --> 05:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
uh because you some people have uh area
 
05:59:11.868 --> 05:59:11.878 align:start position:0%
set up in their house where they might
 
05:59:13.510 --> 05:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
be doing home brewing or that sort of
 
05:59:17.510 --> 05:59:17.520 align:start position:0%
thing and that those areas have um
 
05:59:20.590 --> 05:59:20.600 align:start position:0%
necessary sanitation equipment necessary
 
05:59:21.708 --> 05:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
uh water
 
05:59:24.468 --> 05:59:24.478 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and uh would that you
 
05:59:26.830 --> 05:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
know why would that not be appropriate
 
05:59:30.708 --> 05:59:30.718 align:start position:0%
for um for producing home inead food uh
 
05:59:34.590 --> 05:59:34.600 align:start position:0%
the statute currently reads that uh that
 
05:59:36.830 --> 05:59:36.840 align:start position:0%
it h that the food has to be produced in
 
05:59:42.190 --> 05:59:42.200 align:start position:0%
a kitchen um so uh what the what this B
 
05:59:48.150 --> 05:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
Bill does is it uh changes that to um
 
05:59:50.350 --> 05:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
home uh Homestead food operation means a
 
05:59:52.430 --> 05:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
person who produces Homestead food
 
05:59:54.430 --> 05:59:54.440 align:start position:0%
products excluding potentially hazardous
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
food only in the home kitchen of that
 
05:59:59.070 --> 05:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
person's primary residence in New
 
06:00:01.750 --> 06:00:01.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire or a food production area in
 
06:00:03.468 --> 06:00:03.478 align:start position:0%
the person's primary residence that
 
06:00:05.430 --> 06:00:05.440 align:start position:0%
meets the water supply and sanitary
 
06:00:07.708 --> 06:00:07.718 align:start position:0%
requirements established in rules
 
06:00:10.270 --> 06:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
adopted under RSA
 
06:00:12.868 --> 06:00:12.878 align:start position:0%
541a uh and those rules would be the
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
essentially the sanitation rules uh for
 
06:00:19.548 --> 06:00:19.558 align:start position:0%
that uh for food production that um
 
06:00:23.910 --> 06:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
governs all of that um basically CS the
 
06:00:27.830 --> 06:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
in the food safety code uh so uh and
 
06:00:29.548 --> 06:00:29.558 align:start position:0%
then the second paragraph of it
 
06:00:31.948 --> 06:00:31.958 align:start position:0%
essentially just makes the that
 
06:00:34.670 --> 06:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
following paragraph consistent with with
 
06:00:40.230 --> 06:00:40.240 align:start position:0%
a uh so uh that's the so the the main
 
06:00:44.750 --> 06:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
gist of this is that um and you just uh
 
06:00:46.548 --> 06:00:46.558 align:start position:0%
increasing the number of options for
 
06:00:50.310 --> 06:00:50.320 align:start position:0%
where someone can uh produce food in
 
06:00:54.548 --> 06:00:54.558 align:start position:0%
their home uh and uh it might make it
 
06:00:56.788 --> 06:00:56.798 align:start position:0%
more efficient uh in a different area of
 
06:00:59.468 --> 06:00:59.478 align:start position:0%
the home than the kitchen uh depending
 
06:01:01.868 --> 06:01:01.878 align:start position:0%
on a per the particular setup of the of
 
06:01:06.390 --> 06:01:06.400 align:start position:0%
the home um this one uh unlike the ones
 
06:01:09.430 --> 06:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
that I brought earlier there were uh the
 
06:01:11.110 --> 06:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
when I spoke with the food Protective
 
06:01:13.468 --> 06:01:13.478 align:start position:0%
Services uh they had some reservations
 
06:01:16.830 --> 06:01:16.840 align:start position:0%
about this I uh if they still have those
 
06:01:18.868 --> 06:01:18.878 align:start position:0%
reservations then they are probably
 
06:01:21.750 --> 06:01:21.760 align:start position:0%
better uh to is probably better for them
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
to explain them than me than I uh but um
 
06:01:29.590 --> 06:01:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things that occurred to me uh
 
06:01:31.670 --> 06:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
when I was thinking about this you know
 
06:01:34.830 --> 06:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
my testimony was that uh another option
 
06:01:37.070 --> 06:01:37.080 align:start position:0%
rather than what the phrasing that I had
 
06:01:40.788 --> 06:01:40.798 align:start position:0%
would be simply to um put in a
 
06:01:42.868 --> 06:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
definition of kitchen that could apply
 
06:01:45.788 --> 06:01:45.798 align:start position:0%
to more than one space in the house so
 
06:01:47.150 --> 06:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
you could have two kitchens in your
 
06:01:49.628 --> 06:01:49.638 align:start position:0%
house and in fact uh this is something
 
06:01:52.750 --> 06:01:52.760 align:start position:0%
that is not uncommon for Orthodox Jewish
 
06:01:57.230 --> 06:01:57.240 align:start position:0%
families uh because under um uh kosher
 
06:02:00.990 --> 06:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
rules uh you can't mix Dairy and meat
 
06:02:04.590 --> 06:02:04.600 align:start position:0%
and uh for those who can afford it it uh
 
06:02:06.548 --> 06:02:06.558 align:start position:0%
they will have one kitchen where they
 
06:02:09.310 --> 06:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
produce uh food that involves meat and
 
06:02:12.230 --> 06:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
another that involves uh food that is
 
06:02:15.468 --> 06:02:15.478 align:start position:0%
either uh has dairy in it or has
 
06:02:17.190 --> 06:02:17.200 align:start position:0%
ingredients that are neither dairy or
 
06:02:19.270 --> 06:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
food Dairy nor meat uh which would be
 
06:02:22.510 --> 06:02:22.520 align:start position:0%
called parva uh but uh this is this is
 
06:02:25.788 --> 06:02:25.798 align:start position:0%
something that has uh been done for I
 
06:02:29.510 --> 06:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
think centuries so um so having two
 
06:02:31.750 --> 06:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
kitchens would not be a weird thing if
 
06:02:33.510 --> 06:02:33.520 align:start position:0%
if the particular phrasing of this bill
 
06:02:35.548 --> 06:02:35.558 align:start position:0%
is problematic perhaps we can amend it
 
06:02:38.070 --> 06:02:38.080 align:start position:0%
to involve defining kitchens so that
 
06:02:39.510 --> 06:02:39.520 align:start position:0%
there could be more than one Kitchen in
 
06:02:39.520 --> 06:02:40.830 align:start position:0%
there could be more than one Kitchen in
a

06:02:40.830 --> 06:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
a
 
06:02:43.350 --> 06:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
house thank you representative Bixby
 
06:02:45.990 --> 06:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
question by representative King thank
 
06:02:47.310 --> 06:02:47.320 align:start position:0%
you madam chair thank you for taking
 
06:02:49.948 --> 06:02:49.958 align:start position:0%
questions um you started to touch on
 
06:02:51.430 --> 06:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
that the idea that a person might have
 
06:02:54.590 --> 06:02:54.600 align:start position:0%
multiple kitchens so I'm just wondering
 
06:02:56.990 --> 06:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
if instead of that all extra line about
 
06:02:58.750 --> 06:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
a food production area you just put
 
06:03:01.910 --> 06:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
kitchen or kitchens or you actually do
 
06:03:03.788 --> 06:03:03.798 align:start position:0%
mean a food production area and I'm just
 
06:03:06.070 --> 06:03:06.080 align:start position:0%
wondering I'm just trying to think some
 
06:03:07.628 --> 06:03:07.638 align:start position:0%
examples in my mind of what a food
 
06:03:08.990 --> 06:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
production area would look like that's
 
06:03:10.510 --> 06:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
not a kitchen I'm thinking like an
 
06:03:13.590 --> 06:03:13.600 align:start position:0%
outdoor you know barbecue patio like
 
06:03:16.548 --> 06:03:16.558 align:start position:0%
like an outdoor kind of kitchen what can
 
06:03:18.350 --> 06:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
you give me some examples of what a food
 
06:03:20.150 --> 06:03:20.160 align:start position:0%
production area looks like to you that's
 
06:03:22.910 --> 06:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
not a kitchen okay so uh I guess I I
 
06:03:24.390 --> 06:03:24.400 align:start position:0%
briefly touched on the idea of home
 
06:03:27.590 --> 06:03:27.600 align:start position:0%
brewing so uh if you're doing home
 
06:03:30.030 --> 06:03:30.040 align:start position:0%
brewing then you need an area where you
 
06:03:33.590 --> 06:03:33.600 align:start position:0%
can heat things and cool things and you
 
06:03:36.708 --> 06:03:36.718 align:start position:0%
need to have a uh consistent water
 
06:03:38.788 --> 06:03:38.798 align:start position:0%
supply you need to have the capacity to
 
06:03:43.030 --> 06:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
sanitize everything you need to um uh
 
06:03:45.590 --> 06:03:45.600 align:start position:0%
you need to have appropriate uh drainage
 
06:03:49.868 --> 06:03:49.878 align:start position:0%
for Wastewater uh which is basically um
 
06:03:52.110 --> 06:03:52.120 align:start position:0%
mostly that that's most of what you have
 
06:03:53.670 --> 06:03:53.680 align:start position:0%
in a kitchen it's and if you wanted to
 
06:03:58.830 --> 06:03:58.840 align:start position:0%
be if you wanted to uh make
 
06:04:02.270 --> 06:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
um do homemade jam there uh you have the
 
06:04:05.788 --> 06:04:05.798 align:start position:0%
heating elements you have the uh you
 
06:04:07.590 --> 06:04:07.600 align:start position:0%
basically have everything you would need
 
06:04:10.788 --> 06:04:10.798 align:start position:0%
to do the canning uh and the and the and
 
06:04:12.990 --> 06:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
the cooking off of the jelly in that
 
06:04:18.390 --> 06:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
area as well so um so that that's uh
 
06:04:19.868 --> 06:04:19.878 align:start position:0%
that would be an example of something
 
06:04:22.590 --> 06:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
like that um whether that would actually
 
06:04:24.468 --> 06:04:24.478 align:start position:0%
def be defined as a second kitchen I'm
 
06:04:24.478 --> 06:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
def be defined as a second kitchen I'm
not

06:04:25.190 --> 06:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:04:28.270 --> 06:04:28.280 align:start position:0%
sure okay um I invite representative
 
06:04:31.590 --> 06:04:31.600 align:start position:0%
wheeler to please take a seat thank you
 
06:04:32.708 --> 06:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
and I have a question from
 
06:04:32.718 --> 06:04:33.910 align:start position:0%
and I have a question from
representative

06:04:33.910 --> 06:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:04:36.708 --> 06:04:36.718 align:start position:0%
guber uh yes thank you very much for
 
06:04:36.718 --> 06:04:38.548 align:start position:0%
guber uh yes thank you very much for
testifying

06:04:38.548 --> 06:04:38.558 align:start position:0%
testifying
 
06:04:41.548 --> 06:04:41.558 align:start position:0%
um the definition of a
 
06:04:44.830 --> 06:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
home uh food production area would that
 
06:04:47.150 --> 06:04:47.160 align:start position:0%
include uh for example I have a small
 
06:04:49.430 --> 06:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
Winery off part of my house a wing where
 
06:04:51.510 --> 06:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
I make wine and I also have a sugar
 
06:04:54.310 --> 06:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
house and I make maple syrup uh would
 
06:04:56.270 --> 06:04:56.280 align:start position:0%
that would a sugar house also be part of
 
06:04:58.868 --> 06:04:58.878 align:start position:0%
a food production area at at my
 
06:05:01.510 --> 06:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
Homestead or how does that work um it
 
06:05:04.990 --> 06:05:05.000 align:start position:0%
could be yes um those all be considered
 
06:05:07.628 --> 06:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
uh food production areas yes and and it
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
would also need to have the you know the
 
06:05:12.110 --> 06:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
necessary infrastructure in terms of
 
06:05:14.230 --> 06:05:14.240 align:start position:0%
water supply and in terms of waste water
 
06:05:16.750 --> 06:05:16.760 align:start position:0%
and in terms of Sanitation which you I
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
would guess that uh your um your sugar
 
06:05:22.788 --> 06:05:22.798 align:start position:0%
house probably has that so I would just
 
06:05:25.310 --> 06:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
follow up with maybe food production
 
06:05:27.468 --> 06:05:27.478 align:start position:0%
area is worthwhile because these aren't
 
06:05:30.628 --> 06:05:30.638 align:start position:0%
usually referred to as kitchens okay yes
 
06:05:32.350 --> 06:05:32.360 align:start position:0%
that's good
 
06:05:34.468 --> 06:05:34.478 align:start position:0%
point representative
 
06:05:37.390 --> 06:05:37.400 align:start position:0%
comto uh thank you representative Bixby
 
06:05:39.468 --> 06:05:39.478 align:start position:0%
and thank you for this I think we're
 
06:05:40.830 --> 06:05:40.840 align:start position:0%
missing something here when we're
 
06:05:44.030 --> 06:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
talking about this because what it says
 
06:05:48.030 --> 06:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
here is a food or a food production area
 
06:05:51.350 --> 06:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
in the person's primary residence I
 
06:05:54.430 --> 06:05:54.440 align:start position:0%
think the key there is primary residence
 
06:05:58.110 --> 06:05:58.120 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say you do you would would
 
06:06:01.750 --> 06:06:01.760 align:start position:0%
you agree with that yes yes so I I think
 
06:06:04.708 --> 06:06:04.718 align:start position:0%
that might in fact not preclude the
 
06:06:08.390 --> 06:06:08.400 align:start position:0%
Sugar House but um but but uh depending
 
06:06:11.510 --> 06:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
on if your Winery was in fact in a if
 
06:06:13.628 --> 06:06:13.638 align:start position:0%
it's if it's attached then that would in
 
06:06:13.638 --> 06:06:16.110 align:start position:0%
it's if it's attached then that would in
fact

06:06:16.110 --> 06:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
fact
 
06:06:19.270 --> 06:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
qualify okay any other questions from
 
06:06:19.280 --> 06:06:21.430 align:start position:0%
qualify okay any other questions from
the

06:06:21.430 --> 06:06:21.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:06:23.548 --> 06:06:23.558 align:start position:0%
committee seeing
 
06:06:26.030 --> 06:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
none thank you for introducing the bill
 
06:06:29.468 --> 06:06:29.478 align:start position:0%
to us and let's call Erica Davis and
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:53.548 --> 06:06:53.558 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
06:06:54.948 --> 06:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
and again thank you for the opportunity
 
06:06:57.670 --> 06:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
to speak on House Bill 307 for the
 
06:06:59.708 --> 06:06:59.718 align:start position:0%
record my name is Erica Davis I'm the
 
06:07:01.230 --> 06:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
administrator for the food protection
 
06:07:03.150 --> 06:07:03.160 align:start position:0%
section within the Department of Health
 
06:07:05.270 --> 06:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
and Human Services Division of Public
 
06:07:07.468 --> 06:07:07.478 align:start position:0%
Health Health Services um while the
 
06:07:08.990 --> 06:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
department does not have a position on
 
06:07:11.548 --> 06:07:11.558 align:start position:0%
this bill um we do have some concerns
 
06:07:14.910 --> 06:07:14.920 align:start position:0%
with um the food safety concerns with
 
06:07:17.788 --> 06:07:17.798 align:start position:0%
the bill should it be enacted as is the
 
06:07:19.670 --> 06:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
purpose of this bill would be to modify
 
06:07:20.990 --> 06:07:21.000 align:start position:0%
the definition of Homestead food
 
06:07:24.070 --> 06:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
operations to allow for food production
 
06:07:27.590 --> 06:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
in other areas of the person's primary
 
06:07:30.708 --> 06:07:30.718 align:start position:0%
residence the change to RSA
 
06:07:34.350 --> 06:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
143 um a12 would require other areas to
 
06:07:37.190 --> 06:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
meet water um and sanitary requirements
 
06:07:39.548 --> 06:07:39.558 align:start position:0%
established in rule however the
 
06:07:42.310 --> 06:07:42.320 align:start position:0%
homestead standards required in our rule
 
06:07:45.750 --> 06:07:45.760 align:start position:0%
which is HP 2300 rely on the use of a
 
06:07:48.590 --> 06:07:48.600 align:start position:0%
residential kitchen assuming that the
 
06:07:51.350 --> 06:07:51.360 align:start position:0%
water supply and sanitary conditions for
 
06:07:53.628 --> 06:07:53.638 align:start position:0%
the food protection or food production
 
06:07:56.628 --> 06:07:56.638 align:start position:0%
area are already established and that
 
06:07:58.788 --> 06:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
residential kitchens naturally meet the
 
06:08:00.628 --> 06:08:00.638 align:start position:0%
requirements for maintaining a clean and
 
06:08:00.638 --> 06:08:02.628 align:start position:0%
requirements for maintaining a clean and
sanitary

06:08:02.628 --> 06:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
sanitary
 
06:08:05.150 --> 06:08:05.160 align:start position:0%
environment if this bill was enacted as
 
06:08:07.510 --> 06:08:07.520 align:start position:0%
it with no specific requirement for
 
06:08:09.430 --> 06:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
these areas to be part of a kitchen it
 
06:08:11.628 --> 06:08:11.638 align:start position:0%
could unintentionally allow for the use
 
06:08:14.070 --> 06:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
of a space such as like a garage or a
 
06:08:16.190 --> 06:08:16.200 align:start position:0%
basement um to be used for food
 
06:08:19.110 --> 06:08:19.120 align:start position:0%
protection uh food production I'm sorry
 
06:08:22.230 --> 06:08:22.240 align:start position:0%
um often these spaces do not have um or
 
06:08:24.270 --> 06:08:24.280 align:start position:0%
have not been outfitted um to have
 
06:08:26.788 --> 06:08:26.798 align:start position:0%
cleanable floors walls and ceilings and
 
06:08:29.110 --> 06:08:29.120 align:start position:0%
may allow for the entry of rodents or
 
06:08:31.190 --> 06:08:31.200 align:start position:0%
pest may not be equipped to handle the
 
06:08:33.670 --> 06:08:33.680 align:start position:0%
food prod food production in a sanitary
 
06:08:33.680 --> 06:08:36.590 align:start position:0%
food prod food production in a sanitary
manner

06:08:36.590 --> 06:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
manner
 
06:08:39.070 --> 06:08:39.080 align:start position:0%
for retail food establishments who are
 
06:08:42.548 --> 06:08:42.558 align:start position:0%
building a new food production
 
06:08:45.270 --> 06:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
area or remodeling a current food
 
06:08:47.510 --> 06:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
production area they are required to
 
06:08:50.868 --> 06:08:50.878 align:start position:0%
submit a floor plan application which
 
06:08:52.868 --> 06:08:52.878 align:start position:0%
gives us the ability to review the new
 
06:08:55.390 --> 06:08:55.400 align:start position:0%
space to ensure that all the the water
 
06:08:57.548 --> 06:08:57.558 align:start position:0%
and sanitary requirements are met for
 
06:09:01.150 --> 06:09:01.160 align:start position:0%
the space if this bill is enacted as is
 
06:09:02.510 --> 06:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
there would be no requirement for
 
06:09:05.868 --> 06:09:05.878 align:start position:0%
homesteads to submit any sort of plann
 
06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
to ensure that the food production space
 
06:09:11.548 --> 06:09:11.558 align:start position:0%
would have the the requirements for um a
 
06:09:11.558 --> 06:09:13.468 align:start position:0%
would have the the requirements for um a
sanitary

06:09:13.468 --> 06:09:13.478 align:start position:0%
sanitary
 
06:09:16.310 --> 06:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
environment um and we would like to note
 
06:09:19.430 --> 06:09:19.440 align:start position:0%
that exempt homesteads so homesteads
 
06:09:21.430 --> 06:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
that do not require licensing or
 
06:09:23.270 --> 06:09:23.280 align:start position:0%
inspection from the Department would
 
06:09:27.590 --> 06:09:27.600 align:start position:0%
have um again less less oversight um for
 
06:09:31.510 --> 06:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
those uh food food production
 
06:09:35.628 --> 06:09:35.638 align:start position:0%
areas so I am happy to answer any
 
06:09:37.868 --> 06:09:37.878 align:start position:0%
questions um and thank you for the
 
06:09:39.468 --> 06:09:39.478 align:start position:0%
opportunity to share our concerns
 
06:09:41.510 --> 06:09:41.520 align:start position:0%
representative King thank you madam
 
06:09:44.270 --> 06:09:44.280 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking questions um
 
06:09:45.510 --> 06:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
I'm just a little confused I'm hoping
 
06:09:47.548 --> 06:09:47.558 align:start position:0%
you can give me some real world examples
 
06:09:49.230 --> 06:09:49.240 align:start position:0%
but you're talking about how somebody
 
06:09:51.590 --> 06:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
could say produce food in like their
 
06:09:54.430 --> 06:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
garage but not meet safety standards but
 
06:09:56.590 --> 06:09:56.600 align:start position:0%
here it I mean it seems like it says
 
06:09:58.270 --> 06:09:58.280 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't be allowed to do that
 
06:10:00.230 --> 06:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
unless they met the water supply and
 
06:10:03.788 --> 06:10:03.798 align:start position:0%
sanitary requirements so I'm just like
 
06:10:05.430 --> 06:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
let's I'm just imagining let's say
 
06:10:07.230 --> 06:10:07.240 align:start position:0%
somebody was butchering meat in their
 
06:10:10.070 --> 06:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
garage um but they had adequate water
 
06:10:12.468 --> 06:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
supply and met the sanitary requirements
 
06:10:14.310 --> 06:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
established in rules adopted under RSA
 
06:10:16.310 --> 06:10:16.320 align:start position:0%
blah blah blah um can you give me an
 
06:10:20.948 --> 06:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:26.190 --> 06:10:26.200 align:start position:0%
okay so in HP 2300 which is is the
 
06:10:29.708 --> 06:10:29.718 align:start position:0%
food um rules under the homestead
 
06:10:32.830 --> 06:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
section it build it builds on the use of
 
06:10:36.150 --> 06:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
a residential kitchen space and exempts
 
06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:37.558 align:start position:0%
them from the use of commercial
 
06:10:40.030 --> 06:10:40.040 align:start position:0%
equipment it exempts them from plumbing
 
06:10:43.390 --> 06:10:43.400 align:start position:0%
code so it exempts them from some from
 
06:10:44.788 --> 06:10:44.798 align:start position:0%
certain things that are required in a
 
06:10:46.990 --> 06:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
commercial space so if you remove the
 
06:10:51.190 --> 06:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
word kitchen um it doesn't refer back to
 
06:10:54.150 --> 06:10:54.160 align:start position:0%
any specific sanitary requirements which
 
06:10:57.788 --> 06:10:57.798 align:start position:0%
is our concern so somebody could um take
 
06:11:01.990 --> 06:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
their garage and and put a a sync
 
06:11:05.868 --> 06:11:05.878 align:start position:0%
and and call it good um where we would
 
06:11:07.708 --> 06:11:07.718 align:start position:0%
have no oversight to make sure that the
 
06:11:09.350 --> 06:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
floors the walls the
 
06:11:13.110 --> 06:11:13.120 align:start position:0%
ceilings meet those cleanable standards
 
06:11:15.270 --> 06:11:15.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much welcome
 
06:11:17.708 --> 06:11:17.718 align:start position:0%
representative jamaa thank you madam
 
06:11:18.910 --> 06:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:11:20.910 --> 06:11:20.920 align:start position:0%
so along those lines I'm wondering in
 
06:11:24.750 --> 06:11:24.760 align:start position:0%
lines four and five it it says that the
 
06:11:27.310 --> 06:11:27.320 align:start position:0%
water supply and sanitary requirements
 
06:11:31.070 --> 06:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
established in rules adopted under RSA
 
06:11:33.548 --> 06:11:33.558 align:start position:0%
so that if we remove the word kitchen
 
06:11:35.788 --> 06:11:35.798 align:start position:0%
whatever we call this aren't they
 
06:11:38.670 --> 06:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
required by this bill to meet the
 
06:11:41.310 --> 06:11:41.320 align:start position:0%
specific conditions that are listed in
 
06:11:43.708 --> 06:11:43.718 align:start position:0%
the rules under that RSA so I'm
 
06:11:45.830 --> 06:11:45.840 align:start position:0%
wondering why removing the word kitchen
 
06:11:48.948 --> 06:11:48.958 align:start position:0%
is a problem if the bill specifically
 
06:11:51.750 --> 06:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
refers to the set of rules under RSA
 
06:11:53.390 --> 06:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
that govern the water supply and
 
06:11:53.400 --> 06:11:54.910 align:start position:0%
that govern the water supply and
sanitary

06:11:54.910 --> 06:11:54.920 align:start position:0%
sanitary
 
06:11:57.190 --> 06:11:57.200 align:start position:0%
requirements the way that the rule is
 
06:12:00.190 --> 06:12:00.200 align:start position:0%
written um really again relies on the
 
06:12:03.270 --> 06:12:03.280 align:start position:0%
word kitchen and the implication that it
 
06:12:05.468 --> 06:12:05.478 align:start position:0%
is already a kitchen established for
 
06:12:05.478 --> 06:12:08.788 align:start position:0%
is already a kitchen established for
food

06:12:08.788 --> 06:12:08.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:11.708 --> 06:12:11.718 align:start position:0%
production and
 
06:12:15.350 --> 06:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
then gives them certain um leeway as a
 
06:12:15.360 --> 06:12:16.430 align:start position:0%
then gives them certain um leeway as a
homestead

06:12:16.430 --> 06:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
homestead
 
06:12:19.030 --> 06:12:19.040 align:start position:0%
operator so instead of the requirement
 
06:12:21.030 --> 06:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
to have all of the commercial equipment
 
06:12:23.830 --> 06:12:23.840 align:start position:0%
and to have all of the we don't list it
 
06:12:25.670 --> 06:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
all out as we do for commercial
 
06:12:29.868 --> 06:12:29.878 align:start position:0%
facilities um in a floor plan and in um
 
06:12:31.830 --> 06:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
the food code which is is what we
 
06:12:33.868 --> 06:12:33.878 align:start position:0%
license and inspect to in the retail
 
06:12:36.390 --> 06:12:36.400 align:start position:0%
world it's doesn't list those out the
 
06:12:39.390 --> 06:12:39.400 align:start position:0%
same way in for Homestead food
 
06:12:41.430 --> 06:12:41.440 align:start position:0%
establishments follow up yeah thank you
 
06:12:45.150 --> 06:12:45.160 align:start position:0%
very much so would it be effective to
 
06:12:47.830 --> 06:12:47.840 align:start position:0%
amend the language to say something to
 
06:12:51.430 --> 06:12:51.440 align:start position:0%
the effect of um kind of as meets the
 
06:12:54.670 --> 06:12:54.680 align:start position:0%
definition of a kitchen as defined in RS
 
06:12:56.468 --> 06:12:56.478 align:start position:0%
so you're saying it's a different thing
 
06:12:59.190 --> 06:12:59.200 align:start position:0%
but this thing meets the requirements of
 
06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
kitchen defined under rule yes I think
 
06:13:03.468 --> 06:13:03.478 align:start position:0%
that if we if there were some if there
 
06:13:07.150 --> 06:13:07.160 align:start position:0%
is a link to um establish a those
 
06:13:09.590 --> 06:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
sanitary requirements for a homestead
 
06:13:13.350 --> 06:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
kitchen that it would be it would meet
 
06:13:15.990 --> 06:13:16.000 align:start position:0%
it would fulfill our concerns thank you
 
06:13:18.350 --> 06:13:18.360 align:start position:0%
very much okay um did you have a
 
06:13:20.670 --> 06:13:20.680 align:start position:0%
question first okay representative
 
06:13:22.990 --> 06:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
Scully thank you Madame chair and thank
 
06:13:25.230 --> 06:13:25.240 align:start position:0%
you again for offering your
 
06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
perspectives well I assume that would it
 
06:13:31.070 --> 06:13:31.080 align:start position:0%
be a major um effort to modify the rules
 
06:13:34.030 --> 06:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
to include the language of this
 
06:13:36.590 --> 06:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
particular Bill if
 
06:13:38.830 --> 06:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
passed I mean do we need to change the
 
06:13:41.788 --> 06:13:41.798 align:start position:0%
bill or is could it be equally easy to
 
06:13:46.990 --> 06:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:52.750 --> 06:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
rules yeah I go ahead so um the
 
06:13:55.510 --> 06:13:55.520 align:start position:0%
department can change we we have
 
06:13:57.830 --> 06:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
obviously a process to change the rules
 
06:14:01.468 --> 06:14:01.478 align:start position:0%
and there is a um you know a public a
 
06:14:03.750 --> 06:14:03.760 align:start position:0%
public process for rule change so yes we
 
06:14:07.430 --> 06:14:07.440 align:start position:0%
could modify exist ing rule um to
 
06:14:11.070 --> 06:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
address concerns but I do think um that
 
06:14:12.788 --> 06:14:12.798 align:start position:0%
uh in our discussions with the committee
 
06:14:15.430 --> 06:14:15.440 align:start position:0%
I think that there was some uh desire to
 
06:14:18.070 --> 06:14:18.080 align:start position:0%
kind of had set this in in statute I
 
06:14:19.830 --> 06:14:19.840 align:start position:0%
think that's kind of what we heard from
 
06:14:23.270 --> 06:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
meetings um previously that there was a
 
06:14:25.788 --> 06:14:25.798 align:start position:0%
a desire uh to set it in statute and
 
06:14:27.270 --> 06:14:27.280 align:start position:0%
then obviously the department would
 
06:14:29.628 --> 06:14:29.638 align:start position:0%
follow in rulemaking but yes we could
 
06:14:32.548 --> 06:14:32.558 align:start position:0%
modify our existing rules to address to
 
06:14:34.030 --> 06:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
provide more
 
06:14:37.830 --> 06:14:37.840 align:start position:0%
clarity thank you representative
 
06:14:41.070 --> 06:14:41.080 align:start position:0%
ktoa thank you madam chair I guess I'm a
 
06:14:43.548 --> 06:14:43.558 align:start position:0%
little confused because if we're
 
06:14:45.750 --> 06:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
saying that they must follow the
 
06:14:48.468 --> 06:14:48.478 align:start position:0%
sanitary requirements established in oh
 
06:14:50.430 --> 06:14:50.440 align:start position:0%
in rules I missed the part in rules
 
06:14:53.390 --> 06:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
adopted under RSA 541a so what you're
 
06:14:55.270 --> 06:14:55.280 align:start position:0%
saying is your rules are different
 
06:14:58.230 --> 06:14:58.240 align:start position:0%
because it says kitchen is that my
 
06:15:01.548 --> 06:15:01.558 align:start position:0%
understanding yes the kitchen gives the
 
06:15:01.558 --> 06:15:03.070 align:start position:0%
understanding yes the kitchen gives the
implication

06:15:03.070 --> 06:15:03.080 align:start position:0%
implication
 
06:15:06.390 --> 06:15:06.400 align:start position:0%
that it's already a a space again
 
06:15:09.868 --> 06:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
established for food food production
 
06:15:11.948 --> 06:15:11.958 align:start position:0%
yeah followup uh thank you madam chair
 
06:15:13.190 --> 06:15:13.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you again for taking my
 
06:15:15.548 --> 06:15:15.558 align:start position:0%
question um how much of a heavy lift
 
06:15:17.310 --> 06:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
would it be to say a food production
 
06:15:19.270 --> 06:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
area in a person's primary residence as
 
06:15:23.430 --> 06:15:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:26.350 --> 06:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
rules so the department certainly if if
 
06:15:28.548 --> 06:15:28.558 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass as written the
 
06:15:30.788 --> 06:15:30.798 align:start position:0%
department can modify its rules the
 
06:15:33.070 --> 06:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
Department's concerns that we're
 
06:15:37.350 --> 06:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
presenting today are are that we have
 
06:15:39.708 --> 06:15:39.718 align:start position:0%
concerns that the the language as
 
06:15:43.830 --> 06:15:43.840 align:start position:0%
written doesn't uh doesn't allow or
 
06:15:47.430 --> 06:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
could potentially um spaces in the home
 
06:15:49.948 --> 06:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
that don't align with the use of a
 
06:15:52.468 --> 06:15:52.478 align:start position:0%
kitchen could be used in those instances
 
06:15:55.628 --> 06:15:55.638 align:start position:0%
and could present some uh food safety
 
06:15:58.030 --> 06:15:58.040 align:start position:0%
concerns sure representa come 12 one
 
06:16:00.990 --> 06:16:01.000 align:start position:0%
more thank you madam chair um and just
 
06:16:04.270 --> 06:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
one last question but in all of our
 
06:16:06.628 --> 06:16:06.638 align:start position:0%
guidelines and even in the one paining
 
06:16:08.350 --> 06:16:08.360 align:start position:0%
to say the commercial equipment we're
 
06:16:10.788 --> 06:16:10.798 align:start position:0%
saying has to be cleaned and sanitized
 
06:16:12.990 --> 06:16:13.000 align:start position:0%
so we are always talking in all of the
 
06:16:15.830 --> 06:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
rules dealing with food s sanitization
 
06:16:17.990 --> 06:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
and making sure everything is sanitized
 
06:16:22.230 --> 06:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
so in rules I mean it would be if people
 
06:16:25.270 --> 06:16:25.280 align:start position:0%
followed what they're supposed to why
 
06:16:27.270 --> 06:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
would it matter if it says someone's
 
06:16:30.628 --> 06:16:30.638 align:start position:0%
primary residence because I understand
 
06:16:34.390 --> 06:16:34.400 align:start position:0%
that that may happen but if we have in
 
06:16:34.400 --> 06:16:35.548 align:start position:0%
that that may happen but if we have in
statute

06:16:35.548 --> 06:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
statute
 
06:16:37.750 --> 06:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
that we're cleaning we're sanitizing
 
06:16:41.270 --> 06:16:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're labeling we have all of these laws
 
06:16:45.750 --> 06:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
in statute why are we can you please
 
06:16:48.628 --> 06:16:48.638 align:start position:0%
give me an example that maybe has
 
06:16:52.788 --> 06:16:52.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
happen so well while most people have
 
06:17:00.150 --> 06:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
the best intentions um we we have seen
 
06:17:02.788 --> 06:17:02.798 align:start position:0%
situations where people have moved out
 
06:17:05.310 --> 06:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
of their Homestead kitchen and moved
 
06:17:07.750 --> 06:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
into a garage or a basement
 
06:17:10.750 --> 06:17:10.760 align:start position:0%
space which doesn't meet the the same
 
06:17:13.190 --> 06:17:13.200 align:start position:0%
cleanable surfaces the countertops have
 
06:17:15.150 --> 06:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
not you know they don't have counter
 
06:17:17.948 --> 06:17:17.958 align:start position:0%
spaces that are easily cleanable and you
 
06:17:20.590 --> 06:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
know are not going to collect buildup
 
06:17:25.230 --> 06:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
and possibly you know grow bacteria that
 
06:17:29.628 --> 06:17:29.638 align:start position:0%
can affect food on contact surfaces
 
06:17:32.230 --> 06:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
so we're what we're truly concerned
 
06:17:35.590 --> 06:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
about is is the space itself and that it
 
06:17:38.750 --> 06:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
meets those standards and and our and we
 
06:17:40.110 --> 06:17:40.120 align:start position:0%
have seen it happen where people have
 
06:17:43.708 --> 06:17:43.718 align:start position:0%
moved into a garage space that has no um
 
06:17:46.670 --> 06:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
no ceiling coverage and the walls are
 
06:17:49.788 --> 06:17:49.798 align:start position:0%
not cleanable and the the floor is not
 
06:17:52.150 --> 06:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
able to be cleaned
 
06:17:56.190 --> 06:17:56.200 align:start position:0%
and those areas also can allow for the
 
06:17:58.070 --> 06:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
entrance of rodents or pests because
 
06:17:59.868 --> 06:17:59.878 align:start position:0%
they haven't been secured the same way
 
06:18:01.948 --> 06:18:01.958 align:start position:0%
that a resident residential kitchen may
 
06:18:05.390 --> 06:18:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:07.548 --> 06:18:07.558 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah sure uh one more followup
 
06:18:09.310 --> 06:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and thank you
 
06:18:12.830 --> 06:18:12.840 align:start position:0%
for that answer I appreciate it um now
 
06:18:14.590 --> 06:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
when you've gone into these why were you
 
06:18:18.270 --> 06:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
called into that space and what were you
 
06:18:22.430 --> 06:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
able to do so we have we have exempt
 
06:18:24.190 --> 06:18:24.200 align:start position:0%
Homestead kitchens and we have licensed
 
06:18:26.030 --> 06:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
Homestead kitchens so our licensed
 
06:18:29.150 --> 06:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
Homestead kitchens um do receive an
 
06:18:31.190 --> 06:18:31.200 align:start position:0%
inspection so they are licensed and
 
06:18:33.910 --> 06:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
inspected um granted on a longer cycle
 
06:18:36.830 --> 06:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
than an than a retail facility but they
 
06:18:38.670 --> 06:18:38.680 align:start position:0%
are inspected so there have been times
 
06:18:41.070 --> 06:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
where the the production area in the
 
06:18:43.430 --> 06:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
kitchen they outgrew and move their
 
06:18:46.270 --> 06:18:46.280 align:start position:0%
space into or move their production into
 
06:18:49.150 --> 06:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
a garage or a basement area and what we
 
06:18:52.628 --> 06:18:52.638 align:start position:0%
tell them is that they are able to do
 
06:18:54.070 --> 06:18:54.080 align:start position:0%
that if they want to move outside their
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
residential kitchen right now we move
 
06:18:58.948 --> 06:18:58.958 align:start position:0%
them into a different category they're
 
06:19:00.310 --> 06:19:00.320 align:start position:0%
considered they would be considered a
 
06:19:02.788 --> 06:19:02.798 align:start position:0%
commercial processor so they would apply
 
06:19:05.070 --> 06:19:05.080 align:start position:0%
for a different license and when they
 
06:19:07.230 --> 06:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
apply for a commercial processor license
 
06:19:09.030 --> 06:19:09.040 align:start position:0%
in a new space they are required to
 
06:19:12.110 --> 06:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
submit a floor plan application which
 
06:19:15.468 --> 06:19:15.478 align:start position:0%
again allows us to review that space and
 
06:19:16.948 --> 06:19:16.958 align:start position:0%
the equipment that's going into that
 
06:19:18.628 --> 06:19:18.638 align:start position:0%
space to ensure that they have all of
 
06:19:20.670 --> 06:19:20.680 align:start position:0%
those things in place prior to food
 
06:19:26.270 --> 06:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:29.910 --> 06:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
area you may have one more thank you
 
06:19:32.270 --> 06:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
madam chair could you tell me how many
 
06:19:35.510 --> 06:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
times uh this has happened in the state
 
06:19:37.390 --> 06:19:37.400 align:start position:0%
I I can't get I I do not have those
 
06:19:38.590 --> 06:19:38.600 align:start position:0%
numbers for
 
06:19:38.600 --> 06:19:40.708 align:start position:0%
numbers for
you

06:19:40.708 --> 06:19:40.718 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:19:45.468 --> 06:19:45.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:48.990 --> 06:19:49.000 align:start position:0%
committee um yeah I have I have a
 
06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:19:59.110 --> 06:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
to we so we're we're looking to to be to
 
06:20:02.070 --> 06:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
have people be able to use other
 
06:20:06.990 --> 06:20:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:10.788 --> 06:20:10.798 align:start position:0%
and your objection is that you want to
 
06:20:13.670 --> 06:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that certain spaces
 
06:20:17.750 --> 06:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
are cleanable and don't have rodents
 
06:20:20.708 --> 06:20:20.718 align:start position:0%
running around and so
 
06:20:20.718 --> 06:20:23.948 align:start position:0%
running around and so
forth

06:20:23.948 --> 06:20:23.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:26.548 --> 06:20:26.558 align:start position:0%
so the difference difference to me I'm
 
06:20:28.150 --> 06:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
just trying to get this straight in my
 
06:20:30.468 --> 06:20:30.478 align:start position:0%
mind the difference to me between the
 
06:20:32.750 --> 06:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
licensed and unlicensed is that you
 
06:20:35.310 --> 06:20:35.320 align:start position:0%
inspect one and not the other correct
 
06:20:35.320 --> 06:20:38.230 align:start position:0%
inspect one and not the other correct
okay

06:20:38.230 --> 06:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
okay
 
06:20:40.750 --> 06:20:40.760 align:start position:0%
um all right so I just I kind of wanted
 
06:20:42.868 --> 06:20:42.878 align:start position:0%
to get that all you know teased out in
 
06:20:44.948 --> 06:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
06:20:51.628 --> 06:20:51.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:20:54.750 --> 06:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
we all right I guess I just I'm I'm just
 
06:20:58.030 --> 06:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out this the whole uh
 
06:21:00.548 --> 06:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
kitchen definition versus you know space
 
06:21:01.468 --> 06:21:01.478 align:start position:0%
that you
 
06:21:05.150 --> 06:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
use and and and as as a representative
 
06:21:07.110 --> 06:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
Bixby pointed out I mean I do know
 
06:21:09.590 --> 06:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
people who have kitchens in their
 
06:21:12.150 --> 06:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
basements MH and um and they're
 
06:21:13.948 --> 06:21:13.958 align:start position:0%
perfectly fine they're perfectly safe
 
06:21:16.788 --> 06:21:16.798 align:start position:0%
there's no rodents running around and
 
06:21:18.670 --> 06:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
there are surfaces that I mean it's it's
 
06:21:21.868 --> 06:21:21.878 align:start position:0%
another Kitchen in their home
 
06:21:26.990 --> 06:21:27.000 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know is that if they if if
 
06:21:30.868 --> 06:21:30.878 align:start position:0%
they used another space as a kitchen
 
06:21:33.510 --> 06:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
that's something that's
 
06:21:36.468 --> 06:21:36.478 align:start position:0%
uh better for you in your mind
 
06:21:39.868 --> 06:21:39.878 align:start position:0%
or so I guess to clarify it's it's not
 
06:21:40.910 --> 06:21:40.920 align:start position:0%
so much
 
06:21:42.948 --> 06:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
about the fact that we don't want them
 
06:21:44.948 --> 06:21:44.958 align:start position:0%
to use another space it's that we just
 
06:21:47.270 --> 06:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that if we remove
 
06:21:49.788 --> 06:21:49.798 align:start position:0%
kitchen that we're not unintentionally
 
06:21:52.670 --> 06:21:52.680 align:start position:0%
allowing for these spaces to be used
 
06:21:54.310 --> 06:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
without meeting those sanitary
 
06:21:59.150 --> 06:21:59.160 align:start position:0%
requirements okay okay representative
 
06:21:59.160 --> 06:22:00.948 align:start position:0%
requirements okay okay representative
king

06:22:00.948 --> 06:22:00.958 align:start position:0%
king
 
06:22:04.030 --> 06:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
um this mentions uh excluding
 
06:22:06.910 --> 06:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
potentially hazardous food so my example
 
06:22:09.628 --> 06:22:09.638 align:start position:0%
earlier about like a butcher in a garage
 
06:22:12.270 --> 06:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
is is meat like a hazardous food because
 
06:22:14.110 --> 06:22:14.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm just imagining that meat would
 
06:22:16.990 --> 06:22:17.000 align:start position:0%
be hazardous but like somebody canning
 
06:22:19.430 --> 06:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
strawberry jam it's a totally different
 
06:22:23.150 --> 06:22:23.160 align:start position:0%
ball game um are you concerned about
 
06:22:25.230 --> 06:22:25.240 align:start position:0%
people you know canning strawberry jam
 
06:22:27.150 --> 06:22:27.160 align:start position:0%
in their garage whereas meat would be
 
06:22:27.160 --> 06:22:28.230 align:start position:0%
in their garage whereas meat would be
totally

06:22:28.230 --> 06:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
totally
 
06:22:31.430 --> 06:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
unacceptable so with this bill we're
 
06:22:32.708 --> 06:22:32.718 align:start position:0%
specifically talking about Homestead
 
06:22:36.910 --> 06:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
food operators um so there are specific
 
06:22:38.548 --> 06:22:38.558 align:start position:0%
um products that they are allowed to
 
06:22:40.910 --> 06:22:40.920 align:start position:0%
make under the homestead allowance and
 
06:22:42.548 --> 06:22:42.558 align:start position:0%
those are non potentially hazardous
 
06:22:45.070 --> 06:22:45.080 align:start position:0%
products such as jams jellies cookies
 
06:22:47.030 --> 06:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
acidified Foods so meat would not be
 
06:22:49.868 --> 06:22:49.878 align:start position:0%
allowed um to be done in a homestead
 
06:22:52.270 --> 06:22:52.280 align:start position:0%
facility okay but so in that case since
 
06:22:54.830 --> 06:22:54.840 align:start position:0%
since we are dealing only with health
 
06:22:56.110 --> 06:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
safe quote unquote safe food
 
06:22:58.708 --> 06:22:58.718 align:start position:0%
non-hazardous Foods I'm just wondering
 
06:23:00.670 --> 06:23:00.680 align:start position:0%
how problematic it could even
 
06:23:04.468 --> 06:23:04.478 align:start position:0%
potentially be to be in a situation that
 
06:23:06.390 --> 06:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
removes that kitchen concern that you're
 
06:23:06.400 --> 06:23:09.150 align:start position:0%
removes that kitchen concern that you're
worrying

06:23:09.150 --> 06:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:11.948 --> 06:23:11.958 align:start position:0%
about so I think the concern still
 
06:23:14.910 --> 06:23:14.920 align:start position:0%
exists because the space could have un
 
06:23:16.868 --> 06:23:16.878 align:start position:0%
unsanitary conditions associated with
 
06:23:18.948 --> 06:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
there could be you if it's not wipable
 
06:23:20.868 --> 06:23:20.878 align:start position:0%
if the surface isn't wipable and they're
 
06:23:23.110 --> 06:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
and they're canning on on that surface
 
06:23:25.548 --> 06:23:25.558 align:start position:0%
or they're making cookies or you know if
 
06:23:27.510 --> 06:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
they have Carpeting and the floors can't
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
be uh washed and sanitized there are
 
06:23:33.070 --> 06:23:33.080 align:start position:0%
concerns that the space you know that
 
06:23:34.628 --> 06:23:34.638 align:start position:0%
doesn't really matter what the food food
 
06:23:36.830 --> 06:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
is they're preparing it's about making
 
06:23:39.590 --> 06:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
sure that the space is it meets it meets
 
06:23:41.110 --> 06:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
those require the sanitary requirements
 
06:23:44.350 --> 06:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions from the
 
06:23:46.868 --> 06:23:46.878 align:start position:0%
committee nope seeing none thank you
 
06:23:50.070 --> 06:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
time I have
 
06:23:56.948 --> 06:23:56.958 align:start position:0%
um oh got two more okay again uh Annie
 
06:24:00.030 --> 06:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
leader Addy leer Z zos and Michael
 
06:24:01.670 --> 06:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
Williams if you'd like to come up
 
06:24:03.750 --> 06:24:03.760 align:start position:0%
together that would kind of Save Our
 
06:24:03.760 --> 06:24:04.948 align:start position:0%
together that would kind of Save Our
Time

06:24:04.948 --> 06:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
Time
 
06:24:04.958 --> 06:24:09.350 align:start position:0%
Time
thank

06:24:09.350 --> 06:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:12.708 --> 06:24:12.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you again Madame chairwoman
 
06:24:16.310 --> 06:24:16.320 align:start position:0%
um again closer Williams Addy leader
 
06:24:18.990 --> 06:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
zavos we're from dun Barton we
 
06:24:22.150 --> 06:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
are farmers and food producers Homestead
 
06:24:23.990 --> 06:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
food producers uh although we are
 
06:24:26.708 --> 06:24:26.718 align:start position:0%
currently unlicensed but our farm store
 
06:24:29.070 --> 06:24:29.080 align:start position:0%
is licensed so I'm not sure exactly how
 
06:24:33.070 --> 06:24:33.080 align:start position:0%
that works um yeah so the idea behind
 
06:24:36.270 --> 06:24:36.280 align:start position:0%
this um law was that if you can clean
 
06:24:38.030 --> 06:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
and sanitize yourself like wash your
 
06:24:40.270 --> 06:24:40.280 align:start position:0%
hands if you can clean and sanitize the
 
06:24:42.350 --> 06:24:42.360 align:start position:0%
space and if you can clean and sanitize
 
06:24:44.430 --> 06:24:44.440 align:start position:0%
your equipment what does it matter if
 
06:24:46.110 --> 06:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
you're cooking in a kitchen or if you're
 
06:24:48.110 --> 06:24:48.120 align:start position:0%
cooking in a finished garage or if
 
06:24:50.708 --> 06:24:50.718 align:start position:0%
you're you know assembling cookies in a
 
06:24:53.948 --> 06:24:53.958 align:start position:0%
guest room and there were three reasons
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
that this is really important to
 
06:24:57.948 --> 06:24:57.958 align:start position:0%
homebased producers um the first is that
 
06:24:59.708 --> 06:24:59.718 align:start position:0%
the definition of kitchen is really
 
06:25:02.350 --> 06:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
malleable like some people have kitchens
 
06:25:04.070 --> 06:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
where their dining room is also kind of
 
06:25:05.788 --> 06:25:05.798 align:start position:0%
part part of their kitchen some people
 
06:25:08.310 --> 06:25:08.320 align:start position:0%
have kitchens that are very closed off
 
06:25:10.788 --> 06:25:10.798 align:start position:0%
some people have pantries so how do you
 
06:25:13.270 --> 06:25:13.280 align:start position:0%
really Define kitchen and what does that
 
06:25:15.548 --> 06:25:15.558 align:start position:0%
mean for the producer and are you
 
06:25:19.788 --> 06:25:19.798 align:start position:0%
providing an equitable like law to
 
06:25:22.030 --> 06:25:22.040 align:start position:0%
everyone for someone who has a really
 
06:25:23.548 --> 06:25:23.558 align:start position:0%
tiny kitchen someone who has a really
 
06:25:25.150 --> 06:25:25.160 align:start position:0%
open kitchen with their whole dining
 
06:25:27.310 --> 06:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
room that they're able to use um and to
 
06:25:29.468 --> 06:25:29.478 align:start position:0%
really just clarify that that if it's
 
06:25:31.350 --> 06:25:31.360 align:start position:0%
sanitar and if it's safe you should be
 
06:25:33.670 --> 06:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
able to produce there so that was reason
 
06:25:34.868 --> 06:25:34.878 align:start position:0%
number one
 
06:25:36.948 --> 06:25:36.958 align:start position:0%
um reason number two is to improve
 
06:25:39.628 --> 06:25:39.638 align:start position:0%
safety and efficiency by allowing people
 
06:25:41.590 --> 06:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
um to create separate space from their
 
06:25:43.830 --> 06:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
family kitchen so I think I've mentioned
 
06:25:45.750 --> 06:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of times that one of the
 
06:25:47.750 --> 06:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
largest sort of groups of people who end
 
06:25:49.708 --> 06:25:49.718 align:start position:0%
up doing homebased food production is
 
06:25:51.230 --> 06:25:51.240 align:start position:0%
women with children who don't have
 
06:25:52.708 --> 06:25:52.718 align:start position:0%
full-time jobs but want to be able to
 
06:25:55.430 --> 06:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
supplement um their family's income and
 
06:25:57.750 --> 06:25:57.760 align:start position:0%
one of the the things that I hear over
 
06:26:00.750 --> 06:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
and over and over and over again from
 
06:26:03.750 --> 06:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
this this type of producer is I can't
 
06:26:05.590 --> 06:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
keep my kids out of the things that I'm
 
06:26:07.708 --> 06:26:07.718 align:start position:0%
making for my customers and I can't keep
 
06:26:09.468 --> 06:26:09.478 align:start position:0%
my husband out of the things that I'm
 
06:26:11.990 --> 06:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
making for my customers obviously that's
 
06:26:13.510 --> 06:26:13.520 align:start position:0%
their relationship we have a different
 
06:26:14.868 --> 06:26:14.878 align:start position:0%
type of relationship that where he would
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
not do that um but there is a question
 
06:26:21.910 --> 06:26:21.920 align:start position:0%
of improving safety for food safety for
 
06:26:24.110 --> 06:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
people by having a separate space where
 
06:26:26.390 --> 06:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
they can close off their ingredients
 
06:26:29.708 --> 06:26:29.718 align:start position:0%
they can close off um things that are in
 
06:26:31.990 --> 06:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
production uh things like that and
 
06:26:34.788 --> 06:26:34.798 align:start position:0%
having a separate space for that
 
06:26:37.670 --> 06:26:37.680 align:start position:0%
um and I also wanted to note kind of
 
06:26:39.468 --> 06:26:39.478 align:start position:0%
explain a detail of this that I think
 
06:26:43.548 --> 06:26:43.558 align:start position:0%
probably is not really commonly known um
 
06:26:45.350 --> 06:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
one of the most
 
06:26:48.190 --> 06:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
lucrative paths for a home food producer
 
06:26:50.350 --> 06:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
is to do very highly decorated sugar
 
06:26:52.150 --> 06:26:52.160 align:start position:0%
cookies so you've probably seen those
 
06:26:54.468 --> 06:26:54.478 align:start position:0%
cookies where it's like a custom set for
 
06:26:57.868 --> 06:26:57.878 align:start position:0%
a baby shower or um a special thing for
 
06:26:59.468 --> 06:26:59.478 align:start position:0%
someone's graduation where it has their
 
06:27:01.070 --> 06:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
name and there's like these intricate
 
06:27:04.948 --> 06:27:04.958 align:start position:0%
cookies it's really cool um that level
 
06:27:08.230 --> 06:27:08.240 align:start position:0%
of skill is something that someone can
 
06:27:11.110 --> 06:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
turn into Cash really well even if they
 
06:27:13.390 --> 06:27:13.400 align:start position:0%
don't want to ever have employees even
 
06:27:15.510 --> 06:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
if they always want to work only a few
 
06:27:18.350 --> 06:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
hours a week even if they have kids or a
 
06:27:20.948 --> 06:27:20.958 align:start position:0%
husband who is around um and
 
06:27:22.590 --> 06:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
interrupting them they can set aside
 
06:27:24.468 --> 06:27:24.478 align:start position:0%
some time late at night bake their
 
06:27:26.110 --> 06:27:26.120 align:start position:0%
cookies off and then do this really
 
06:27:27.948 --> 06:27:27.958 align:start position:0%
intricate work and make some good money
 
06:27:31.030 --> 06:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
that way and that type of work is really
 
06:27:33.430 --> 06:27:33.440 align:start position:0%
poorly suited for a family kitchen
 
06:27:35.590 --> 06:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
because you have a lot of decorating
 
06:27:36.868 --> 06:27:36.878 align:start position:0%
things you a lot of different types of
 
06:27:39.350 --> 06:27:39.360 align:start position:0%
sprinkles and colors and little cookie
 
06:27:41.590 --> 06:27:41.600 align:start position:0%
cutters and there usually isn't storage
 
06:27:43.948 --> 06:27:43.958 align:start position:0%
in your primary kitchen for that kind of
 
06:27:46.750 --> 06:27:46.760 align:start position:0%
stuff so in other states women will and
 
06:27:49.788 --> 06:27:49.798 align:start position:0%
Men I guess will often take like a guest
 
06:27:51.750 --> 06:27:51.760 align:start position:0%
room and make that that their cookie
 
06:27:54.430 --> 06:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
room by adding a sink and they'll do
 
06:27:55.868 --> 06:27:55.878 align:start position:0%
their baking in their home kitchen and
 
06:27:57.230 --> 06:27:57.240 align:start position:0%
then they'll take their baked cookies
 
06:27:59.110 --> 06:27:59.120 align:start position:0%
and do their fine decorative work in
 
06:28:01.430 --> 06:28:01.440 align:start position:0%
another space and so this is an issue
 
06:28:03.190 --> 06:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
that this is one of the primary driving
 
06:28:04.910 --> 06:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
reasons that we really want to see this
 
06:28:07.750 --> 06:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
bill passed is to let those people have
 
06:28:10.110 --> 06:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
this this space where they can keep
 
06:28:11.830 --> 06:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
those cookies away from the kids away
 
06:28:15.150 --> 06:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
from the husbands whatever um and
 
06:28:17.910 --> 06:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
finally allowing for expansion um
 
06:28:21.190 --> 06:28:21.200 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of room in a business
 
06:28:24.150 --> 06:28:24.160 align:start position:0%
between I'm baking a little bit in my
 
06:28:27.430 --> 06:28:27.440 align:start position:0%
tiny residential kitchen um and I'm
 
06:28:29.548 --> 06:28:29.558 align:start position:0%
ready to move to a commercial space
 
06:28:31.910 --> 06:28:31.920 align:start position:0%
that's a really long path and there's a
 
06:28:34.310 --> 06:28:34.320 align:start position:0%
lot of steps up and a lot of money
 
06:28:37.390 --> 06:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
involved and so the idea here is also
 
06:28:39.708 --> 06:28:39.718 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to be able to do your
 
06:28:42.070 --> 06:28:42.080 align:start position:0%
needing in your dining room instead of
 
06:28:44.150 --> 06:28:44.160 align:start position:0%
just in your kitchen maybe you want to
 
06:28:47.030 --> 06:28:47.040 align:start position:0%
have a cooling area in your dining room
 
06:28:49.390 --> 06:28:49.400 align:start position:0%
and not just in your kitchen right now
 
06:28:51.788 --> 06:28:51.798 align:start position:0%
you're kind of breaking the law if you
 
06:28:53.990 --> 06:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
do that no one's going to catch you no
 
06:28:56.628 --> 06:28:56.638 align:start position:0%
one's going to know but like if you're a
 
06:28:59.070 --> 06:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
rule follower like some of us it really
 
06:29:01.468 --> 06:29:01.478 align:start position:0%
puts you in a bad position um and so the
 
06:29:03.510 --> 06:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
idea is to let people who want to follow
 
06:29:06.510 --> 06:29:06.520 align:start position:0%
the rules who want to produce safe food
 
06:29:09.270 --> 06:29:09.280 align:start position:0%
who want to produce things in a sanitary
 
06:29:11.468 --> 06:29:11.478 align:start position:0%
environment do that in a way that is
 
06:29:12.910 --> 06:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
actually going to work for themselves
 
06:29:14.670 --> 06:29:14.680 align:start position:0%
and for their business given the
 
06:29:20.110 --> 06:29:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:22.750 --> 06:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
situation um so to to to add to some of
 
06:29:22.760 --> 06:29:24.150 align:start position:0%
situation um so to to to add to some of
that

06:29:24.150 --> 06:29:24.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:29:26.390 --> 06:29:26.400 align:start position:0%
um something that was made clear is that
 
06:29:30.390 --> 06:29:30.400 align:start position:0%
there's kind of like three tiers of um
 
06:29:32.628 --> 06:29:32.638 align:start position:0%
lure and inspection there's a the
 
06:29:34.830 --> 06:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
commercial producer
 
06:29:38.670 --> 06:29:38.680 align:start position:0%
um there is the Homestead food license
 
06:29:40.030 --> 06:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
and then there is the exempt from
 
06:29:44.430 --> 06:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
license and I think implied in that is
 
06:29:44.440 --> 06:29:45.310 align:start position:0%
license and I think implied in that is
the

06:29:45.310 --> 06:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:29:48.350 --> 06:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
idea that the greatest
 
06:29:50.628 --> 06:29:50.638 align:start position:0%
incentive that anyone has producing food
 
06:29:52.510 --> 06:29:52.520 align:start position:0%
is to produce safe food for the health
 
06:29:55.070 --> 06:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
of their business if you want to have a
 
06:29:57.310 --> 06:29:57.320 align:start position:0%
business you can't make people sick with
 
06:30:00.788 --> 06:30:00.798 align:start position:0%
your food um you have to produce safe
 
06:30:02.708 --> 06:30:02.718 align:start position:0%
food consistently if you want to build
 
06:30:06.708 --> 06:30:06.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:10.110 --> 06:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
if you basically there is no enforcement
 
06:30:13.150 --> 06:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
there is no inspection for Exempted
 
06:30:15.030 --> 06:30:15.040 align:start position:0%
people so they could they could already
 
06:30:17.708 --> 06:30:17.718 align:start position:0%
be doing the things that DHHS fears at
 
06:30:19.310 --> 06:30:19.320 align:start position:0%
some point they're assuming they're not
 
06:30:20.788 --> 06:30:20.798 align:start position:0%
because they have this incentive to
 
06:30:23.190 --> 06:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
produce a safe product and the
 
06:30:25.270 --> 06:30:25.280 align:start position:0%
inspections for the second tier are
 
06:30:27.948 --> 06:30:27.958 align:start position:0%
scheduled so it's not like you couldn't
 
06:30:29.310 --> 06:30:29.320 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to hide something you
 
06:30:31.510 --> 06:30:31.520 align:start position:0%
could um it's not like a commercial
 
06:30:32.990 --> 06:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
inspection where you you have a pop
 
06:30:34.670 --> 06:30:34.680 align:start position:0%
inspection so
 
06:30:37.468 --> 06:30:37.478 align:start position:0%
so um I think that we're we are whether
 
06:30:39.190 --> 06:30:39.200 align:start position:0%
we realize it or not kind of assuming
 
06:30:42.510 --> 06:30:42.520 align:start position:0%
that people are working safely more than
 
06:30:42.520 --> 06:30:44.430 align:start position:0%
that people are working safely more than
not

06:30:44.430 --> 06:30:44.440 align:start position:0%
not
 
06:30:48.868 --> 06:30:48.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:30:51.468 --> 06:30:51.478 align:start position:0%
uh the idea that people will work in
 
06:30:54.350 --> 06:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
spaces where it could be open to animals
 
06:30:56.190 --> 06:30:56.200 align:start position:0%
it could be open you know you could have
 
06:30:58.270 --> 06:30:58.280 align:start position:0%
not non- cleanable surfaces like say a
 
06:31:00.868 --> 06:31:00.878 align:start position:0%
dirt floor basement um I I'm sure there
 
06:31:02.430 --> 06:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
are people that would try to make food
 
06:31:05.070 --> 06:31:05.080 align:start position:0%
and sell it in that environment
 
06:31:08.430 --> 06:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
but I can't imagine there are many um
 
06:31:12.310 --> 06:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
and again as Addie pointed out unless
 
06:31:14.670 --> 06:31:14.680 align:start position:0%
you are a commercial
 
06:31:16.868 --> 06:31:16.878 align:start position:0%
producer if you wanted to do that and
 
06:31:18.628 --> 06:31:18.638 align:start position:0%
hide it under the current system that
 
06:31:21.468 --> 06:31:21.478 align:start position:0%
would be really easy so um we're kind of
 
06:31:24.350 --> 06:31:24.360 align:start position:0%
assuming good intent on people and and
 
06:31:27.110 --> 06:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
uh and that they are trying to do what's
 
06:31:30.388 --> 06:31:30.398 align:start position:0%
safe and that brings me to something
 
06:31:32.430 --> 06:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
that I think is inherent in the mission
 
06:31:34.708 --> 06:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
of DHHS
 
06:31:39.910 --> 06:31:39.920 align:start position:0%
that their role in all of this primarily
 
06:31:41.788 --> 06:31:41.798 align:start position:0%
should be
 
06:31:45.990 --> 06:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
education and if they want to engage
 
06:31:49.350 --> 06:31:49.360 align:start position:0%
with um either Homestead food licensed
 
06:31:51.310 --> 06:31:51.320 align:start position:0%
producers or exempt
 
06:31:54.510 --> 06:31:54.520 align:start position:0%
producers in order to support food
 
06:31:57.350 --> 06:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
safety in New Hampshire their best move
 
06:31:59.430 --> 06:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
is to engage with them on
 
06:32:01.990 --> 06:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
education um you know like like I
 
06:32:04.150 --> 06:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier that no no one is more
 
06:32:05.590 --> 06:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
important in that process than the
 
06:32:07.670 --> 06:32:07.680 align:start position:0%
person who's doing the cleaning they
 
06:32:09.150 --> 06:32:09.160 align:start position:0%
need to know what they're doing person
 
06:32:10.548 --> 06:32:10.558 align:start position:0%
that's preparing that food needs to know
 
06:32:13.788 --> 06:32:13.798 align:start position:0%
how to produce it safely um and absent
 
06:32:13.798 --> 06:32:15.150 align:start position:0%
how to produce it safely um and absent
that

06:32:15.150 --> 06:32:15.160 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:32:17.150 --> 06:32:17.160 align:start position:0%
engagement there
 
06:32:19.948 --> 06:32:19.958 align:start position:0%
is there is only the the individual
 
06:32:22.750 --> 06:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
incentive to produce a safe product so
 
06:32:24.350 --> 06:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
since we're going to operate under that
 
06:32:27.430 --> 06:32:27.440 align:start position:0%
assumption we may as well lean into it
 
06:32:29.708 --> 06:32:29.718 align:start position:0%
engage with education and allow people
 
06:32:33.070 --> 06:32:33.080 align:start position:0%
to bridge that gap between I've just
 
06:32:36.110 --> 06:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
started making cookies for my neighbors
 
06:32:39.070 --> 06:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
and I have a brick and mortar business
 
06:32:40.868 --> 06:32:40.878 align:start position:0%
opening a brick and mortar business is a
 
06:32:43.270 --> 06:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
six-figure proposition that's a lot of
 
06:32:45.590 --> 06:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
cookies in your kitchen but you have
 
06:32:47.310 --> 06:32:47.320 align:start position:0%
some steps that might be available to
 
06:32:49.388 --> 06:32:49.398 align:start position:0%
you if you are
 
06:32:53.590 --> 06:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
not hemmed into a small space and you
 
06:32:57.430 --> 06:32:57.440 align:start position:0%
have the option to say store already
 
06:32:58.788 --> 06:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
baked products that are waiting to be
 
06:33:00.990 --> 06:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
decorated in another room in a sealed
 
06:33:04.070 --> 06:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
container right now that's illegal
 
06:33:05.030 --> 06:33:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's kind of
 
06:33:07.388 --> 06:33:07.398 align:start position:0%
silly it's kind of unnecessary and it's
 
06:33:10.830 --> 06:33:10.840 align:start position:0%
not helpful and and it what it does is
 
06:33:13.548 --> 06:33:13.558 align:start position:0%
it creates a barrier to
 
06:33:16.788 --> 06:33:16.798 align:start position:0%
entry for people who want to start a
 
06:33:20.430 --> 06:33:20.440 align:start position:0%
business and do not have access to
 
06:33:23.628 --> 06:33:23.638 align:start position:0%
Capital so I have a question before you
 
06:33:25.990 --> 06:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
continue you bring up a good point I
 
06:33:28.190 --> 06:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
mean you're saying that they're possibly
 
06:33:29.990 --> 06:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
are people that are doing this now and
 
06:33:33.788 --> 06:33:33.798 align:start position:0%
breaking the law so do you feel that by
 
06:33:37.628 --> 06:33:37.638 align:start position:0%
codifying this and saying yes you can
 
06:33:41.150 --> 06:33:41.160 align:start position:0%
use other spaces in your in your
 
06:33:44.788 --> 06:33:44.798 align:start position:0%
home you're at least giving people uh
 
06:33:46.910 --> 06:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
you know that that it is codified that
 
06:33:46.920 --> 06:33:47.910 align:start position:0%
you know that that it is codified that
it

06:33:47.910 --> 06:33:47.920 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:33:52.310 --> 06:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
is um something that to be taken
 
06:33:55.110 --> 06:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
seriously and that it is law that it
 
06:33:59.388 --> 06:33:59.398 align:start position:0%
should be um a place that meets water
 
06:34:01.110 --> 06:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
supply and sanitary requirements
 
06:34:04.750 --> 06:34:04.760 align:start position:0%
established in certain rules so it's not
 
06:34:07.750 --> 06:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
just oh I'm going to do this on the sly
 
06:34:10.430 --> 06:34:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's codified and there are rules that
 
06:34:12.350 --> 06:34:12.360 align:start position:0%
must be followed well whether you're
 
06:34:14.548 --> 06:34:14.558 align:start position:0%
inspected or not I mean it's sort of a I
 
06:34:15.868 --> 06:34:15.878 align:start position:0%
guess that's another
 
06:34:18.830 --> 06:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
Point well what's your thought on that I
 
06:34:21.948 --> 06:34:21.958 align:start position:0%
guess my my my first thought is that um
 
06:34:24.628 --> 06:34:24.638 align:start position:0%
you know if if anyone involved including
 
06:34:26.548 --> 06:34:26.558 align:start position:0%
DHHS wants a little more clarity in the
 
06:34:28.590 --> 06:34:28.600 align:start position:0%
language on what exactly those
 
06:34:31.750 --> 06:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
requirements are or how to find your way
 
06:34:35.430 --> 06:34:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the the statute or or um official
 
06:34:39.590 --> 06:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
rules or that that that govern what
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
defines a a a safe working space I'm
 
06:34:45.788 --> 06:34:45.798 align:start position:0%
totally for that because right now the
 
06:34:48.708 --> 06:34:48.718 align:start position:0%
best opportunity you have to educate
 
06:34:50.788 --> 06:34:50.798 align:start position:0%
people who are producing food is through
 
06:34:54.150 --> 06:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
the statute it is through the rules
 
06:34:56.070 --> 06:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
because they're not I mean if they're
 
06:34:57.388 --> 06:34:57.398 align:start position:0%
not being inspected they're seeing no
 
06:34:59.830 --> 06:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
one and their only opportunity to find
 
06:35:04.670 --> 06:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
out you know any guidance from HHS or
 
06:35:07.750 --> 06:35:07.760 align:start position:0%
from any other uh entity would be to go
 
06:35:09.628 --> 06:35:09.638 align:start position:0%
to the website ask the question to to
 
06:35:11.310 --> 06:35:11.320 align:start position:0%
contact them to to look through the
 
06:35:13.788 --> 06:35:13.798 align:start position:0%
rules basically so if they can easily
 
06:35:15.948 --> 06:35:15.958 align:start position:0%
find a rule that says oh oh I I can use
 
06:35:17.868 --> 06:35:17.878 align:start position:0%
another room as long as
 
06:35:22.230 --> 06:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
Xyz then that's a that's at least giving
 
06:35:23.948 --> 06:35:23.958 align:start position:0%
them some sort of guidance instead of
 
06:35:27.230 --> 06:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
them using their own kind
 
06:35:29.868 --> 06:35:29.878 align:start position:0%
of cognitive capability to look at it
 
06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
and say do I feel safe here and I can
 
06:35:33.628 --> 06:35:33.638 align:start position:0%
tell you that there are some things
 
06:35:35.468 --> 06:35:35.478 align:start position:0%
things that are a little bit not
 
06:35:38.948 --> 06:35:38.958 align:start position:0%
intuitive about food safety that you
 
06:35:40.548 --> 06:35:40.558 align:start position:0%
would miss if you didn't work
 
06:35:42.190 --> 06:35:42.200 align:start position:0%
professionally in it and have training
 
06:35:46.110 --> 06:35:46.120 align:start position:0%
in it so uh I think clarifying the
 
06:35:47.548 --> 06:35:47.558 align:start position:0%
language and having more detail in the
 
06:35:49.990 --> 06:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
language is a great idea um but I also
 
06:35:51.788 --> 06:35:51.798 align:start position:0%
think that
 
06:35:54.468 --> 06:35:54.478 align:start position:0%
this as written is better than what we
 
06:35:56.788 --> 06:35:56.798 align:start position:0%
have now representative
 
06:35:58.590 --> 06:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
gerana thank you and that's I'm
 
06:36:00.430 --> 06:36:00.440 align:start position:0%
wondering around this piece of education
 
06:36:02.628 --> 06:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
and trying to make it as easy as
 
06:36:04.430 --> 06:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
possible for folks to be able to do this
 
06:36:06.388 --> 06:36:06.398 align:start position:0%
kind of work one of my best friends's
 
06:36:08.670 --> 06:36:08.680 align:start position:0%
wife makes these phenomenal really fancy
 
06:36:10.270 --> 06:36:10.280 align:start position:0%
cookies that we order for all kinds of
 
06:36:12.590 --> 06:36:12.600 align:start position:0%
occasions great stuff uh but so that's
 
06:36:14.548 --> 06:36:14.558 align:start position:0%
why I'm wondering also question I asked
 
06:36:17.628 --> 06:36:17.638 align:start position:0%
before DHHS if there's a way to amend
 
06:36:19.230 --> 06:36:19.240 align:start position:0%
the language in the bill to basically
 
06:36:21.270 --> 06:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
say that the food production area will
 
06:36:25.110 --> 06:36:25.120 align:start position:0%
meet the requirements of a kitchen as
 
06:36:27.468 --> 06:36:27.478 align:start position:0%
defined in whatever because number one I
 
06:36:29.670 --> 06:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
think there is value to defining a
 
06:36:32.548 --> 06:36:32.558 align:start position:0%
particular space as a space where food
 
06:36:34.310 --> 06:36:34.320 align:start position:0%
is made and the term we use for that is
 
06:36:36.830 --> 06:36:36.840 align:start position:0%
kitchen right so I'm wondering if that
 
06:36:38.270 --> 06:36:38.280 align:start position:0%
helps and I also think it would be
 
06:36:40.150 --> 06:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
helpful and correct me if I'm wrong if
 
06:36:42.110 --> 06:36:42.120 align:start position:0%
somebody who's looking to do this that's
 
06:36:45.310 --> 06:36:45.320 align:start position:0%
a pretty easy way to search right so
 
06:36:47.628 --> 06:36:47.638 align:start position:0%
what do I need to have what you the
 
06:36:49.310 --> 06:36:49.320 align:start position:0%
space that you are going to have for
 
06:36:51.590 --> 06:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
this food production needs to meet the
 
06:36:53.430 --> 06:36:53.440 align:start position:0%
definition of kitchen you look up
 
06:36:56.548 --> 06:36:56.558 align:start position:0%
kitchen there are the requirements uh
 
06:36:58.590 --> 06:36:58.600 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I'm always for making things
 
06:37:02.830 --> 06:37:02.840 align:start position:0%
simpler for people um I wanted to go
 
06:37:05.110 --> 06:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
back um to something that representative
 
06:37:08.310 --> 06:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
Ain said um about sort of codifying
 
06:37:10.070 --> 06:37:10.080 align:start position:0%
things and allowing people to do this
 
06:37:12.628 --> 06:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
legally what you have now is a situation
 
06:37:14.548 --> 06:37:14.558 align:start position:0%
where people who want to do things
 
06:37:17.030 --> 06:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
legally are being disadvantaged compared
 
06:37:18.910 --> 06:37:18.920 align:start position:0%
to people who are just like well what if
 
06:37:20.910 --> 06:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
I just break the law because no one's
 
06:37:23.190 --> 06:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
checking and no one's looking so people
 
06:37:25.750 --> 06:37:25.760 align:start position:0%
who are willing to work somewhere else
 
06:37:28.590 --> 06:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
um outside of the law they can just do
 
06:37:30.868 --> 06:37:30.878 align:start position:0%
it but people who do want to work within
 
06:37:32.230 --> 06:37:32.240 align:start position:0%
the law who maybe want to grow their
 
06:37:35.230 --> 06:37:35.240 align:start position:0%
businesses they don't have that option
 
06:37:37.070 --> 06:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
um and so this would really fix that
 
06:37:40.270 --> 06:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
issue and then second point about what
 
06:37:42.628 --> 06:37:42.638 align:start position:0%
is a kitchen I what it sounds like to me
 
06:37:45.070 --> 06:37:45.080 align:start position:0%
is that there isn't necessarily a
 
06:37:47.430 --> 06:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
definition in the administrative rules
 
06:37:49.270 --> 06:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
about what a kitchen is and what makes
 
06:37:52.830 --> 06:37:52.840 align:start position:0%
it sanitary would you say that's
 
06:37:56.670 --> 06:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
correct yeah it it relies on the idea of
 
06:37:58.788 --> 06:37:58.798 align:start position:0%
a kitchen so there's not a rule about
 
06:38:00.788 --> 06:38:00.798 align:start position:0%
what a kitchen is it's just this idea
 
06:38:03.270 --> 06:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
that a kitchen is safe which if anyone
 
06:38:03.280 --> 06:38:04.190 align:start position:0%
that a kitchen is safe which if anyone
has

06:38:04.190 --> 06:38:04.200 align:start position:0%
has
 
06:38:05.708 --> 06:38:05.718 align:start position:0%
seen like hoarders or something it's
 
06:38:09.430 --> 06:38:09.440 align:start position:0%
like that's not true um so it's not yeah
 
06:38:11.948 --> 06:38:11.958 align:start position:0%
but anyway what I would encourage is in
 
06:38:14.590 --> 06:38:14.600 align:start position:0%
the same way that DHHS adopts rules from
 
06:38:16.510 --> 06:38:16.520 align:start position:0%
like the FDA when they're talking about
 
06:38:16.520 --> 06:38:18.110 align:start position:0%
like the FDA when they're talking about
commercial

06:38:18.110 --> 06:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
commercial
 
06:38:21.590 --> 06:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
um businesses there are other states
 
06:38:24.350 --> 06:38:24.360 align:start position:0%
that have really a ton of guidance for
 
06:38:26.830 --> 06:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
homebased producers not to harp on this
 
06:38:29.230 --> 06:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
but Virginia has an amazing system where
 
06:38:31.468 --> 06:38:31.478 align:start position:0%
you can make the same exact things that
 
06:38:33.830 --> 06:38:33.840 align:start position:0%
you can make in a commercial kitchen
 
06:38:35.708 --> 06:38:35.718 align:start position:0%
they have a separate inspection process
 
06:38:38.110 --> 06:38:38.120 align:start position:0%
for homebased producers they have pop
 
06:38:40.628 --> 06:38:40.638 align:start position:0%
inspections they have all kinds of
 
06:38:41.948 --> 06:38:41.958 align:start position:0%
guidance where that you can like print
 
06:38:44.350 --> 06:38:44.360 align:start position:0%
out these 40 page booklets about what do
 
06:38:45.990 --> 06:38:46.000 align:start position:0%
you need to do to make sure your space
 
06:38:48.788 --> 06:38:48.798 align:start position:0%
Ms meets the right requirements so I
 
06:38:50.590 --> 06:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
would say why not just adopt some of
 
06:38:52.948 --> 06:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
those things into the administrative
 
06:38:55.230 --> 06:38:55.240 align:start position:0%
rules the same way that they adopt
 
06:38:57.230 --> 06:38:57.240 align:start position:0%
things like the FDA code just go to a
 
06:38:58.590 --> 06:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
state that maybe is a little bit larger
 
06:39:00.708 --> 06:39:00.718 align:start position:0%
has more resources has already done the
 
06:39:03.948 --> 06:39:03.958 align:start position:0%
work um and adopt some of those practice
 
06:39:05.510 --> 06:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
just copy and paste it it's really easy
 
06:39:08.910 --> 06:39:08.920 align:start position:0%
like chat gbt it you know sorry
 
06:39:11.670 --> 06:39:11.680 align:start position:0%
representative kto has a question uh
 
06:39:13.868 --> 06:39:13.878 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and and thank you
 
06:39:16.230 --> 06:39:16.240 align:start position:0%
again for being here I appreciate your
 
06:39:20.590 --> 06:39:20.600 align:start position:0%
insight into this when you hear food
 
06:39:23.190 --> 06:39:23.200 align:start position:0%
production area in a person's primary
 
06:39:25.430 --> 06:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
residence that meets water supply and
 
06:39:27.910 --> 06:39:27.920 align:start position:0%
sanitary requirements can you explain to
 
06:39:31.788 --> 06:39:31.798 align:start position:0%
me what that implies to you yeah to me
 
06:39:33.868 --> 06:39:33.878 align:start position:0%
that implies I can clean my myself I can
 
06:39:35.350 --> 06:39:35.360 align:start position:0%
clean the space and I can clean my
 
06:39:37.190 --> 06:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
equipment I think it's really simple if
 
06:39:39.590 --> 06:39:39.600 align:start position:0%
I hear sanitary that's what I think of
 
06:39:41.510 --> 06:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying that that's what anyone
 
06:39:43.030 --> 06:39:43.040 align:start position:0%
would think of but that's definitely
 
06:39:46.230 --> 06:39:46.240 align:start position:0%
what I think of yeah follow-up question
 
06:39:48.670 --> 06:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair the the reason
 
06:39:51.510 --> 06:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
I was asking that is because you know
 
06:39:54.070 --> 06:39:54.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking a food production area in
 
06:39:55.468 --> 06:39:55.478 align:start position:0%
the person's primary residence but you
 
06:39:57.750 --> 06:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
were bringing up where your decorating
 
06:40:00.468 --> 06:40:00.478 align:start position:0%
cookies in a bedroom but a bedroom
 
06:40:02.310 --> 06:40:02.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't meet would wouldn't meet the
 
06:40:04.830 --> 06:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
water supply in sanitary requirements
 
06:40:07.430 --> 06:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
and can you yeah sorry I didn't mean
 
06:40:07.440 --> 06:40:08.468 align:start position:0%
and can you yeah sorry I didn't mean
that

06:40:08.468 --> 06:40:08.478 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:40:11.110 --> 06:40:11.120 align:start position:0%
um people put sinks into their bedrooms
 
06:40:12.788 --> 06:40:12.798 align:start position:0%
all the time it's like pop through the
 
06:40:14.388 --> 06:40:14.398 align:start position:0%
wall from the bathroom and put a hand
 
06:40:16.270 --> 06:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
sink there that's really easy and then
 
06:40:17.430 --> 06:40:17.440 align:start position:0%
you can just take the rest of your
 
06:40:18.788 --> 06:40:18.798 align:start position:0%
equipment and wash it in the kitchen
 
06:40:20.868 --> 06:40:20.878 align:start position:0%
it's not I that's not a complicated
 
06:40:23.310 --> 06:40:23.320 align:start position:0%
thing it's easy you can put a three-bay
 
06:40:25.830 --> 06:40:25.840 align:start position:0%
sink in there um I see this in homebased
 
06:40:28.708 --> 06:40:28.718 align:start position:0%
food producer groups like Cottage groups
 
06:40:31.110 --> 06:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
online all the time o my husband fixed
 
06:40:32.350 --> 06:40:32.360 align:start position:0%
up the basement for me and it's like
 
06:40:33.830 --> 06:40:33.840 align:start position:0%
this beautiful space where they've
 
06:40:35.990 --> 06:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
painted everything pink and put in like
 
06:40:38.150 --> 06:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
six sinks and like four ovens and it's
 
06:40:42.670 --> 06:40:42.680 align:start position:0%
awesome um sorry a little bit of a
 
06:40:46.948 --> 06:40:46.958 align:start position:0%
Divergence um yeah um but yeah you can
 
06:40:49.070 --> 06:40:49.080 align:start position:0%
meet those requirements in any room I
 
06:40:50.628 --> 06:40:50.638 align:start position:0%
mean you just get the right plumber and
 
06:40:52.868 --> 06:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
the right contractor in it's not a big
 
06:40:54.830 --> 06:40:54.840 align:start position:0%
deal but it's a lot less expensive than
 
06:40:56.948 --> 06:40:56.958 align:start position:0%
buying a store and then outfitting that
 
06:40:58.670 --> 06:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
place which is like
 
06:41:01.788 --> 06:41:01.798 align:start position:0%
$100,000 okay any other questions
 
06:41:04.270 --> 06:41:04.280 align:start position:0%
representative ktoa thank you madam
 
06:41:05.910 --> 06:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for your patience
 
06:41:09.110 --> 06:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
with me um
 
06:41:12.590 --> 06:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
so I like the idea of production area as
 
06:41:15.910 --> 06:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
opposed to kitchen because when we're
 
06:41:17.590 --> 06:41:17.600 align:start position:0%
talking about a space where you're
 
06:41:20.070 --> 06:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
decorating cookies it doesn't imply that
 
06:41:23.030 --> 06:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
it has a kitchen a a an oven and a
 
06:41:26.948 --> 06:41:26.958 align:start position:0%
refrigerator ab and I think there needs
 
06:41:28.708 --> 06:41:28.718 align:start position:0%
you know there's a distinction there
 
06:41:30.590 --> 06:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
because when I think of a kitchen I
 
06:41:32.230 --> 06:41:32.240 align:start position:0%
think of something with an oven a
 
06:41:35.788 --> 06:41:35.798 align:start position:0%
dishwasher refrigerator stove all of
 
06:41:39.510 --> 06:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
those things so I think you know I I
 
06:41:42.670 --> 06:41:42.680 align:start position:0%
like this idea uh of a production area
 
06:41:45.468 --> 06:41:45.478 align:start position:0%
in and and the key there is in the
 
06:41:48.270 --> 06:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
person's primary residence that meets
 
06:41:50.788 --> 06:41:50.798 align:start position:0%
water supply and sanitary requirements
 
06:41:53.388 --> 06:41:53.398 align:start position:0%
so in listening to your testimony you're
 
06:41:54.750 --> 06:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
saying that the fact that it actually
 
06:41:58.510 --> 06:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
says sanitary is is really the big word
 
06:42:02.070 --> 06:42:02.080 align:start position:0%
um besides uh the primary residence yeah
 
06:42:04.670 --> 06:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
and there are all kinds of points in in
 
06:42:06.590 --> 06:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire law where we hear things
 
06:42:09.430 --> 06:42:09.440 align:start position:0%
like sanitary and there's no like
 
06:42:11.830 --> 06:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
quantitative definition of them um
 
06:42:13.350 --> 06:42:13.360 align:start position:0%
there's a part of the law that says that
 
06:42:15.468 --> 06:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
DHHS can do an emergency inspection if
 
06:42:17.388 --> 06:42:17.398 align:start position:0%
they think something unsanitary is
 
06:42:19.708 --> 06:42:19.718 align:start position:0%
happening so it's not like I I don't
 
06:42:22.868 --> 06:42:22.878 align:start position:0%
think that this is a particularly out of
 
06:42:25.750 --> 06:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
the norm in terms of how we convey to
 
06:42:27.670 --> 06:42:27.680 align:start position:0%
people that something needs to be clean
 
06:42:31.670 --> 06:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:42:35.030 --> 06:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
cleanable one thing if uh if no one has
 
06:42:37.990 --> 06:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
questions um well I I I wanted to build
 
06:42:40.150 --> 06:42:40.160 align:start position:0%
on something that Addy touched on um
 
06:42:43.110 --> 06:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
earlier in our testimony um the idea
 
06:42:45.388 --> 06:42:45.398 align:start position:0%
that people who want to follow the rules
 
06:42:46.590 --> 06:42:46.600 align:start position:0%
they want to build their business they
 
06:42:48.990 --> 06:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
want to go a certain pathway with their
 
06:42:51.830 --> 06:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
business um are they're going to want to
 
06:42:52.948 --> 06:42:52.958 align:start position:0%
follow the rules they're going to want
 
06:42:54.830 --> 06:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
to do things right to me this is the
 
06:42:56.868 --> 06:42:56.878 align:start position:0%
this touches on the concept of
 
06:43:00.670 --> 06:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
professionalization and um you know I
 
06:43:03.750 --> 06:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
know that we are unique among homebased
 
06:43:06.190 --> 06:43:06.200 align:start position:0%
food producers in that we have both
 
06:43:08.708 --> 06:43:08.718 align:start position:0%
worked in highly professional highly
 
06:43:11.910 --> 06:43:11.920 align:start position:0%
trained profession like commercial
 
06:43:14.030 --> 06:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
highly inspected people spent millions
 
06:43:15.468 --> 06:43:15.478 align:start position:0%
of dollars building kitchens that we
 
06:43:18.190 --> 06:43:18.200 align:start position:0%
worked in um I don't think we both of us
 
06:43:21.430 --> 06:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
worked in fine dining yeah yeah yeah I
 
06:43:25.590 --> 06:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
spent 15 years in fine dining um and so
 
06:43:27.230 --> 06:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
I I know that that's not normal for
 
06:43:30.070 --> 06:43:30.080 align:start position:0%
homebased food producers but I think
 
06:43:33.150 --> 06:43:33.160 align:start position:0%
that the advantages of being a homebased
 
06:43:36.590 --> 06:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
food producer if you can if you can
 
06:43:38.948 --> 06:43:38.958 align:start position:0%
produce if you're allowed to produce an
 
06:43:40.670 --> 06:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
array of products that is going to be
 
06:43:42.548 --> 06:43:42.558 align:start position:0%
attractive to
 
06:43:45.270 --> 06:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
Consumers is going to attract people who
 
06:43:48.628 --> 06:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
are professionals like us and that is a
 
06:43:51.750 --> 06:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
good thing for the quality of food for
 
06:43:54.270 --> 06:43:54.280 align:start position:0%
the variety of food and for the
 
06:43:58.948 --> 06:43:58.958 align:start position:0%
sanitation of food and so I think that
 
06:44:01.830 --> 06:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
um you know kind of broadening some of
 
06:44:03.990 --> 06:44:04.000 align:start position:0%
these definitions allow o people a
 
06:44:07.070 --> 06:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
little more space to work and grow and
 
06:44:09.910 --> 06:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
and do more is going to only Trend
 
06:44:12.310 --> 06:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
toward having better and saer food
 
06:44:14.070 --> 06:44:14.080 align:start position:0%
because it makes it more attractive to
 
06:44:16.070 --> 06:44:16.080 align:start position:0%
people who really know what they're
 
06:44:18.788 --> 06:44:18.798 align:start position:0%
doing and want to take it seriously
 
06:44:21.628 --> 06:44:21.638 align:start position:0%
represent come thank you madam chair I
 
06:44:23.910 --> 06:44:23.920 align:start position:0%
want to touch on something uh that you
 
06:44:27.510 --> 06:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
just you mentioned earlier um you said
 
06:44:29.948 --> 06:44:29.958 align:start position:0%
that DHS already has the ability to come
 
06:44:31.468 --> 06:44:31.478 align:start position:0%
in if they believe something is
 
06:44:31.478 --> 06:44:33.230 align:start position:0%
in if they believe something is
unsanitary

06:44:33.230 --> 06:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
unsanitary
 
06:44:36.548 --> 06:44:36.558 align:start position:0%
um and in because New Hampshire is such
 
06:44:39.388 --> 06:44:39.398 align:start position:0%
a cottage industry State and it's really
 
06:44:42.708 --> 06:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
a Small World um if there were people
 
06:44:45.070 --> 06:44:45.080 align:start position:0%
doing unsanitary things do you think the
 
06:44:47.510 --> 06:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
word would get out pretty quickly to
 
06:44:50.468 --> 06:44:50.478 align:start position:0%
DHHS um yeah I mean I think probably the
 
06:44:51.990 --> 06:44:52.000 align:start position:0%
first thing that would happen was would
 
06:44:53.948 --> 06:44:53.958 align:start position:0%
people would just stop buying things
 
06:44:56.750 --> 06:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
from you um I'll give this is not an
 
06:44:58.190 --> 06:44:58.200 align:start position:0%
example people stopping buying things of
 
06:45:00.628 --> 06:45:00.638 align:start position:0%
our M but um when we went we're in our
 
06:45:02.548 --> 06:45:02.558 align:start position:0%
little Garden Club in our town and when
 
06:45:04.750 --> 06:45:04.760 align:start position:0%
we went to like our second meeting
 
06:45:06.590 --> 06:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
people were like oh I've heard of you
 
06:45:08.590 --> 06:45:08.600 align:start position:0%
you're the new celebrities New Hampshire
 
06:45:10.468 --> 06:45:10.478 align:start position:0%
is a lot of small towns where people
 
06:45:11.868 --> 06:45:11.878 align:start position:0%
know each other and they know the
 
06:45:14.190 --> 06:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
practices of what people are doing and
 
06:45:16.468 --> 06:45:16.478 align:start position:0%
so I think that if there was a question
 
06:45:19.910 --> 06:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
about someone's sanitation or a product
 
06:45:21.948 --> 06:45:21.958 align:start position:0%
being moldy or something like that I
 
06:45:24.150 --> 06:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
think the word would absolutely get out
 
06:45:27.750 --> 06:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
quickly and I mean yeah people talk here
 
06:45:29.788 --> 06:45:29.798 align:start position:0%
a lot really quickly at least in our
 
06:45:31.230 --> 06:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
case I guarantee you it would kill our
 
06:45:35.510 --> 06:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
business before DHHS out about it yeah
 
06:45:39.270 --> 06:45:39.280 align:start position:0%
it represent Penza yeah so I have a
 
06:45:40.948 --> 06:45:40.958 align:start position:0%
statement and a question um thank you
 
06:45:45.230 --> 06:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
madam chair um would you believe that I
 
06:45:47.590 --> 06:45:47.600 align:start position:0%
have an experience this go I've been in
 
06:45:48.830 --> 06:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
I've lived in New Hampshire my whole
 
06:45:50.750 --> 06:45:50.760 align:start position:0%
life I'm not going to State how old I am
 
06:45:54.310 --> 06:45:54.320 align:start position:0%
but there was a uh a local like little
 
06:45:57.070 --> 06:45:57.080 align:start position:0%
food Farm Stand um we used to every
 
06:46:00.110 --> 06:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
summer be up on a lake and
 
06:46:02.910 --> 06:46:02.920 align:start position:0%
um and she would make these popovers and
 
06:46:04.548 --> 06:46:04.558 align:start position:0%
and then we got a popover that was like
 
06:46:06.590 --> 06:46:06.600 align:start position:0%
covered in mold and then you know nobody
 
06:46:08.270 --> 06:46:08.280 align:start position:0%
ever bought the popovers anymore I
 
06:46:10.230 --> 06:46:10.240 align:start position:0%
really wouldn't believe that most people
 
06:46:12.190 --> 06:46:12.200 align:start position:0%
even do the reporting it's just
 
06:46:14.910 --> 06:46:14.920 align:start position:0%
basically their business go stops
 
06:46:16.628 --> 06:46:16.638 align:start position:0%
correct they go with their dollar
 
06:46:21.150 --> 06:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
exactly it's that mortgage yeah so yeah
 
06:46:23.750 --> 06:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from the
 
06:46:25.948 --> 06:46:25.958 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none thank you very
 
06:46:29.830 --> 06:46:29.840 align:start position:0%
much for coming and speaking to us this
 
06:46:31.788 --> 06:46:31.798 align:start position:0%
afternoon is there anyone else that
 
06:46:33.590 --> 06:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak on this
 
06:46:37.150 --> 06:46:37.160 align:start position:0%
Bill I'd like the blue sheet
 
06:46:41.350 --> 06:46:41.360 align:start position:0%
please and um I also want to report
 
06:46:45.190 --> 06:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
um folks who have come out uh with their
 
06:46:50.270 --> 06:46:50.280 align:start position:0%
testimony on the online portal 51 people
 
06:46:53.190 --> 06:46:53.200 align:start position:0%
support this bill three p persons oppose
 
06:46:55.868 --> 06:46:55.878 align:start position:0%
it one person is
 
06:46:59.510 --> 06:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
neutral and uh I've just taken a you
 
06:47:01.868 --> 06:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
know sort of looked at what some people
 
06:47:03.548 --> 06:47:03.558 align:start position:0%
were saying and they they would
 
06:47:06.430 --> 06:47:06.440 align:start position:0%
absolutely love to use other spaces in
 
06:47:14.430 --> 06:47:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:17.190 --> 06:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
sheet I have one
 
06:47:21.270 --> 06:47:21.280 align:start position:0%
person uh in favor on the blue sheet and
 
06:47:23.350 --> 06:47:23.360 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to close the hearing
 
06:47:27.990 --> 06:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:28.000 --> 06:47:30.030 align:start position:0%
 
307

06:47:30.030 --> 06:47:30.040 align:start position:0%
307
 
06:47:33.868 --> 06:47:33.878 align:start position:0%
I believe I am not sure sure if the
 
06:47:38.750 --> 06:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor has any comments um regarding
 
06:47:43.190 --> 06:47:43.200 align:start position:0%
the any possibility of necessary of
 
06:47:46.990 --> 06:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:47:49.830 --> 06:47:49.840 align:start position:0%
or I'm
 
06:47:54.468 --> 06:47:54.478 align:start position:0%
sorry uh I um I'm not sure that it needs
 
06:47:57.430 --> 06:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean I I had thought about
 
06:47:59.270 --> 06:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know sort of something in terms of
 
06:48:01.030 --> 06:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
definition of a kitchen but I think
 
06:48:04.190 --> 06:48:04.200 align:start position:0%
that's having but sounds like that's
 
06:48:09.468 --> 06:48:09.478 align:start position:0%
probably not a good route to go um I I
 
06:48:13.388 --> 06:48:13.398 align:start position:0%
think that uh the testimony in terms
 
06:48:17.590 --> 06:48:17.600 align:start position:0%
of the um the flexibility of the
 
06:48:19.590 --> 06:48:19.600 align:start position:0%
definition of food production area
 
06:48:21.628 --> 06:48:21.638 align:start position:0%
combined with the fact that it does
 
06:48:25.190 --> 06:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
require sanitation I think I think the
 
06:48:28.230 --> 06:48:28.240 align:start position:0%
the key thing in terms of safe food
 
06:48:30.110 --> 06:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
production is
 
06:48:33.548 --> 06:48:33.558 align:start position:0%
sanitation um and uh
 
06:48:38.110 --> 06:48:38.120 align:start position:0%
uh so and and in terms of what is
 
06:48:41.388 --> 06:48:41.398 align:start position:0%
allowed um the the types of things that
 
06:48:42.788 --> 06:48:42.798 align:start position:0%
are allowed
 
06:48:49.310 --> 06:48:49.320 align:start position:0%
under um Homestead food uh the this the
 
06:48:51.030 --> 06:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
things that are particularly temperature
 
06:48:54.030 --> 06:48:54.040 align:start position:0%
sensitive are and time sensitive are
 
06:48:57.910 --> 06:48:57.920 align:start position:0%
actually in the excluded categories so
 
06:49:00.990 --> 06:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that
 
06:49:05.708 --> 06:49:05.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:49:08.910 --> 06:49:08.920 align:start position:0%
um I found I found our the testimony
 
06:49:08.920 --> 06:49:10.388 align:start position:0%
um I found I found our the testimony
particularly

06:49:10.388 --> 06:49:10.398 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
06:49:13.030 --> 06:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
convincing that you made me think I had
 
06:49:17.670 --> 06:49:17.680 align:start position:0%
done this right so may I you may uh I
 
06:49:19.628 --> 06:49:19.638 align:start position:0%
would absolutely concur with the fact
 
06:49:21.388 --> 06:49:21.398 align:start position:0%
that you did this right representative
 
06:49:25.350 --> 06:49:25.360 align:start position:0%
Bixby and I think Madam chair if we
 
06:49:28.030 --> 06:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
could uh take a consensus but I think
 
06:49:30.430 --> 06:49:30.440 align:start position:0%
that we could possibly exect this today
 
06:49:32.190 --> 06:49:32.200 align:start position:0%
yeah does anyone have a problem with the
 
06:49:32.200 --> 06:49:34.468 align:start position:0%
yeah does anyone have a problem with the
bill

06:49:34.468 --> 06:49:34.478 align:start position:0%
bill
 
06:49:38.990 --> 06:49:39.000 align:start position:0%
no representative King I uh I think it
 
06:49:40.670 --> 06:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
it would be better to execute another
 
06:49:42.150 --> 06:49:42.160 align:start position:0%
week from now just because it would
 
06:49:45.510 --> 06:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
allow people to cogitate on the bill a
 
06:49:48.430 --> 06:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
little bit more um I could go home and
 
06:49:52.388 --> 06:49:52.398 align:start position:0%
you know read with the rsas or you know
 
06:49:53.788 --> 06:49:53.798 align:start position:0%
I don't know I just feel like there was
 
06:49:56.868 --> 06:49:56.878 align:start position:0%
enough concern about the bill from the
 
06:49:58.628 --> 06:49:58.638 align:start position:0%
Department that it would be a good idea
 
06:50:00.910 --> 06:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
just to citate on a little bit more
 
06:50:03.310 --> 06:50:03.320 align:start position:0%
before we steam steam it head
 
06:50:03.320 --> 06:50:04.830 align:start position:0%
before we steam steam it head
representative

06:50:04.830 --> 06:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:50:08.230 --> 06:50:08.240 align:start position:0%
guber thank you madam chair um I don't
 
06:50:10.830 --> 06:50:10.840 align:start position:0%
know that I'm new but I understand
 
06:50:12.830 --> 06:50:12.840 align:start position:0%
there's a procedure that the uh public
 
06:50:14.548 --> 06:50:14.558 align:start position:0%
hearing is open for comments till 11
 
06:50:17.350 --> 06:50:17.360 align:start position:0%
o'clock of the night of the hearing is
 
06:50:20.750 --> 06:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
there any uh expectations that we need
 
06:50:24.910 --> 06:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
to allow that to happen uh not I think
 
06:50:29.548 --> 06:50:29.558 align:start position:0%
that um generally the you know on a bill
 
06:50:33.190 --> 06:50:33.200 align:start position:0%
I given that this committee does not
 
06:50:33.200 --> 06:50:34.788 align:start position:0%
I given that this committee does not
um

06:50:34.788 --> 06:50:34.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:50:39.628 --> 06:50:39.638 align:start position:0%
typically uh exec a bill where everyone
 
06:50:42.868 --> 06:50:42.878 align:start position:0%
is not comfortable executing it uh
 
06:50:45.270 --> 06:50:45.280 align:start position:0%
that's not going to be an issue because
 
06:50:49.468 --> 06:50:49.478 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think that the the
 
06:50:52.830 --> 06:50:52.840 align:start position:0%
testimony that might come in between now
 
06:50:57.070 --> 06:50:57.080 align:start position:0%
and uh 11 o'clock is going to have a a
 
06:51:00.868 --> 06:51:00.878 align:start position:0%
significant effect on what we might do
 
06:51:02.948 --> 06:51:02.958 align:start position:0%
however given that we have have one
 
06:51:05.510 --> 06:51:05.520 align:start position:0%
member who thinks that it might be worth
 
06:51:07.670 --> 06:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
thinking about this before we execute I
 
06:51:09.788 --> 06:51:09.798 align:start position:0%
think that we should not execute
 
06:51:12.468 --> 06:51:12.478 align:start position:0%
today representative H Haskins make that
 
06:51:12.478 --> 06:51:14.110 align:start position:0%
today representative H Haskins make that
too

06:51:14.110 --> 06:51:14.120 align:start position:0%
too
 
06:51:16.430 --> 06:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay all right certainly you know if
 
06:51:19.110 --> 06:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
folks want to think about it uh we will
 
06:51:21.468 --> 06:51:21.478 align:start position:0%
include that into our uh work session
 
06:51:25.670 --> 06:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday morning and uh if we have
 
06:51:28.190 --> 06:51:28.200 align:start position:0%
any objections to it um this is not an
 
06:51:28.200 --> 06:51:29.070 align:start position:0%
any objections to it um this is not an
early

06:51:29.070 --> 06:51:29.080 align:start position:0%
early
 
06:51:33.230 --> 06:51:33.240 align:start position:0%
bill um as far as I know it's not an
 
06:51:36.030 --> 06:51:36.040 align:start position:0%
early bill and my feeling is that if
 
06:51:38.350 --> 06:51:38.360 align:start position:0%
people come to the work session next
 
06:51:41.750 --> 06:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
week and have ideas about ways that we
 
06:51:46.868 --> 06:51:46.878 align:start position:0%
need to um to modify it uh then uh that
 
06:51:48.750 --> 06:51:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be a good place to to start work
 
06:51:51.388 --> 06:51:51.398 align:start position:0%
on it okay represent
 
06:51:54.708 --> 06:51:54.718 align:start position:0%
Penza um thank you madam chair I'm sorry
 
06:51:56.750 --> 06:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
I missed all of the testimony I will
 
06:51:59.948 --> 06:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
watch when I get home um so just so I
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
have it clear this is you know I
 
06:52:04.548 --> 06:52:04.558 align:start position:0%
remember this from last term so this
 
06:52:07.430 --> 06:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
excludes um you know the foods that had
 
06:52:09.948 --> 06:52:09.958 align:start position:0%
with refrigeration and dairy all of that
 
06:52:13.190 --> 06:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
piece okay and then underneath the RSA
 
06:52:16.590 --> 06:52:16.600 align:start position:0%
does it have anything in there about um
 
06:52:18.868 --> 06:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
with the home like Serve Safe certified
 
06:52:21.030 --> 06:52:21.040 align:start position:0%
and things like that in there no because
 
06:52:22.750 --> 06:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
