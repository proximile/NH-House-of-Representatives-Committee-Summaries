um

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:41.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is representative
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
joshua keller i represent rockingham
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh 33 fremont danville and brentwood and
 
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
today i'm introducing hb 1136
 
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 align:start position:0%
i'm just requiring planning boards to
 
00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:57.520 align:start position:0%
list the type of studies that would be
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
there are requirements to
 
00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
you know post the fee schedule for
 
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 align:start position:0%
for planning
 
00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
and uh zoning
 
00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.070 align:start position:0%
and uh zoning
uh

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:16.479 align:start position:0%
fees that would be applicable to
 
00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:17.830 align:start position:0%
fees that would be applicable to
applications

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 align:start position:0%
in the hopes of allowing people to
 
00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:23.199 align:start position:0%
be able to predict what the cost of
 
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:25.360 align:start position:0%
their application is going to be so that
 
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:27.440 align:start position:0%
they can plan accordingly
 
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.390 align:start position:0%
they can plan accordingly
and

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:28.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
i see that this is just
 
00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:33.919 align:start position:0%
one piece of that so that they can
 
00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:36.080 align:start position:0%
be able to predict better what
 
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
what their uh
 
00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
expenses for for their application is
 
00:06:42.870 --> 00:06:42.880 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
you know the range of possibilities
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
as far as that expenses depending on
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%
which which
 
00:06:52.309 --> 00:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
studies that are listed would be
 
00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.160 align:start position:0%
required for them
 
00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
and also um
 
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:04.400 align:start position:0%
that they wouldn't be required to
 
00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:06.639 align:start position:0%
repeat the exact same study
 
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
multiple times because that would
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
obviously increase the
 
00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
the cost of it
 
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:14.840 align:start position:0%
um a cost of the application
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
obviously obviously the um
 
00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:20.240 align:start position:0%
if a
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
change was made to the um
 
00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
the thing that was studied then
 
00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.909 align:start position:0%
the thing that was studied then
obviously

00:07:25.909 --> 00:07:25.919 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
00:07:25.919 --> 00:07:26.790 align:start position:0%
obviously
that

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:26.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be
 
00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:30.870 align:start position:0%
that wouldn't be
uh

00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:30.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:32.800 align:start position:0%
an issue if it needed to be re-studied
 
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:35.280 align:start position:0%
you know if you study the water
 
00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:36.230 align:start position:0%
you know if you study the water
um

00:07:36.230 --> 00:07:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:37.670 --> 00:07:37.680 align:start position:0%
drainage issue and then you make a
 
00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:39.759 align:start position:0%
change to the drainage
 
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.560 align:start position:0%
um it it makes sense that this that the
 
00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.270 align:start position:0%
um it it makes sense that this that the
um

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:07:45.029 --> 00:07:45.039 align:start position:0%
the board would be able to
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
require a new study with that new
 
00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
information but not if you didn't make a
 
00:07:50.230 --> 00:07:50.240 align:start position:0%
change to the drainage and they would
 
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
just want to get it try and get a
 
00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
different answer from that study
 
00:07:57.510 --> 00:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the
 
00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
the goal of this bill and i'm happy to
 
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
answer any questions
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:08:05.909 --> 00:08:05.919 align:start position:0%
before we get started with that
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
just for the record we've had two people
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
are registered for this bill
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
one four and one against
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
so uh does the committee have questions
 
00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.350 --> 00:08:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
hi um
 
00:08:29.589 --> 00:08:29.599 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering if
 
00:08:32.949 --> 00:08:32.959 align:start position:0%
um you could provide us with a bit more
 
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
uh specificity about how
 
00:08:40.709 --> 00:08:40.719 align:start position:0%
repetitive is designed here like how are
 
00:08:43.269 --> 00:08:43.279 align:start position:0%
interpreters of this law supposed to
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
decide whether a study is repetitive or
 
00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
decide whether a study is repetitive or
not

00:08:50.150 --> 00:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:52.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:08:54.389 --> 00:08:54.399 align:start position:0%
so in the in the bill it says
 
00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.710 align:start position:0%
so in the in the bill it says
um

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
repetitive studies so it wouldn't be you
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
would be studying the same thing again
 
00:09:05.110 --> 00:09:05.120 align:start position:0%
it would not be allowed unless there was
 
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:06.880 align:start position:0%
a change to the plan
 
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
after the study's completion which
 
00:09:11.509 --> 00:09:11.519 align:start position:0%
substantially impact the issue studied
 
00:09:11.519 --> 00:09:12.310 align:start position:0%
substantially impact the issue studied
so

00:09:12.310 --> 00:09:12.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:14.310 --> 00:09:14.320 align:start position:0%
if you study drainage and then you
 
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:17.680 align:start position:0%
change the drainage of the plan then
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
the board would be able to ask you to
 
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
restudy that
 
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.790 align:start position:0%
restudy that
drainage

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
drainage
 
00:09:26.949 --> 00:09:26.959 align:start position:0%
impact on the on the plan but if
 
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:29.040 align:start position:0%
let's say you
 
00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:33.200 align:start position:0%
the soil
 
00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.350 align:start position:0%
the soil
samples

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
samples
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
impact or or or um
 
00:09:43.750 --> 00:09:43.760 align:start position:0%
maybe a better example is uh traffic
 
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
study if you did a traffic study
 
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.269 align:start position:0%
study if you did a traffic study
on

00:09:47.269 --> 00:09:47.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
on your uh
 
00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:53.910 --> 00:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
because you're you know building a
 
00:09:55.509 --> 00:09:55.519 align:start position:0%
development of 10 houses or something
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
and you want to be able to find out
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
what's what's the impact on the roads
 
00:10:00.550 --> 00:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
going to be and then you train change
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
the drainage you shouldn't really really
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
have to restudy the
 
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:07.600 align:start position:0%
the traffic study again because
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
changing drainage doesn't really
 
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.710 align:start position:0%
changing drainage doesn't really
affect

00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:10.720 align:start position:0%
affect
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
the change of the traffic right so that
 
00:10:15.269 --> 00:10:15.279 align:start position:0%
was kind of the um
 
00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
the wording and and how i think it would
 
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
be handled in practice and then uh i
 
00:10:23.350 --> 00:10:23.360 align:start position:0%
think that um the
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
the board would take a vote on whether
 
00:10:27.509 --> 00:10:27.519 align:start position:0%
they believe
 
00:10:27.519 --> 00:10:28.389 align:start position:0%
they believe
that

00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:28.399 --> 00:10:29.190 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:29.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
the change substantially impacted the
 
00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
issue studied
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
and obviously any
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
ruling of the board would be able to be
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
appealed to the zba
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
and the zba would be the
 
00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
place if there was a disagreement
 
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
between the applicant and the board so
 
00:10:50.230 --> 00:10:50.240 align:start position:0%
that that could be resolved
 
00:10:51.509 --> 00:10:51.519 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:53.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
representative

00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
um good morning uh representative and
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question i have
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
a number of questions about this bill as
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
a member of a planning board yes for a
 
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
relatively large municipality
 
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.430 align:start position:0%
relatively large municipality
first

00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where the title of the
 
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:10.710 align:start position:0%
can you tell me where the title of the
bill

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
dilatory studies comes from because it's
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
so i i didn't write the title of the um
 
00:11:29.269 --> 00:11:29.279 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
the section so let me
 
00:11:31.839 --> 00:11:33.509 align:start position:0%
the section so let me
just

00:11:33.509 --> 00:11:33.519 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
i would have to look that up for you
 
00:11:35.279 --> 00:11:36.069 align:start position:0%
i would have to look that up for you
well

00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
but more importantly
 
00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:41.200 align:start position:0%
um my question is
 
00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:43.600 align:start position:0%
speaks to
 
00:11:45.990 --> 00:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
the meaning of the word dilatory in this
 
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
context has a negative connotation when
 
00:11:51.509 --> 00:11:51.519 align:start position:0%
in fact many planning boards
 
00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:54.839 align:start position:0%
in the course of reviewing
 
00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
projects must
 
00:12:00.949 --> 00:12:00.959 align:start position:0%
do multiple tests on the same issue
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
and part of their due diligence process
 
00:12:06.710 --> 00:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
i also i have a question about your
 
00:12:08.949 --> 00:12:08.959 align:start position:0%
mention in your introduction of the bill
 
00:12:08.959 --> 00:12:09.829 align:start position:0%
mention in your introduction of the bill
about

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:09.839 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:12:12.790 --> 00:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
listing fees
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
for uh applicants and i don't see that
 
00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
anywhere in your bill
 
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
no that's currently required
 
00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be changed that's correct
 
00:12:24.230 --> 00:12:24.240 align:start position:0%
but you mentioned it in your
 
00:12:25.750 --> 00:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill which made me
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
think that there would be additional
 
00:12:31.829 --> 00:12:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:35.440 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:36.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
my point in in mentioning it in my
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
introduction was that the cost of the
 
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.470 align:start position:0%
introduction was that the cost of the
studies

00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
studies
 
00:12:47.190 --> 00:12:47.200 align:start position:0%
are part of the cost of that application
 
00:12:49.829 --> 00:12:49.839 align:start position:0%
and so currently there are there are
 
00:12:51.509 --> 00:12:51.519 align:start position:0%
requirements to
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
post the fees for the application
 
00:12:54.399 --> 00:12:55.269 align:start position:0%
post the fees for the application
right

00:12:55.269 --> 00:12:55.279 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:12:59.910 --> 00:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
in a sense all this is doing is saying
 
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
we understand that we're supposed to
 
00:13:05.030 --> 00:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
post the fees for the application
 
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:07.110 align:start position:0%
post the fees for the application
and

00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:07.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
some part of that cost
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
could be studies
 
00:13:14.230 --> 00:13:14.240 align:start position:0%
and therefore we're going to also
 
00:13:16.310 --> 00:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
let you know that these studies may
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
occur obviously the size and the scope
 
00:13:22.790 --> 00:13:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the study will affect the cost but
 
00:13:24.870 --> 00:13:24.880 align:start position:0%
being aware that they
 
00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:28.240 align:start position:0%
that these are part of that process or
 
00:13:32.069 --> 00:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
they could be part of that process would
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
help them understand whether or not uh
 
00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
the total scope and cost of the project
 
00:13:42.150 --> 00:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
as far as the application
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair yes
 
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
please thank you mr chair
 
00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.310 align:start position:0%
please thank you mr chair
uh

00:13:50.310 --> 00:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
you also
 
00:13:53.829 --> 00:13:53.839 align:start position:0%
said in response to the previous
 
00:13:53.839 --> 00:13:55.030 align:start position:0%
said in response to the previous
question

00:13:55.030 --> 00:13:55.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
that if a planning board if this bill
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
bill were to come law
 
00:14:02.710 --> 00:14:02.720 align:start position:0%
wanted to do another study on us on the
 
00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
same issue that it would there would
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
have to be a vote
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
taken by the board but i don't see that
 
00:14:13.430 --> 00:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.230 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:14:14.230 --> 00:14:14.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:16.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um so if you
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a traffic study
 
00:14:21.269 --> 00:14:21.279 align:start position:0%
and then the board wanted to do another
 
00:14:23.110 --> 00:14:23.120 align:start position:0%
traffic study
 
00:14:26.310 --> 00:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
um they would have to decide
 
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are allowed to do
 
00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:29.590 align:start position:0%
whether or not they are allowed to do
that

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.629 align:start position:0%
that
right

00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
under this law
 
00:14:32.079 --> 00:14:33.110 align:start position:0%
under this law
and

00:14:33.110 --> 00:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:35.680 align:start position:0%
that discussion
 
00:14:37.350 --> 00:14:37.360 align:start position:0%
that discussion about whether or not
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to do it
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
up to the
 
00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
they would vote on whether they believed
 
00:14:48.389 --> 00:14:48.399 align:start position:0%
it would substantial if the study
 
00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:50.150 align:start position:0%
it would substantial if the study
um

00:14:50.150 --> 00:14:50.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
if they're allowed to do it because the
 
00:14:54.230 --> 00:14:54.240 align:start position:0%
plan substantially
 
00:14:57.110 --> 00:14:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh changed the impact of the issue that
 
00:14:58.389 --> 00:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
was studied
 
00:15:02.949 --> 00:15:02.959 align:start position:0%
so if you come to the board you study um
 
00:15:02.959 --> 00:15:03.750 align:start position:0%
so if you come to the board you study um
uh

00:15:03.750 --> 00:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:06.069 --> 00:15:06.079 align:start position:0%
the traffic study and then you add 10
 
00:15:07.750 --> 00:15:07.760 align:start position:0%
more houses
 
00:15:08.949 --> 00:15:08.959 align:start position:0%
and then you could
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
you the the board could would say hey
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
maybe we want to study this traffic
 
00:15:16.870 --> 00:15:16.880 align:start position:0%
study again because there's more houses
 
00:15:18.629 --> 00:15:18.639 align:start position:0%
the chan plan has changed there's going
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
to be more traffic and so we want to
 
00:15:23.110 --> 00:15:23.120 align:start position:0%
know what that impact is
 
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:24.550 align:start position:0%
know what that impact is
right

00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:15:28.230 --> 00:15:28.240 align:start position:0%
the board would say okay we um
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
according to this law
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
we read it to
 
00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.269 align:start position:0%
we read it to
uh

00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:15:35.509 --> 00:15:35.519 align:start position:0%
substantially impact that issue and they
 
00:15:37.269 --> 00:15:37.279 align:start position:0%
would make a ruling about whether they
 
00:15:38.629 --> 00:15:38.639 align:start position:0%
believed that was
 
00:15:41.269 --> 00:15:41.279 align:start position:0%
was impacted whereas maybe adding one
 
00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.310 align:start position:0%
was impacted whereas maybe adding one
house

00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:42.320 align:start position:0%
house
 
00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
the board would say
 
00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:48.800 align:start position:0%
it's um you know the one more car
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
would would not be substantial
 
00:15:52.550 --> 00:15:52.560 align:start position:0%
substantially different than the
 
00:15:54.150 --> 00:15:54.160 align:start position:0%
information that we got from the first
 
00:15:59.749 --> 00:15:59.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:01.430 --> 00:16:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:16:03.509 --> 00:16:03.519 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
i'm trying to understand if this is
 
00:16:08.790 --> 00:16:08.800 align:start position:0%
a solution looking for a problem
 
00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
can you cite how
 
00:16:14.389 --> 00:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
can you cite any specific situations
 
00:16:22.949 --> 00:16:22.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:22.959 --> 00:16:26.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.310 --> 00:16:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.030 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:16:36.069 --> 00:16:36.079 align:start position:0%
i would obviously i'm i only live in one
 
00:16:40.629 --> 00:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:42.870 --> 00:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
the my experience in my own town it
 
00:16:44.230 --> 00:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be
 
00:16:46.230 --> 00:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
you know a larger study of
 
00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
how how uh
 
00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040 align:start position:0%
much this impacts people in other towns
 
00:16:52.949 --> 00:16:52.959 align:start position:0%
it would be anecdotal anything that i
 
00:16:52.959 --> 00:16:53.749 align:start position:0%
it would be anecdotal anything that i
said

00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
said
 
00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:56.800 align:start position:0%
but um there was
 
00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:57.590 align:start position:0%
but um there was
um

00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
something in in
 
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
the town
 
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
that i live in
 
00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:03.430 align:start position:0%
that i live in
that

00:17:03.430 --> 00:17:03.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.029 align:start position:0%
that
was

00:17:05.029 --> 00:17:05.039 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.630 align:start position:0%
was
controversial

00:17:06.630 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
controversial
 
00:17:09.909 --> 00:17:09.919 align:start position:0%
um in the town and some of the people on
 
00:17:11.189 --> 00:17:11.199 align:start position:0%
the board
 
00:17:12.870 --> 00:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
were not
 
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:15.110 align:start position:0%
were not
um

00:17:15.110 --> 00:17:15.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
satisfied or did not like the person
 
00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
that was chosen to do the study
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
um they did not like the answer of the
 
00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:26.160 align:start position:0%
study is kind of how it how what came
 
00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
about it and they wanted to look into
 
00:17:32.470 --> 00:17:32.480 align:start position:0%
that issue again to try and get what
 
00:17:34.870 --> 00:17:34.880 align:start position:0%
they thought was the correct answer and
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.510 align:start position:0%
 
make

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
make
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
in in that example
 
00:17:45.669 --> 00:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
the the people
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
were trying i think to
 
00:17:49.990 --> 00:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
kill the project by just studying it to
 
00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:51.350 align:start position:0%
kill the project by just studying it to
death

00:17:51.350 --> 00:17:51.360 align:start position:0%
death
 
00:17:51.360 --> 00:17:53.350 align:start position:0%
death
but

00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:17:55.510 --> 00:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
i think in general
 
00:17:57.909 --> 00:17:57.919 align:start position:0%
you know it's important to be upfront
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
with what the
 
00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:01.760 align:start position:0%
the fees are of the process and that's
 
00:18:03.909 --> 00:18:03.919 align:start position:0%
why we have it required now
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to expand on that
 
00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:07.270 align:start position:0%
so i'm just trying to expand on that
representative

00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:18:09.110 --> 00:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:18:12.470 --> 00:18:12.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question absolutely so in
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
preparation for this bill hearing i did
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
two things
 
00:18:20.310 --> 00:18:20.320 align:start position:0%
i um referenced rsa 674
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
and um that lists provisions um a
 
00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
through e to which you would like to add
 
00:18:29.270 --> 00:18:29.280 align:start position:0%
f as
 
00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
outlined or in within the framework of
 
00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:33.520 align:start position:0%
this bill and secondly
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
i looked up
 
00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:38.160 align:start position:0%
for my town the site plan regulations
 
00:18:40.470 --> 00:18:40.480 align:start position:0%
and i noticed on page seven my
 
00:18:43.669 --> 00:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
particular town in fact does list
 
00:18:46.390 --> 00:18:46.400 align:start position:0%
studies for example environmental impact
 
00:18:49.190 --> 00:18:49.200 align:start position:0%
hydrological impact ground quality
 
00:18:51.669 --> 00:18:51.679 align:start position:0%
ground water quality in impact traffic
 
00:18:51.679 --> 00:18:53.270 align:start position:0%
ground water quality in impact traffic
impact

00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:18:55.510 --> 00:18:55.520 align:start position:0%
parking studies and then they also list
 
00:18:58.070 --> 00:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
and other special studies
 
00:18:59.909 --> 00:18:59.919 align:start position:0%
and then it goes on to say or any other
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
study deemed necessary by the planning
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
board in order to make it an informed
 
00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:05.029 align:start position:0%
board in order to make it an informed
decision

00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:19:06.230 --> 00:19:06.240 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
my question is is i'd like to better
 
00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand the purpose and in the intent
 
00:19:13.110 --> 00:19:13.120 align:start position:0%
of this bill because you say list
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
studies so
 
00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:19:17.430 --> 00:19:17.440 align:start position:0%
very specific
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
what is this bill asking to do are they
 
00:19:22.870 --> 00:19:22.880 align:start position:0%
are they directing municipalities to
 
00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
list within their ordinances
 
00:19:29.029 --> 00:19:29.039 align:start position:0%
very clearly because i only spot checked
 
00:19:30.870 --> 00:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
brookline i do not know if other
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
municipalities are in fact taking the
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
step to list studies and furthermore i i
 
00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:40.960 align:start position:0%
do understand that again looking at my
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
municipality that they did list fees so
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
is the goal and the intent of this
 
00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
legislation is it to clearly list
 
00:19:52.950 --> 00:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
any such studies and also
 
00:19:56.230 --> 00:19:56.240 align:start position:0%
to publish within the municipal
 
00:19:59.190 --> 00:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
ordinances fees associated with with
 
00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.549 align:start position:0%
ordinances fees associated with with
those

00:20:00.549 --> 00:20:00.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:20:02.390 --> 00:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
could you clarify thank you
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question absolutely um
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
so it's good that that your town is uh
 
00:20:10.470 --> 00:20:10.480 align:start position:0%
listing some of the things that they
 
00:20:11.510 --> 00:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:20:14.549 --> 00:20:14.559 align:start position:0%
um studying however obviously the list
 
00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:18.230 align:start position:0%
um studying however obviously the list
is

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.029 align:start position:0%
 
not

00:20:19.029 --> 00:20:19.039 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:20.470 align:start position:0%
not
comprehensive

00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:21.669 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
and

00:20:21.669 --> 00:20:21.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:21.679 --> 00:20:22.789 align:start position:0%
and
that

00:20:22.789 --> 00:20:22.799 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
i believe you know
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:20:28.710 --> 00:20:28.720 align:start position:0%
a problem
 
00:20:30.789 --> 00:20:30.799 align:start position:0%
as far as you know
 
00:20:34.630 --> 00:20:34.640 align:start position:0%
transparency and what the the cost of of
 
00:20:37.430 --> 00:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
that application might be
 
00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.390 align:start position:0%
that application might be
um

00:20:38.390 --> 00:20:38.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.510 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:20:39.510 --> 00:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
there is
 
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:42.070 align:start position:0%
there is
so

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
the cost of each study is going to
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.390 align:start position:0%
to um
vary

00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
vary
 
00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
widely depending on how much
 
00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
there is to study so you wouldn't be
 
00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
able to say like oh we're going to
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
charge you a certain flat fee
 
00:21:01.029 --> 00:21:01.039 align:start position:0%
for this study you would have to go
 
00:21:03.669 --> 00:21:03.679 align:start position:0%
and acquire the study and depending on
 
00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:06.720 align:start position:0%
how much work is it is
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
in that you know how much of the impact
 
00:21:09.909 --> 00:21:09.919 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to affect
 
00:21:17.190 --> 00:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
obviously the cost of that study so i
 
00:21:19.590 --> 00:21:19.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's even possible to
 
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.750 align:start position:0%
don't think that it's even possible to
list

00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
list
 
00:21:24.630 --> 00:21:24.640 align:start position:0%
the amounts of what the studies would
 
00:21:24.640 --> 00:21:25.590 align:start position:0%
the amounts of what the studies would
cost

00:21:25.590 --> 00:21:25.600 align:start position:0%
cost
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's just a guideline to say okay we're
 
00:21:30.950 --> 00:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
going to study the the parking and the
 
00:21:30.960 --> 00:21:33.029 align:start position:0%
going to study the the parking and the
traffic

00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
traffic
 
00:21:33.039 --> 00:21:33.830 align:start position:0%
traffic
and

00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:35.760 align:start position:0%
maybe the water table
 
00:21:37.270 --> 00:21:37.280 align:start position:0%
you know these are the things that this
 
00:21:39.350 --> 00:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
town is looking at when
 
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
when we set up an ordinance we set up
 
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
what is allowed to be
 
00:21:45.909 --> 00:21:45.919 align:start position:0%
in you know each district let's say and
 
00:21:48.149 --> 00:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
so if you have
 
00:21:48.159 --> 00:21:49.990 align:start position:0%
so if you have
industrial

00:21:49.990 --> 00:21:50.000 align:start position:0%
industrial
 
00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:52.080 align:start position:0%
things going in then you want to be able
 
00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:53.669 align:start position:0%
things going in then you want to be able
to

00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:21:55.669 --> 00:21:55.679 align:start position:0%
make sure that the water table is going
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
to be safe and
 
00:21:59.350 --> 00:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
and those types of things so those
 
00:22:00.789 --> 00:22:00.799 align:start position:0%
things that you're looking at should
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
really be listed and not um you know
 
00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
anything else that we imagined
 
00:22:07.110 --> 00:22:07.120 align:start position:0%

00:22:16.710 --> 00:22:16.720 align:start position:0%
requirement for getting this uh passed
 
00:22:19.590 --> 00:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up mr chair yes
 
00:22:22.149 --> 00:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
thank you um and thank you for taking my
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
follow-up question so relative to the
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
language in this legislation
 
00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
proposed section f
 
00:22:31.830 --> 00:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
could you also
 
00:22:34.470 --> 00:22:34.480 align:start position:0%
tell me if the the term substantially
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
impact is defined anywhere i'm
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
interested in knowing the criteria
 
00:22:42.870 --> 00:22:42.880 align:start position:0%
for that because it says
 
00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:44.880 align:start position:0%
after a study completion which would
 
00:22:48.230 --> 00:22:48.240 align:start position:0%
substantially impact the issue
 
00:22:50.390 --> 00:22:50.400 align:start position:0%
is that defined anywhere else in statute
 
00:22:52.390 --> 00:22:52.400 align:start position:0%
that we could reference and could you
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.590 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
um

00:22:59.590 --> 00:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
as i was saying before i don't
 
00:23:03.549 --> 00:23:03.559 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of anywhere that
 
00:23:06.470 --> 00:23:06.480 align:start position:0%
substantially impact is defined and it's
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
not defined in this um
 
00:23:10.789 --> 00:23:10.799 align:start position:0%
this ordinance if if you believe that
 
00:23:13.270 --> 00:23:13.280 align:start position:0%
that is necessary and the that the board
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
would not be able to decide that on
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
their own
 
00:23:17.510 --> 00:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
um whether
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
it had a substantial impact or not
 
00:23:20.159 --> 00:23:20.950 align:start position:0%
it had a substantial impact or not
um

00:23:20.950 --> 00:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:23.909 --> 00:23:23.919 align:start position:0%
with the um as already explained with
 
00:23:23.919 --> 00:23:24.630 align:start position:0%
with the um as already explained with
the

00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:24.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:26.310 --> 00:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
um caveat that if there was a
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
disagreement whether with um obviously
 
00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:30.950 align:start position:0%
disagreement whether with um obviously
abutters

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:30.960 align:start position:0%
abutters
 
00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:32.799 align:start position:0%
or the applicant
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
and whether it was substantially
 
00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:37.590 align:start position:0%
and whether it was substantially
uh

00:23:37.590 --> 00:23:37.600 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
you know any decision made by the board
 
00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
can be appealed to the zba by the
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
butters or the applicant and so
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
if there was a disagreement on that
 
00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:48.880 align:start position:0%
issue that would be
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
able to be appealed and discussed
 
00:23:54.630 --> 00:23:54.640 align:start position:0%
um more thoroughly with uh
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
you know the
 
00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:57.760 align:start position:0%
appropriate through the appropriate
 
00:23:57.760 --> 00:24:05.750 align:start position:0%
appropriate through the appropriate
process

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:08.400 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any uh questions for
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:14.149 --> 00:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
yes representative stavis thank you mr
 
00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:15.440 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking yet
 
00:24:16.830 --> 00:24:16.840 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:24:20.470 --> 00:24:20.480 align:start position:0%
representative uh so
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
under letter f in your bill there are
 
00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
several grammatical errors that i would
 
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
one is that you list studies
 
00:24:35.350 --> 00:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
in line four
 
00:24:36.390 --> 00:24:36.400 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:24:39.029 --> 00:24:39.039 align:start position:0%
plural noun representative could you
 
00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:40.870 align:start position:0%
plural noun representative could you
yes

00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
do you mean that to be
 
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:46.640 align:start position:0%
a possessive
 
00:24:48.230 --> 00:24:48.240 align:start position:0%
singular noun
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
it confuses me
 
00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:53.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question let me just
 
00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:54.400 align:start position:0%
just uh
 
00:24:56.149 --> 00:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
re re-read
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
let's see
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
yes you're you're right it should be
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
possessive thank you thank you and then
 
00:25:21.029 --> 00:25:21.039 align:start position:0%
and my my my last question
 
00:25:21.039 --> 00:25:21.990 align:start position:0%
and my my my last question
uh

00:25:21.990 --> 00:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:24.080 align:start position:0%
is about the phrase which would
 
00:25:27.350 --> 00:25:27.360 align:start position:0%
substantially impact the issues studied
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
does that refer to the studies
 
00:25:32.630 --> 00:25:32.640 align:start position:0%
or to the development
 
00:25:35.190 --> 00:25:35.200 align:start position:0%
being reviewed it's not clear from the
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:45.350 --> 00:25:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:48.320 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure of the
 
00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:50.400 align:start position:0%
a way in which
 
00:25:55.269 --> 00:25:55.279 align:start position:0%
a study would impact the issue studied
 
00:25:55.279 --> 00:25:56.470 align:start position:0%
a study would impact the issue studied
so

00:25:56.470 --> 00:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
i think that the only way to understand
 
00:26:01.029 --> 00:26:01.039 align:start position:0%
that language is that it has to be the
 
00:26:03.909 --> 00:26:03.919 align:start position:0%
plan it is the is the thing that changed
 
00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
so any further questions for the
 
00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:08.149 align:start position:0%
so any further questions for the
representative

00:26:08.149 --> 00:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:26:08.159 --> 00:26:08.830 align:start position:0%
representative
uh

00:26:08.830 --> 00:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative a question was brought up
 
00:26:13.909 --> 00:26:13.919 align:start position:0%
about language would you expect that you
 
00:26:13.919 --> 00:26:14.950 align:start position:0%
about language would you expect that you
would

00:26:14.950 --> 00:26:14.960 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
bring forth an amendment to correct that
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
are you okay the way it is
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
with the possessive
 
00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.190 align:start position:0%
with the possessive
um

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:23.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:26.390 --> 00:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
draft an amendment i would be more
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
interested if the committee was um
 
00:26:34.310 --> 00:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
wanted me to draft
 
00:26:37.669 --> 00:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
an amendment to define substantially
 
00:26:40.070 --> 00:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
that would be more of i'm happy to do
 
00:26:41.669 --> 00:26:41.679 align:start position:0%
the possessive obviously that's just a
 
00:26:43.269 --> 00:26:43.279 align:start position:0%
grammatical change but
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm happy i'm i'm willing to work on
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%

believes is is appropriate so
 
00:26:55.510 --> 00:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to propose that amendment for
 
00:26:56.710 --> 00:26:56.720 align:start position:0%

00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%

any further questions
 
00:27:50.549 --> 00:27:50.559 align:start position:0%
uh any questions
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
from the public
 
00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:55.600 align:start position:0%
we did have a request to speak from the
 
00:28:06.630 --> 00:28:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:08.470 --> 00:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace for the
 
00:28:10.310 --> 00:28:10.320 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association we
 
00:28:13.110 --> 00:28:13.120 align:start position:0%
object to this bill as written and based
 
00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:14.720 align:start position:0%
on what i've heard here today we would
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
also object to the amendment
 
00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
the first thing i want to point out is
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
that this would amend rsa 674 colon 44
 
00:28:26.149 --> 00:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
roman 3 by inserting a new sub-paragraph
 
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:28.080 align:start position:0%
that statute is the statute that
 
00:28:31.669 --> 00:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
requires a planning board to
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
adopt site plan review regulations and
 
00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.029 align:start position:0%
adopt site plan review regulations and
lists

00:28:35.029 --> 00:28:35.039 align:start position:0%
lists
 
00:28:37.029 --> 00:28:37.039 align:start position:0%
what is required in those site plan
 
00:28:39.669 --> 00:28:39.679 align:start position:0%
review regulations
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
so essentially what this would do
 
00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:44.960 align:start position:0%
is just require exactly what brookline
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
does although of course if there's
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
already a fee attached to it they would
 
00:28:50.149 --> 00:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
already have to list what they what they
 
00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:51.360 align:start position:0%
want so
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really change anything
 
00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really change anything
um

00:28:54.870 --> 00:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
and the problem is is you would you
 
00:28:58.630 --> 00:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
would end up with a list exactly like
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
brooklines because
 
00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
the planning board wouldn't necessarily
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
know all possible studies and
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
it might be the case for example that in
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
you know a place that's heavily impacted
 
00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:11.669 align:start position:0%
you know a place that's heavily impacted
by

00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:13.520 align:start position:0%
pfas if
 
00:29:13.520 --> 00:29:14.630 align:start position:0%
pfas if
des

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
des
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
enacts a soil surface uh standard
 
00:29:21.909 --> 00:29:21.919 align:start position:0%
that you know a project that would
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
that would result in
 
00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.430 align:start position:0%
that would result in
substantial

00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
substantial
 
00:29:26.870 --> 00:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
digging or something that would disturb
 
00:29:28.789 --> 00:29:28.799 align:start position:0%
the soil might require some sort of
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
study related to that i don't know what
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
that is
 
00:29:32.789 --> 00:29:32.799 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anybody knows what that
 
00:29:34.789 --> 00:29:34.799 align:start position:0%
is at the point of at this point in time
 
00:29:34.799 --> 00:29:35.830 align:start position:0%
is at the point of at this point in time
but

00:29:35.830 --> 00:29:35.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
a simple listing of all possible studies
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't really help applicants know what
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
they need because
 
00:29:43.430 --> 00:29:43.440 align:start position:0%
you know certainly if you're proposing a
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
big box store you can assume a traffic
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
study makes sense but if you're building
 
00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:49.440 align:start position:0%
a house that doesn't really make sense
 
00:29:51.510 --> 00:29:51.520 align:start position:0%
um if you're building you know on top of
 
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
a mountain you're not going to need a
 
00:29:54.549 --> 00:29:54.559 align:start position:0%
wetland study
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
but you are if you are in a place where
 
00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:57.029 align:start position:0%
but you are if you are in a place where
it's

00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a possible wetland
 
00:30:01.750 --> 00:30:01.760 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't really help applicants
 
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
narrow down what their costs are going
 
00:30:06.070 --> 00:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.590 --> 00:30:09.600 align:start position:0%
already they have the option of going to
 
00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:11.200 align:start position:0%
uh the planning board prior to
 
00:30:12.950 --> 00:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
submitting an application
 
00:30:14.870 --> 00:30:14.880 align:start position:0%
speaking with the board on a
 
00:30:16.630 --> 00:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
semi-formal basis
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
saying here's kind of our plan what do
 
00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:20.480 align:start position:0%
we need to know and there is an
 
00:30:21.909 --> 00:30:21.919 align:start position:0%
obligation of the planning board to talk
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
to them and to say you know
 
00:30:26.389 --> 00:30:26.399 align:start position:0%
based on where you are in town we've
 
00:30:28.789 --> 00:30:28.799 align:start position:0%
seen that there are wetlands from other
 
00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:30.720 align:start position:0%
applications you might need a wetland
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
study that's something you might want to
 
00:30:34.310 --> 00:30:34.320 align:start position:0%
look into
 
00:30:36.950 --> 00:30:36.960 align:start position:0%
and you know the list goes on from there
 
00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:39.120 align:start position:0%
um and that's really the best way for
 
00:30:41.029 --> 00:30:41.039 align:start position:0%
the applicant to know what the cost
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
would be before they go too far into the
 
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.470 align:start position:0%
would be before they go too far into the
project

00:30:44.470 --> 00:30:44.480 align:start position:0%
project
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
and they can certainly do that at a
 
00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:49.200 align:start position:0%
preliminary design phase where they
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
would go in
 
00:30:52.470 --> 00:30:52.480 align:start position:0%
long before hiring architects or
 
00:30:55.510 --> 00:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
anything and saying you know i i own 20
 
00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.320 align:start position:0%
acres i want to subdivide that into 20
 
00:31:01.350 --> 00:31:01.360 align:start position:0%
lots and build a residential
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
place what do i need to know and the
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
town is obligated to tell them what they
 
00:31:07.990 --> 00:31:08.000 align:start position:0%
need to know about that
 
00:31:09.990 --> 00:31:10.000 align:start position:0%
the other portion of the
 
00:31:11.830 --> 00:31:11.840 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed
 
00:31:14.389 --> 00:31:14.399 align:start position:0%
would prevent duplicate studies
 
00:31:18.230 --> 00:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
already we have in place rsa 674 colon 4
 
00:31:20.950 --> 00:31:20.960 align:start position:0%
hyphen b
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
and that's for the planning board and
 
00:31:27.029 --> 00:31:27.039 align:start position:0%
rsa 676 colon 5 roman 5 a which is for
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
the zba
 
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.269 align:start position:0%
the zba
which

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:31:31.430 --> 00:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
essentially says
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
on the one side the planning board can't
 
00:31:36.070 --> 00:31:36.080 align:start position:0%
require substantially duplicative
 
00:31:38.789 --> 00:31:38.799 align:start position:0%
studies those are the same studies as
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
the zoning board
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
and vice versa because if you have that
 
00:31:44.070 --> 00:31:44.080 align:start position:0%
information once
 
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:46.000 align:start position:0%
you can't require applicants to go out
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
and get it again
 
00:31:50.149 --> 00:31:50.159 align:start position:0%
um it sounds from the discussion like
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
cases out there where
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
an applicant goes out gets a study
 
00:31:58.630 --> 00:31:58.640 align:start position:0%
and then the abutters who live next to
 
00:31:58.640 --> 00:31:59.430 align:start position:0%
and then the abutters who live next to
them

00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:32:01.430 --> 00:32:01.440 align:start position:0%
don't like the result or they don't like
 
00:32:02.710 --> 00:32:02.720 align:start position:0%
what the applicant's doing so they get
 
00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:04.000 align:start position:0%
their own study
 
00:32:05.750 --> 00:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
both sides have the option of presenting
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
that to whichever board they're in front
 
00:32:10.389 --> 00:32:10.399 align:start position:0%
of and that board has an obligation to
 
00:32:12.630 --> 00:32:12.640 align:start position:0%
determine which one is best and it may
 
00:32:14.149 --> 00:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
be the case the board needs to hire an
 
00:32:15.430 --> 00:32:15.440 align:start position:0%
expert to help them sort through the
 
00:32:17.029 --> 00:32:17.039 align:start position:0%
studies if it's a highly technical
 
00:32:17.039 --> 00:32:18.230 align:start position:0%
studies if it's a highly technical
analysis

00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
analysis
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
and point out you know what the what the
 
00:32:21.029 --> 00:32:21.039 align:start position:0%
errors are
 
00:32:23.190 --> 00:32:23.200 align:start position:0%
um or what the
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
what the different factors are and then
 
00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh it's ultimately the board's decision
 
00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:31.440 align:start position:0%
as to what study is more persuasive
 
00:32:32.950 --> 00:32:32.960 align:start position:0%
which one to believe much like a
 
00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.549 align:start position:0%
which one to believe much like a
courtroom

00:32:34.549 --> 00:32:34.559 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:37.200 align:start position:0%
really what i want to point out to the
 
00:32:39.190 --> 00:32:39.200 align:start position:0%
committee i'm happy to take questions
 
00:32:41.509 --> 00:32:41.519 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions for the nhma mr
 
00:32:41.519 --> 00:32:44.070 align:start position:0%
anybody have questions for the nhma mr
graves

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:46.470 --> 00:32:46.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative manchapudi
 
00:32:48.310 --> 00:32:48.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:32:49.909 --> 00:32:49.919 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:32:49.919 --> 00:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
my question
um

00:32:51.110 --> 00:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:52.549 --> 00:32:52.559 align:start position:0%
from your testimony what i'm
 
00:32:55.430 --> 00:32:55.440 align:start position:0%
understanding is that true that
 
00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.549 align:start position:0%
understanding is that true that
this

00:32:56.549 --> 00:32:56.559 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill does not clarify or
 
00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.190 align:start position:0%
bill does not clarify or
help

00:33:01.190 --> 00:33:01.200 align:start position:0%
help
 
00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
preventing repetitive studies
 
00:33:07.509 --> 00:33:07.519 align:start position:0%
in all scenarios so when you change an
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
rsa it's not just one particular small
 
00:33:13.350 --> 00:33:13.360 align:start position:0%
town but it also impacts
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
every municipality or city or every
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
community and how would this impact the
 
00:33:21.669 --> 00:33:21.679 align:start position:0%
larger communities for example like in
 
00:33:24.149 --> 00:33:24.159 align:start position:0%
nashua what would the zoning board have
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
to face if this
 
00:33:28.710 --> 00:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
is it would it make it more restrictive
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question um
 
00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:33:35.350 --> 00:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
i really don't see how this would
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
enhance an applicant's ability to do
 
00:33:39.509 --> 00:33:39.519 align:start position:0%
anything because they might for example
 
00:33:41.269 --> 00:33:41.279 align:start position:0%
go in and say i want to subdivide my
 
00:33:44.470 --> 00:33:44.480 align:start position:0%
property and build however many houses
 
00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
they start doing a study and uh you know
 
00:33:50.389 --> 00:33:50.399 align:start position:0%
they realize hey their wetlands here
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
maybe instead of going through the whole
 
00:33:53.750 --> 00:33:53.760 align:start position:0%
process of getting the excavation permit
 
00:33:55.590 --> 00:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
through des and all of that
 
00:33:58.149 --> 00:33:58.159 align:start position:0%
we're just going to change the plan um
 
00:34:00.149 --> 00:34:00.159 align:start position:0%
and then you have to make sure that
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
whatever information you've given to the
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
board corresponds with what your plan is
 
00:34:06.149 --> 00:34:06.159 align:start position:0%
right otherwise why do it
 
00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:09.280 align:start position:0%
so if their initial study didn't capture
 
00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:10.879 align:start position:0%
enough information
 
00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:12.560 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:14.800 align:start position:0%
inform the board about their new plan
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
then you have to redo part of the study
 
00:34:19.109 --> 00:34:19.119 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:21.919 align:start position:0%
i don't think that this would
 
00:34:26.629 --> 00:34:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:28.230 --> 00:34:28.240 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow
 
00:34:31.990 --> 00:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair yeah so basically it's not
 
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.430 align:start position:0%
mr chair yeah so basically it's not
helping

00:34:33.430 --> 00:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
helping
 
00:34:35.589 --> 00:34:35.599 align:start position:0%
the person who's applying
 
00:34:38.149 --> 00:34:38.159 align:start position:0%
to reduce the fee or do the repetitive
 
00:34:39.589 --> 00:34:39.599 align:start position:0%
but it gives
 
00:34:42.149 --> 00:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
the municipalities and the towns
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
the platform where as it stands now it
 
00:34:48.149 --> 00:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
gives opportunity for all parties to
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
work it through if there is
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
uh any issues right right and under the
 
00:34:55.430 --> 00:34:55.440 align:start position:0%
existing statutes you know you might
 
00:34:55.440 --> 00:34:56.710 align:start position:0%
existing statutes you know you might
have

00:34:56.710 --> 00:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:34:58.390 --> 00:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
someone going with their application go
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
before the planning board the planning
 
00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:02.640 align:start position:0%
award requires that wetlands study and
 
00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:04.560 align:start position:0%
part of the planning board
 
00:35:07.910 --> 00:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
approval process is that they
 
00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:35:10.390 --> 00:35:10.400 align:start position:0%
they they can't improve the plan without
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
a variance so the affliction goes to zba
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
and halfway through that
 
00:35:16.870 --> 00:35:16.880 align:start position:0%
process they realize
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
you know maybe it's more economical
 
00:35:19.829 --> 00:35:19.839 align:start position:0%
maybe it's a better idea whatever the
 
00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:22.240 align:start position:0%
case is they decide to change the plan
 
00:35:24.310 --> 00:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
and if your initial study already
 
00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:26.320 align:start position:0%
captured that the zba can't go back and
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
say we need to do the study again that's
 
00:35:30.069 --> 00:35:30.079 align:start position:0%
already prevented under this under the
 
00:35:31.829 --> 00:35:31.839 align:start position:0%
law and once they're sent back to the
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
planning board the planning board can't
 
00:35:34.150 --> 00:35:34.160 align:start position:0%
say you have to go back and do the study
 
00:35:36.069 --> 00:35:36.079 align:start position:0%
again because it's already
 
00:35:38.390 --> 00:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
it they already have the information
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
that's not allowed
 
00:35:44.870 --> 00:35:44.880 align:start position:0%
any other questions for the nhma
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:51.430 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
and that concludes our hearing on hb
 
00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.030 align:start position:0%
and that concludes our hearing on hb
1136.

00:35:57.030 --> 00:35:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:00.150 --> 00:36:00.160 align:start position:0%
our next bill to be heard is 1161
 
00:36:02.950 --> 00:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
which is relative to ethics obligations
 
00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.670 align:start position:0%
which is relative to ethics obligations
of

00:36:03.670 --> 00:36:03.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:36:06.390 --> 00:36:06.400 align:start position:0%
elected local and county officials
 
00:36:16.310 --> 00:36:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have anyone that wishes to introduce
 
00:36:29.670 --> 00:36:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
no push the push button okay we're good
 
00:36:46.230 --> 00:36:46.240 align:start position:0%
so thank you for hearing me i am uh
 
00:36:48.069 --> 00:36:48.079 align:start position:0%
representative callum from sullivan
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
district six
 
00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:52.310 align:start position:0%
district six
um

00:36:52.310 --> 00:36:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:54.790 --> 00:36:54.800 align:start position:0%
and just for a little bit of background
 
00:36:57.589 --> 00:36:57.599 align:start position:0%
i've been at this
 
00:36:57.599 --> 00:36:58.790 align:start position:0%
i've been at this
and

00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
so my experiences
 
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.069 align:start position:0%
so my experiences
are

00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:37:05.349 --> 00:37:05.359 align:start position:0%
the main reason for bringing this
 
00:37:05.359 --> 00:37:06.550 align:start position:0%
the main reason for bringing this
and

00:37:06.550 --> 00:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:09.349 --> 00:37:09.359 align:start position:0%
i had input from others
 
00:37:12.630 --> 00:37:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
so i think that this is a case of
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
the timing
 
00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.240 align:start position:0%
is past due
 
00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.829 align:start position:0%
is past due
um

00:37:23.829 --> 00:37:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:26.320 align:start position:0%
you all have the paper in front of you i
 
00:37:29.589 --> 00:37:29.599 align:start position:0%
don't know that i really need to read it
 
00:37:29.599 --> 00:37:31.270 align:start position:0%
don't know that i really need to read it
um

00:37:31.270 --> 00:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:33.750 --> 00:37:33.760 align:start position:0%
suffice to say that the attention here
 
00:37:39.030 --> 00:37:39.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:41.920 align:start position:0%
bring the same level
 
00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:43.510 align:start position:0%
bring the same level
of

00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:44.870 align:start position:0%
of
ethics

00:37:44.870 --> 00:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
00:37:47.430 --> 00:37:47.440 align:start position:0%
to county and local government
 
00:37:50.390 --> 00:37:50.400 align:start position:0%
that we ourselves as representatives
 
00:37:51.750 --> 00:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
have to
 
00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
assign to
 
00:37:58.069 --> 00:37:58.079 align:start position:0%
and in the past there's not been
 
00:38:03.349 --> 00:38:03.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:06.950 --> 00:38:06.960 align:start position:0%
a local government
 
00:38:08.870 --> 00:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
which they would still have to write it
 
00:38:11.109 --> 00:38:11.119 align:start position:0%
but at least you would have
 
00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:11.910 align:start position:0%
but at least you would have
a

00:38:11.910 --> 00:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:38:14.470 --> 00:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
state statute
 
00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:23.510 --> 00:38:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:24.640 align:start position:0%
pardon me
 
00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:25.510 align:start position:0%
pardon me
by

00:38:25.510 --> 00:38:25.520 align:start position:0%

and representative baxter of rockingham
20.

00:38:38.790 --> 00:38:38.800 align:start position:0%
20.
 
00:38:41.430 --> 00:38:41.440 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any of those are here
 
00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.390 align:start position:0%
i don't believe any of those are here
today

00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:47.829 --> 00:38:47.839 align:start position:0%
so my intention was to introduce it
 
00:38:47.839 --> 00:38:49.670 align:start position:0%
so my intention was to introduce it
and

00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:38:55.990 --> 00:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so my
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
question focuses on line 21 of the bill
 
00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.670 align:start position:0%
question focuses on line 21 of the bill
language

00:39:03.670 --> 00:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:39:06.470 --> 00:39:06.480 align:start position:0%
specifically the term
 
00:39:09.750 --> 00:39:09.760 align:start position:0%
removal by the voters so i would like to
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
understand by what mechanisms
 
00:39:15.190 --> 00:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
shall the person
 
00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:18.880 align:start position:0%
be removed from by the voters
 
00:39:19.910 --> 00:39:19.920 align:start position:0%
would it be
 
00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.109 align:start position:0%
would it be
by

00:39:21.109 --> 00:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
by
 
00:39:23.910 --> 00:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
a recall election and who would initiate
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
that would it be the governing body
 
00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:27.349 align:start position:0%
that would it be the governing body
or

00:39:27.349 --> 00:39:27.359 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:39:29.670 --> 00:39:29.680 align:start position:0%
would it be by a petitioned warrant
 
00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:30.790 align:start position:0%
would it be by a petitioned warrant
article

00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
article
 
00:39:33.510 --> 00:39:33.520 align:start position:0%
potentially a regular meeting which is
 
00:39:35.109 --> 00:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
probably unlikely
 
00:39:38.310 --> 00:39:38.320 align:start position:0%
and most likely it would be by a special
 
00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
meeting could you please explain
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
the mechanism by which this
 
00:39:46.310 --> 00:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
person would be removed by the voters
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
00:39:51.750 --> 00:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
that particular line
 
00:39:53.510 --> 00:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
as it appears
 
00:39:53.520 --> 00:39:54.390 align:start position:0%
as it appears
was

00:39:54.390 --> 00:39:54.400 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:57.520 align:start position:0%
put in by the writers from
 
00:39:57.520 --> 00:39:59.430 align:start position:0%
put in by the writers from
downstairs

00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
downstairs
 
00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:01.589 align:start position:0%
downstairs
and

00:40:01.589 --> 00:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure that i had
 
00:40:06.390 --> 00:40:06.400 align:start position:0%
a grasp on legalities
 
00:40:09.190 --> 00:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:09.990 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:40:09.990 --> 00:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
more specific
 
00:40:13.119 --> 00:40:14.790 align:start position:0%
more specific
and

00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:40:18.870 --> 00:40:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:21.200 align:start position:0%
because i'm not a legal individual i
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:40:22.640 --> 00:40:23.510 align:start position:0%
don't know
what

00:40:23.510 --> 00:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
what
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
is the correct mechanism to make
 
00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
something happen but i would
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
my guess would be that you would end up
 
00:40:33.510 --> 00:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
with a special
 
00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:35.349 align:start position:0%
with a special
election

00:40:35.349 --> 00:40:35.359 align:start position:0%
election
 
00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
or something of that sort
 
00:40:43.349 --> 00:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:45.349 align:start position:0%
 
that

00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:47.670 --> 00:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
for example the slackman
 
00:40:49.270 --> 00:40:49.280 align:start position:0%
would have to pursue
 
00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119 align:start position:0%
pursue legal avenues which may be the
 
00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:54.880 align:start position:0%
real possibility
 
00:40:58.710 --> 00:40:58.720 align:start position:0%
i don't have a straight answer for that
 
00:41:00.470 --> 00:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
 
00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:01.990 align:start position:0%
follow-up mr chair
um

00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
could you please edify me with regard to
 
00:41:07.349 --> 00:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
special elections i meant recall
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
elections in new hampshire is is that in
 
00:41:14.150 --> 00:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
our statute so um i asked that question
 
00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:16.150 align:start position:0%
our statute so um i asked that question
of

00:41:16.150 --> 00:41:16.160 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:41:18.230 --> 00:41:18.240 align:start position:0%
town council
 
00:41:21.109 --> 00:41:21.119 align:start position:0%
and the answer i got was that new
 
00:41:24.870 --> 00:41:24.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not have a provision
 
00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:25.910 align:start position:0%
hampshire does not have a provision
now

00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:25.920 align:start position:0%
now
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
i did not look myself yet to see if this
 
00:41:32.950 --> 00:41:32.960 align:start position:0%
is true but what i got in writing
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
was that new hampshire does not have a
 
00:41:38.230 --> 00:41:38.240 align:start position:0%
provision for recall elections
 
00:41:40.870 --> 00:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
as some states do
 
00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.829 align:start position:0%
as some states do
so

00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:41:54.230 --> 00:41:54.240 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question um
 
00:41:56.069 --> 00:41:56.079 align:start position:0%
like you i've been a member of my select
 
00:41:57.990 --> 00:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
board for many years and in my first
 
00:42:00.390 --> 00:42:00.400 align:start position:0%
term or maybe my second term
 
00:42:02.870 --> 00:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
uh myself and our two other select
 
00:42:06.309 --> 00:42:06.319 align:start position:0%
people drafted wrote a an ethics policy
 
00:42:08.230 --> 00:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
for the town a comprehensive one between
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
the three of us
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
we have two phds a masters and two
 
00:42:15.190 --> 00:42:15.200 align:start position:0%
ivy league degrees
 
00:42:17.990 --> 00:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
when that ethics violation or that
 
00:42:20.390 --> 00:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
ethics policy was tested many years
 
00:42:22.710 --> 00:42:22.720 align:start position:0%
later it hadn't been tested for a while
 
00:42:25.030 --> 00:42:25.040 align:start position:0%
it was proven to be garbage
 
00:42:26.550 --> 00:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
and it was proven to be garbage and
 
00:42:28.630 --> 00:42:28.640 align:start position:0%
here's my question because you have a
 
00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:29.670 align:start position:0%
here's my question because you have a
right

00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:42:31.829 --> 00:42:31.839 align:start position:0%
to your first amendment to speak your
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
mind to say what you will say my
 
00:42:37.190 --> 00:42:37.200 align:start position:0%
question to you is then
 
00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
how do you reconcile your first
 
00:42:41.190 --> 00:42:41.200 align:start position:0%
amendment rights against section 30 in
 
00:42:43.270 --> 00:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
here which is your right you know you
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.910 --> 00:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
that's the conflict i
 
00:42:54.150 --> 00:42:54.160 align:start position:0%
i can't deny it
 
00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:56.710 align:start position:0%
i can't deny it
i

00:42:56.710 --> 00:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:59.270 --> 00:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
my issue was to try to get something
 
00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:00.550 align:start position:0%
my issue was to try to get something
started

00:43:00.550 --> 00:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
started
 
00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:02.230 align:start position:0%
started
that

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:02.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
would take us to some point that people
 
00:43:07.589 --> 00:43:07.599 align:start position:0%
who run for office would understand as
 
00:43:10.950 --> 00:43:10.960 align:start position:0%
we as representatives do
 
00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:13.119 align:start position:0%
that there are certain things you've got
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
to disclose even if you're uh if you're
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
a businessman uh a contractor you got
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
ten implements and three guys working
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
for you
 
00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
and you bid on a job
 
00:43:25.359 --> 00:43:27.109 align:start position:0%
and you bid on a job
well

00:43:27.109 --> 00:43:27.119 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:43:29.829 --> 00:43:29.839 align:start position:0%
if you're sitting on the board yourself
 
00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:32.560 align:start position:0%
at least everybody in town ought to know
 
00:43:34.150 --> 00:43:34.160 align:start position:0%
that you're bidding on something that
 
00:43:36.069 --> 00:43:36.079 align:start position:0%
you're sitting on
 
00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:38.480 align:start position:0%
that is my
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
main focus
 
00:43:43.990 --> 00:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
and like i said i don't have all those
 
00:43:46.710 --> 00:43:46.720 align:start position:0%
phds i'm just a joe blow who was in the
 
00:43:50.470 --> 00:43:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.109 --> 00:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
i have all the best intentions but i
 
00:43:55.910 --> 00:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
don't claim to be legal and know how to
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:06.870 align:start position:0%
taking my question
i

00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:44:11.030 --> 00:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
wonder if you have thought about how
 
00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.790 align:start position:0%
wonder if you have thought about how
this

00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:44:14.790 --> 00:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
proposed bill
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
would affect membership on boards the
 
00:44:20.150 --> 00:44:20.160 align:start position:0%
planning board comes to mind
 
00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.589 align:start position:0%
planning board comes to mind
particularly

00:44:21.589 --> 00:44:21.599 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
where often people serve on the board
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
because they know about something
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
it seems to me as though
 
00:44:32.150 --> 00:44:32.160 align:start position:0%
this is going to create
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
a disincentive
 
00:44:37.589 --> 00:44:37.599 align:start position:0%
for someone to serve on their planning
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
board because oh they developed a house
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
once therefore they have a conflict
 
00:44:44.069 --> 00:44:44.079 align:start position:0%
could you talk about that a little bit
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
please so
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:49.599 align:start position:0%
if it were myself
 
00:44:52.390 --> 00:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
uh and i were going to plan
 
00:44:54.630 --> 00:44:54.640 align:start position:0%
sit on the board and i believe i had a
 
00:44:54.640 --> 00:44:55.910 align:start position:0%
sit on the board and i believe i had a
conflict

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:44:58.069 --> 00:44:58.079 align:start position:0%
and in a couple of cases
 
00:45:01.030 --> 00:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
i have mentioned those conflicts and
 
00:45:03.430 --> 00:45:03.440 align:start position:0%
what i have done is said
 
00:45:05.910 --> 00:45:05.920 align:start position:0%
i have a conflict with this interest
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
or this situation
 
00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:09.990 align:start position:0%
or this situation
and

00:45:09.990 --> 00:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:45:12.309 --> 00:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
so i will be abstaining would you like
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
me to leave the room
 
00:45:17.430 --> 00:45:17.440 align:start position:0%
i don't think that that is anything to
 
00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:21.200 align:start position:0%
expect a person to do the problem is
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
at this point it's really voluntary and
 
00:45:26.710 --> 00:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of people who don't
 
00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.950 align:start position:0%
there's a whole lot of people who don't
necessarily

00:45:28.950 --> 00:45:28.960 align:start position:0%
necessarily
 
00:45:32.950 --> 00:45:32.960 align:start position:0%
step up and volunteer that information
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
yes follow-up go ahead
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
my question was really more of a general
 
00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:37.510 align:start position:0%
my question was really more of a general
one

00:45:37.510 --> 00:45:37.520 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:45:40.390 --> 00:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
um the way i read the bill
 
00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.950 align:start position:0%
um the way i read the bill
uh

00:45:42.950 --> 00:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:46.640 align:start position:0%
it sounds as though
 
00:45:49.030 --> 00:45:49.040 align:start position:0%
uh shall have any interest financial or
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
otherwise direct or incorrect in any
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
business or transaction or incur any
 
00:45:54.790 --> 00:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
obligation of any nature that is in
 
00:45:56.390 --> 00:45:56.400 align:start position:0%
substantial conflict with the proper
 
00:45:58.710 --> 00:45:58.720 align:start position:0%
discharge of his or her duties as
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
prescribed in the loss of the state
 
00:46:05.270 --> 00:46:05.280 align:start position:0%
that seems fairly general such that
 
00:46:08.390 --> 00:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
someone who works in the field might not
 
00:46:10.630 --> 00:46:10.640 align:start position:0%
be able to serve at all i understand
 
00:46:13.510 --> 00:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
your example of oh well i live next door
 
00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:14.470 align:start position:0%
your example of oh well i live next door
therefore

00:46:14.470 --> 00:46:14.480 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
00:46:17.030 --> 00:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
i'm you know i have a conflict or
 
00:46:19.190 --> 00:46:19.200 align:start position:0%
i bid on this job therefore i have a
 
00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:21.760 align:start position:0%
conflict but the first
 
00:46:24.630 --> 00:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
the first uh
 
00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
clause here
 
00:46:28.550 --> 00:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
feels more general is was that your
 
00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:32.150 align:start position:0%
feels more general is was that your
intention

00:46:32.150 --> 00:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:33.829 --> 00:46:33.839 align:start position:0%
and you're saying starting right at
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
leighton five
 
00:46:37.910 --> 00:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh yeah starting at line five
 
00:47:06.069 --> 00:47:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.079 --> 00:47:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:47:09.510 --> 00:47:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's very general
 
00:47:12.240 --> 00:47:14.230 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's very general
um

00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
i think the problem here is
 
00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:19.349 align:start position:0%
i think the problem here is
that

00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:21.190 --> 00:47:21.200 align:start position:0%
i don't think you can possibly write
 
00:47:25.270 --> 00:47:25.280 align:start position:0%
anything that's specific to everything
 
00:47:27.589 --> 00:47:27.599 align:start position:0%
that's why it has to be general
 
00:47:27.599 --> 00:47:30.710 align:start position:0%
that's why it has to be general
it's

00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:30.720 --> 00:47:32.069 align:start position:0%
 
lawyers

00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
lawyers
 
00:47:34.230 --> 00:47:34.240 align:start position:0%
need to work on this and fix it better
 
00:47:36.630 --> 00:47:36.640 align:start position:0%
than i've got it but
 
00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:39.430 align:start position:0%
than i've got it but
it's

00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:47:41.190 --> 00:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know how you would write
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
something that fits every single
 
00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.950 align:start position:0%
something that fits every single
situation

00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.990 align:start position:0%
situation
yes

00:47:49.990 --> 00:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question i
 
00:47:55.589 --> 00:47:55.599 align:start position:0%
have two questions
 
00:47:55.599 --> 00:47:56.470 align:start position:0%
have two questions
um

00:47:56.470 --> 00:47:56.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:57.990 --> 00:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
one is
 
00:48:01.589 --> 00:48:01.599 align:start position:0%
has to do with line uh lines 21 and 22
 
00:48:03.109 --> 00:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
of the bill
 
00:48:06.549 --> 00:48:06.559 align:start position:0%
where it says that
 
00:48:10.309 --> 00:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
anyone who is um
 
00:48:12.549 --> 00:48:12.559 align:start position:0%
found to be in conflict with this ethics
 
00:48:15.829 --> 00:48:15.839 align:start position:0%
policy shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
 
00:48:20.470 --> 00:48:20.480 align:start position:0%
is it a class a or a class b misdemeanor
 
00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
i don't actually know that uh penalties
 
00:48:26.790 --> 00:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
are substantially different for each one
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
right and there is due process that must
 
00:48:31.670 --> 00:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
be followed
 
00:48:34.069 --> 00:48:34.079 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with removal by
 
00:48:34.079 --> 00:48:35.829 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with removal by
voters

00:48:35.829 --> 00:48:35.839 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
so how how would how would this bill
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
move someone
 
00:48:43.750 --> 00:48:43.760 align:start position:0%
from an elected or appointed position
 
00:48:46.069 --> 00:48:46.079 align:start position:0%
that is judged to be in conflict with
 
00:48:48.549 --> 00:48:48.559 align:start position:0%
the guidelines of this bill that
 
00:48:51.109 --> 00:48:51.119 align:start position:0%
outlines ethics
 
00:48:53.349 --> 00:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
through the criminal justice system
 
00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
to be indicted of a class a or a class b
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor how would that how would
 
00:49:00.309 --> 00:49:00.319 align:start position:0%
that actually happen
 
00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.000 align:start position:0%
who would bring the charge who would
 
00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:04.000 align:start position:0%
hear the charge how would it happen
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
that's something i would have to
 
00:49:08.309 --> 00:49:08.319 align:start position:0%
research and get back to you i don't
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
have an answer for that
 
00:49:12.549 --> 00:49:12.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:49:12.559 --> 00:49:14.710 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
00:49:19.270 --> 00:49:19.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
00:49:19.280 --> 00:49:20.470 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

00:49:20.470 --> 00:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
many of the
 
00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:23.430 align:start position:0%
many of the
boards

00:49:23.430 --> 00:49:23.440 align:start position:0%
boards
 
00:49:27.430 --> 00:49:27.440 align:start position:0%
are either voluntary or it
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
pays a small token of
 
00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.589 align:start position:0%
pays a small token of
stipend

00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
stipend
 
00:49:35.589 --> 00:49:35.599 align:start position:0%
and if somebody
 
00:49:35.599 --> 00:49:37.030 align:start position:0%
and if somebody
is

00:49:37.030 --> 00:49:37.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:40.150 --> 00:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
working full time and their expertise is
 
00:49:42.630 --> 00:49:42.640 align:start position:0%
in that field that we want their input
 
00:49:45.030 --> 00:49:45.040 align:start position:0%
on a board for example public health
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
board we want a doctor who is a public
 
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:49.200 align:start position:0%
health official
 
00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:51.760 align:start position:0%
not in that town or you know
 
00:49:54.630 --> 00:49:54.640 align:start position:0%
elsewhere but need to
 
00:49:56.150 --> 00:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
sit on it
 
00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:56.829 align:start position:0%
sit on it
i

00:49:56.829 --> 00:49:56.839 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:00.870 --> 00:50:00.880 align:start position:0%
mean many of the boards in new hampshire
 
00:50:04.230 --> 00:50:04.240 align:start position:0%
is voluntary so would this your bill
 
00:50:07.309 --> 00:50:07.319 align:start position:0%
would it preclude
 
00:50:09.910 --> 00:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
participation because of this high
 
00:50:13.030 --> 00:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
penalty and high stakes
 
00:50:15.910 --> 00:50:15.920 align:start position:0%
which is very vague
 
00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:16.950 align:start position:0%
which is very vague
i

00:50:16.950 --> 00:50:16.960 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
i think in looking at some of this
 
00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:19.990 align:start position:0%
i think in looking at some of this
wording

00:50:19.990 --> 00:50:20.000 align:start position:0%
wording
 
00:50:21.510 --> 00:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
you might
 
00:50:25.670 --> 00:50:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
as i said before my my intention
 
00:50:31.190 --> 00:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
was more to get
 
00:50:33.270 --> 00:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh people to
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
shall we say own up
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
and be clear
 
00:50:41.190 --> 00:50:41.200 align:start position:0%
and recuse themselves
 
00:50:43.030 --> 00:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
not necessarily to stop them from
 
00:50:45.510 --> 00:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
bidding on a job
 
00:50:47.829 --> 00:50:47.839 align:start position:0%
but to have them be clear so everybody
 
00:50:50.230 --> 00:50:50.240 align:start position:0%
else knows
 
00:50:52.710 --> 00:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
what's going on that it
 
00:50:55.030 --> 00:50:55.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't as it might as it sometimes
 
00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't as it might as it sometimes
happens

00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
happens
 
00:50:58.630 --> 00:50:58.640 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
no one in town is clear about who's
 
00:51:01.359 --> 00:51:03.670 align:start position:0%
no one in town is clear about who's
actually

00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
sitting where and doing the job
 
00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:09.430 align:start position:0%
sitting where and doing the job
clay

00:51:09.430 --> 00:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
clay
 
00:51:11.030 --> 00:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:51:13.430 --> 00:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my questions um
 
00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
it does reference in governing bodies
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
and the definition of governing bodies
 
00:51:18.870 --> 00:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
sounds more like it's an elected uh
 
00:51:18.880 --> 00:51:20.150 align:start position:0%
sounds more like it's an elected uh
position

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:51:23.670 --> 00:51:23.680 align:start position:0%
for selectmen so on and so forth but um
 
00:51:23.680 --> 00:51:24.790 align:start position:0%
for selectmen so on and so forth but um
where

00:51:24.790 --> 00:51:24.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:51:27.270 --> 00:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
i do agree that there could be conflict
 
00:51:30.790 --> 00:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
i also sit on a board of aldermen um
 
00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.510 align:start position:0%
i also sit on a board of aldermen um
and

00:51:31.510 --> 00:51:31.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:51:33.430 --> 00:51:33.440 align:start position:0%
anytime someone has a conflict for
 
00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:37.520 align:start position:0%
instance um a spouse is uh
 
00:51:38.710 --> 00:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
in the school
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
works in the schools and there's a
 
00:51:41.750 --> 00:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
contract coming up they they always
 
00:51:44.470 --> 00:51:44.480 align:start position:0%
recuse themselves um
 
00:51:45.910 --> 00:51:45.920 align:start position:0%
if there's a
 
00:51:49.349 --> 00:51:49.359 align:start position:0%
a they work for a non-profit and there's
 
00:51:50.630 --> 00:51:50.640 align:start position:0%
some kind of grants that are going up
 
00:51:52.710 --> 00:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
they'll recuse themselves from doing
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
that and so on so i i see it happening
 
00:51:58.390 --> 00:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
within my within my town i think my
 
00:52:00.950 --> 00:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
concern with this is that
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
um if we start forcing people to
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
disclose any potentials or possibilities
 
00:52:09.030 --> 00:52:09.040 align:start position:0%
and it goes beyond
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
the governing body of the elected
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
officials we as i believe that
 
00:52:15.510 --> 00:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative manju puti brought up so
 
00:52:17.670 --> 00:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
my question to you is
 
00:52:19.910 --> 00:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
do you feel that this could go beyond
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
the governing body the elected officials
 
00:52:25.270 --> 00:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
do you think that just the voluntary i
 
00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.150 align:start position:0%
do you think that just the voluntary i
know

00:52:26.150 --> 00:52:26.160 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
pardon me here so i know that you
 
00:52:29.910 --> 00:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
you put this through because p you felt
 
00:52:31.589 --> 00:52:31.599 align:start position:0%
people aren't stepping up to the the
 
00:52:34.230 --> 00:52:34.240 align:start position:0%
fact but is there a specific case i
 
00:52:36.069 --> 00:52:36.079 align:start position:0%
guess there's a question that i'm asking
 
00:52:38.069 --> 00:52:38.079 align:start position:0%
that that brought this to your attention
 
00:52:40.549 --> 00:52:40.559 align:start position:0%
or any of the other authors
 
00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:48.630 --> 00:52:48.640 align:start position:0%
in the past
 
00:52:50.950 --> 00:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
in the town of unity
 
00:52:52.790 --> 00:52:52.800 align:start position:0%
a selectmen
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
or two
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
a couple of different cases
 
00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:56.870 align:start position:0%
a couple of different cases
in

00:52:56.870 --> 00:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:52:59.109 --> 00:52:59.119 align:start position:0%
in actual different
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
situations not the same
 
00:53:06.870 --> 00:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
one of the individuals is deceased
 
00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.309 align:start position:0%
one of the individuals is deceased
uh

00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:15.990 --> 00:53:16.000 align:start position:0%
was sitting as a border slackman member
 
00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:17.670 align:start position:0%
was sitting as a border slackman member
and

00:53:17.670 --> 00:53:17.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:53:19.430 --> 00:53:19.440 align:start position:0%
did things
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
that should not in my opinion have been
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
loud and there didn't seem to be any
 
00:53:27.190 --> 00:53:27.200 align:start position:0%
teeth anywhere to make sure
 
00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:28.870 align:start position:0%
teeth anywhere to make sure
that

00:53:28.870 --> 00:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:30.790 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:53:30.790 --> 00:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:53:31.990 --> 00:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
the individual owned up
 
00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:37.430 align:start position:0%
the individual owned up
also

00:53:37.430 --> 00:53:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the county
 
00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:42.870 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the county
um

00:53:42.870 --> 00:53:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.549 align:start position:0%
um
recently

00:53:46.549 --> 00:53:46.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.309 --> 00:53:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:50.319 --> 00:53:51.430 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:53:51.430 --> 00:53:51.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
who had influence on a board
 
00:53:56.150 --> 00:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
don't know that he was actually a member
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
at the time
 
00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:02.390 align:start position:0%
at the time
um

00:54:02.390 --> 00:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:09.109 --> 00:54:09.119 align:start position:0%
i think the question was
 
00:54:11.270 --> 00:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
are you aware of
 
00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:12.150 align:start position:0%
are you aware of
other

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:13.510 align:start position:0%
other
situations

00:54:13.510 --> 00:54:13.520 align:start position:0%
situations
 
00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:15.190 align:start position:0%
situations
that

00:54:15.190 --> 00:54:15.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:15.200 --> 00:54:16.069 align:start position:0%
that
this

00:54:16.069 --> 00:54:16.079 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:54:18.069 --> 00:54:18.079 align:start position:0%
policy would be
 
00:54:20.470 --> 00:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
so the answer would be yes sir
 
00:54:22.470 --> 00:54:22.480 align:start position:0%
because i think i think if we bring up
 
00:54:24.230 --> 00:54:24.240 align:start position:0%
individual cases we're going to cross
 
00:54:26.309 --> 00:54:26.319 align:start position:0%
over the line of dupras okay
 
00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.270 --> 00:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
first we have representative gilman
 
00:54:39.270 --> 00:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
00:54:41.750 --> 00:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
representative for uh my testimony my
 
00:54:44.390 --> 00:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
question um my question might go a
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
little along your lines mr chair but
 
00:54:49.109 --> 00:54:49.119 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it falls out
 
00:54:49.119 --> 00:54:50.069 align:start position:0%
we'll see how it falls out
um

00:54:50.069 --> 00:54:50.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
i sit on the executive committee of the
 
00:54:54.630 --> 00:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
00:54:54.640 --> 00:54:55.990 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
delegation

00:54:55.990 --> 00:54:56.000 align:start position:0%
delegation
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
and my mother lives in the nursing home
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
so i have some control over the budget
 
00:55:03.510 --> 00:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
that is spent
 
00:55:06.069 --> 00:55:06.079 align:start position:0%
on her care is would you see that as a
 
00:55:06.079 --> 00:55:09.190 align:start position:0%
on her care is would you see that as a
conflict

00:55:09.190 --> 00:55:09.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:11.829 --> 00:55:11.839 align:start position:0%
i personally would not see that as
 
00:55:14.309 --> 00:55:14.319 align:start position:0%
as a conflict it would
 
00:55:14.319 --> 00:55:15.430 align:start position:0%
as a conflict it would
but

00:55:15.430 --> 00:55:15.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:55:16.950 --> 00:55:16.960 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
00:55:27.990 --> 00:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:33.030 --> 00:55:33.040 align:start position:0%
how come you uh excluded uh appointed
 
00:55:35.829 --> 00:55:35.839 align:start position:0%
people that appointed boards in my town
 
00:55:38.950 --> 00:55:38.960 align:start position:0%
our zba is appointed by the moderator
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
so they would not have to follow this
 
00:55:40.799 --> 00:55:43.510 align:start position:0%
so they would not have to follow this
rule

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.109 --> 00:55:45.119 align:start position:0%
i think that was just something i didn't
 
00:55:46.390 --> 00:55:46.400 align:start position:0%
think of
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
i uh i'm looking at elected officials
 
00:55:54.870 --> 00:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.710 --> 00:55:58.720 align:start position:0%
pot with the rest of us here
 
00:56:01.349 --> 00:56:01.359 align:start position:0%
so if we have if we lost a member of our
 
00:56:03.109 --> 00:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
board of selectmen
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
and the board of selectmen decided not
 
00:56:05.359 --> 00:56:06.390 align:start position:0%
and the board of selectmen decided not
to

00:56:06.390 --> 00:56:06.400 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.190 align:start position:0%
to
uh

00:56:07.190 --> 00:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:56:09.270 --> 00:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
do a special election
 
00:56:12.390 --> 00:56:12.400 align:start position:0%
and appointed an individual with that
 
00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:13.589 align:start position:0%
and appointed an individual with that
individual

00:56:13.589 --> 00:56:13.599 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:56:16.390 --> 00:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
follow under this guideline because they
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
was appointed
 
00:56:20.470 --> 00:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
in my mind they would because it's the
 
00:56:22.069 --> 00:56:22.079 align:start position:0%
job but
 
00:56:25.990 --> 00:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
where i was drawing the line is people
 
00:56:30.789 --> 00:56:30.799 align:start position:0%
who are volunteers let's say historic
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
society or something like that and
 
00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:36.160 align:start position:0%
they take no compensation
 
00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:37.510 align:start position:0%
they take no compensation
purely

00:56:37.510 --> 00:56:37.520 align:start position:0%
purely
 
00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:40.240 align:start position:0%
a voluntary situation
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
i would not see that
 
00:56:46.309 --> 00:56:46.319 align:start position:0%
as a potential conflict anywhere
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm looking at is
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
elected officials or in your case what
 
00:56:53.349 --> 00:56:53.359 align:start position:0%
you're what you're asking is an
 
00:56:53.359 --> 00:56:54.789 align:start position:0%
you're what you're asking is an
appointed

00:56:54.789 --> 00:56:54.799 align:start position:0%
appointed
 
00:56:57.109 --> 00:56:57.119 align:start position:0%
official who takes who assumes
 
00:57:00.630 --> 00:57:00.640 align:start position:0%
to me the point a person assumes a job
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
to fill a seat
 
00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:03.589 align:start position:0%
to fill a seat
for

00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:57:08.069 --> 00:57:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
elected official i think they're subject
 
00:57:12.309 --> 00:57:12.319 align:start position:0%
to the same thing they accept it and
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
they're sworn in you know they're
 
00:57:17.750 --> 00:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
they're taking that job so it's more
 
00:57:26.470 --> 00:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.109 --> 00:57:31.119 align:start position:0%
in my mind there is a big need for
 
00:57:33.190 --> 00:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
this legislation
 
00:57:34.390 --> 00:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure
 
00:57:36.069 --> 00:57:36.079 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
ready for
 
00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:39.030 align:start position:0%
ready for
uh

00:57:39.030 --> 00:57:39.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
to be
 
00:57:43.190 --> 00:57:43.200 align:start position:0%
processed into law
 
00:57:45.910 --> 00:57:45.920 align:start position:0%
we all live in small towns
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
and there's always a need for there's
 
00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:49.750 align:start position:0%
and there's always a need for there's
always

00:57:49.750 --> 00:57:49.760 align:start position:0%
always
 
00:57:51.510 --> 00:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
the possibility
 
00:57:55.349 --> 00:57:55.359 align:start position:0%
of conflict of interest to uh
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
to occur
 
00:57:59.349 --> 00:57:59.359 align:start position:0%
i've experienced this
 
00:58:02.630 --> 00:58:02.640 align:start position:0%
in our own uh small town
 
00:58:05.109 --> 00:58:05.119 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure we all have
 
00:58:08.150 --> 00:58:08.160 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at
 
00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:09.030 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at
where

00:58:09.030 --> 00:58:09.040 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:58:11.990 --> 00:58:12.000 align:start position:0%
it says disclosure required
 
00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
on page one an elected member shall
 
00:58:18.710 --> 00:58:18.720 align:start position:0%
abstain from participating in a vote
 
00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
on any matter if he or she has a known
 
00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.309 align:start position:0%
on any matter if he or she has a known
conflict

00:58:24.309 --> 00:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
00:58:27.270 --> 00:58:27.280 align:start position:0%
it's not just the vote
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
a person can
 
00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.430 align:start position:0%
a person can
can

00:58:31.430 --> 00:58:31.440 align:start position:0%
can
 
00:58:33.510 --> 00:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
exert influence
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
by simply
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
participating in a conversation or the
 
00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.309 align:start position:0%
participating in a conversation or the
discussion

00:58:40.309 --> 00:58:40.319 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
00:58:46.630 --> 00:58:46.640 align:start position:0%
that person who has a conflict
 
00:58:48.710 --> 00:58:48.720 align:start position:0%
should not participate
 
00:58:50.390 --> 00:58:50.400 align:start position:0%
should should
 
00:58:52.230 --> 00:58:52.240 align:start position:0%
abstain from
 
00:58:56.789 --> 00:58:56.799 align:start position:0%
participating in any manner because they
 
00:58:59.670 --> 00:58:59.680 align:start position:0%
they could have a conflict the other
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
thing too
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
is and i'm i think one of my
 
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:06.230 align:start position:0%
is and i'm i think one of my
my

00:59:06.230 --> 00:59:06.240 align:start position:0%
my
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
colleagues had mentioned it
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:59:13.990 --> 00:59:14.000 align:start position:0%
a person could have a personal conflict
 
00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:14.950 align:start position:0%
a person could have a personal conflict
or

00:59:14.950 --> 00:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:59:17.670 --> 00:59:17.680 align:start position:0%
their brother-in-law could be involved
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
or you know you have to you have to take
 
00:59:22.710 --> 00:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
families involved
 
00:59:26.789 --> 00:59:26.799 align:start position:0%
so my my thought was
 
00:59:28.069 --> 00:59:28.079 align:start position:0%
do you
 
00:59:31.030 --> 00:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
for where it says disclosure
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
required would you agree with me
 
00:59:37.750 --> 00:59:37.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:39.109 align:start position:0%
 
expand

00:59:39.109 --> 00:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
expand
 
00:59:42.789 --> 00:59:42.799 align:start position:0%
the scope of that particular paragraph
 
00:59:44.390 --> 00:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
to include
 
00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:47.030 align:start position:0%
to include
discussion

00:59:47.030 --> 00:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:59:55.430 --> 00:59:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.950 --> 00:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:59:59.270 --> 00:59:59.280 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:00:02.309 --> 01:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
i'm curious about the education of this
 
01:00:04.309 --> 01:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
this bill because
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
um for instance in my town of merrimack
 
01:00:07.910 --> 01:00:07.920 align:start position:0%
and i'm sure there's many other towns
 
01:00:09.510 --> 01:00:09.520 align:start position:0%
too we have an ethics committee and
 
01:00:10.870 --> 01:00:10.880 align:start position:0%
they're elected
 
01:00:10.880 --> 01:00:12.069 align:start position:0%
they're elected
and

01:00:12.069 --> 01:00:12.079 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:00:13.910 --> 01:00:13.920 align:start position:0%
anyone can file an ethics complaint
 
01:00:15.910 --> 01:00:15.920 align:start position:0%
about someone and they investigate it
 
01:00:18.309 --> 01:00:18.319 align:start position:0%
and i i don't know what arrays of
 
01:00:20.230 --> 01:00:20.240 align:start position:0%
remedies they have i don't even know if
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
any charges come to them
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
but how would that be reconciled with
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
your bill
 
01:00:29.109 --> 01:00:29.119 align:start position:0%
like if would we have to disband our
 
01:00:31.430 --> 01:00:31.440 align:start position:0%
ethics committee and it goes right
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
to the judicial system as a to be
 
01:00:36.309 --> 01:00:36.319 align:start position:0%
charged as a misdemeanor
 
01:00:38.230 --> 01:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
that would not be the intention i i
 
01:00:39.990 --> 01:00:40.000 align:start position:0%
certainly would hope not
 
01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.190 align:start position:0%
certainly would hope not
um

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:45.589 --> 01:00:45.599 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the paragraphs in here
 
01:00:45.599 --> 01:00:46.870 align:start position:0%
one of the one of the paragraphs in here
um

01:00:46.870 --> 01:00:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:00:51.349 --> 01:00:51.359 align:start position:0%
it's to pro promote
 
01:00:53.670 --> 01:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
uh local
 
01:00:57.430 --> 01:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
and county municipalities to actually
 
01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.390 align:start position:0%
and county municipalities to actually
write

01:00:58.390 --> 01:00:58.400 align:start position:0%
write
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
stuff now
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:05.430 --> 01:01:05.440 align:start position:0%
rules if you will
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
the town of unity doesn't have any
 
01:01:09.589 --> 01:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
ethics rules and i've been sitting on
 
01:01:11.910 --> 01:01:11.920 align:start position:0%
that board for like i said 15 or more
 
01:01:11.920 --> 01:01:14.630 align:start position:0%
that board for like i said 15 or more
years

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:14.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.030 --> 01:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's just not something we've done
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
however my two years in the county
 
01:01:20.470 --> 01:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner's seat
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
tells me the same thing
 
01:01:22.799 --> 01:01:25.430 align:start position:0%
tells me the same thing
so

01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:27.990 --> 01:01:28.000 align:start position:0%
the the the intention would not to be to
 
01:01:30.230 --> 01:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
take away your rights the intention
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
would be to
 
01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:33.270 align:start position:0%
would be to
promote

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:33.280 align:start position:0%
promote
 
01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.549 align:start position:0%
promote
those

01:01:34.549 --> 01:01:34.559 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:01:36.630 --> 01:01:36.640 align:start position:0%
rights and we might even be looking at
 
01:01:38.549 --> 01:01:38.559 align:start position:0%
your town and saying look what they're
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
doing maybe we should do something like
 
01:01:40.319 --> 01:01:42.630 align:start position:0%
doing maybe we should do something like
that

01:01:42.630 --> 01:01:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:44.710 --> 01:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you thank you mr chair yeah
 
01:01:46.789 --> 01:01:46.799 align:start position:0%
that's what i was going to ask is is
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
there anything that prevents a town
 
01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:49.990 align:start position:0%
there anything that prevents a town
from

01:01:49.990 --> 01:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:01:52.069 --> 01:01:52.079 align:start position:0%
implementing an ethics policy and
 
01:01:52.079 --> 01:01:53.750 align:start position:0%
implementing an ethics policy and
procedures

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:53.760 align:start position:0%
procedures
 
01:01:57.430 --> 01:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
if this bill should not enter into law
 
01:01:59.750 --> 01:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so okay thank you
 
01:01:59.760 --> 01:02:02.230 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so okay thank you
representative

01:02:02.230 --> 01:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:02:05.990 --> 01:02:06.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question representative so
 
01:02:07.109 --> 01:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
when i um
 
01:02:09.510 --> 01:02:09.520 align:start position:0%
reviewed the language of this bill
 
01:02:11.190 --> 01:02:11.200 align:start position:0%
in preparation for the hearing i went
 
01:02:14.390 --> 01:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
back to rsa 21 colon 48
 
01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.270 align:start position:0%
back to rsa 21 colon 48
which

01:02:15.270 --> 01:02:15.280 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:02:18.630 --> 01:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
references the definition of a member of
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
a local or county governing body and it
 
01:02:22.870 --> 01:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
specifically cites
 
01:02:25.029 --> 01:02:25.039 align:start position:0%
members of select board members boards
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
of aldermen school boards and village
 
01:02:30.549 --> 01:02:30.559 align:start position:0%
district district boards so my question
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
in your prior response to a question you
 
01:02:35.750 --> 01:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
had cited
 
01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:02:39.589 --> 01:02:39.599 align:start position:0%
the purpose of this bill is um
 
01:02:41.589 --> 01:02:41.599 align:start position:0%
pertain to elected officials so my
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
did was it
 
01:02:46.950 --> 01:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
was it an oversight to have
 
01:02:50.230 --> 01:02:50.240 align:start position:0%
not included elected members to a budget
 
01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:52.549 align:start position:0%
not included elected members to a budget
committee

01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:02:54.630 --> 01:02:54.640 align:start position:0%
that would be an oversight we don't do
 
01:02:56.710 --> 01:02:56.720 align:start position:0%
it i mean unity
 
01:02:58.789 --> 01:02:58.799 align:start position:0%
unity the selectmen
 
01:03:00.630 --> 01:03:00.640 align:start position:0%
do everything right the budget there's
 
01:03:04.150 --> 01:03:04.160 align:start position:0%
nobody else so i was looking at it from
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:10.950 --> 01:03:10.960 align:start position:0%
yes representative clee
 
01:03:15.510 --> 01:03:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:17.349 --> 01:03:17.359 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you for
 
01:03:19.349 --> 01:03:19.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:03:19.359 --> 01:03:21.750 align:start position:0%
taking my question
so

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.549 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:03:22.549 --> 01:03:22.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:25.589 --> 01:03:25.599 align:start position:0%
i'm going back to that whole question of
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
what constitutes a conflict of interest
 
01:03:30.870 --> 01:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking about planning boards
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
both elected and appointed
 
01:03:35.670 --> 01:03:35.680 align:start position:0%
all of those people live in town most of
 
01:03:37.910 --> 01:03:37.920 align:start position:0%
them are probably landowners
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
so when they propose changes to the
 
01:03:42.150 --> 01:03:42.160 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance
 
01:03:44.150 --> 01:03:44.160 align:start position:0%
they are affected by the changes that
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
they propose
 
01:03:52.069 --> 01:03:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.870 --> 01:03:58.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
i would think that if there was
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
any situation like that the individual
 
01:04:05.349 --> 01:04:05.359 align:start position:0%
would say
 
01:04:06.950 --> 01:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
straight out i
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
have a conflict
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
but they all do
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
i mean think about it
 
01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:17.680 align:start position:0%
if you live in town
 
01:04:19.270 --> 01:04:19.280 align:start position:0%
and representative
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
sorry question please
 
01:04:23.349 --> 01:04:23.359 align:start position:0%
if you live in town
 
01:04:26.309 --> 01:04:26.319 align:start position:0%
you are affected are you not by the
 
01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:30.000 align:start position:0%
zoning enacted by the planning board
 
01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.109 align:start position:0%
zoning enacted by the planning board
so

01:04:31.109 --> 01:04:31.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:04:34.549 --> 01:04:34.559 align:start position:0%
in conflict
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
because maybe that's advantageous for
 
01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:41.190 align:start position:0%
because maybe that's advantageous for
you

01:04:41.190 --> 01:04:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:46.390 --> 01:04:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
what i'm looking at is
 
01:04:51.270 --> 01:04:51.280 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:04:52.470 --> 01:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
who may
 
01:04:52.480 --> 01:04:55.910 align:start position:0%
who may
be

01:04:55.910 --> 01:04:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:58.549 --> 01:04:58.559 align:start position:0%
in a major situation of
 
01:05:00.309 --> 01:05:00.319 align:start position:0%
personal gain
 
01:05:00.319 --> 01:05:01.190 align:start position:0%
personal gain
not

01:05:01.190 --> 01:05:01.200 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:05:02.950 --> 01:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
the individual
 
01:05:06.710 --> 01:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
who owns a piece of property and
 
01:05:08.789 --> 01:05:08.799 align:start position:0%
two doors down something's going to
 
01:05:08.799 --> 01:05:09.750 align:start position:0%
two doors down something's going to
happen

01:05:09.750 --> 01:05:09.760 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:05:11.670 --> 01:05:11.680 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have
 
01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
an opportunity for him to make money on
 
01:05:17.510 --> 01:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
it i'm i i can't see how this
 
01:05:20.069 --> 01:05:20.079 align:start position:0%
is intended to hit every single person
 
01:05:20.079 --> 01:05:20.870 align:start position:0%
is intended to hit every single person
it's

01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.390 align:start position:0%
it's
intended

01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
intended
 
01:05:23.589 --> 01:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
to keep
 
01:05:25.109 --> 01:05:25.119 align:start position:0%
those who can
 
01:05:25.119 --> 01:05:26.150 align:start position:0%
those who can
make

01:05:26.150 --> 01:05:26.160 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:05:31.109 --> 01:05:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.119 --> 01:05:32.470 align:start position:0%
 
personal

01:05:32.470 --> 01:05:32.480 align:start position:0%
personal
 
01:05:33.589 --> 01:05:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know and
 
01:05:35.510 --> 01:05:35.520 align:start position:0%
keep them honest and have them step up
 
01:05:38.470 --> 01:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
and say that they're
 
01:05:40.150 --> 01:05:40.160 align:start position:0%
at risk
 
01:05:41.750 --> 01:05:41.760 align:start position:0%
representatives davis
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.549 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:48.950 --> 01:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
my question has to do with your response
 
01:05:50.950 --> 01:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
to the previous question
 
01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:51.910 align:start position:0%
to the previous question
where

01:05:51.910 --> 01:05:51.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:05:56.230 --> 01:05:56.240 align:start position:0%
the bill states financial or otherwise
 
01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
the bill states financial or otherwise
so

01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:59.670 --> 01:05:59.680 align:start position:0%
can you explain to me
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
i suppose that that could be
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
a situation where
 
01:06:14.789 --> 01:06:14.799 align:start position:0%
somebody actually receives
 
01:06:16.470 --> 01:06:16.480 align:start position:0%
i know let's say there's a piece of
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
property and they can receive that piece
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
of property
 
01:06:22.630 --> 01:06:22.640 align:start position:0%
but a
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
value has not stuck on it because
 
01:06:28.870 --> 01:06:28.880 align:start position:0%
money didn't change hands only the
 
01:06:31.990 --> 01:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
property did now we know there's a value
 
01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
to the property
 
01:06:36.630 --> 01:06:36.640 align:start position:0%
but i would think that and is included
 
01:06:38.549 --> 01:06:38.559 align:start position:0%
in other gains
 
01:06:38.559 --> 01:06:39.829 align:start position:0%
in other gains
follow-up

01:06:39.829 --> 01:06:39.839 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:06:42.710 --> 01:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
01:06:45.750 --> 01:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
and so said person
 
01:06:50.789 --> 01:06:50.799 align:start position:0%
who stood to gain in that otherwise way
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty
 
01:06:54.549 --> 01:06:54.559 align:start position:0%
of a class a or b
 
01:06:54.559 --> 01:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
of a class a or b
misdemeanor

01:06:55.990 --> 01:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor
 
01:06:58.230 --> 01:06:58.240 align:start position:0%
but when i read
 
01:07:01.190 --> 01:07:01.200 align:start position:0%
the statute that defines class a or b
 
01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
distance misdemeanor that kind of
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
activity is not punishable under new
 
01:07:08.789 --> 01:07:08.799 align:start position:0%
hampshire law
 
01:07:11.589 --> 01:07:11.599 align:start position:0%
by a class a or b dis mis misdemeanor so
 
01:07:15.349 --> 01:07:15.359 align:start position:0%
i go back to my previous question
 
01:07:16.470 --> 01:07:16.480 align:start position:0%
which is
 
01:07:19.349 --> 01:07:19.359 align:start position:0%
has to do with the mechanics of
 
01:07:21.430 --> 01:07:21.440 align:start position:0%
implementing this
 
01:07:23.829 --> 01:07:23.839 align:start position:0%
bill should it become law
 
01:07:26.309 --> 01:07:26.319 align:start position:0%
where it says this these individuals
 
01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor
 
01:07:29.990 --> 01:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
how does that happen
 
01:07:31.990 --> 01:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
if it's not allowed under new hampshire
 
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.349 align:start position:0%
if it's not allowed under new hampshire
law

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
law
 
01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:34.960 align:start position:0%
i don't have an answer for that i'm
 
01:07:38.870 --> 01:07:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:38.880 --> 01:07:40.829 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:07:40.829 --> 01:07:40.839 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:07:44.309 --> 01:07:44.319 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chair thank you um
 
01:07:44.319 --> 01:07:45.910 align:start position:0%
representative you mr chair thank you um
representative

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:45.920 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
i'm here in this corner um for taking my
 
01:07:49.680 --> 01:07:50.870 align:start position:0%
i'm here in this corner um for taking my
question

01:07:50.870 --> 01:07:50.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:52.950 --> 01:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to wrap my head around
 
01:07:55.349 --> 01:07:55.359 align:start position:0%
the intention would you believe that the
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill
 
01:08:01.670 --> 01:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
is to enhance
 
01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:03.430 align:start position:0%
is to enhance
individual

01:08:03.430 --> 01:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
individual
 
01:08:07.430 --> 01:08:07.440 align:start position:0%
moral and ethical value system
 
01:08:09.510 --> 01:08:09.520 align:start position:0%
by enforcing
 
01:08:11.670 --> 01:08:11.680 align:start position:0%
a collective
 
01:08:15.829 --> 01:08:15.839 align:start position:0%
moral and ethical system
 
01:08:17.990 --> 01:08:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'd say yes
 
01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:18.950 align:start position:0%
i'd say yes
so

01:08:18.950 --> 01:08:18.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:08:21.590 --> 01:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up yes okay
 
01:08:27.430 --> 01:08:27.440 align:start position:0%
so that's a very high stake in terms of
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
to doing it
 
01:08:33.030 --> 01:08:33.040 align:start position:0%
enforcing it as a collective
 
01:08:34.709 --> 01:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
value to
 
01:08:34.719 --> 01:08:36.070 align:start position:0%
value to
implement

01:08:36.070 --> 01:08:36.080 align:start position:0%
implement
 
01:08:39.990 --> 01:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.110 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:08:41.110 --> 01:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:08:43.910 --> 01:08:43.920 align:start position:0%
right yeah thank you
 
01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:45.110 align:start position:0%
right yeah thank you
uh

01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:08:47.669 --> 01:08:47.679 align:start position:0%
let me say that it's it's my sense
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
especially with working with the members
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
of the committee that they're all very
 
01:08:55.189 --> 01:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
careful about
 
01:08:55.199 --> 01:08:56.309 align:start position:0%
careful about
ethics

01:08:56.309 --> 01:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
ethics
 
01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and want to see us behave in the highest
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
manner that we can across not just this
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
committee but across all
 
01:09:07.590 --> 01:09:07.600 align:start position:0%
areas of government
 
01:09:09.189 --> 01:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
so that's why i think you're getting a
 
01:09:11.510 --> 01:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
lot of questions about some of this what
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
i'll call softness in the bill
 
01:09:15.910 --> 01:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
let me ask you this
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
has this
 
01:09:20.630 --> 01:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
narrative been reviewed by attorney
 
01:09:24.550 --> 01:09:24.560 align:start position:0%
other than the ols team downstairs
 
01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:25.749 align:start position:0%
other than the ols team downstairs
oh

01:09:25.749 --> 01:09:25.759 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:09:27.829 --> 01:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
only the new hampshire municipal
 
01:09:29.910 --> 01:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
association that i know of because i did
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
receive a call from them and i believe
 
01:09:35.430 --> 01:09:35.440 align:start position:0%
he's here to witness okay
 
01:09:38.550 --> 01:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.470 --> 01:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
under this provision under this ethics
 
01:09:43.430 --> 01:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
commit provision if if somebody has a
 
01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:44.709 align:start position:0%
commit provision if if somebody has a
conflict

01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
conflict
 
01:09:47.110 --> 01:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
is it your intention that they disclose
 
01:09:49.349 --> 01:09:49.359 align:start position:0%
that conflict when they recuse
 
01:09:49.359 --> 01:09:50.550 align:start position:0%
that conflict when they recuse
themselves

01:09:50.550 --> 01:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:54.070 align:start position:0%
themselves
yes

01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
i mean when i say disclose not just to
 
01:09:58.149 --> 01:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
disclose the head of contract but
 
01:10:03.590 --> 01:10:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.790 --> 01:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:10:12.950 --> 01:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
general term in the general terms one of
 
01:10:14.709 --> 01:10:14.719 align:start position:0%
the reasons i think
 
01:10:16.709 --> 01:10:16.719 align:start position:0%
you're getting so many questions is
 
01:10:19.990 --> 01:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
for example if if
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
some committee members here sit on uh
 
01:10:25.990 --> 01:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
local government municipal uh
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
boards uh
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
town councils or board of and so forth
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
and it comes to them a vote
 
01:10:35.590 --> 01:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
on tax policy
 
01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:36.790 align:start position:0%
on tax policy
where

01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:10:38.870 --> 01:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
as citizens of the community they're
 
01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:40.880 align:start position:0%
certainly going to be impacted by the
 
01:10:43.030 --> 01:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
results of that tax policy
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
would it be your intention that this
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
could be some conflict of interest
 
01:10:46.880 --> 01:10:49.189 align:start position:0%
could be some conflict of interest
between

01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
members serving in the community in a
 
01:10:53.350 --> 01:10:53.360 align:start position:0%
position like that and
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
developing tax policy for the town
 
01:10:59.030 --> 01:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
that's not the intention no
 
01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:03.910 align:start position:0%
that's not the intention no
i

01:11:03.910 --> 01:11:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.110 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:11.360 align:start position:0%
it would not be the intention of trying
 
01:11:13.830 --> 01:11:13.840 align:start position:0%
to hold everybody hostage to that
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
so so if
 
01:11:17.830 --> 01:11:17.840 align:start position:0%
if citizen a
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
feels that that
 
01:11:21.350 --> 01:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
they just went through a revaluation and
 
01:11:23.350 --> 01:11:23.360 align:start position:0%
they think that their taxes are way too
 
01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.189 align:start position:0%
they think that their taxes are way too
high

01:11:25.189 --> 01:11:25.199 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:28.080 align:start position:0%
uh if that motivates them
 
01:11:28.080 --> 01:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
uh if that motivates them
uh

01:11:29.030 --> 01:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:11:31.189 --> 01:11:31.199 align:start position:0%
to vote a certain way or to try to
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
convince other members to vote a certain
 
01:11:36.149 --> 01:11:36.159 align:start position:0%
way would that be a conflict
 
01:11:37.830 --> 01:11:37.840 align:start position:0%
i would think not
 
01:11:39.110 --> 01:11:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you uh
 
01:11:41.990 --> 01:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
and given the uh the the
 
01:11:44.149 --> 01:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
questions you've been receiving do you
 
01:11:46.870 --> 01:11:46.880 align:start position:0%
would you recommend that this this bill
 
01:11:48.709 --> 01:11:48.719 align:start position:0%
be passed before
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps criminal justice
 
01:11:52.950 --> 01:11:52.960 align:start position:0%
committee to see if they have issues
 
01:11:55.830 --> 01:11:55.840 align:start position:0%
with the bill because the fact that this
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
bill does call out
 
01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
bill does call out
for

01:11:58.470 --> 01:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:12:00.550 --> 01:12:00.560 align:start position:0%
criminal uh
 
01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.229 align:start position:0%
criminal uh
repercussions

01:12:02.229 --> 01:12:02.239 align:start position:0%
repercussions
 
01:12:04.390 --> 01:12:04.400 align:start position:0%
yeah i would actually hope that it did
 
01:12:06.390 --> 01:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
go before them
 
01:12:08.950 --> 01:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you i have no more questions
 
01:12:10.790 --> 01:12:10.800 align:start position:0%
does the committee have any
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
01:12:12.719 --> 01:12:13.990 align:start position:0%
further questions
okay

01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:15.510 --> 01:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
thank you representative that was a kind
 
01:12:16.709 --> 01:12:16.719 align:start position:0%
of a grilling
 
01:12:19.590 --> 01:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
appreciate you thank you through it uh
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%

committee my name is kate horgan
 
01:12:45.750 --> 01:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
i serve as the executive director for
 
01:12:47.270 --> 01:12:47.280 align:start position:0%
the new hampshire association of
 
01:12:49.110 --> 01:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
counties which is all of your elected
 
01:12:51.030 --> 01:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
and appointed officials
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
to county government the association is
 
01:12:55.110 --> 01:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
opposed to this bill
 
01:12:56.709 --> 01:12:56.719 align:start position:0%
primarily for many of the reasons that
 
01:12:58.630 --> 01:12:58.640 align:start position:0%
you have already raised particularly
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
around the shall be guilty of a
 
01:13:02.550 --> 01:13:02.560 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor that was very concerning to
 
01:13:05.430 --> 01:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
our membership but also all ten counties
 
01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
already have ethics policies in place
 
01:13:10.310 --> 01:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
that they feel are
 
01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
aligned with best practices i would be
 
01:13:14.950 --> 01:13:14.960 align:start position:0%
happy to provide a copy of those to the
 
01:13:16.229 --> 01:13:16.239 align:start position:0%
committee if that is something the
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
committee would like to see um but you
 
01:13:20.630 --> 01:13:20.640 align:start position:0%
did raise most of our concerns already
 
01:13:22.870 --> 01:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
so i will wrap my testimony and i'm
 
01:13:25.510 --> 01:13:25.520 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions i would uh
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
recommend that you did
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
send those
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
policies that you have copies of
 
01:13:30.880 --> 01:13:32.709 align:start position:0%
policies that you have copies of
to

01:13:32.709 --> 01:13:32.719 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:13:34.149 --> 01:13:34.159 align:start position:0%
i'd be happy to collect those and get
 
01:13:35.350 --> 01:13:35.360 align:start position:0%
those out thank you

municipalities in the state
 
01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:51.440 align:start position:0%
uh would you be able to give us like

natchez graves
 
01:14:34.470 --> 01:14:34.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.229 --> 01:14:36.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair nate grace for the
 
01:14:38.550 --> 01:14:38.560 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
 
01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.430 align:start position:0%
new hampshire municipal association
we

01:14:39.430 --> 01:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:14:43.910 --> 01:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
do not object to the concept of a ethics
 
01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:45.189 align:start position:0%
do not object to the concept of a ethics
bill

01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
part of a large part of what we do
 
01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:48.790 align:start position:0%
part of a large part of what we do
is

01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.830 align:start position:0%
is
provide

01:14:49.830 --> 01:14:49.840 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:14:50.950 --> 01:14:50.960 align:start position:0%
assistance and training to
 
01:14:53.750 --> 01:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities on good governance and
 
01:14:56.149 --> 01:14:56.159 align:start position:0%
we help them work through ethical issues
 
01:14:58.630 --> 01:14:58.640 align:start position:0%
as they as they pop up as part of our
 
01:15:00.390 --> 01:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
legal services
 
01:15:01.750 --> 01:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
side of things
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
so we're well aware that
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
there is quite a lot of
 
01:15:08.870 --> 01:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
contention about this um
 
01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
but i think as as illustrated by the
 
01:15:12.870 --> 01:15:12.880 align:start position:0%
committee today this bill is probably
 
01:15:14.790 --> 01:15:14.800 align:start position:0%
not ready for prime time
 
01:15:16.950 --> 01:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
um there were a couple of things that i
 
01:15:19.030 --> 01:15:19.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to point out that weren't uh
 
01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily mentioned already
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
um lines nine through eleven
 
01:15:26.229 --> 01:15:26.239 align:start position:0%
about the
 
01:15:28.950 --> 01:15:28.960 align:start position:0%
disclosure of confidential information
 
01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
that is probably already captured under
 
01:15:35.430 --> 01:15:35.440 align:start position:0%
rsa 42 colon 1 hyphen a roman 2 which is
 
01:15:38.709 --> 01:15:38.719 align:start position:0%
the oath of office statute that relates
 
01:15:38.719 --> 01:15:39.830 align:start position:0%
the oath of office statute that relates
to

01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:15:42.550 --> 01:15:42.560 align:start position:0%
disclosure of information that a
 
01:15:44.709 --> 01:15:44.719 align:start position:0%
a member might learn in non-public
 
01:15:44.719 --> 01:15:46.550 align:start position:0%
a member might learn in non-public
session

01:15:46.550 --> 01:15:46.560 align:start position:0%
session
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
i would suggest the committee take a
 
01:15:49.189 --> 01:15:49.199 align:start position:0%
look at that
 
01:15:50.709 --> 01:15:50.719 align:start position:0%
if if they're going to consider this
 
01:15:52.070 --> 01:15:52.080 align:start position:0%
bill and see how those two would
 
01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:53.590 align:start position:0%
bill and see how those two would
interact

01:15:53.590 --> 01:15:53.600 align:start position:0%
interact
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
in addition lines 15 through uh 18
 
01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
about the ethics policy um
 
01:16:02.709 --> 01:16:02.719 align:start position:0%
that would be developed at the local
 
01:16:02.719 --> 01:16:03.590 align:start position:0%
that would be developed at the local
level

01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:16:06.070 --> 01:16:06.080 align:start position:0%
um there already is a
 
01:16:09.750 --> 01:16:09.760 align:start position:0%
statute rsa 31 colon 39 hyphen a
 
01:16:12.070 --> 01:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
that allows a local legislative body to
 
01:16:14.550 --> 01:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
adopt an ethics policy for
 
01:16:16.630 --> 01:16:16.640 align:start position:0%
municipal wide and gives them
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
some pretty broad discretion about what
 
01:16:20.950 --> 01:16:20.960 align:start position:0%
to do there that might be captured based
 
01:16:23.110 --> 01:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
on what the sponsor said already under
 
01:16:24.630 --> 01:16:24.640 align:start position:0%
that statute
 
01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:26.950 align:start position:0%
that statute
um

01:16:26.950 --> 01:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:29.830 --> 01:16:29.840 align:start position:0%
as far as section one goes there which
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
are lines five through eight
 
01:16:34.070 --> 01:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
um it appears that the sponsor may have
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
been intending to
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
to capture
 
01:16:39.430 --> 01:16:39.440 align:start position:0%
uh kind of the the essence of a couple
 
01:16:41.990 --> 01:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire supreme court cases
 
01:16:44.470 --> 01:16:44.480 align:start position:0%
um we only have a couple on on ethical
 
01:16:46.390 --> 01:16:46.400 align:start position:0%
issues at the municipal level
 
01:16:49.510 --> 01:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
um and those are quinn versus concord uh
 
01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:52.400 align:start position:0%
that's 108 nh 242
 
01:16:55.270 --> 01:16:55.280 align:start position:0%
from 1967
 
01:16:57.990 --> 01:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
where i guess the relevant line is
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
the court states we think misconduct in
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
office means simply the doing of
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
something which the officer ought not to
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
do or the failure to do something which
 
01:17:06.790 --> 01:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
he ought to do in the conduct of his
 
01:17:06.800 --> 01:17:07.669 align:start position:0%
he ought to do in the conduct of his
office

01:17:07.669 --> 01:17:07.679 align:start position:0%
office
 
01:17:09.830 --> 01:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
each case must rest upon his own facts
 
01:17:11.430 --> 01:17:11.440 align:start position:0%
and i think that illustrates
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
as has the committee's questions how
 
01:17:15.990 --> 01:17:16.000 align:start position:0%
difficult it is to capture that today
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
and really that idea was repeated in the
 
01:17:22.709 --> 01:17:22.719 align:start position:0%
case atherton versus concord 109 nh164
 
01:17:25.990 --> 01:17:26.000 align:start position:0%
in 1968. i'm happy to take questions any
 
01:17:28.149 --> 01:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
questions for nhma yes representative
 
01:17:30.149 --> 01:17:30.159 align:start position:0%
max poody
 
01:17:32.149 --> 01:17:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:17:34.630 --> 01:17:34.640 align:start position:0%
my question my question to you which i
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
posed earlier would it be possible for
 
01:17:40.390 --> 01:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
us to get how many municipalities have
 
01:17:43.189 --> 01:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
their own ethics
 
01:17:43.199 --> 01:17:44.630 align:start position:0%
their own ethics
rules

01:17:44.630 --> 01:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:17:47.030 --> 01:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
uh in new hampshire just
 
01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
you know so that we have an idea i don't
 
01:17:51.750 --> 01:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
have a comprehensive list it's not
 
01:17:53.830 --> 01:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
something we collect data on
 
01:17:56.390 --> 01:17:56.400 align:start position:0%
um i can tell you that it's something
 
01:17:58.470 --> 01:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
that's very popular in our training
 
01:18:00.070 --> 01:18:00.080 align:start position:0%
sessions so for example we do an annual
 
01:18:02.229 --> 01:18:02.239 align:start position:0%
conference in november we have an ethics
 
01:18:04.310 --> 01:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
section that i usually teach or have
 
01:18:06.229 --> 01:18:06.239 align:start position:0%
been teaching for the past several years
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
and we usually get around
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
60 or so local officials who attend that
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
um just because it's so complicated and
 
01:18:16.470 --> 01:18:16.480 align:start position:0%
there it it's really a case-by-case
 
01:18:16.480 --> 01:18:18.709 align:start position:0%
there it it's really a case-by-case
basis

01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
basis
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
by the way those who registered for this
 
01:18:20.640 --> 01:18:21.910 align:start position:0%
by the way those who registered for this
bill

01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
there are six supporters and 29 in
 
01:18:27.030 --> 01:18:27.040 align:start position:0%
opposition any other further questions
 
01:18:30.470 --> 01:18:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.830 --> 01:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
01:18:33.830 --> 01:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:18:33.840 --> 01:18:35.669 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

01:18:35.669 --> 01:18:35.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
some boards uh in exeter almost all of
 
01:18:40.149 --> 01:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
our it's all of our land use boards have
 
01:18:42.070 --> 01:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
rules of procedure
 
01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
which cover how a meeting is run and
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
part of it does
 
01:18:49.270 --> 01:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
do with this fiduciary um
 
01:18:52.630 --> 01:18:52.640 align:start position:0%
responsibility to declare the conflict
 
01:18:56.229 --> 01:18:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh are those adequate uh i know that
 
01:18:58.229 --> 01:18:58.239 align:start position:0%
there's one rsa that covers it for
 
01:19:00.470 --> 01:19:00.480 align:start position:0%
cities and towns the one you cited
 
01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:01.590 align:start position:0%
cities and towns the one you cited
um

01:19:01.590 --> 01:19:01.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:03.430 --> 01:19:03.440 align:start position:0%
part of this bill
 
01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.709 align:start position:0%
part of this bill
covers

01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
covers
 
01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh counties and i haven't found yet a
 
01:19:09.830 --> 01:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
similar thing for counties
 
01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:10.950 align:start position:0%
similar thing for counties
um

01:19:10.950 --> 01:19:10.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:19:13.910 --> 01:19:13.920 align:start position:0%
well it ethics is such a broad area um
 
01:19:15.910 --> 01:19:15.920 align:start position:0%
that it certainly plays into the the
 
01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:18.400 align:start position:0%
rules procedure because those outline
 
01:19:20.790 --> 01:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
the expectations of everyone involved so
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
when they come up they understand you
 
01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
know what the application process is
 
01:19:26.149 --> 01:19:26.159 align:start position:0%
going to be what the appeal process is
 
01:19:27.270 --> 01:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
going to be how the board's going to
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
conduct itself you know there are other
 
01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
parts involved too so
 
01:19:32.550 --> 01:19:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:19:34.310 --> 01:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
one of the good examples that we've seen
 
01:19:37.110 --> 01:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
court cases on is if you're a board
 
01:19:38.950 --> 01:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
member but you're also in a butter to a
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
case in a land use
 
01:19:43.189 --> 01:19:43.199 align:start position:0%
a land use case
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
and you for whatever reason sit as part
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the voting body
 
01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.950 align:start position:0%
of the voting body
that

01:19:48.950 --> 01:19:48.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
is not the right thing to do because the
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
court has an automatic presumption that
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
you have a conflict of interest there um
 
01:19:58.229 --> 01:19:58.239 align:start position:0%
and so if that were appealed to the
 
01:20:01.110 --> 01:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
court you'd see an automatic reversal um
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
based on the fact that's a
 
01:20:04.550 --> 01:20:04.560 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial body
 
01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.750 align:start position:0%
quasi-judicial body
and

01:20:05.750 --> 01:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
and there's somebody on there who
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be on there
 
01:20:11.669 --> 01:20:11.679 align:start position:0%
so that's one area where uh you know we
 
01:20:13.590 --> 01:20:13.600 align:start position:0%
have clear law but
 
01:20:15.590 --> 01:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
it does get complicated you know what if
 
01:20:17.750 --> 01:20:17.760 align:start position:0%
your spouse is involved in something and
 
01:20:19.189 --> 01:20:19.199 align:start position:0%
that's not something that's going to be
 
01:20:20.470 --> 01:20:20.480 align:start position:0%
you know all that's not going to be
 
01:20:25.910 --> 01:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:28.950 --> 01:20:28.960 align:start position:0%
uh i have a question for you um
 
01:20:31.110 --> 01:20:31.120 align:start position:0%
well if you go to a paragraph roman
 
01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.310 align:start position:0%
well if you go to a paragraph roman
numeral

01:20:32.310 --> 01:20:32.320 align:start position:0%
numeral
 
01:20:34.550 --> 01:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
roman numeral number one
 
01:20:36.550 --> 01:20:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh that whole paragraph
 
01:20:39.030 --> 01:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
it seems to get it seems to be very
 
01:20:42.149 --> 01:20:42.159 align:start position:0%
specific and then slides into the very
 
01:20:43.990 --> 01:20:44.000 align:start position:0%
general as you get towards the end of
 
01:20:46.629 --> 01:20:46.639 align:start position:0%
the pagra for example
 
01:20:48.870 --> 01:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
my question is
 
01:20:50.390 --> 01:20:50.400 align:start position:0%
if we're looking
 
01:20:54.070 --> 01:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
to define ethics violations as any
 
01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:55.990 align:start position:0%
to define ethics violations as any
financial

01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
financial
 
01:20:58.629 --> 01:20:58.639 align:start position:0%
in any business
 
01:21:01.590 --> 01:21:01.600 align:start position:0%
including any obligation
 
01:21:04.310 --> 01:21:04.320 align:start position:0%
so that's very inclusive but then the
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph goes on to say that's in
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
substantial conflict
 
01:21:11.910 --> 01:21:11.920 align:start position:0%
with uh official duties so who would
 
01:21:13.510 --> 01:21:13.520 align:start position:0%
adjudicate the difference between
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
substantial and
 
01:21:15.360 --> 01:21:17.270 align:start position:0%
substantial and
non-substantial

01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
non-substantial
 
01:21:19.189 --> 01:21:19.199 align:start position:0%
i i think if this were
 
01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
were to pass as written that that would
 
01:21:22.950 --> 01:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
be something that would be have to be
 
01:21:24.550 --> 01:21:24.560 align:start position:0%
decided at this new hampshire supreme
 
01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:26.229 align:start position:0%
decided at this new hampshire supreme
court

01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
court
 
01:21:27.990 --> 01:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
which is of course not something we
 
01:21:29.669 --> 01:21:29.679 align:start position:0%
generally want in the legislative
 
01:21:31.990 --> 01:21:32.000 align:start position:0%
context um simply because i don't know
 
01:21:34.310 --> 01:21:34.320 align:start position:0%
what substantial conflict means and it
 
01:21:35.430 --> 01:21:35.440 align:start position:0%
may be
 
01:21:36.790 --> 01:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
the case that the supreme court says
 
01:21:38.229 --> 01:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's going to be an individualized
 
01:21:40.229 --> 01:21:40.239 align:start position:0%
basis um which is going to be
 
01:21:43.910 --> 01:21:43.920 align:start position:0%
problematic thank you any last questions
 
01:21:45.750 --> 01:21:45.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:46.390 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
you

01:21:46.390 --> 01:21:46.400 align:start position:0%

01:21:49.590 --> 01:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
our last speaker on this topic
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
uh linda
 
01:21:53.510 --> 01:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
helped me with last
 
01:21:53.520 --> 01:21:56.310 align:start position:0%
helped me with last
weinstein

01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.110 --> 01:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
yes thank you from newport
 
01:22:03.990 --> 01:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chairman
 
01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.189 align:start position:0%
hi thank you chairman
i

01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:22:08.870 --> 01:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
had something prepared
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
and i think i'm going to go a little bit
 
01:22:11.990 --> 01:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
differently based on listening to
 
01:22:14.709 --> 01:22:14.719 align:start position:0%
everybody's questions on this
 
01:22:16.629 --> 01:22:16.639 align:start position:0%
i have been an elected official in my
 
01:22:19.669 --> 01:22:19.679 align:start position:0%
community of newport for over 10 years
 
01:22:21.910 --> 01:22:21.920 align:start position:0%
and i've served on many different boards
 
01:22:23.669 --> 01:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
and i'm a business owner as well for
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
many years
 
01:22:28.229 --> 01:22:28.239 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i just like to
 
01:22:30.709 --> 01:22:30.719 align:start position:0%
point out and i'm on a school board side
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
not a municipal side so you guys been
 
01:22:35.669 --> 01:22:35.679 align:start position:0%
focusing on the municipal side here so
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
i'm going to reel you in and maybe try
 
01:22:39.030 --> 01:22:39.040 align:start position:0%
to get you a little bit differently
 
01:22:41.830 --> 01:22:41.840 align:start position:0%
sorry if i take this off sure
 
01:22:45.750 --> 01:22:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:48.550 --> 01:22:48.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that i'd like to bring
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
to point is
 
01:22:52.870 --> 01:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
when we all go to
 
01:22:55.750 --> 01:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
put our name in for a position
 
01:22:57.590 --> 01:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
whether it be your position school board
 
01:23:00.229 --> 01:23:00.239 align:start position:0%
position municipal position
 
01:23:03.189 --> 01:23:03.199 align:start position:0%
most ethical people look to see what the
 
01:23:04.629 --> 01:23:04.639 align:start position:0%
job entails
 
01:23:07.830 --> 01:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
can i do it what's required what are
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
some of the processes involved
 
01:23:12.790 --> 01:23:12.800 align:start position:0%
and we all have some
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
itching about ourselves why we want to
 
01:23:17.590 --> 01:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
join this committee or board
 
01:23:18.790 --> 01:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here to make a
 
01:23:18.800 --> 01:23:20.390 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here to make a
difference

01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
difference
 
01:23:22.470 --> 01:23:22.480 align:start position:0%
so when we go and we take our oath of
 
01:23:25.110 --> 01:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
office after being elected in
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
we all do the same thing do solemnly
 
01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.629 align:start position:0%
we all do the same thing do solemnly
swear

01:23:28.629 --> 01:23:28.639 align:start position:0%
swear
 
01:23:31.270 --> 01:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
and affirm that i will faithfully
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
impartially discharge and perform all
 
01:23:35.189 --> 01:23:35.199 align:start position:0%
duties incumbent upon me to the best of
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
my abilities
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
to the normal person you would think
 
01:23:41.510 --> 01:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
that makes real sense and implies ethics
 
01:23:44.390 --> 01:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:46.709 --> 01:23:46.719 align:start position:0%
from there you go to an organizational
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
meeting where you select the chair vice
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
chair secretary and typically after an
 
01:23:54.390 --> 01:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
organizational meeting where the
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
officers have been elected
 
01:23:59.110 --> 01:23:59.120 align:start position:0%
you go and you review your code ethics
 
01:24:02.229 --> 01:24:02.239 align:start position:0%
or your code of conduct in some places
 
01:24:05.430 --> 01:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
and you all agree and sign it
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
there's processes involved with
 
01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.110 align:start position:0%
there's processes involved with
policy

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
policy
 
01:24:11.110 --> 01:24:11.120 align:start position:0%
and you have policy committees i would
 
01:24:14.149 --> 01:24:14.159 align:start position:0%
imagine it's similar across the board
 
01:24:15.990 --> 01:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
if there is something that a board
 
01:24:17.910 --> 01:24:17.920 align:start position:0%
member would disagree with in the code
 
01:24:20.149 --> 01:24:20.159 align:start position:0%
of ethics they would bring it to policy
 
01:24:21.830 --> 01:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
committee and bring it back to the board
 
01:24:24.629 --> 01:24:24.639 align:start position:0%
with suggestions
 
01:24:27.669 --> 01:24:27.679 align:start position:0%
my support for this bill comes
 
01:24:29.910 --> 01:24:29.920 align:start position:0%
around the code asks not so much about
 
01:24:32.709 --> 01:24:32.719 align:start position:0%
the conflict which you all have been
 
01:24:34.870 --> 01:24:34.880 align:start position:0%
very focused on here
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
but the fact that the code of ethics is
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
a guide of principles designed to help
 
01:24:41.669 --> 01:24:41.679 align:start position:0%
the board
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
conduct business business honestly and
 
01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:47.040 align:start position:0%
with integrity
 
01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
and some of those outline missions
 
01:24:51.830 --> 01:24:51.840 align:start position:0%
values things like that it's it's common
 
01:24:53.430 --> 01:24:53.440 align:start position:0%
sense things
 
01:24:56.470 --> 01:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
so things like be prepared for all the
 
01:24:58.629 --> 01:24:58.639 align:start position:0%
meetings read the material in advance
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
which you all have done here today
 
01:25:04.390 --> 01:25:04.400 align:start position:0%
be respectful to one another and be able
 
01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:06.800 align:start position:0%
to share opinions
 
01:25:06.800 --> 01:25:07.590 align:start position:0%
to share opinions
be

01:25:07.590 --> 01:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:25:09.669 --> 01:25:09.679 align:start position:0%
informed about
 
01:25:11.830 --> 01:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
the decisions you're making or if it's
 
01:25:13.910 --> 01:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
educational understand what you're
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:21.990 --> 01:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:25.830 --> 01:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
so my reason for supporting this is that
 
01:25:29.430 --> 01:25:29.440 align:start position:0%
there is no teeth in ethics and and the
 
01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
there is no teeth in ethics and and the
simplicity

01:25:30.870 --> 01:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
simplicity
 
01:25:32.629 --> 01:25:32.639 align:start position:0%
of being able to
 
01:25:35.350 --> 01:25:35.360 align:start position:0%
be sworn in under the oath office
 
01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
or abiding by a code of ethics committee
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
or the board itself is run by
 
01:25:44.870 --> 01:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
so for instance
 
01:25:46.790 --> 01:25:46.800 align:start position:0%
an example
 
01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
if you have a board member that has
 
01:25:51.750 --> 01:25:51.760 align:start position:0%
maleficent intentions
 
01:25:53.430 --> 01:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
that comes to a board with the sole
 
01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.390 align:start position:0%
that comes to a board with the sole
purpose

01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
01:25:58.950 --> 01:25:58.960 align:start position:0%
of being individual an i not a team
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
and refuses to sign a code of ethics
 
01:26:02.239 --> 01:26:03.189 align:start position:0%
and refuses to sign a code of ethics
and

01:26:03.189 --> 01:26:03.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:26:05.350 --> 01:26:05.360 align:start position:0%
possibly just shows up
 
01:26:07.830 --> 01:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
and roll call says i'm here and then
 
01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:09.910 align:start position:0%
and roll call says i'm here and then
leaves

01:26:09.910 --> 01:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
leaves
 
01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
also get stipend public funds for that
 
01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
also get stipend public funds for that
position

01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:26:17.030 --> 01:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
they are voted in and
 
01:26:18.950 --> 01:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
i know somebody over here represent over
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
here was talking about recall
 
01:26:23.669 --> 01:26:23.679 align:start position:0%
there is no recall
 
01:26:25.669 --> 01:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
for a board member
 
01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
at school board member at least
 
01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:29.970 align:start position:0%
so now you are stuck with a
 
01:26:29.970 --> 01:26:31.590 align:start position:0%
so now you are stuck with a
[Music]

01:26:31.590 --> 01:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:26:34.709 --> 01:26:34.719 align:start position:0%
representative on a on a board that is
 
01:26:36.709 --> 01:26:36.719 align:start position:0%
not participating
 
01:26:40.070 --> 01:26:40.080 align:start position:0%
is trying to call cause chaos
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:26:45.110 --> 01:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
is making the burden of the work upon
 
01:26:47.270 --> 01:26:47.280 align:start position:0%
the other members not including
 
01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:49.270 align:start position:0%
the other members not including
themselves

01:26:49.270 --> 01:26:49.280 align:start position:0%
themselves
 
01:26:52.149 --> 01:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
so when i think of code ethics it's kind
 
01:26:53.910 --> 01:26:53.920 align:start position:0%
of a no-brainer
 
01:26:55.430 --> 01:26:55.440 align:start position:0%
and i understand
 
01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:57.280 align:start position:0%
all of your
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
concerns about conflict again you almost
 
01:27:02.790 --> 01:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
think that that is
 
01:27:05.990 --> 01:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
something an ethical person would say
 
01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.550 align:start position:0%
something an ethical person would say
especially

01:27:07.550 --> 01:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
especially
 
01:27:11.110 --> 01:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities if they are talking about
 
01:27:13.110 --> 01:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
a home that is
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
next to them i would imagine they would
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
have to disclose that you know i i'm
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.550 --> 01:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
own the home next to me and i don't want
 
01:27:26.870 --> 01:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
this board's decision to be reflective
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
upon my personal opinion
 
01:27:31.189 --> 01:27:31.199 align:start position:0%
but when you have somebody that doesn't
 
01:27:34.470 --> 01:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
want to abide by
 
01:27:37.669 --> 01:27:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:40.629 --> 01:27:40.639 align:start position:0%
an official official position is elected
 
01:27:40.639 --> 01:27:41.430 align:start position:0%
an official official position is elected
to

01:27:41.430 --> 01:27:41.440 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:27:43.990 --> 01:27:44.000 align:start position:0%
that maintains a policy
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
i have a problem with that i would
 
01:27:48.229 --> 01:27:48.239 align:start position:0%
imagine that
 
01:27:50.709 --> 01:27:50.719 align:start position:0%
the teeth of the
 
01:27:50.719 --> 01:27:51.830 align:start position:0%
the teeth of the
fines

01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
fines
 
01:27:53.669 --> 01:27:53.679 align:start position:0%
is questionable
 
01:27:55.669 --> 01:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
how that works and
 
01:27:58.070 --> 01:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
my two cents for that
 
01:28:00.310 --> 01:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
i would am i allowed to give my two
 
01:28:03.350 --> 01:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
cents about how it might be changed
 
01:28:07.110 --> 01:28:07.120 align:start position:0%
um for me it would be as simple as
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
putting it in the oath of office
 
01:28:11.510 --> 01:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
agreeable to rules and regulations of
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
this constitutional law
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and by the
 
01:28:18.950 --> 01:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
board seated upon
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
and if they don't sign it
 
01:28:23.110 --> 01:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
they are not sitting on that board and
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
giving them a time date to sign it
 
01:28:28.470 --> 01:28:28.480 align:start position:0%
they have 30 days to agree
 
01:28:31.110 --> 01:28:31.120 align:start position:0%
to it or not the problem is
 
01:28:32.950 --> 01:28:32.960 align:start position:0%
and we all know this because you're all
 
01:28:34.950 --> 01:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
here and this is why we're here
 
01:28:36.870 --> 01:28:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's kind of the old
 
01:28:38.709 --> 01:28:38.719 align:start position:0%
legal term if it's not in writing it
 
01:28:40.149 --> 01:28:40.159 align:start position:0%
never happened
 
01:28:42.629 --> 01:28:42.639 align:start position:0%
so if it's not part of a statute
 
01:28:42.639 --> 01:28:43.750 align:start position:0%
so if it's not part of a statute
somewhere

01:28:43.750 --> 01:28:43.760 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:28:47.189 --> 01:28:47.199 align:start position:0%
about uh code of ethics
 
01:28:50.149 --> 01:28:50.159 align:start position:0%
people absolutely are going to use their
 
01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
right to speech
 
01:28:54.390 --> 01:28:54.400 align:start position:0%
which i don't think ethics has a
 
01:28:57.030 --> 01:28:57.040 align:start position:0%
conflict to because it encourages people
 
01:28:59.350 --> 01:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
to have the right to speak and listen to
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
people's differences
 
01:29:01.679 --> 01:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
people's differences
however

01:29:03.350 --> 01:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:29:06.390 --> 01:29:06.400 align:start position:0%
if somebody comes on just to create
 
01:29:09.669 --> 01:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
conflict and chaos i have a problem with
 
01:29:12.229 --> 01:29:12.239 align:start position:0%
that and for most people like you said
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
and the gentleman prior to me and
 
01:29:19.030 --> 01:29:19.040 align:start position:0%
the woman i'm sorry forgot your name
 
01:29:22.550 --> 01:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
most schools most municipalities
 
01:29:25.350 --> 01:29:25.360 align:start position:0%
most legislative bodies have code of
 
01:29:27.350 --> 01:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
ethics already
 
01:29:29.590 --> 01:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
but there's nothing in
 
01:29:31.270 --> 01:29:31.280 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
that makes them abide by it and i think
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that i have so i like
 
01:29:38.950 --> 01:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
that there's some teeth in it
 
01:29:41.590 --> 01:29:41.600 align:start position:0%
so i changed my focus a little bit up
 
01:29:42.790 --> 01:29:42.800 align:start position:0%
but hopefully
 
01:29:44.790 --> 01:29:44.800 align:start position:0%
you better understand that
 
01:29:46.310 --> 01:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
thank you are you willing to take some
 
01:29:46.320 --> 01:29:47.270 align:start position:0%
thank you are you willing to take some
questions

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:29:49.910 --> 01:29:49.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely anybody have questions for
 
01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.950 align:start position:0%
absolutely anybody have questions for
miss

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
miss

wadenstein
 
01:29:56.070 --> 01:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative gallagher um yeah
 
01:29:58.149 --> 01:29:58.159 align:start position:0%
could you just spell your last name for
 
01:30:00.229 --> 01:30:00.239 align:start position:0%
me please for my personal note-taking
 
01:30:02.470 --> 01:30:02.480 align:start position:0%
purposes sure thank you representative
 
01:30:04.950 --> 01:30:04.960 align:start position:0%
gallagher it's
 
01:30:10.390 --> 01:30:10.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:15.590 --> 01:30:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:17.270 --> 01:30:17.280 align:start position:0%
what do you how do you decide or what
 
01:30:18.470 --> 01:30:18.480 align:start position:0%
would you
 
01:30:20.950 --> 01:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
decide would be the difference between
 
01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:23.750 align:start position:0%
decide would be the difference between
disclosing

01:30:23.750 --> 01:30:23.760 align:start position:0%
disclosing
 
01:30:24.950 --> 01:30:24.960 align:start position:0%
an issue
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.790 --> 01:30:32.800 align:start position:0%
well i'm no legal
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
aid here so i can only give you my
 
01:30:34.800 --> 01:30:36.550 align:start position:0%
aid here so i can only give you my
opinion

01:30:36.550 --> 01:30:36.560 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
01:30:40.950 --> 01:30:40.960 align:start position:0%
i think that if you disclose or recuse
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
it's kind of almost the same thing
 
01:30:45.750 --> 01:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
because if you're not going to
 
01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:47.350 align:start position:0%
because if you're not going to
vote

01:30:47.350 --> 01:30:47.360 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
it's a mute point but if you want to
 
01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:52.050 align:start position:0%
expound upon it
 
01:30:52.050 --> 01:30:53.510 align:start position:0%

01:30:55.350 --> 01:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:56.629 align:start position:0%
i think that
as

01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
having sat on an elected official
 
01:31:02.709 --> 01:31:02.719 align:start position:0%
position as long as i have in small
 
01:31:05.189 --> 01:31:05.199 align:start position:0%
towns like we have in new hampshire
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
you can bet your bottom dollar that
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
there's somebody that's going to point
 
01:31:10.470 --> 01:31:10.480 align:start position:0%
out why
 
01:31:12.390 --> 01:31:12.400 align:start position:0%
you had to recuse yourself so it's
 
01:31:13.990 --> 01:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
better just to say
 
01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
why you're accusing for let me let me
 
01:31:18.709 --> 01:31:18.719 align:start position:0%
rephrase my question
 
01:31:20.550 --> 01:31:20.560 align:start position:0%
if somebody
 
01:31:23.110 --> 01:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
has a problem with themselves and they
 
01:31:24.950 --> 01:31:24.960 align:start position:0%
decide they're going to fix that problem
 
01:31:27.510 --> 01:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
by disclosing the issue to the audience
 
01:31:29.430 --> 01:31:29.440 align:start position:0%
and the board members that they're with
 
01:31:30.950 --> 01:31:30.960 align:start position:0%
with the intention that they are going
 
01:31:32.950 --> 01:31:32.960 align:start position:0%
to vote on it and
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
discuss the issue
 
01:31:37.669 --> 01:31:37.679 align:start position:0%
as long as they disclose it versus i'm
 
01:31:39.510 --> 01:31:39.520 align:start position:0%
not going to participate in the issue
 
01:31:41.430 --> 01:31:41.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to recuse myself in fact in
 
01:31:43.750 --> 01:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
some cases they leave the
 
01:31:47.110 --> 01:31:47.120 align:start position:0%
the uh deus and sit in the audience
 
01:31:48.870 --> 01:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with either one of
 
01:31:48.880 --> 01:31:50.070 align:start position:0%
do you have a problem with either one of
those

01:31:50.070 --> 01:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:31:50.080 --> 01:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
those
um

01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:53.430 align:start position:0%
um
well

01:31:53.430 --> 01:31:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
i do and i don't if that were in my
 
01:31:58.790 --> 01:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
position on my board
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
and i've been chair for a long time
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
one of the things that
 
01:32:07.669 --> 01:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
i welcome people to come on boards
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
with purpose
 
01:32:12.950 --> 01:32:12.960 align:start position:0%
i would then say to that person
 
01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.149 align:start position:0%
i would then say to that person
let's

01:32:14.149 --> 01:32:14.159 align:start position:0%
let's
 
01:32:16.790 --> 01:32:16.800 align:start position:0%
put it to committee and do research
 
01:32:18.790 --> 01:32:18.800 align:start position:0%
and then the committee can bring back
 
01:32:18.800 --> 01:32:20.470 align:start position:0%
and then the committee can bring back
recommendations

01:32:20.470 --> 01:32:20.480 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
that way it involves the
 
01:32:26.229 --> 01:32:26.239 align:start position:0%
member that has an issue but it also
 
01:32:28.950 --> 01:32:28.960 align:start position:0%
involves other people and it's a we
 
01:32:32.550 --> 01:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
versus an eye coming forward with a
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
suggestion maybe i didn't hear you when
 
01:32:36.629 --> 01:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
you started what board of commissioner
 
01:32:38.070 --> 01:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
you are now
 
01:32:40.470 --> 01:32:40.480 align:start position:0%
i am on the newport school board i've
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
been there a very long time
 
01:32:44.790 --> 01:32:44.800 align:start position:0%
if uh if
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
someone came forth
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
and said to you
 
01:32:51.750 --> 01:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
a fellow member of the board said
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
i have a conflict
 
01:32:55.110 --> 01:32:55.120 align:start position:0%
do you require
 
01:32:56.229 --> 01:32:56.239 align:start position:0%
them to
 
01:32:58.229 --> 01:32:58.239 align:start position:0%
reveal to you what that the nature of
 
01:33:01.189 --> 01:33:01.199 align:start position:0%
that conflict or is it just okay for you
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
to hear that they have a conflict and
 
01:33:04.950 --> 01:33:04.960 align:start position:0%
that they've decided not to speak or
 
01:33:07.350 --> 01:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
decided not to vote
 
01:33:09.189 --> 01:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
well i think it comes down to a
 
01:33:11.110 --> 01:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
personal's true north
 
01:33:13.189 --> 01:33:13.199 align:start position:0%
because i wouldn't know that unless you
 
01:33:15.030 --> 01:33:15.040 align:start position:0%
disclosed it to me
 
01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
if you disclosed a conflict to me
 
01:33:19.430 --> 01:33:19.440 align:start position:0%
i would
 
01:33:22.629 --> 01:33:22.639 align:start position:0%
absolutely encourage you to abstain or
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
recuse for those reasons and ethically
 
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:28.239 align:start position:0%
for my own
 
01:33:30.390 --> 01:33:30.400 align:start position:0%
true personal north i would have to
 
01:33:32.870 --> 01:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
bring that forward and say
 
01:33:35.590 --> 01:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
you know our board member so and so i
 
01:33:37.669 --> 01:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
think needs to recuse themselves because
 
01:33:39.990 --> 01:33:40.000 align:start position:0%
they've already disclosed a conflict to
 
01:33:42.390 --> 01:33:42.400 align:start position:0%
me if you're if you're
 
01:33:44.709 --> 01:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
looking to ask the community to vote on
 
01:33:45.750 --> 01:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
the next
 
01:33:47.510 --> 01:33:47.520 align:start position:0%
teacher contract
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
which i'm sure you've done quite often
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
and there's a member on the board who is
 
01:33:54.870 --> 01:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
a has a relative who was a teacher
 
01:33:56.709 --> 01:33:56.719 align:start position:0%
is is that considered a conflict of
 
01:33:56.719 --> 01:33:57.910 align:start position:0%
is is that considered a conflict of
interest

01:33:57.910 --> 01:33:57.920 align:start position:0%
interest
 
01:34:00.390 --> 01:34:00.400 align:start position:0%
well i believe that there is already
 
01:34:02.790 --> 01:34:02.800 align:start position:0%
some statute somewhere if i'm not
 
01:34:07.270 --> 01:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:10.550 --> 01:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
small boards and small communities where
 
01:34:13.590 --> 01:34:13.600 align:start position:0%
it is often that you will find a husband
 
01:34:15.990 --> 01:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
or a cousin on a board
 
01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:16.830 align:start position:0%
or a cousin on a board
so

01:34:16.830 --> 01:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:18.390 align:start position:0%
so
if

01:34:18.390 --> 01:34:18.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:34:20.790 --> 01:34:20.800 align:start position:0%
in particular this has come up with us
 
01:34:22.950 --> 01:34:22.960 align:start position:0%
so i will give you that particular
 
01:34:25.189 --> 01:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
um example
 
01:34:26.550 --> 01:34:26.560 align:start position:0%
the person
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
if the person is on the board and they
 
01:34:31.270 --> 01:34:31.280 align:start position:0%
are voting on a teacher con contract
 
01:34:33.110 --> 01:34:33.120 align:start position:0%
they would recuse themselves from it
 
01:34:35.510 --> 01:34:35.520 align:start position:0%
because of their marital status with
 
01:34:37.590 --> 01:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
somebody yes are there any other
 
01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:40.870 align:start position:0%

01:37:22.709 --> 01:37:22.719 align:start position:0%
and locally are trying to address the
 
01:37:24.870 --> 01:37:24.880 align:start position:0%
housing shortages
 
01:37:27.669 --> 01:37:27.679 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:37:29.750 --> 01:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
and affordable housing
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
and um just access to housing in general
 
01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.430 align:start position:0%
and um just access to housing in general
and

01:37:35.430 --> 01:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:38.070 --> 01:37:38.080 align:start position:0%
what this this uh
 
01:37:41.189 --> 01:37:41.199 align:start position:0%
this bill would do is if we are trying
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
as a as a town or as a community
 
01:37:45.199 --> 01:37:46.870 align:start position:0%
as a as a town or as a community
to

01:37:46.870 --> 01:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:48.470 --> 01:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
allow for
 
01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:49.270 align:start position:0%
allow for
to

01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:37:51.910 --> 01:37:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know to change our current policies
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
to allow for
 
01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.270 align:start position:0%
to allow for
um

01:37:55.270 --> 01:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:58.470 --> 01:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
more density or more affordable housing
 
01:38:01.990 --> 01:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
or complying with new laws that that
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:07.270 --> 01:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
zones to exist
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
you know when we when we change the law
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes we need to change the the
 
01:38:13.750 --> 01:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
local zoning ordinance to comply with
 
01:38:17.270 --> 01:38:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:21.189 --> 01:38:21.199 align:start position:0%
there is the potential that that um
 
01:38:24.629 --> 01:38:24.639 align:start position:0%
someone might use this protest
 
01:38:27.109 --> 01:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
petition to make it harder for us to
 
01:38:30.470 --> 01:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
comply with the law or comp
 
01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.430 align:start position:0%
comply with the law or comp
make

01:38:31.430 --> 01:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
make
 
01:38:33.590 --> 01:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
our communities more
 
01:38:35.669 --> 01:38:35.679 align:start position:0%
uh affordable
 
01:38:36.709 --> 01:38:36.719 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:38:38.950 --> 01:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
this this uh
 
01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:40.070 align:start position:0%
this this uh
bill

01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:38:42.310 --> 01:38:42.320 align:start position:0%
is just trying to say hey if we're
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
trying to you know address the housing
 
01:38:46.709 --> 01:38:46.719 align:start position:0%
crisis in new hampshire
 
01:38:46.719 --> 01:38:47.669 align:start position:0%
crisis in new hampshire
and

01:38:47.669 --> 01:38:47.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:38:49.830 --> 01:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to comply with a law that
 
01:38:50.950 --> 01:38:50.960 align:start position:0%
is now
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
allowing you know
 
01:38:56.470 --> 01:38:56.480 align:start position:0%
increased density of development or
 
01:38:56.480 --> 01:38:57.510 align:start position:0%
increased density of development or
reduced

01:38:57.510 --> 01:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
reduced
 
01:38:57.520 --> 01:38:58.950 align:start position:0%
reduced
dimensional

01:38:58.950 --> 01:38:58.960 align:start position:0%
dimensional
 
01:39:01.750 --> 01:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
requirements of lots or
 
01:39:03.430 --> 01:39:03.440 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
not be hampered by a super majority vote
 
01:39:09.669 --> 01:39:09.679 align:start position:0%
requirement and that a simple majority
 
01:39:10.629 --> 01:39:10.639 align:start position:0%
should be
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
to pass those changes
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.480 --> 01:39:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:39:23.109 --> 01:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman and thank you
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
representative yokola so i see what
 
01:39:29.510 --> 01:39:29.520 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do here but uh let me
 
01:39:30.950 --> 01:39:30.960 align:start position:0%
ask a question
 
01:39:30.960 --> 01:39:31.910 align:start position:0%
ask a question
about

01:39:31.910 --> 01:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
the opposite side of this
 
01:39:37.350 --> 01:39:37.360 align:start position:0%
suppose your town has adopted an
 
01:39:40.149 --> 01:39:40.159 align:start position:0%
ordinance that allows for smaller lot
 
01:39:40.159 --> 01:39:41.910 align:start position:0%
ordinance that allows for smaller lot
sizes

01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
sizes
 
01:39:44.070 --> 01:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
after it's been in place for five or six
 
01:39:46.149 --> 01:39:46.159 align:start position:0%
years a group of citizens suddenly
 
01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:48.560 align:start position:0%
discovers that it exists
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
files a petition warrant article
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
to eliminate
 
01:39:56.550 --> 01:39:56.560 align:start position:0%
that dimensional standard
 
01:39:56.560 --> 01:39:56.900 align:start position:0%
that dimensional standard
so

01:39:56.900 --> 01:39:56.910 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:56.910 --> 01:39:58.629 align:start position:0%
so
[Music]

01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:40:01.270 --> 01:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
and another group of citizens files a
 
01:40:03.270 --> 01:40:03.280 align:start position:0%
protest petition to say okay if you're
 
01:40:05.109 --> 01:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
going to change this you've got to get
 
01:40:07.030 --> 01:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me that the whole protest
 
01:40:11.910 --> 01:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
petition two-thirds majority simple
 
01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.189 align:start position:0%
petition two-thirds majority simple
majority

01:40:13.189 --> 01:40:13.199 align:start position:0%
majority
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
can work in both directions so what do
 
01:40:19.830 --> 01:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:19.840 --> 01:40:20.709 align:start position:0%
 
uh

01:40:20.709 --> 01:40:20.719 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:22.960 align:start position:0%
and i did not make that up by the way
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question um
 
01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:28.790 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the question um
i'm

01:40:28.790 --> 01:40:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:30.790 --> 01:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
could i ask some for some clarification
 
01:40:33.189 --> 01:40:33.199 align:start position:0%
on the question is
 
01:40:36.149 --> 01:40:36.159 align:start position:0%
when you were describing the situation
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
you suggested that there was a
 
01:40:41.510 --> 01:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
you know increased development allowed
 
01:40:43.430 --> 01:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
in a certain section and someone did a
 
01:40:46.229 --> 01:40:46.239 align:start position:0%
warrant article to remove that
 
01:40:46.239 --> 01:40:47.109 align:start position:0%
warrant article to remove that
um

01:40:47.109 --> 01:40:47.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:49.750 --> 01:40:49.760 align:start position:0%
maybe zoning ordinance or they're trying
 
01:40:52.629 --> 01:40:52.639 align:start position:0%
to remove the um
 
01:40:52.639 --> 01:40:54.790 align:start position:0%
to remove the um
the

01:40:54.790 --> 01:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:40:57.430 --> 01:40:57.440 align:start position:0%
any any uh dimensional requirements at
 
01:41:00.550 --> 01:41:00.560 align:start position:0%
all for that area no they're trying to
 
01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
increase they're trying to remove the
 
01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
already passed zoning ordinance which
 
01:41:08.229 --> 01:41:08.239 align:start position:0%
allows for smaller lot sizes so it's a
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
dimensional change so they're trying to
 
01:41:13.430 --> 01:41:13.440 align:start position:0%
increase the size the requirement of
 
01:41:19.590 --> 01:41:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.709 --> 01:41:22.719 align:start position:0%
and so currently under our statute you
 
01:41:25.830 --> 01:41:25.840 align:start position:0%
would be able to have a protest petition
 
01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:26.550 align:start position:0%
would be able to have a protest petition
and

01:41:26.550 --> 01:41:26.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:41:29.590 --> 01:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:32.709 --> 01:41:32.719 align:start position:0%
that size increase
 
01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
subject to a
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
two-thirds majority requirement and not
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
a simple majority requirement
 
01:41:42.310 --> 01:41:42.320 align:start position:0%
and under this law this would not change
 
01:41:44.709 --> 01:41:44.719 align:start position:0%
that however if they were to do the
 
01:41:47.590 --> 01:41:47.600 align:start position:0%
reverse if the if the planning board or
 
01:41:49.189 --> 01:41:49.199 align:start position:0%
a zoning board
 
01:41:49.199 --> 01:41:49.990 align:start position:0%
a zoning board
or

01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:41:52.709 --> 01:41:52.719 align:start position:0%
if the planning board or a petition
 
01:41:52.719 --> 01:41:55.189 align:start position:0%
if the planning board or a petition
uh

01:41:55.189 --> 01:41:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:55.199 --> 01:41:56.550 align:start position:0%
 
went

01:41:56.550 --> 01:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
went
 
01:41:59.189 --> 01:41:59.199 align:start position:0%
if this bill passed if they tried to put
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
in uh increased events density
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
development they would not be allowed to
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
do a protest petition for that is
 
01:42:09.109 --> 01:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
is that kind of your question
 
01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
follow-up yeah uh well then i think that
 
01:42:13.830 --> 01:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
you need to clarify that this does not
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
apply to citizen petition articles
 
01:42:19.669 --> 01:42:19.679 align:start position:0%
because as i read it now a petition
 
01:42:21.750 --> 01:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
warrant article that changes dimensional
 
01:42:25.830 --> 01:42:25.840 align:start position:0%
standards could not be protested
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
are you saying that currently that that
 
01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.270 align:start position:0%
are you saying that currently that that
um

01:42:41.270 --> 01:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:43.350 --> 01:42:43.360 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
01:42:45.350 --> 01:42:45.360 align:start position:0%
citizen warrant articles are not allowed
 
01:42:47.669 --> 01:42:47.679 align:start position:0%
to be protested
 
01:42:50.149 --> 01:42:50.159 align:start position:0%
no currently citizen warrant articles
 
01:42:53.270 --> 01:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
are allowed to be protested okay under
 
01:42:54.950 --> 01:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
the way i read this
 
01:42:57.910 --> 01:42:57.920 align:start position:0%
if it passed if a citizen petition
 
01:43:00.310 --> 01:43:00.320 align:start position:0%
warrant article changed dimensional
 
01:43:05.189 --> 01:43:05.199 align:start position:0%
standards it could not be protested
 
01:43:07.830 --> 01:43:07.840 align:start position:0%
if it reduced the size
 
01:43:07.840 --> 01:43:08.870 align:start position:0%
if it reduced the size
no

01:43:08.870 --> 01:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:43:08.880 --> 01:43:16.870 align:start position:0%
no
if

01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:16.880 --> 01:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:43:19.030 --> 01:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:21.990 align:start position:0%
yes
okay

01:43:21.990 --> 01:43:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:27.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:28.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:43:28.870 --> 01:43:28.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the question is that
 
01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.830 align:start position:0%
my understanding of the question is that
um

01:43:33.830 --> 01:43:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:36.550 --> 01:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
if i agree that
 
01:43:39.270 --> 01:43:39.280 align:start position:0%
with this proposed change you wouldn't
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
be able to to um
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:47.040 --> 01:43:48.390 align:start position:0%
 
article

01:43:48.390 --> 01:43:48.400 align:start position:0%
article
 
01:43:51.510 --> 01:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:54.229 --> 01:43:54.239 align:start position:0%
citizen petition
 
01:43:54.239 --> 01:43:55.109 align:start position:0%
citizen petition
and

01:43:55.109 --> 01:43:55.119 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:43:57.910 --> 01:43:57.920 align:start position:0%
for for changing dimensions of in any
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
direction and i don't believe that to be
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
the case because the the um the
 
01:44:07.109 --> 01:44:07.119 align:start position:0%
the bill doesn't specify
 
01:44:09.510 --> 01:44:09.520 align:start position:0%
what the amendment to the zoning
 
01:44:12.149 --> 01:44:12.159 align:start position:0%
like the method of getting on to the
 
01:44:12.159 --> 01:44:13.189 align:start position:0%
like the method of getting on to the
ballot

01:44:13.189 --> 01:44:13.199 align:start position:0%
ballot
 
01:44:13.199 --> 01:44:14.149 align:start position:0%
ballot
uh

01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:14.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
is not specified in this this bill and
 
01:44:21.270 --> 01:44:21.280 align:start position:0%
it specifically only addresses
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
uh reductions
 
01:44:27.030 --> 01:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
of dementia requirements
 
01:44:31.830 --> 01:44:31.840 align:start position:0%
or an and increase of density so
 
01:44:33.350 --> 01:44:33.360 align:start position:0%
it would only be
 
01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
ones that were trying to
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
01:44:44.070 --> 01:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
remove the increased density development
 
01:44:45.830 --> 01:44:45.840 align:start position:0%
it would not
 
01:44:47.750 --> 01:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
this would not apply to
 
01:44:50.950 --> 01:44:50.960 align:start position:0%
someone trying to implement uh increased
 
01:44:50.960 --> 01:44:55.030 align:start position:0%
someone trying to implement uh increased
density

01:44:55.030 --> 01:44:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:56.310 --> 01:44:56.320 align:start position:0%
no but i'll take it up with
 
01:44:58.870 --> 01:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
representative yokola later
 
01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.470 align:start position:0%
representative yokola later
sorry

01:45:02.470 --> 01:45:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question so
 
01:45:08.709 --> 01:45:08.719 align:start position:0%
i just want to to to be clear and
 
01:45:11.510 --> 01:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
understand that what this bill is
 
01:45:13.350 --> 01:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
proposing to do
 
01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:14.470 align:start position:0%
proposing to do
so

01:45:14.470 --> 01:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:16.870 --> 01:45:16.880 align:start position:0%
i understand
 
01:45:19.510 --> 01:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
lines three and four as written so just
 
01:45:20.790 --> 01:45:20.800 align:start position:0%
to be clear
 
01:45:22.950 --> 01:45:22.960 align:start position:0%
if there was a petitioned warrant
 
01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:24.709 align:start position:0%
if there was a petitioned warrant
article

01:45:24.709 --> 01:45:24.719 align:start position:0%
article
 
01:45:24.719 --> 01:45:25.430 align:start position:0%
article
that

01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:45:27.990 --> 01:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
sought to the subject matter is to
 
01:45:31.669 --> 01:45:31.679 align:start position:0%
increase dimensional requirements or
 
01:45:31.679 --> 01:45:33.270 align:start position:0%
increase dimensional requirements or
decrease

01:45:33.270 --> 01:45:33.280 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
allowed density of development
 
01:45:37.990 --> 01:45:38.000 align:start position:0%
so it's just the inverse that we're just
 
01:45:40.470 --> 01:45:40.480 align:start position:0%
switching the adjectives here
 
01:45:43.270 --> 01:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
so the subject matter still pertains to
 
01:45:45.270 --> 01:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
dimensional requirements and density of
 
01:45:47.669 --> 01:45:47.679 align:start position:0%
development but it's
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
what direction
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
are we going in so to be clear
 
01:45:56.070 --> 01:45:56.080 align:start position:0%
the vote threshold to reduce dimensional
 
01:45:56.080 --> 01:45:57.430 align:start position:0%
the vote threshold to reduce dimensional
requirements

01:45:57.430 --> 01:45:57.440 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
or decrease density that would still
 
01:46:03.910 --> 01:46:03.920 align:start position:0%
require the two-thirds vote threshold is
 
01:46:05.830 --> 01:46:05.840 align:start position:0%
that correct
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:10.830 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

01:46:10.830 --> 01:46:10.840 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:46:10.840 --> 01:46:12.550 align:start position:0%
sorry
sorry

01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
 
01:46:14.880 --> 01:46:16.629 align:start position:0%
um thank you for the question
um

01:46:16.629 --> 01:46:16.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:17.590 --> 01:46:17.600 align:start position:0%
as i
 
01:46:20.709 --> 01:46:20.719 align:start position:0%
as i stated before um the method of
 
01:46:24.550 --> 01:46:24.560 align:start position:0%
getting the amendment on the ballot is
 
01:46:26.550 --> 01:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
is not really relevant to the
 
01:46:27.830 --> 01:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
01:46:29.109 --> 01:46:29.119 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:46:29.119 --> 01:46:30.629 align:start position:0%
this bill
um

01:46:30.629 --> 01:46:30.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:33.109 --> 01:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
however in in the
 
01:46:34.550 --> 01:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
very last
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
statement that you said um
 
01:46:40.070 --> 01:46:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh i thought that you were trying to
 
01:46:40.080 --> 01:46:41.270 align:start position:0%
uh i thought that you were trying to
reverse

01:46:41.270 --> 01:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
reverse
 
01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
the the language in your question by
 
01:46:46.470 --> 01:46:46.480 align:start position:0%
saying increase dimensional requirements
 
01:46:48.870 --> 01:46:48.880 align:start position:0%
and decrease the allowed density but
 
01:46:50.870 --> 01:46:50.880 align:start position:0%
then in your final
 
01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:52.149 align:start position:0%
then in your final
uh

01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:55.030 --> 01:46:55.040 align:start position:0%
reading of restatement of it you said
 
01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.310 align:start position:0%
reading of restatement of it you said
reduce

01:46:56.310 --> 01:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
reduce
 
01:46:59.189 --> 01:46:59.199 align:start position:0%
dimensional requirements and increase
 
01:47:00.629 --> 01:47:00.639 align:start position:0%
or and
 
01:47:02.310 --> 01:47:02.320 align:start position:0%
decrease the allowed density which
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
didn't make any sense to me so
 
01:47:06.870 --> 01:47:06.880 align:start position:0%
i'm going to answer the question as if
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
it was completely reversed
 
01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
it was completely reversed
and

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:47:16.070 --> 01:47:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think that this bill if if you were to
 
01:47:18.790 --> 01:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
increase dimensional requirements and
 
01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.390 align:start position:0%
increase dimensional requirements and
decrease

01:47:20.390 --> 01:47:20.400 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:47:20.400 --> 01:47:21.430 align:start position:0%
decrease
the

01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:47:22.870 --> 01:47:22.880 align:start position:0%
allowed density
 
01:47:24.470 --> 01:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
that this bill has nothing to say about
 
01:47:27.270 --> 01:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
that because it's only talking about
 
01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:28.629 align:start position:0%
that because it's only talking about
reducing

01:47:28.629 --> 01:47:28.639 align:start position:0%
reducing
 
01:47:30.790 --> 01:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
dimensional requirements and increasing
 
01:47:33.910 --> 01:47:33.920 align:start position:0%
allowed density which
 
01:47:37.109 --> 01:47:37.119 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of this bill and
 
01:47:39.189 --> 01:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
so that we can address the housing
 
01:47:41.990 --> 01:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
crisis if you're trying to increase it
 
01:47:42.000 --> 01:47:42.870 align:start position:0%
crisis if you're trying to increase it
um

01:47:42.870 --> 01:47:42.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
increase the dimensional requirements i
 
01:47:47.109 --> 01:47:47.119 align:start position:0%
think that you sh
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
that the current system is fine
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
would you like a follow-up
 
01:47:51.520 --> 01:47:53.590 align:start position:0%
would you like a follow-up
representative

01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.880 --> 01:47:58.550 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:47:58.550 --> 01:47:58.560 align:start position:0%

taking my question
 
01:48:05.189 --> 01:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
um i'll put it
 
01:48:07.910 --> 01:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
in a very simple term
 
01:48:09.830 --> 01:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
you're trying to address
 
01:48:13.350 --> 01:48:13.360 align:start position:0%
are you trying to address one specific
 
01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:14.390 align:start position:0%
are you trying to address one specific
issue

01:48:14.390 --> 01:48:14.400 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:48:16.229 --> 01:48:16.239 align:start position:0%
with the sledgehammer
 
01:48:18.470 --> 01:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
you're trying to nail one

01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for this
 
01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.669 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions for this
representative

01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:35.430 --> 01:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
i see no thank you very much thank you
 
01:48:35.440 --> 01:48:36.790 align:start position:0%
i see no thank you very much thank you
um

01:48:36.790 --> 01:48:36.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:39.189 --> 01:48:39.199 align:start position:0%
is there anybody in the audience that
 
01:48:41.109 --> 01:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
would like to testify in this
 
01:48:41.119 --> 01:48:42.950 align:start position:0%
would like to testify in this
bill

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:48:44.629 --> 01:48:44.639 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:48:44.639 --> 01:48:51.350 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

01:48:53.189 --> 01:48:53.199 align:start position:0%
on the um
 
01:48:56.550 --> 01:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
house remote testimony we have uh
 
01:48:58.709 --> 01:48:58.719 align:start position:0%
zero support and one opposed
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
and that's house bill 1179
 
01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:05.119 align:start position:0%
and blue sheet yes thank you
 
01:49:05.119 --> 01:49:05.990 align:start position:0%
and blue sheet yes thank you
um

01:49:05.990 --> 01:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:09.189 --> 01:49:09.199 align:start position:0%
no one at all on the blue sheet
 
01:49:11.430 --> 01:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close hearing on
 
01:49:13.430 --> 01:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
hbo 1179
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
and open
 
01:49:20.709 --> 01:49:20.719 align:start position:0%
the hearing on house bill 1183
 
01:49:22.709 --> 01:49:22.719 align:start position:0%
and that is relative to the calculation
 
01:49:25.510 --> 01:49:25.520 align:start position:0%
of property taxes for residents
 
01:49:30.629 --> 01:49:30.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:34.870 --> 01:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.750 --> 01:49:37.760 align:start position:0%
yes um that's a relative to calculation
 
01:49:40.149 --> 01:49:40.159 align:start position:0%
of property taxes for residents 75 years
 
01:49:42.629 --> 01:49:42.639 align:start position:0%
of age and older
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%

for a total of 25 percent reduction
 
01:50:36.629 --> 01:50:36.639 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:51:30.070 --> 01:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
and that also spells out the discount
 
01:51:31.830 --> 01:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
over the years
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
to a total of 25

last change was on the initial bill

it would would have taken effect in 2022
 
01:51:43.599 --> 01:51:44.470 align:start position:0%
it would would have taken effect in 2022
which

which
 
01:51:46.310 --> 01:51:46.320 align:start position:0%
we all know can't happen
 
01:51:50.310 --> 01:51:50.320 align:start position:0%
so we've changed that to 2024 to allow
 
01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.149 align:start position:0%
so we've changed that to 2024 to allow
the

01:51:52.149 --> 01:51:52.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
tax collectors and
 
01:51:57.830 --> 01:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
and the dra time to come up with the
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
forms and to process
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
any claims in the first year

if you have any other questions i would
 
01:52:09.270 --> 01:52:09.280 align:start position:0%
be happy to answer them if i can
 
01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay representative majori
 
01:52:13.350 --> 01:52:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:52:15.109 --> 01:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
representative taking my question i'm
 
01:52:18.550 --> 01:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
curious why there is no means testing
 
01:52:20.149 --> 01:52:20.159 align:start position:0%
for income
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
in this bill
 
01:52:22.790 --> 01:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
well because
 
01:52:25.750 --> 01:52:25.760 align:start position:0%
i thought about that a lot and uh and
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
i've seen some in the past that had and
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
there there are some other bills that
 
01:52:35.669 --> 01:52:35.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:37.750 --> 01:52:37.760 align:start position:0%
for elderly exemptions
 
01:52:40.390 --> 01:52:40.400 align:start position:0%
um i think uh
 
01:52:41.910 --> 01:52:41.920 align:start position:0%
one of them is a
 
01:52:45.189 --> 01:52:45.199 align:start position:0%
veterans exemption
 
01:52:48.709 --> 01:52:48.719 align:start position:0%
the reason i did that is my feeling is
 
01:52:51.030 --> 01:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
that these people in particularly in my
 
01:52:51.040 --> 01:52:51.990 align:start position:0%
that these people in particularly in my
district

01:52:51.990 --> 01:52:52.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:52:54.070 --> 01:52:54.080 align:start position:0%
we have a much older
 
01:52:56.149 --> 01:52:56.159 align:start position:0%
group of folks
 
01:52:58.629 --> 01:52:58.639 align:start position:0%
who have supported the public school
 
01:52:58.639 --> 01:52:59.669 align:start position:0%
who have supported the public school
systems

01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
systems
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
their entire lives
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
and it seems like it's time to give them
 
01:53:04.870 --> 01:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
a break
 
01:53:07.270 --> 01:53:07.280 align:start position:0%
um we have many people up there that are
 
01:53:09.270 --> 01:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
on the verge of losing their homes that
 
01:53:10.950 --> 01:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
have they've lived in for
 
01:53:12.870 --> 01:53:12.880 align:start position:0%
their entire lives
 
01:53:14.709 --> 01:53:14.719 align:start position:0%
we have other people that live on a
 
01:53:17.589 --> 01:53:17.599 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a month social security
 
01:53:20.390 --> 01:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
and the taxes continue to go up and
 
01:53:22.709 --> 01:53:22.719 align:start position:0%
generally they go up
 
01:53:24.950 --> 01:53:24.960 align:start position:0%
particularly in our area they go up
 
01:53:27.589 --> 01:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
because of the schools
 
01:53:30.070 --> 01:53:30.080 align:start position:0%
i know in my particular town we've not
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
had a tax increase
 
01:53:33.990 --> 01:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the school
 
01:53:34.000 --> 01:53:35.350 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the school
district

01:53:35.350 --> 01:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
request in quite a number of years the
 
01:53:40.870 --> 01:53:40.880 align:start position:0%
town has kept their budget flat
 
01:53:43.189 --> 01:53:43.199 align:start position:0%
in order to try and assist the taxpayers
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
so my feeling is
 
01:53:48.390 --> 01:53:48.400 align:start position:0%
if someone
 
01:53:50.950 --> 01:53:50.960 align:start position:0%
has more money they probably also have a
 
01:53:53.589 --> 01:53:53.599 align:start position:0%
larger property in a larger house
 
01:53:53.599 --> 01:53:54.950 align:start position:0%
larger property in a larger house
and

01:53:54.950 --> 01:53:54.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
this is restricted to two acres
 
01:53:59.830 --> 01:53:59.840 align:start position:0%
the house and a garage
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
any additional land they own would not
 
01:54:03.270 --> 01:54:03.280 align:start position:0%
be exempt
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
it needs to be their primary residence
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
they need to meet a occupancy
 
01:54:09.990 --> 01:54:10.000 align:start position:0%
requirement for how long they've lived
 
01:54:11.189 --> 01:54:11.199 align:start position:0%
in the town
 
01:54:11.199 --> 01:54:12.629 align:start position:0%
in the town
and

01:54:12.629 --> 01:54:12.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:12.639 --> 01:54:13.350 align:start position:0%
and
and

01:54:13.350 --> 01:54:13.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:54:16.070 --> 01:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
with respect to a spouse
 
01:54:17.589 --> 01:54:17.599 align:start position:0%
they'd have to be married for a minimum
 
01:54:19.150 --> 01:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
of 10 years
 
01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:20.709 align:start position:0%
of 10 years
[Music]

01:54:20.709 --> 01:54:20.719 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:20.719 --> 01:54:21.589 align:start position:0%
[Music]
so

01:54:21.589 --> 01:54:21.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
i didn't write that into the law for
 
01:54:25.589 --> 01:54:25.599 align:start position:0%
that specific reason that we do have
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:30.550 --> 01:54:30.560 align:start position:0%
you know i mean it's
 
01:54:32.870 --> 01:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
if they've had a uh half a million
 
01:54:34.950 --> 01:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
dollar home all these years
 
01:54:37.669 --> 01:54:37.679 align:start position:0%
they've paid substantially more taxes
 
01:54:39.270 --> 01:54:39.280 align:start position:0%
than someone who has a hundred thousand
 
01:54:42.310 --> 01:54:42.320 align:start position:0%
dollar home so i think they deserve
 
01:54:45.510 --> 01:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
the same percentage of decrease
 
01:54:48.629 --> 01:54:48.639 align:start position:0%
and it appears that the people eligible
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
for this
 
01:54:52.229 --> 01:54:52.239 align:start position:0%
statewide would be just over nine
 
01:54:52.239 --> 01:54:53.910 align:start position:0%
statewide would be just over nine
percent

01:54:53.910 --> 01:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:54:56.229 --> 01:54:56.239 align:start position:0%
so the impact um
 
01:54:58.149 --> 01:54:58.159 align:start position:0%
the impact obviously
 
01:54:59.109 --> 01:54:59.119 align:start position:0%
this was
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
i hadn't thought of it but it was
 
01:55:02.550 --> 01:55:02.560 align:start position:0%
pointed out to me by
 
01:55:05.910 --> 01:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
ms heck from the municipal association
 
01:55:07.430 --> 01:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:55:10.149 --> 01:55:10.159 align:start position:0%
the impact of this is going to not be on
 
01:55:11.750 --> 01:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
the schools it's not going to hurt the
 
01:55:13.109 --> 01:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
schools at all
 
01:55:14.790 --> 01:55:14.800 align:start position:0%
their budgets will
 
01:55:17.750 --> 01:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
remain the same as they need
 
01:55:18.870 --> 01:55:18.880 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
following years but it will raise the
 
01:55:24.229 --> 01:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
taxes on the taxpayer the the overall
 
01:55:26.629 --> 01:55:26.639 align:start position:0%
taxpayer a little bit
 
01:55:26.639 --> 01:55:27.510 align:start position:0%
taxpayer a little bit
and

01:55:27.510 --> 01:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:55:29.350 --> 01:55:29.360 align:start position:0%
represent representatives expanded
 
01:55:33.669 --> 01:55:33.679 align:start position:0%
somebody got a phone or something on

thank you mr chair i have uh two things
 
01:55:53.270 --> 01:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
one is a request to the chair
 
01:55:56.070 --> 01:55:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we ask for a fiscal note
 
01:55:58.310 --> 01:55:58.320 align:start position:0%
on this bill we have several
 
01:56:01.350 --> 01:56:01.360 align:start position:0%
tax credit tax exemption bills that have
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
no fiscal notes
 
01:56:05.270 --> 01:56:05.280 align:start position:0%
okay after um
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
after before we get when we get to
 
01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:10.080 align:start position:0%
executive center section
 
01:56:12.310 --> 01:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
we can take a vote and decide to send
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
that to
 
01:56:14.790 --> 01:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
the finance
 
01:56:16.390 --> 01:56:16.400 align:start position:0%
if you would like to do that thank you
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
mr chair thank you mr chair and and my
 
01:56:20.709 --> 01:56:20.719 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative for
 
01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:56:25.270 --> 01:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
as sometimes happens in life
 
01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:26.870 align:start position:0%
as sometimes happens in life
um

01:56:26.870 --> 01:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:28.870 --> 01:56:28.880 align:start position:0%
older people marry
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
very much younger people
 
01:56:32.870 --> 01:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
and they may stay married for a very
 
01:56:34.149 --> 01:56:34.159 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
and the younger person may have children
 
01:56:37.910 --> 01:56:37.920 align:start position:0%
in school
 
01:56:39.350 --> 01:56:39.360 align:start position:0%
so if i'm
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
75 years old
 
01:56:44.790 --> 01:56:44.800 align:start position:0%
and i marry someone who is 50
 
01:56:47.350 --> 01:56:47.360 align:start position:0%
and has children in school
 
01:56:50.229 --> 01:56:50.239 align:start position:0%
and i pass away but i have
 
01:56:52.310 --> 01:56:52.320 align:start position:0%
qualified for this credit
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
and my spouse qualifies
 
01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
i'm not yet 75
 
01:56:58.149 --> 01:56:58.159 align:start position:0%
i still have children in the school yet
 
01:57:00.070 --> 01:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
i am still getting the credit
 
01:57:02.550 --> 01:57:02.560 align:start position:0%
is that the way this would work
 
01:57:04.950 --> 01:57:04.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
 
01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.109 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question um
my

01:57:07.109 --> 01:57:07.119 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
my uh
 
01:57:10.709 --> 01:57:10.719 align:start position:0%
reaction to that i guess is that if the
 
01:57:13.669 --> 01:57:13.679 align:start position:0%
spouse is not 75
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
um they would they'd be eligible for
 
01:57:18.070 --> 01:57:18.080 align:start position:0%
that tax credit while they're married to
 
01:57:21.030 --> 01:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
the person that is 75 or older if that
 
01:57:23.510 --> 01:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
person should pass away then i would
 
01:57:26.470 --> 01:57:26.480 align:start position:0%
think the spouse would have to reapply
 
01:57:29.910 --> 01:57:29.920 align:start position:0%
for a tax credit if they're not 75 they
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
would not be eligible for it follow-up
 
01:57:33.990 --> 01:57:34.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
go ahead with follow-up
 
01:57:38.790 --> 01:57:38.800 align:start position:0%
would you be amenable to
 
01:57:40.950 --> 01:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
amending your bill so that it is
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
specified in the bill because i'm for
 
01:57:44.629 --> 01:57:44.639 align:start position:0%
the current
 
01:57:44.639 --> 01:57:45.830 align:start position:0%
the current
yes

01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:57:48.470 --> 01:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
i would be ambiguous i would be amenable
 
01:57:49.830 --> 01:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:57:52.950 --> 01:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
our representative wrong
 
01:57:54.229 --> 01:57:54.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
01:57:56.550 --> 01:57:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious on line
 
01:57:59.119 --> 01:58:00.070 align:start position:0%
um i'm curious on line
six

01:58:00.070 --> 01:58:00.080 align:start position:0%
six
 
01:58:01.990 --> 01:58:02.000 align:start position:0%
it says a town or city may adopt or
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
rescind the property tax credit
 
01:58:05.350 --> 01:58:05.360 align:start position:0%
established under this section by the
 
01:58:09.109 --> 01:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
procedure of rsa 782 colon 27a
 
01:58:09.119 --> 01:58:10.709 align:start position:0%
procedure of rsa 782 colon 27a
um

01:58:10.709 --> 01:58:10.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:10.719 --> 01:58:11.910 align:start position:0%
um
so

01:58:11.910 --> 01:58:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:58:15.589 --> 01:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
it would either be by a vote of the i
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
haven't looked up that rsa but would it
 
01:58:19.750 --> 01:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
be by a vote of the people or a vote by
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
the selectmen or the town council it
 
01:58:24.229 --> 01:58:24.239 align:start position:0%
would be the taxing agency so the
 
01:58:26.470 --> 01:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
selectmen of the city
 
01:58:28.530 --> 01:58:28.540 align:start position:0%
um depending on where it is
 
01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:29.830 align:start position:0%
um depending on where it is
[Music]

01:58:29.830 --> 01:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:58:33.270 --> 01:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
there is also a an appeal process
 
01:58:35.350 --> 01:58:35.360 align:start position:0%
that's stated in statute that they can
 
01:58:36.709 --> 01:58:36.719 align:start position:0%
appeal the
 
01:58:38.950 --> 01:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
decision if they'd like to okay follow
 
01:58:41.189 --> 01:58:41.199 align:start position:0%
up mr chair uh go with the follow-up
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and um
 
01:58:46.709 --> 01:58:46.719 align:start position:0%
if this bill wasn't enacted so the the
 
01:58:50.550 --> 01:58:50.560 align:start position:0%
tax savings that the the person 75 or
 
01:58:53.350 --> 01:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
older would would um enjoy
 
01:58:55.830 --> 01:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
that would be made up by other taxpayers
 
01:58:57.750 --> 01:58:57.760 align:start position:0%
correct that is correct and would that
 
01:58:59.589 --> 01:58:59.599 align:start position:0%
be a burden for them
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
i don't believe it would i mean it's
 
01:59:02.870 --> 01:59:02.880 align:start position:0%
going to depend on the value of your
 
01:59:02.880 --> 01:59:03.990 align:start position:0%
going to depend on the value of your
property

01:59:03.990 --> 01:59:04.000 align:start position:0%
property
 
01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:05.189 align:start position:0%
property
and

01:59:05.189 --> 01:59:05.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
and the quantity of people that apply
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
for this credit and they do have to
 
01:59:12.629 --> 01:59:12.639 align:start position:0%
apply for it it's not automatic
 
01:59:15.430 --> 01:59:15.440 align:start position:0%
there will be a dra form that will be
 
01:59:15.440 --> 01:59:16.629 align:start position:0%
there will be a dra form that will be
generated

01:59:16.629 --> 01:59:16.639 align:start position:0%
generated
 
01:59:18.709 --> 01:59:18.719 align:start position:0%
for them to apply for it and it'll be up
 
01:59:20.790 --> 01:59:20.800 align:start position:0%
to the town
 
01:59:22.950 --> 01:59:22.960 align:start position:0%
um either the tax collector or the
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
selectmen to decide whether it's
 
01:59:27.669 --> 01:59:27.679 align:start position:0%
a legitimate request or not but
 
01:59:30.229 --> 01:59:30.239 align:start position:0%
if you're 75 and you own the property
 
01:59:33.109 --> 01:59:33.119 align:start position:0%
and meet the other criteria i
 
01:59:34.470 --> 01:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
can't see how it wouldn't be a
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
legitimate request but they do have an
 
01:59:38.149 --> 01:59:38.159 align:start position:0%
appeal process
 
01:59:41.830 --> 01:59:41.840 align:start position:0%
as well if if they don't want to if the
 
01:59:43.430 --> 01:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
select board or the tax collector
 
01:59:45.109 --> 01:59:45.119 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to grant it for one reason
 
01:59:47.430 --> 01:59:47.440 align:start position:0%
or another all right thank you
 
01:59:49.510 --> 01:59:49.520 align:start position:0%
representative klee
 
01:59:51.510 --> 01:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr uh
 
01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:52.310 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr uh
chair

01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:59:56.070 --> 01:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
01:59:58.229 --> 01:59:58.239 align:start position:0%
i get this question all the time so i i
 
02:00:01.350 --> 02:00:01.360 align:start position:0%
understand you know um the
 
02:00:02.950 --> 02:00:02.960 align:start position:0%
i have nobody in the school i've been
 
02:00:04.790 --> 02:00:04.800 align:start position:0%
living in the city for this many years
 
02:00:07.669 --> 02:00:07.679 align:start position:0%
why can't i get a break
 
02:00:10.070 --> 02:00:10.080 align:start position:0%
i will i will admit that the the lack of
 
02:00:10.080 --> 02:00:11.109 align:start position:0%
i will i will admit that the the lack of
um

02:00:11.109 --> 02:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:12.870 --> 02:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
means test does
 
02:00:15.189 --> 02:00:15.199 align:start position:0%
um just kind of stick with me but
 
02:00:17.669 --> 02:00:17.679 align:start position:0%
putting that aside what about someone
 
02:00:20.229 --> 02:00:20.239 align:start position:0%
who's been living in the um
 
02:00:23.430 --> 02:00:23.440 align:start position:0%
their municipality for 40 years namely
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
me not quite uh um
 
02:00:29.910 --> 02:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
75 yet and um but
 
02:00:32.149 --> 02:00:32.159 align:start position:0%
low income how do you how do you explain
 
02:00:33.669 --> 02:00:33.679 align:start position:0%
that to them saying
 
02:00:35.270 --> 02:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
versus someone who may have only lived
 
02:00:36.470 --> 02:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
in the city
 
02:00:38.149 --> 02:00:38.159 align:start position:0%
10 years but meets the 75 age
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:44.790 --> 02:00:44.800 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna have to think about it for a
 
02:00:45.910 --> 02:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
second but
 
02:00:48.149 --> 02:00:48.159 align:start position:0%
my initial reaction is
 
02:00:48.159 --> 02:00:49.750 align:start position:0%
my initial reaction is
that

02:00:49.750 --> 02:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:51.669 --> 02:00:51.679 align:start position:0%
we can't
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
draft bills for every eventuality
 
02:00:57.750 --> 02:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
it's just not
 
02:01:01.270 --> 02:01:01.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:03.270 --> 02:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
i just think that if
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
there's a standard set down that you
 
02:01:07.109 --> 02:01:07.119 align:start position:0%
need to live in the town for five years
 
02:01:10.709 --> 02:01:10.719 align:start position:0%
minimum and you need to be over 75 years
 
02:01:10.719 --> 02:01:12.149 align:start position:0%
minimum and you need to be over 75 years
old

02:01:12.149 --> 02:01:12.159 align:start position:0%
old
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
i think there are going to be some
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
chances where low-income people
 
02:01:21.030 --> 02:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
i don't know that they'll be hurt by it
 
02:01:23.350 --> 02:01:23.360 align:start position:0%
but until they're 75 they're just not
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:33.109 --> 02:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:01:36.229 --> 02:01:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:01:40.870 --> 02:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:42.709 --> 02:01:42.719 align:start position:0%
you know taxes
 
02:01:45.270 --> 02:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
that help with the schools
 
02:01:46.950 --> 02:01:46.960 align:start position:0%
it's a collective effort
 
02:01:50.470 --> 02:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
if you want a good community to have
 
02:01:50.480 --> 02:01:52.310 align:start position:0%
if you want a good community to have
contributing

02:01:52.310 --> 02:01:52.320 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
members in the community we have to
 
02:01:55.199 --> 02:01:56.629 align:start position:0%
members in the community we have to
provide

02:01:56.629 --> 02:01:56.639 align:start position:0%
provide
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
educational system
 
02:02:01.189 --> 02:02:01.199 align:start position:0%
so if you're making exception because we
 
02:02:04.950 --> 02:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
are 75 i don't have kids in school
 
02:02:07.350 --> 02:02:07.360 align:start position:0%
are we going to next make an exception
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
for families who are moving in
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
but don't have children why should i pay
 
02:02:12.709 --> 02:02:12.719 align:start position:0%
for this
 
02:02:15.589 --> 02:02:15.599 align:start position:0%
and i'm you know i don't have uh
 
02:02:18.870 --> 02:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
you know i live by myself in a corner
 
02:02:21.589 --> 02:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
and i don't need i don't use the roads
 
02:02:23.750 --> 02:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
so i'm not going to pay for the roads so
 
02:02:26.709 --> 02:02:26.719 align:start position:0%
are we going to make exceptions how are
 
02:02:27.820 --> 02:02:27.830 align:start position:0%
we going to
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:29.589 align:start position:0%
we going to
[Music]

02:02:29.589 --> 02:02:29.599 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:02:31.589 --> 02:02:31.599 align:start position:0%
understand that under this statute
 
02:02:33.669 --> 02:02:33.679 align:start position:0%
there'd be no
 
02:02:35.350 --> 02:02:35.360 align:start position:0%
exceptions for
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
people under 75 years of age and
 
02:02:42.790 --> 02:02:42.800 align:start position:0%
frankly my my reason for doing this is
 
02:02:44.550 --> 02:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
many of these people if they've grown up
 
02:02:46.390 --> 02:02:46.400 align:start position:0%
in the public school system and most of
 
02:02:48.870 --> 02:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
them have
 
02:02:51.109 --> 02:02:51.119 align:start position:0%
and have had children and probably
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
grandchildren at age 75 that have been
 
02:02:56.629 --> 02:02:56.639 align:start position:0%
in the public school system
 
02:02:58.709 --> 02:02:58.719 align:start position:0%
they want to support the schools but in
 
02:03:00.470 --> 02:03:00.480 align:start position:0%
many cases they're just not able to do
 
02:03:00.480 --> 02:03:01.350 align:start position:0%
many cases they're just not able to do
it

02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:03:04.070 --> 02:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and make ends meet um
 
02:03:06.550 --> 02:03:06.560 align:start position:0%
living on social security depending on
 
02:03:10.709 --> 02:03:10.719 align:start position:0%
what your uh particular circumstance is
 
02:03:12.470 --> 02:03:12.480 align:start position:0%
with social security you're not going to
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
get a lot of money to pay your taxes to
 
02:03:17.750 --> 02:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
begin with and this seemed like a
 
02:03:19.350 --> 02:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
reasonable way
 
02:03:21.910 --> 02:03:21.920 align:start position:0%
that after people had paid all these
 
02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:22.950 align:start position:0%
that after people had paid all these
years

02:03:22.950 --> 02:03:22.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
that they should get some sort of a tax
 
02:03:27.990 --> 02:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
break we're not discounting their
 
02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.350 align:start position:0%
break we're not discounting their
property

02:03:29.350 --> 02:03:29.360 align:start position:0%
property
 
02:03:29.360 --> 02:03:30.390 align:start position:0%
property
or

02:03:30.390 --> 02:03:30.400 align:start position:0%
or
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
the value of their land outside of the
 
02:03:35.589 --> 02:03:35.599 align:start position:0%
two acres the house and in a possible
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
garage might sit on
 
02:03:37.679 --> 02:03:38.390 align:start position:0%
garage might sit on
so

02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:39.910 --> 02:03:39.920 align:start position:0%
they're still going to pay the full tax
 
02:03:43.030 --> 02:03:43.040 align:start position:0%
on that including the school tax portion
 
02:03:49.350 --> 02:03:49.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:51.910 --> 02:03:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
my what if you know in a transitional or
 
02:03:56.159 --> 02:03:57.589 align:start position:0%
my what if you know in a transitional or
transient

02:03:57.589 --> 02:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
transient
 
02:04:01.510 --> 02:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
you know i i lived in a different
 
02:04:05.750 --> 02:04:05.760 align:start position:0%
community i paid the taxes my kids went
 
02:04:07.990 --> 02:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
to the public schools and stuff then i
 
02:04:10.470 --> 02:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
moved to a retirement
 
02:04:12.870 --> 02:04:12.880 align:start position:0%
and i turn 75
 
02:04:15.430 --> 02:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
and i come to new hampshire
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
now i can say oh i can get the discount
 
02:04:19.589 --> 02:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
i haven't paid
 
02:04:21.830 --> 02:04:21.840 align:start position:0%
into new hampshire but i came here
 
02:04:24.229 --> 02:04:24.239 align:start position:0%
because it's attractive so are we going
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
to make
 
02:04:25.599 --> 02:04:27.350 align:start position:0%
to make
more

02:04:27.350 --> 02:04:27.360 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:04:30.229 --> 02:04:30.239 align:start position:0%
people come here because it's
 
02:04:32.069 --> 02:04:32.079 align:start position:0%
we don't have sales tax we don't have
 
02:04:34.870 --> 02:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
income tax we don't have property tax so
 
02:04:36.390 --> 02:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
this is a
 
02:04:39.270 --> 02:04:39.280 align:start position:0%
tax haven well
 
02:04:41.189 --> 02:04:41.199 align:start position:0%
again you have to have lived in your
 
02:04:43.430 --> 02:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
primary residence for a minimum of five
 
02:04:45.910 --> 02:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
years before you'd be eligible to apply
 
02:04:47.430 --> 02:04:47.440 align:start position:0%
for the tax
 
02:04:47.440 --> 02:04:48.629 align:start position:0%
for the tax
credit

02:04:48.629 --> 02:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
credit
 
02:04:48.639 --> 02:04:49.830 align:start position:0%
credit
um

02:04:49.830 --> 02:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
beyond that i i have no idea
 
02:04:54.310 --> 02:04:54.320 align:start position:0%
whether it would attract people to new
 
02:04:56.149 --> 02:04:56.159 align:start position:0%
hampshire i would
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
pretty much say that most of the people
 
02:05:00.870 --> 02:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
who retire try to
 
02:05:03.510 --> 02:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
migrate south not not up here
 
02:05:05.189 --> 02:05:05.199 align:start position:0%
particularly with the storm we have
 
02:05:05.199 --> 02:05:07.030 align:start position:0%
particularly with the storm we have
coming

02:05:07.030 --> 02:05:07.040 align:start position:0%
coming
 
02:05:07.040 --> 02:05:08.870 align:start position:0%
coming
that's

02:05:08.870 --> 02:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:16.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:18.069 --> 02:05:18.079 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:05:19.510 --> 02:05:19.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:05:19.520 --> 02:05:21.510 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

02:05:21.510 --> 02:05:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:24.470 --> 02:05:24.480 align:start position:0%
on line nine of the first page it says
 
02:05:27.910 --> 02:05:27.920 align:start position:0%
that uh it must be owned and used as his
 
02:05:29.109 --> 02:05:29.119 align:start position:0%
his or her
 
02:05:31.270 --> 02:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
residential real estate
 
02:05:31.280 --> 02:05:32.310 align:start position:0%
residential real estate
uh

02:05:32.310 --> 02:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:05:34.550 --> 02:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
on 915
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
it says if the real estate is owned by
 
02:05:38.470 --> 02:05:38.480 align:start position:0%
the person's spouse
 
02:05:41.589 --> 02:05:41.599 align:start position:0%
is this a uh an exception to the uh
 
02:05:45.990 --> 02:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:52.310 --> 02:05:52.320 align:start position:0%
are you talking about on the bill or on
 
02:05:54.629 --> 02:05:54.639 align:start position:0%
the amendment on on the amendment i i
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
assume we're talking about the amendment
 
02:05:56.159 --> 02:05:57.589 align:start position:0%
assume we're talking about the amendment
right

02:05:57.589 --> 02:05:57.599 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:05:57.599 --> 02:06:06.390 align:start position:0%
right
um

02:06:06.390 --> 02:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:15.350 --> 02:06:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:17.109 --> 02:06:17.119 align:start position:0%
okay now i've read this could you repeat
 
02:06:19.589 --> 02:06:19.599 align:start position:0%
the question all right on line nine it
 
02:06:21.830 --> 02:06:21.840 align:start position:0%
states that the property is owned and
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
used by as his or her primary uh
 
02:06:27.270 --> 02:06:27.280 align:start position:0%
residential real estate and then on line
 
02:06:29.669 --> 02:06:29.679 align:start position:0%
15 it says if the real estate is owned
 
02:06:31.589 --> 02:06:31.599 align:start position:0%
by the person's spouse
 
02:06:34.069 --> 02:06:34.079 align:start position:0%
so you know it seems that there's either
 
02:06:36.629 --> 02:06:36.639 align:start position:0%
a contradiction or an exception
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
well i think the way i i wrote that is
 
02:06:39.360 --> 02:06:40.470 align:start position:0%
well i think the way i i wrote that is
um

02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:41.990 align:start position:0%
um
the

02:06:41.990 --> 02:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:06:43.510 --> 02:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
in one of the
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh previous representatives asked about
 
02:06:49.109 --> 02:06:49.119 align:start position:0%
um the age of the spouse it's
 
02:06:51.750 --> 02:06:51.760 align:start position:0%
it was intended to mean
 
02:06:55.109 --> 02:06:55.119 align:start position:0%
that if they're married to someone
 
02:06:58.390 --> 02:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
and the property is in their name those
 
02:07:00.709 --> 02:07:00.719 align:start position:0%
two people live in the domicile but
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
they'd both be
 
02:07:04.149 --> 02:07:04.159 align:start position:0%
if they're paying the taxes they'd both
 
02:07:06.870 --> 02:07:06.880 align:start position:0%
be eligible as long as one of them is
 
02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:07.990 align:start position:0%
be eligible as long as one of them is
alive

02:07:07.990 --> 02:07:08.000 align:start position:0%
alive
 
02:07:11.270 --> 02:07:11.280 align:start position:0%
and over 75.
 
02:07:15.109 --> 02:07:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:16.790 --> 02:07:16.800 align:start position:0%
follow up please
 
02:07:16.800 --> 02:07:17.589 align:start position:0%
follow up please
but

02:07:17.589 --> 02:07:17.599 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
like i said if you look at the the
 
02:07:21.990 --> 02:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
requirement on line nine it says it has
 
02:07:24.870 --> 02:07:24.880 align:start position:0%
to be owned and used
 
02:07:27.669 --> 02:07:27.679 align:start position:0%
by the the it's their primary represent
 
02:07:27.679 --> 02:07:29.109 align:start position:0%
by the the it's their primary represent
uh

02:07:29.109 --> 02:07:29.119 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:07:30.790 --> 02:07:30.800 align:start position:0%
real estate
 
02:07:32.870 --> 02:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
but if it's not owned
 
02:07:35.430 --> 02:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
by the person that is qualifying
 
02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:37.030 align:start position:0%
by the person that is qualifying
then

02:07:37.030 --> 02:07:37.040 align:start position:0%
then
 
02:07:39.430 --> 02:07:39.440 align:start position:0%
like i said is this an exception
 
02:07:50.790 --> 02:07:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.149 --> 02:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
75 years of age who was liable for the
 
02:07:56.709 --> 02:07:56.719 align:start position:0%
property taxes for the property owned or
 
02:07:59.430 --> 02:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
used as his or her
 
02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
residential estate or
 
02:08:02.159 --> 02:08:03.589 align:start position:0%

real estate
 
02:08:08.310 --> 02:08:08.320 align:start position:0%
so it says that the 75 year old person
 
02:08:10.149 --> 02:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
needs to be the person liable for the

needs to be the person liable for the

02:08:11.350 --> 02:08:11.360 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:08:13.589 --> 02:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
if you have your

your father or your grandfather move in

to your home
 
02:08:20.709 --> 02:08:20.719 align:start position:0%
if you're paying the taxes you're not
 
02:08:23.189 --> 02:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
liable for the credit
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:26.239 --> 02:08:28.550 align:start position:0%

02:08:32.719 --> 02:08:35.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.069 --> 02:08:38.079 align:start position:0%

02:08:43.270 --> 02:08:43.280 align:start position:0%
these other statutes in mind
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:55.910 --> 02:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:57.430 --> 02:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
do you do you believe there's a a
 
02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.109 align:start position:0%
do you do you believe there's a a
contradiction

02:08:59.109 --> 02:08:59.119 align:start position:0%
contradiction
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
or is it or like i said isn't an
 
02:09:03.510 --> 02:09:03.520 align:start position:0%
exception no
 
02:09:08.470 --> 02:09:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
if the real estate is only the personal
 
02:09:11.910 --> 02:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
spouse the couple
 
02:09:13.750 --> 02:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
must have been married for at least 10
 
02:09:15.750 --> 02:09:15.760 align:start position:0%
consecutive years
 
02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:17.430 align:start position:0%
consecutive years
so

02:09:17.430 --> 02:09:17.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:09:19.109 --> 02:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
no i don't think it's a contradiction i
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:31.189 --> 02:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:33.030 --> 02:09:33.040 align:start position:0%
thank you if it's owned by the person
 
02:09:36.149 --> 02:09:36.159 align:start position:0%
spells yeah i i'll
 
02:09:44.470 --> 02:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
02:09:47.189 --> 02:09:47.199 align:start position:0%
representative for taking another
 
02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
question that i am
 
02:09:52.390 --> 02:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
i i am uh
 
02:09:54.229 --> 02:09:54.239 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out if it's actually a
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
question but but this this
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
municipal county government has several
 
02:10:00.629 --> 02:10:00.639 align:start position:0%
of these bills that are exemptions and
 
02:10:03.189 --> 02:10:03.199 align:start position:0%
one of them is an elderly exemption and
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure that there's going to
 
02:10:06.550 --> 02:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
be a question in here so i'm trying to
 
02:10:07.830 --> 02:10:07.840 align:start position:0%
figure it out do you think there should
 
02:10:10.629 --> 02:10:10.639 align:start position:0%
be a reconciliation somehow
 
02:10:12.870 --> 02:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
between these bills because we have
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
another elderly exemption which i am
 
02:10:17.750 --> 02:10:17.760 align:start position:0%
going to be elderly according to that
 
02:10:20.069 --> 02:10:20.079 align:start position:0%
one at 60 years old
 
02:10:24.069 --> 02:10:24.079 align:start position:0%
but this one is 75 years old the other
 
02:10:27.510 --> 02:10:27.520 align:start position:0%
one is a one-year residency requirement
 
02:10:29.430 --> 02:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
this one is a five-year
 
02:10:31.430 --> 02:10:31.440 align:start position:0%
residency requirement do you have any
 
02:10:33.109 --> 02:10:33.119 align:start position:0%
idea i guess the question is do you have
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
any idea how we can reconcile
 
02:10:38.229 --> 02:10:38.239 align:start position:0%
which one of these is the right one
 
02:10:39.990 --> 02:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
and i that's why i'm not sure that i can
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
ask that question because
 
02:10:43.030 --> 02:10:43.040 align:start position:0%
with all due respect there's no way you
 
02:10:44.470 --> 02:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
could know the other bills that we have
 
02:10:45.830 --> 02:10:45.840 align:start position:0%
in front of us right
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
i've not read the other bill but
 
02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.350 align:start position:0%
i've not read the other bill but
um

02:10:49.350 --> 02:10:49.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:10:51.510 --> 02:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm over 60
 
02:10:54.310 --> 02:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
and i've never asked for tax credit
 
02:10:57.030 --> 02:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
because of my age and don't expect that
 
02:10:58.550 --> 02:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
i will
 
02:10:59.830 --> 02:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
but i'm
 
02:11:01.990 --> 02:11:02.000 align:start position:0%
probably better off than many of the
 
02:11:04.629 --> 02:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
elderly people in our state
 
02:11:04.639 --> 02:11:05.070 align:start position:0%
elderly people in our state
and

02:11:05.070 --> 02:11:05.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:05.080 --> 02:11:06.550 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

02:11:06.550 --> 02:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:11:07.830 --> 02:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
i would not like to see this bill
 
02:11:11.510 --> 02:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
combined with that bill
 
02:11:11.520 --> 02:11:12.390 align:start position:0%
combined with that bill
um

02:11:12.390 --> 02:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:14.470 --> 02:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
i just think that 60 years old is way
 
02:11:16.629 --> 02:11:16.639 align:start position:0%
too young to be asking for an elderly
 
02:11:16.639 --> 02:11:19.030 align:start position:0%
too young to be asking for an elderly
exemption

02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
although aarp gives out cards now when
 
02:11:32.390 --> 02:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:33.750 --> 02:11:33.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:11:37.910 --> 02:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
i i'm going to go back to the means
 
02:11:39.910 --> 02:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
testing and maybe i don't even have to
 
02:11:43.270 --> 02:11:43.280 align:start position:0%
do that but if you have someone who owns
 
02:11:47.189 --> 02:11:47.199 align:start position:0%
a 400 000 house 75 doesn't have their
 
02:11:49.030 --> 02:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
kids in school anymore
 
02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
and is not paying the school part of the
 
02:11:52.870 --> 02:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
called tax bill
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
but you have someone who's living in a
 
02:11:59.270 --> 02:11:59.280 align:start position:0%
40 000 manufactured housing unit
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
and has two kids in school
 
02:12:04.709 --> 02:12:04.719 align:start position:0%
how does the where does the exemption
 
02:12:07.750 --> 02:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
for the person with the larger property
 
02:12:10.069 --> 02:12:10.079 align:start position:0%
end up it's going to end up in that
 
02:12:16.950 --> 02:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:19.189 --> 02:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
i don't know the answer to the question
 
02:12:21.350 --> 02:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
i wish i did
 
02:12:21.360 --> 02:12:22.629 align:start position:0%
i wish i did
i

02:12:22.629 --> 02:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
i
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
i think the way that i approached this
 
02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.990 align:start position:0%
i think the way that i approached this
was

02:12:25.990 --> 02:12:26.000 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
that if the value of your property was
 
02:12:30.870 --> 02:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
higher you've obviously paid much more
 
02:12:33.430 --> 02:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
in school taxes over the years if the
 
02:12:35.830 --> 02:12:35.840 align:start position:0%
value of your property is
 
02:12:37.669 --> 02:12:37.679 align:start position:0%
i don't want me to
 
02:12:39.830 --> 02:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
sound contrite but minimal
 
02:12:43.109 --> 02:12:43.119 align:start position:0%
then you've paid a lot less in taxes
 
02:12:43.119 --> 02:12:43.990 align:start position:0%
then you've paid a lot less in taxes
and

02:12:43.990 --> 02:12:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.030 align:start position:0%
and
yes

02:12:45.030 --> 02:12:45.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:12:47.430 --> 02:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
if this goes through and there are any
 
02:12:49.350 --> 02:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
number of these people that apply for
 
02:12:49.360 --> 02:12:52.550 align:start position:0%
number of these people that apply for
this

02:12:52.550 --> 02:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:55.430 --> 02:12:55.440 align:start position:0%
there will be
 
02:12:59.030 --> 02:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
there will be an additional
 
02:13:01.270 --> 02:13:01.280 align:start position:0%
amount added to everyone's property
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
taxes in the town
 
02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:03.990 align:start position:0%
taxes in the town
and

02:13:03.990 --> 02:13:04.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:04.000 --> 02:13:05.510 align:start position:0%
and
it's

02:13:05.510 --> 02:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
it's
 
02:13:08.229 --> 02:13:08.239 align:start position:0%
indeterminable what that will be because
 
02:13:10.310 --> 02:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
we have no way to know how many people
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
are eligible in a particular town and
 
02:13:14.550 --> 02:13:14.560 align:start position:0%
how many would even apply for it if they
 
02:13:16.950 --> 02:13:16.960 align:start position:0%
were eligible
 
02:13:18.870 --> 02:13:18.880 align:start position:0%
as you well know
 
02:13:21.109 --> 02:13:21.119 align:start position:0%
we pass laws here
 
02:13:22.470 --> 02:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
every year
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
that no one in in
 
02:13:26.870 --> 02:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
the state ever hears about
 
02:13:28.229 --> 02:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
or is
 
02:13:31.910 --> 02:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
made aware of so um hopefully this won't
 
02:13:34.229 --> 02:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
be one of those bills if it makes it
 
02:13:36.149 --> 02:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
through but
 
02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:37.360 align:start position:0%
i think it
 
02:13:38.629 --> 02:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
we need to give these people an
 
02:13:41.430 --> 02:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
opportunity to save some money
 
02:13:47.270 --> 02:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:48.870 --> 02:13:48.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:13:53.030 --> 02:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:56.390 --> 02:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
following up on what my colleague asked
 
02:13:58.550 --> 02:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
about about other bills before this
 
02:14:01.270 --> 02:14:01.280 align:start position:0%
committee that deal with tax credits or
 
02:14:05.109 --> 02:14:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
would you would you feel that it would
 
02:14:10.470 --> 02:14:10.480 align:start position:0%
be right and proper
 
02:14:14.069 --> 02:14:14.079 align:start position:0%
if if all of those if all of the elderly
 
02:14:17.270 --> 02:14:17.280 align:start position:0%
tax exemption or tax credit bills passed
 
02:14:19.270 --> 02:14:19.280 align:start position:0%
that they'd be cumulative
 
02:14:22.629 --> 02:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
so for example if if if this bill would
 
02:14:22.639 --> 02:14:23.510 align:start position:0%
so for example if if if this bill would
pass

02:14:23.510 --> 02:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
pass
 
02:14:26.550 --> 02:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
and somebody applied for this tax
 
02:14:28.950 --> 02:14:28.960 align:start position:0%
exemption or tax credit
 
02:14:30.550 --> 02:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
and received
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
20 25 percent off their property tax
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
bill but they also applied for and
 
02:14:37.910 --> 02:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
received an additional exemption under
 
02:14:39.430 --> 02:14:39.440 align:start position:0%
another law the path
 
02:14:41.510 --> 02:14:41.520 align:start position:0%
should should those two be
 
02:14:44.229 --> 02:14:44.239 align:start position:0%
added together to make an even larger
 
02:14:49.030 --> 02:14:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:51.510 --> 02:14:51.520 align:start position:0%
where would it end well i think that's
 
02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.830 align:start position:0%
where would it end well i think that's
that's

02:14:52.830 --> 02:14:52.840 align:start position:0%
that's
 
02:14:55.669 --> 02:14:55.679 align:start position:0%
where having the section in that allows
 
02:14:57.430 --> 02:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
the tax collector or the selectmen to
 
02:14:59.430 --> 02:14:59.440 align:start position:0%
determine whether
 
02:14:59.440 --> 02:14:59.650 align:start position:0%
determine whether
the

02:14:59.650 --> 02:14:59.660 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:14:59.660 --> 02:15:01.350 align:start position:0%
the
[Music]

02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:07.350 --> 02:15:07.360 align:start position:0%
able to be
 
02:15:08.709 --> 02:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
applied for
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
i would i would think that most
 
02:15:14.229 --> 02:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
towns or tax collectors would not
 
02:15:14.239 --> 02:15:15.430 align:start position:0%
towns or tax collectors would not
consider

02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
consider
 
02:15:17.830 --> 02:15:17.840 align:start position:0%
more than one exemption they would go to
 
02:15:20.550 --> 02:15:20.560 align:start position:0%
whatever the greatest exemption was for
 
02:15:23.270 --> 02:15:23.280 align:start position:0%
that person if they applied for that
 
02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:24.390 align:start position:0%
that person if they applied for that
exemption

02:15:24.390 --> 02:15:24.400 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
02:15:26.790 --> 02:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
and give that give it to them if someone
 
02:15:29.189 --> 02:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
applies for a veterans exemption because
 
02:15:31.669 --> 02:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
that works better for them
 
02:15:33.189 --> 02:15:33.199 align:start position:0%
and most of those people don't have to
 
02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
be over 75
 
02:15:37.350 --> 02:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
there they can be much younger and still
 
02:15:39.109 --> 02:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
get the exemptions
 
02:15:42.149 --> 02:15:42.159 align:start position:0%
on the laws that exist currently i don't
 
02:15:43.510 --> 02:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
know about the bills before the
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
committee currently but uh
 
02:15:45.840 --> 02:15:46.870 align:start position:0%
committee currently but uh
um

02:15:46.870 --> 02:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:48.830 --> 02:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
i think that the
 
02:15:52.870 --> 02:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
uh the opportunity to decide that is
 
02:15:54.870 --> 02:15:54.880 align:start position:0%
left with local government
 
02:15:54.880 --> 02:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
left with local government
and

02:15:55.990 --> 02:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:15:58.149 --> 02:15:58.159 align:start position:0%
you know probably a consultation between
 
02:15:59.750 --> 02:15:59.760 align:start position:0%
the selectmen and the
 
02:16:01.189 --> 02:16:01.199 align:start position:0%
tax collector
 
02:16:03.430 --> 02:16:03.440 align:start position:0%
and if they're doing their job in my
 
02:16:03.440 --> 02:16:04.390 align:start position:0%
and if they're doing their job in my
opinion

02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:16:05.750 --> 02:16:05.760 align:start position:0%
they should
 
02:16:05.760 --> 02:16:06.709 align:start position:0%
they should
be

02:16:06.709 --> 02:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
be
 
02:16:08.709 --> 02:16:08.719 align:start position:0%
pointing people to whatever
 
02:16:11.270 --> 02:16:11.280 align:start position:0%
the best deal for them is
 
02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:13.589 align:start position:0%
the best deal for them is
tax-wise

02:16:13.589 --> 02:16:13.599 align:start position:0%
tax-wise
 
02:16:15.270 --> 02:16:15.280 align:start position:0%
and approving that
 
02:16:16.830 --> 02:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and there is
 
02:16:26.709 --> 02:16:26.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:28.709 --> 02:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
thank you mr t thank you representative
 
02:16:33.270 --> 02:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:35.349 --> 02:16:35.359 align:start position:0%
have you looked at
 
02:16:35.359 --> 02:16:36.870 align:start position:0%
have you looked at
how

02:16:36.870 --> 02:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
how
 
02:16:39.110 --> 02:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
specifically because you're carving out
 
02:16:42.469 --> 02:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
an exemption for school taxes for people
 
02:16:45.750 --> 02:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
with 75 and older
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
how would it impact
 
02:16:51.270 --> 02:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
communities where
 
02:16:54.230 --> 02:16:54.240 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of the population is
 
02:16:56.870 --> 02:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
elderly or
 
02:16:56.880 --> 02:16:58.150 align:start position:0%
elderly or
older

02:16:58.150 --> 02:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
older
 
02:16:58.160 --> 02:16:59.270 align:start position:0%
older
and

02:16:59.270 --> 02:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
their school system still needs support
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
and we still need to attract younger
 
02:17:10.230 --> 02:17:10.240 align:start position:0%
folks to live in that community
 
02:17:14.709 --> 02:17:14.719 align:start position:0%
is this making that
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
accommodation for
 
02:17:19.589 --> 02:17:19.599 align:start position:0%
the community to still function and
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
thrive or is it going to make it
 
02:17:26.790 --> 02:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
constrict and kind of eliminate the
 
02:17:28.389 --> 02:17:28.399 align:start position:0%
younger community
 
02:17:30.150 --> 02:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
members coming in
 
02:17:32.389 --> 02:17:32.399 align:start position:0%
i don't think it will one of the reasons
 
02:17:35.750 --> 02:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
that i phase this in over five years i
 
02:17:38.629 --> 02:17:38.639 align:start position:0%
get five percent the first year
 
02:17:41.190 --> 02:17:41.200 align:start position:0%
um another five percent the second year
 
02:17:42.870 --> 02:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
and down so that
 
02:17:44.950 --> 02:17:44.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:17:46.950 --> 02:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
the tax base has a
 
02:17:48.790 --> 02:17:48.800 align:start position:0%
chance to adjust
 
02:17:50.790 --> 02:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
to that tax credit whether there be a
 
02:17:53.110 --> 02:17:53.120 align:start position:0%
lot of people in town or not a lot of
 
02:17:53.120 --> 02:17:53.990 align:start position:0%
lot of people in town or not a lot of
people

02:17:53.990 --> 02:17:54.000 align:start position:0%
people
 
02:17:54.000 --> 02:17:54.830 align:start position:0%
people
and

02:17:54.830 --> 02:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:17:58.870 --> 02:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
with um miss heck's permission
 
02:18:01.349 --> 02:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
i will use your uh
 
02:18:04.230 --> 02:18:04.240 align:start position:0%
example of a 400 000 home
 
02:18:04.240 --> 02:18:05.750 align:start position:0%
example of a 400 000 home
um

02:18:05.750 --> 02:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:09.349 --> 02:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
did the math and came up with a
 
02:18:13.990 --> 02:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
an example that uh she felt that
 
02:18:15.990 --> 02:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
in an average town
 
02:18:18.709 --> 02:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
if you had a 400 000 home which i guess
 
02:18:20.790 --> 02:18:20.800 align:start position:0%
is average now
 
02:18:20.800 --> 02:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
is average now
um

02:18:21.830 --> 02:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:23.669 --> 02:18:23.679 align:start position:0%
that over this period of time it would
 
02:18:27.669 --> 02:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
cost you about 249 dollars additional
 
02:18:31.830 --> 02:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
in property tax to make up for the
 
02:18:34.309 --> 02:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:18:35.910 --> 02:18:35.920 align:start position:0%
the credit
 
02:18:39.589 --> 02:18:39.599 align:start position:0%
taken out of the school tax
 
02:18:41.990 --> 02:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't if you're paying taxes on
 
02:18:44.950 --> 02:18:44.960 align:start position:0%
a four hundred thousand dollar home at
 
02:18:46.709 --> 02:18:46.719 align:start position:0%
twenty five dollars a thousand or
 
02:18:49.349 --> 02:18:49.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the tax rate might be
 
02:18:50.870 --> 02:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
two hundred and forty nine dollars a
 
02:18:52.870 --> 02:18:52.880 align:start position:0%
pretty small price to pay the other
 
02:18:54.950 --> 02:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
thing you have to understand is
 
02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
most of us
 
02:18:58.950 --> 02:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
have parents or grandparents
 
02:19:01.349 --> 02:19:01.359 align:start position:0%
that at some time here in the future are
 
02:19:03.429 --> 02:19:03.439 align:start position:0%
going to qualify for this
 
02:19:03.439 --> 02:19:04.549 align:start position:0%
going to qualify for this
deduction

02:19:04.549 --> 02:19:04.559 align:start position:0%
deduction
 
02:19:07.190 --> 02:19:07.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't think it's we're not picking
 
02:19:08.870 --> 02:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
on the younger people
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're just asking them to do something
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're probably already doing by
 
02:19:13.840 --> 02:19:15.110 align:start position:0%
they're probably already doing by
supporting

02:19:15.110 --> 02:19:15.120 align:start position:0%
supporting
 
02:19:17.030 --> 02:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
in some way their parents or their
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
grandparents and i'm not talking about
 
02:19:22.070 --> 02:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
necessarily financially but
 
02:19:22.080 --> 02:19:24.790 align:start position:0%
necessarily financially but
um

02:19:24.790 --> 02:19:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:26.549 --> 02:19:26.559 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
02:19:29.190 --> 02:19:29.200 align:start position:0%
easy way to do it um
 
02:19:31.349 --> 02:19:31.359 align:start position:0%
easiest way i could come up with to do
 
02:19:31.359 --> 02:19:32.150 align:start position:0%
easiest way i could come up with to do
it

02:19:32.150 --> 02:19:32.160 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:19:34.309 --> 02:19:34.319 align:start position:0%
and i did look at the other bills that
 
02:19:34.319 --> 02:19:35.509 align:start position:0%
and i did look at the other bills that
allow

02:19:35.509 --> 02:19:35.519 align:start position:0%
allow
 
02:19:38.709 --> 02:19:38.719 align:start position:0%
um elderly tax exemptions and some of
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
them are
 
02:19:42.070 --> 02:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
convoluted i think
 
02:19:43.669 --> 02:19:43.679 align:start position:0%
is the best word
 
02:19:45.270 --> 02:19:45.280 align:start position:0%
and i think there are a lot of people
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
that just wouldn't understand them this
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
bill at least
 
02:19:51.590 --> 02:19:51.600 align:start position:0%
you know a 75 year old person can read
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
and as far as attracting young younger
 
02:20:02.469 --> 02:20:02.479 align:start position:0%
people my goal is to attract younger
 
02:20:04.389 --> 02:20:04.399 align:start position:0%
people to the state particularly where i
 
02:20:04.399 --> 02:20:05.349 align:start position:0%
people to the state particularly where i
live

02:20:05.349 --> 02:20:05.359 align:start position:0%
live
 
02:20:06.630 --> 02:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
02:20:08.870 --> 02:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
currently have a factory that
 
02:20:11.429 --> 02:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
needs 410 people and they can only
 
02:20:13.349 --> 02:20:13.359 align:start position:0%
attract 160
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
because we don't have any young people
 
02:20:17.270 --> 02:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the newspaper every
 
02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:18.150 align:start position:0%
and when you look at the newspaper every
week

02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
week
 
02:20:19.910 --> 02:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
there are more and more people that are
 
02:20:21.349 --> 02:20:21.359 align:start position:0%
being eliminated
 
02:20:21.359 --> 02:20:22.309 align:start position:0%
being eliminated
just

02:20:22.309 --> 02:20:22.319 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:20:23.910 --> 02:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
by attrition
 
02:20:26.550 --> 02:20:26.560 align:start position:0%
um i'm trying to keep the people there
 
02:20:28.150 --> 02:20:28.160 align:start position:0%
that are there
 
02:20:30.070 --> 02:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know all the towns in new hampshire
 
02:20:31.030 --> 02:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
not just
 
02:20:35.270 --> 02:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:37.030 --> 02:20:37.040 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking uh
 
02:20:38.950 --> 02:20:38.960 align:start position:0%
answer michael uh yeah thank you for
 
02:20:40.230 --> 02:20:40.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
02:20:40.240 --> 02:20:41.110 align:start position:0%
taking my question
uh

02:20:41.110 --> 02:20:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:20:43.670 --> 02:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna give you a scenario i'm 75 i'm
 
02:20:45.429 --> 02:20:45.439 align:start position:0%
75 years old
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
and i have less than two acres
 
02:20:47.840 --> 02:20:48.630 align:start position:0%
and i have less than two acres
but

02:20:48.630 --> 02:20:48.640 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:20:50.950 --> 02:20:50.960 align:start position:0%
i have a commercial business on my
 
02:20:53.990 --> 02:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
property or i got a home based business
 
02:20:56.550 --> 02:20:56.560 align:start position:0%
how would i fit into this
 
02:20:58.389 --> 02:20:58.399 align:start position:0%
or wouldn't i
 
02:20:59.990 --> 02:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
well i would i would guess it would
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
depend on what your zoning is
 
02:21:04.630 --> 02:21:04.640 align:start position:0%
um if you're zoning consider is it a
 
02:21:07.510 --> 02:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
commercial property then it would not be
 
02:21:10.630 --> 02:21:10.640 align:start position:0%
eligible for this this needs to be your
 
02:21:17.429 --> 02:21:17.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.389 --> 02:21:20.399 align:start position:0%
what if my property is mixed use
 
02:21:22.389 --> 02:21:22.399 align:start position:0%
i i would guess that would be up to the
 
02:21:24.150 --> 02:21:24.160 align:start position:0%
town to determine whether or not to
 
02:21:30.950 --> 02:21:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:32.710 --> 02:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative for taking
 
02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
yet another question from me
 
02:21:37.190 --> 02:21:37.200 align:start position:0%
um what if i'm 75 years old and i've
 
02:21:41.670 --> 02:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:43.590 --> 02:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
and i have children in the school
 
02:21:46.389 --> 02:21:46.399 align:start position:0%
because my my children are not able to
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
care for their kids and so i am serving
 
02:21:52.230 --> 02:21:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:54.790 --> 02:21:54.800 align:start position:0%
it's just another one of those
 
02:21:57.910 --> 02:21:57.920 align:start position:0%
many scenarios out there that you can't
 
02:22:00.389 --> 02:22:00.399 align:start position:0%
anticipate and i guess i would have to
 
02:22:02.710 --> 02:22:02.720 align:start position:0%
leave that up to the
 
02:22:04.950 --> 02:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
to the um
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
taxing authority
 
02:22:08.150 --> 02:22:08.160 align:start position:0%
as to whether or not they would allow
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
the exemption my my gut reaction is that
 
02:22:13.990 --> 02:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm sure there are quite a number of
 
02:22:15.990 --> 02:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
people in that position
 
02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.110 align:start position:0%
people in that position
currently

02:22:17.110 --> 02:22:17.120 align:start position:0%
currently
 
02:22:17.120 --> 02:22:18.070 align:start position:0%
currently
but

02:22:18.070 --> 02:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:22:20.469 --> 02:22:20.479 align:start position:0%
those children
 
02:22:22.630 --> 02:22:22.640 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about eliminating the
 
02:22:25.590 --> 02:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
school tax on any of these people at the
 
02:22:28.230 --> 02:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
at the end at age 80 they're still going
 
02:22:30.630 --> 02:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
to be paying 75
 
02:22:33.429 --> 02:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
of the taxes that are
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
for the school portion of their tax bill
 
02:22:37.349 --> 02:22:37.359 align:start position:0%
so that we're not
 
02:22:39.670 --> 02:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
giving up that much what i'm trying to
 
02:22:41.750 --> 02:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
do is give them a leg up on being able
 
02:22:44.230 --> 02:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
to stay in their home until they're 80
 
02:22:44.240 --> 02:22:45.590 align:start position:0%
to stay in their home until they're 80
and

02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:22:47.349 --> 02:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
be able to buy food and heating oil and
 
02:22:47.359 --> 02:22:48.309 align:start position:0%
be able to buy food and heating oil and
whatever

02:22:48.309 --> 02:22:48.319 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
02:22:51.190 --> 02:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
and granted not all elderly people are
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
in that position
 
02:22:55.910 --> 02:22:55.920 align:start position:0%
but as i said before
 
02:22:57.990 --> 02:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
um with the previous question
 
02:23:00.230 --> 02:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
people that are
 
02:23:00.240 --> 02:23:01.910 align:start position:0%
people that are
wealthier

02:23:01.910 --> 02:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
wealthier
 
02:23:05.110 --> 02:23:05.120 align:start position:0%
are probably living in in much larger
 
02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.230 align:start position:0%
are probably living in in much larger
homes

02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:23:09.590 --> 02:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
and own more property and they're paying
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
a much higher percentage of tax
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
02:23:17.110 --> 02:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
than the people that i'm i've targeted
 
02:23:20.950 --> 02:23:20.960 align:start position:0%
this bill too thank you you're welcome
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
for other questions
 
02:23:25.349 --> 02:23:25.359 align:start position:0%
i have a question for you um
 
02:23:26.710 --> 02:23:26.720 align:start position:0%
at the
 
02:23:28.469 --> 02:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
end of the amendment it talks about the
 
02:23:29.990 --> 02:23:30.000 align:start position:0%
appeals process
 
02:23:31.110 --> 02:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
in case
 
02:23:36.070 --> 02:23:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:40.870 --> 02:23:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:43.510 --> 02:23:43.520 align:start position:0%
for refusal to grant the exemption
 
02:23:45.670 --> 02:23:45.680 align:start position:0%
i guess my question is
 
02:23:48.469 --> 02:23:48.479 align:start position:0%
do you think it's reasonable that local
 
02:23:48.479 --> 02:23:51.110 align:start position:0%
do you think it's reasonable that local
municipalities

02:23:51.110 --> 02:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
municipalities
 
02:23:53.270 --> 02:23:53.280 align:start position:0%
are going to refuse exemptions once the
 
02:23:56.070 --> 02:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
exemption's been determined
 
02:23:57.670 --> 02:23:57.680 align:start position:0%
to be
 
02:24:01.270 --> 02:24:01.280 align:start position:0%
in place by the state um
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
i'm sure it happens all the time
 
02:24:06.070 --> 02:24:06.080 align:start position:0%
i i know of two particular instances in
 
02:24:07.990 --> 02:24:08.000 align:start position:0%
my town where it's happened
 
02:24:08.000 --> 02:24:09.190 align:start position:0%
my town where it's happened
um

02:24:09.190 --> 02:24:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
and i feel i think the people dropped it
 
02:24:13.030 --> 02:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
i don't think they appealed because i
 
02:24:15.910 --> 02:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
did ask the tax collector about that
 
02:24:18.230 --> 02:24:18.240 align:start position:0%
if they'd had any of those issues
 
02:24:18.240 --> 02:24:19.590 align:start position:0%
if they'd had any of those issues
and

02:24:19.590 --> 02:24:19.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:24:22.150 --> 02:24:22.160 align:start position:0%
i think that
 
02:24:24.630 --> 02:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
if they qualify for the tax
 
02:24:24.640 --> 02:24:25.910 align:start position:0%
if they qualify for the tax
under

02:24:25.910 --> 02:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
under
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
the rsa
 
02:24:29.429 --> 02:24:29.439 align:start position:0%
what reason would the town have for
 
02:24:30.870 --> 02:24:30.880 align:start position:0%
turning them down
 
02:24:32.469 --> 02:24:32.479 align:start position:0%
other than
 
02:24:34.790 --> 02:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
as the representative had said they'd
 
02:24:37.670 --> 02:24:37.680 align:start position:0%
applied for a different
 
02:24:42.710 --> 02:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:45.190 --> 02:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
decided that they couldn't afford
 
02:24:47.990 --> 02:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
to give these tax exemptions out and
 
02:24:50.070 --> 02:24:50.080 align:start position:0%
they made a decision that they weren't
 
02:24:50.080 --> 02:24:51.270 align:start position:0%
they made a decision that they weren't
gonna

02:24:51.270 --> 02:24:51.280 align:start position:0%
gonna
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to allow any more exemptions
 
02:24:54.389 --> 02:24:54.399 align:start position:0%
for the next
 
02:24:56.790 --> 02:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
x period of time because
 
02:24:59.030 --> 02:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
there was too much stress on their tax
 
02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:00.469 align:start position:0%
there was too much stress on their tax
rate

02:25:00.469 --> 02:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
rate
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
i think we'd be talking about a court
 
02:25:02.640 --> 02:25:04.150 align:start position:0%
i think we'd be talking about a court
case

02:25:04.150 --> 02:25:04.160 align:start position:0%
case
 
02:25:06.469 --> 02:25:06.479 align:start position:0%
um because because there is an appeals
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
process and it does mention the superior
 
02:25:10.870 --> 02:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
court in there i think that's where we'd
 
02:25:13.590 --> 02:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
end up but you have to understand that
 
02:25:15.110 --> 02:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
even though we're giving these people
 
02:25:17.990 --> 02:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
this exemption off the school tax that
 
02:25:19.910 --> 02:25:19.920 align:start position:0%
money is going to be made up by all the
 
02:25:21.750 --> 02:25:21.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the taxpayers
 
02:25:24.710 --> 02:25:24.720 align:start position:0%
to replace that budget for the school
 
02:25:28.630 --> 02:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
and i think probably we'll find out that
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
again in
 
02:25:33.030 --> 02:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
the figure nine percent comes
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
to mind
 
02:25:35.830 --> 02:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
if there's only nine percent of the
 
02:25:37.990 --> 02:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state that are eligible
 
02:25:40.790 --> 02:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
for this and many of them
 
02:25:43.830 --> 02:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
won't take it
 
02:25:45.990 --> 02:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
i certainly would not
 
02:25:46.000 --> 02:25:47.990 align:start position:0%
i certainly would not
um

02:25:47.990 --> 02:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:49.910 --> 02:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
then i think we may be down to four or
 
02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
five percent of people that would
 
02:25:54.070 --> 02:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
actually take that and i think that
 
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
that the effect on the tax rate would be
 
02:25:58.870 --> 02:25:58.880 align:start position:0%
very low very minimal any other further
 
02:26:02.389 --> 02:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:04.389 --> 02:26:04.399 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:26:06.630 --> 02:26:06.640 align:start position:0%

you katherine you've
 
02:26:19.990 --> 02:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you have a comment but

you didn't you didn't mention whether or
 
02:26:23.270 --> 02:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
not you had any preference for or
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
against the bill
 
02:26:26.790 --> 02:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
hopefully my testimony will clarify that
 
02:26:29.190 --> 02:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
sir so my name is catherine heck i'm

thank you for allowing me to speak today
 
02:26:39.190 --> 02:26:39.200 align:start position:0%
um first i would like to say um nhma
 
02:26:40.950 --> 02:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
opposed the original version of this
 
02:26:40.960 --> 02:26:41.750 align:start position:0%
opposed the original version of this
bill

02:26:41.750 --> 02:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
bill
 
02:26:43.349 --> 02:26:43.359 align:start position:0%
um based on the fact that there was no
 
02:26:46.070 --> 02:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
local option and we typically do not
 
02:26:49.670 --> 02:26:49.680 align:start position:0%
support um extended
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
exemptions or new exemptions being
 
02:26:54.870 --> 02:26:54.880 align:start position:0%
created as it does have a burden on the
 
02:26:56.790 --> 02:26:56.800 align:start position:0%
municipal tax base however this is a
 
02:26:59.190 --> 02:26:59.200 align:start position:0%
school specific issue so we took no
 
02:27:01.590 --> 02:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
position on that outside it was outside
 
02:27:03.349 --> 02:27:03.359 align:start position:0%
of local control
 
02:27:05.510 --> 02:27:05.520 align:start position:0%
um the amendment has addressed the local
 
02:27:07.030 --> 02:27:07.040 align:start position:0%
control issue
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
um so now we are neutral on the bill
 
02:27:11.190 --> 02:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
because we have some clarifying
 
02:27:13.750 --> 02:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
questions that i have discussed with the
 
02:27:17.349 --> 02:27:17.359 align:start position:0%
representative who introduced the bill
 
02:27:21.030 --> 02:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
i first wanted to say that based on some
 
02:27:23.270 --> 02:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
discussion you've had i would like to
 
02:27:25.150 --> 02:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
address that rsa
 
02:27:28.870 --> 02:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
7227 which is the adopt and rescind
 
02:27:28.880 --> 02:27:30.389 align:start position:0%
7227 which is the adopt and rescind
provision

02:27:30.389 --> 02:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
provision
 
02:27:32.950 --> 02:27:32.960 align:start position:0%
allows the legislative body to adopt
 
02:27:35.030 --> 02:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
this so that would go to a town meeting
 
02:27:36.870 --> 02:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
vote which was
 
02:27:39.030 --> 02:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
questioned earlier unless you are of
 
02:27:40.469 --> 02:27:40.479 align:start position:0%
course the city council and then the
 
02:27:42.630 --> 02:27:42.640 align:start position:0%
legislative body there's also the
 
02:27:45.910 --> 02:27:45.920 align:start position:0%
ability to rescind it so exemptions
 
02:27:48.150 --> 02:27:48.160 align:start position:0%
weren't being able to be met as to
 
02:27:50.150 --> 02:27:50.160 align:start position:0%
another representative's question
 
02:27:52.070 --> 02:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
because the town just couldn't take any
 
02:27:54.469 --> 02:27:54.479 align:start position:0%
more exemptions then the legislative
 
02:27:56.790 --> 02:27:56.800 align:start position:0%
body should most likely rescind
 
02:27:59.910 --> 02:27:59.920 align:start position:0%
that they have this exemption in place
 
02:28:02.150 --> 02:28:02.160 align:start position:0%
the second thing i would like to clarify
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
is that the example that
 
02:28:07.030 --> 02:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative thompson gave for the 400
 
02:28:09.910 --> 02:28:09.920 align:start position:0%
000 house and 249 dollars was based on
 
02:28:12.790 --> 02:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
my community at the maximum exposure of
 
02:28:15.990 --> 02:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
the 50 discount in the original bill
 
02:28:18.070 --> 02:28:18.080 align:start position:0%
so that's how that math was done using
 
02:28:19.190 --> 02:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
an 18
 
02:28:22.469 --> 02:28:22.479 align:start position:0%
average population of people 75 or older
 
02:28:25.030 --> 02:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire so those are based on
 
02:28:27.510 --> 02:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
some average metrics i'm just doing some
 
02:28:29.590 --> 02:28:29.600 align:start position:0%
quick math with my own tax rate because
 
02:28:31.830 --> 02:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
clearly every homeowner will have a
 
02:28:31.840 --> 02:28:34.309 align:start position:0%
clearly every homeowner will have a
different

02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
effect based on their town's tax rate
 
02:28:38.870 --> 02:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
and of course their homes value so i
 
02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
wanted to clarify where that number came
 
02:28:42.469 --> 02:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
from it's certainly not a statewide
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
number it's very specific
 
02:28:47.190 --> 02:28:47.200 align:start position:0%
and that's my community and my school
 
02:28:49.030 --> 02:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
district based on all of that
 
02:28:52.710 --> 02:28:52.720 align:start position:0%
information and finally our clarifying
 
02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
questions would be first does this
 
02:28:57.510 --> 02:28:57.520 align:start position:0%
exemption is it in addition to the other
 
02:29:00.309 --> 02:29:00.319 align:start position:0%
elderly exemption that currently exists
 
02:29:03.510 --> 02:29:03.520 align:start position:0%
and the second one is the percentage
 
02:29:05.990 --> 02:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
tends to cause a little bit of um
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
an issue when trying to set the tax rate
 
02:29:10.389 --> 02:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
all other exemptions are based on a
 
02:29:13.030 --> 02:29:13.040 align:start position:0%
dollar amount that the legislative body
 
02:29:15.190 --> 02:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
adopts or the state mandates it's a
 
02:29:17.910 --> 02:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
specified dollar amount so when the town
 
02:29:20.950 --> 02:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
files its ms-1 form in september in
 
02:29:22.950 --> 02:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
order to set the tax rate and the school
 
02:29:25.190 --> 02:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
districts have to file their ms 24 and
 
02:29:29.349 --> 02:29:29.359 align:start position:0%
25 to the dra all exemptions revenues
 
02:29:31.590 --> 02:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and credits have to be spelled out in
 
02:29:33.910 --> 02:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
dollar amounts so that the tax rate can
 
02:29:34.950 --> 02:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
be set
 
02:29:38.230 --> 02:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
if it's a percentage we won't know what
 
02:29:40.309 --> 02:29:40.319 align:start position:0%
that percentage could possibly be to set
 
02:29:43.349 --> 02:29:43.359 align:start position:0%
the tax rate so that is another area
 
02:29:45.830 --> 02:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
that we are concerned with because we're
 
02:29:48.550 --> 02:29:48.560 align:start position:0%
not sure the legislation
 
02:29:51.110 --> 02:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
addresses how the tax rate could be set
 
02:29:51.120 --> 02:29:52.070 align:start position:0%
addresses how the tax rate could be set
um

02:29:52.070 --> 02:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:29:54.150 --> 02:29:54.160 align:start position:0%
as the bill is currently written
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
and i will end my testimony and take any
 
02:29:57.830 --> 02:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
questions that you might have at this
 
02:30:02.150 --> 02:30:02.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:03.750 --> 02:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
02:30:06.150 --> 02:30:06.160 align:start position:0%
testimony oh i'm sorry uh representative
 
02:30:07.910 --> 02:30:07.920 align:start position:0%
powell i didn't see you thank you mr
 
02:30:09.190 --> 02:30:09.200 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
02:30:09.200 --> 02:30:10.150 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

02:30:10.150 --> 02:30:10.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:12.630 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:30:12.630 --> 02:30:12.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:14.309 --> 02:30:14.319 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to formulate this
 
02:30:16.230 --> 02:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
question here on the fly
 
02:30:19.270 --> 02:30:19.280 align:start position:0%
so it's with reference to um you had
 
02:30:22.630 --> 02:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
touched upon these cumulative tax
 
02:30:26.230 --> 02:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
credits and exemptions so to be clear
 
02:30:27.990 --> 02:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
is it true that
 
02:30:31.429 --> 02:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
the qualifications are clearly specified
 
02:30:35.190 --> 02:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
the criteria in statute and in fact it
 
02:30:37.990 --> 02:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
not it would not be up to the
 
02:30:40.710 --> 02:30:40.720 align:start position:0%
discretion of a tax collector or a town
 
02:30:44.790 --> 02:30:44.800 align:start position:0%
official to grant that apart from the
 
02:30:48.230 --> 02:30:48.240 align:start position:0%
clearly defined criteria in statute
 
02:30:50.710 --> 02:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
correct the statute determines who is
 
02:30:54.550 --> 02:30:54.560 align:start position:0%
eligible for an exemption
 
02:30:57.910 --> 02:30:57.920 align:start position:0%
follow-up yes go ahead please
 
02:31:00.870 --> 02:31:00.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair so therefore unless a
 
02:31:03.270 --> 02:31:03.280 align:start position:0%
particular tax credit or exemption
 
02:31:05.429 --> 02:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
specifically says that
 
02:31:07.429 --> 02:31:07.439 align:start position:0%
it's it's limiting and there's language
 
02:31:09.670 --> 02:31:09.680 align:start position:0%
within it um
 
02:31:11.990 --> 02:31:12.000 align:start position:0%
that these could in fact such tax
 
02:31:14.230 --> 02:31:14.240 align:start position:0%
credits could and and our exemptions
 
02:31:16.710 --> 02:31:16.720 align:start position:0%
could be cumulative cumulative
 
02:31:18.550 --> 02:31:18.560 align:start position:0%
um that is my understanding and that
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
a question uh
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:33.910 --> 02:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
i'll say refund or elimination
 
02:31:36.230 --> 02:31:36.240 align:start position:0%
are you are you aware of any communities
 
02:31:40.710 --> 02:31:40.720 align:start position:0%
that now have people in of this age
 
02:31:42.630 --> 02:31:42.640 align:start position:0%
and tax situation where they pay no
 
02:31:44.550 --> 02:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
taxes to the community
 
02:31:47.990 --> 02:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
i am not aware of such a situation
 
02:31:51.910 --> 02:31:51.920 align:start position:0%
is there any further questions yes
 
02:31:53.349 --> 02:31:53.359 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a roundabout way to
 
02:31:55.510 --> 02:31:55.520 align:start position:0%
answer your question would you believe
 
02:31:58.469 --> 02:31:58.479 align:start position:0%
that nashua has over 300
 
02:32:00.550 --> 02:32:00.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers that are not paying any taxes
 
02:32:03.830 --> 02:32:03.840 align:start position:0%
due to elderly tax exemptions
 
02:32:08.230 --> 02:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:08.240 --> 02:32:09.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:32:11.910 --> 02:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
seeing no further uh
 
02:32:13.510 --> 02:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
02:32:15.510 --> 02:32:15.520 align:start position:0%
i'm going to close the hearing
 
02:32:16.870 --> 02:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
on uh
 
02:32:16.880 --> 02:32:18.630 align:start position:0%
on uh

02:32:32.469 --> 02:32:32.479 align:start position:0%
but we're gonna
 
02:32:35.990 --> 02:32:36.000 align:start position:0%
go on to hb 1184 which is the author is
 
02:32:37.830 --> 02:32:37.840 align:start position:0%
authorizing the establishment of
 
02:32:43.830 --> 02:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative lyon are you going to
 
02:32:47.110 --> 02:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
introduce this bill i am the prime
 
02:32:48.710 --> 02:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
sponsors over in judiciary and
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
apparently they're trying to exact like
 
02:32:52.389 --> 02:32:52.399 align:start position:0%
40 bills or something so yes he asked me
 
02:32:54.230 --> 02:32:54.240 align:start position:0%
to come over and introduce
 
02:32:56.389 --> 02:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you your floor is yours thank
 
02:32:57.910 --> 02:32:57.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chair thank you members of the
 
02:32:59.670 --> 02:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
committee um
 
02:33:01.990 --> 02:33:02.000 align:start position:0%
the bill's pretty straightforward um and
 
02:33:03.830 --> 02:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
i'll give you a it's a little broader
 
02:33:05.510 --> 02:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
than actually we intended when we did
 
02:33:07.670 --> 02:33:07.680 align:start position:0%
this film this bill came out of the idea
 
02:33:09.910 --> 02:33:09.920 align:start position:0%
of if you have most of your towns you
 
02:33:12.150 --> 02:33:12.160 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of police a lot of towns
 
02:33:14.630 --> 02:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
have established revolving funds around
 
02:33:17.190 --> 02:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
police details um where
 
02:33:19.510 --> 02:33:19.520 align:start position:0%
um a fixed amount of money is put into a
 
02:33:21.670 --> 02:33:21.680 align:start position:0%
to a to kick off the account and then
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
after that all the revenues received are
 
02:33:24.870 --> 02:33:24.880 align:start position:0%
put into that account all the
 
02:33:26.309 --> 02:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
expenditures are taken out of that
 
02:33:28.710 --> 02:33:28.720 align:start position:0%
account and then any net profits for
 
02:33:30.550 --> 02:33:30.560 align:start position:0%
lack of a better phrase are used to buy
 
02:33:32.230 --> 02:33:32.240 align:start position:0%
police equipment
 
02:33:33.190 --> 02:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
you know
 
02:33:35.590 --> 02:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
vests and guns and ammunition and all
 
02:33:37.270 --> 02:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
the tools they need
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
um we found out counties can't do that
 
02:33:42.550 --> 02:33:42.560 align:start position:0%
um that apparently we're not actually
 
02:33:44.230 --> 02:33:44.240 align:start position:0%
there's no legislative authority to
 
02:33:46.150 --> 02:33:46.160 align:start position:0%
create a revolving fund you keep capital
 
02:33:48.070 --> 02:33:48.080 align:start position:0%
funds but you can't create a revolving
 
02:33:49.270 --> 02:33:49.280 align:start position:0%
fund like this
 
02:33:51.510 --> 02:33:51.520 align:start position:0%
and so we wanted to do that because in
 
02:33:53.349 --> 02:33:53.359 align:start position:0%
belknap county which i apologize the
 
02:33:55.990 --> 02:33:56.000 align:start position:0%
craziness of belknap county again but um
 
02:33:58.710 --> 02:33:58.720 align:start position:0%
again in belknap county we allot 20
 
02:33:59.830 --> 02:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to our sheriff's
 
02:34:01.110 --> 02:34:01.120 align:start position:0%
department for the purposes of police
 
02:34:03.750 --> 02:34:03.760 align:start position:0%
details and when he runs out of that
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
money he can no longer do police details
 
02:34:08.070 --> 02:34:08.080 align:start position:0%
all of officers just don't apply and
 
02:34:09.910 --> 02:34:09.920 align:start position:0%
work in other towns and road details and
 
02:34:10.790 --> 02:34:10.800 align:start position:0%
all of that kind of thing because
 
02:34:12.469 --> 02:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
there's no more money in the line item
 
02:34:13.349 --> 02:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
for it
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
and so when we went to try to fix that
 
02:34:17.270 --> 02:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
this is what we found was we needed to
 
02:34:18.950 --> 02:34:18.960 align:start position:0%
create a revolving fund another county
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
creating a revolving fund to allow that
 
02:34:24.230 --> 02:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
to happen the drafters at ols realized
 
02:34:26.790 --> 02:34:26.800 align:start position:0%
that the language was also missing in
 
02:34:29.590 --> 02:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
city funds and i think it's village
 
02:34:31.510 --> 02:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
districts and so they tried to keep
 
02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
everything uniform where towns it's
 
02:34:35.110 --> 02:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
allowed it wasn't allowed in those other
 
02:34:37.270 --> 02:34:37.280 align:start position:0%
areas so they wrote one bigger bill to
 
02:34:39.349 --> 02:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
include so all political entities could
 
02:34:41.190 --> 02:34:41.200 align:start position:0%
create revolving funds
 
02:34:43.110 --> 02:34:43.120 align:start position:0%
so in short that's the bill
 
02:34:44.790 --> 02:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
they use the same exact language that's
 
02:34:46.070 --> 02:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
in the town
 
02:34:49.030 --> 02:34:49.040 align:start position:0%
statutes i think it's a 35 chapter
 
02:34:50.790 --> 02:34:50.800 align:start position:0%
to create the county
 
02:34:52.870 --> 02:34:52.880 align:start position:0%
village district and city language as
 
02:34:52.880 --> 02:34:54.469 align:start position:0%
village district and city language as
well

02:34:54.469 --> 02:34:54.479 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:34:56.070 --> 02:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
the way the fund works if you have if
 
02:34:57.590 --> 02:34:57.600 align:start position:0%
you're not familiar with the towns is
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
that it would be a vote of the governing
 
02:35:01.750 --> 02:35:01.760 align:start position:0%
body to establish the fund in that vote
 
02:35:03.510 --> 02:35:03.520 align:start position:0%
and in that motion would have to be the
 
02:35:05.750 --> 02:35:05.760 align:start position:0%
purpose of the fund and also the
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
expending authority for that fund so
 
02:35:10.389 --> 02:35:10.399 align:start position:0%
most cases in towns it's the selectmen
 
02:35:12.469 --> 02:35:12.479 align:start position:0%
in this case it leaves it to be it could
 
02:35:14.389 --> 02:35:14.399 align:start position:0%
be the delegation but it also more than
 
02:35:15.910 --> 02:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
likely will be the county commissioners
 
02:35:17.990 --> 02:35:18.000 align:start position:0%
in this case will be uh what the motion
 
02:35:19.429 --> 02:35:19.439 align:start position:0%
would look like so
 
02:35:22.309 --> 02:35:22.319 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any questions
 
02:35:23.910 --> 02:35:23.920 align:start position:0%
but again that's kind of the basic of
 
02:35:25.429 --> 02:35:25.439 align:start position:0%
the bill it's more of a housekeeping
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
cleanup bill to put all those political
 
02:35:29.670 --> 02:35:29.680 align:start position:0%
subdivisions on equal footing and again
 
02:35:31.190 --> 02:35:31.200 align:start position:0%
to take care of this particular need
 
02:35:33.030 --> 02:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
that we found out in counties that we
 
02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:34.640 align:start position:0%
can create a revolving fund for police
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
details and let them basically be
 
02:35:37.750 --> 02:35:37.760 align:start position:0%
self-funding for their some of their
 
02:35:37.760 --> 02:35:40.870 align:start position:0%
self-funding for their some of their
equipment

02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
is is it your experience that
 
02:35:45.590 --> 02:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
these police details
 
02:35:48.150 --> 02:35:48.160 align:start position:0%
pay for themselves
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the amount of money
 
02:35:51.349 --> 02:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
collected from
 
02:35:52.550 --> 02:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
from the
 
02:35:54.870 --> 02:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
most often construction site or the
 
02:35:57.110 --> 02:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
whatever the details for
 
02:35:58.469 --> 02:35:58.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question mr chair so
 
02:36:01.349 --> 02:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
yes it's my my understanding is i'm i'm
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
a retired i'm not retired i'm a former
 
02:36:04.870 --> 02:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
police officer spent over a decade on
 
02:36:06.309 --> 02:36:06.319 align:start position:0%
the job i took all my money out into
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
computers and made a lot more money but
 
02:36:11.349 --> 02:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
when i was a police officer these these
 
02:36:12.950 --> 02:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
uh the fees that they're charged are
 
02:36:14.309 --> 02:36:14.319 align:start position:0%
always looked at to make sure that
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're not costing the municipalities
 
02:36:17.670 --> 02:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
money but they're either breaking even
 
02:36:19.750 --> 02:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
or making a slight profit
 
02:36:21.910 --> 02:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
and so in the case of sanderton my town
 
02:36:24.309 --> 02:36:24.319 align:start position:0%
where i'm the town moderator um ours has
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
been we've been able to pay for police
 
02:36:28.630 --> 02:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
improvement so again replacing
 
02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
bulletproof vests replacing safety
 
02:36:32.150 --> 02:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
equipment and cruisers and those kind of
 
02:36:32.160 --> 02:36:33.190 align:start position:0%
equipment and cruisers and those kind of
things

02:36:33.190 --> 02:36:33.200 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:36:34.630 --> 02:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
and we've been able to use what little
 
02:36:36.710 --> 02:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
bit of overage that shows up in these
 
02:36:38.550 --> 02:36:38.560 align:start position:0%
funds to be able to pay for that and not
 
02:36:40.550 --> 02:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
affect the taxpayer directly any other
 
02:36:43.670 --> 02:36:43.680 align:start position:0%
questions for representative lang yes
 
02:36:45.110 --> 02:36:45.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:36:46.469 --> 02:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking my
 
02:36:46.479 --> 02:36:47.670 align:start position:0%
representative lang for taking my
question

02:36:47.670 --> 02:36:47.680 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
what's the difference between a
 
02:36:51.429 --> 02:36:51.439 align:start position:0%
revolving fund and a capital reserve
 
02:36:51.439 --> 02:36:52.550 align:start position:0%
revolving fund and a capital reserve
fund

02:36:52.550 --> 02:36:52.560 align:start position:0%
fund
 
02:36:54.389 --> 02:36:54.399 align:start position:0%
so the my understanding when i read the
 
02:36:56.150 --> 02:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
chapter was that a capital reserve fund
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
is usually used for building and
 
02:37:00.389 --> 02:37:00.399 align:start position:0%
facilities whereas a revolving fund is
 
02:37:02.630 --> 02:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
can be used for other purposes okay
 
02:37:02.640 --> 02:37:04.309 align:start position:0%
can be used for other purposes okay
follow-up

02:37:04.309 --> 02:37:04.319 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:37:07.270 --> 02:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
um where i'm from merrimack um our town
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
operates most of our budget is like 22
 
02:37:11.590 --> 02:37:11.600 align:start position:0%
capital reserve funds
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
and um we like that because it keeps our
 
02:37:16.630 --> 02:37:16.640 align:start position:0%
tax rate stable but every year when we
 
02:37:19.670 --> 02:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
go to um when we have town meeting we
 
02:37:22.870 --> 02:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
have to approve any money going into it
 
02:37:24.790 --> 02:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
and would that be the same be true with
 
02:37:27.270 --> 02:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
the revolving funds it would not because
 
02:37:28.710 --> 02:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
we're not actually so in the difference
 
02:37:30.150 --> 02:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
between capital reserve funds most time
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
using taxpayer dollars to fund it either
 
02:37:34.070 --> 02:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
through an unexpended fund balance is
 
02:37:36.389 --> 02:37:36.399 align:start position:0%
usually where it comes from
 
02:37:38.469 --> 02:37:38.479 align:start position:0%
whereas this is not using taxpayer
 
02:37:40.150 --> 02:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
dollars so once the funds established
 
02:37:41.429 --> 02:37:41.439 align:start position:0%
the money coming in would come from the
 
02:37:42.790 --> 02:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
details the money going out would be
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
going to the police officers and so
 
02:37:47.190 --> 02:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
there's no tax dollar expenditure oh
 
02:37:48.870 --> 02:37:48.880 align:start position:0%
okay so revolving funds are only funded
 
02:37:48.880 --> 02:37:49.830 align:start position:0%
okay so revolving funds are only funded
through

02:37:49.830 --> 02:37:49.840 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:37:52.309 --> 02:37:52.319 align:start position:0%
um non-tax revenue correct okay thank
 
02:37:55.990 --> 02:37:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:58.309 --> 02:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
can you give me some sense of what that
 
02:38:01.590 --> 02:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
non-tax revenue might be
 
02:38:04.389 --> 02:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
so again i i looking at belknap county
 
02:38:06.230 --> 02:38:06.240 align:start position:0%
and again that's the representative i
 
02:38:07.510 --> 02:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
have is is
 
02:38:09.990 --> 02:38:10.000 align:start position:0%
the reference i have um belknap county
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
we we put twenty thousand dollars into
 
02:38:13.990 --> 02:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
our we annually budget twenty thousand
 
02:38:16.070 --> 02:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
dollars which does come from tax dollars
 
02:38:18.469 --> 02:38:18.479 align:start position:0%
uh into the police reserve fund and we i
 
02:38:19.990 --> 02:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
think the number last time we got back
 
02:38:23.910 --> 02:38:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:25.190 --> 02:38:25.200 align:start position:0%
through the various because it also
 
02:38:27.590 --> 02:38:27.600 align:start position:0%
depends on the detail so some are paid
 
02:38:29.349 --> 02:38:29.359 align:start position:0%
more than other details so it's it's
 
02:38:31.510 --> 02:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's not a flat number we can is
 
02:38:31.520 --> 02:38:33.190 align:start position:0%
it's not a flat number we can is
representative

02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:38:35.190 --> 02:38:35.200 align:start position:0%
is it true that what you're talking
 
02:38:38.070 --> 02:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
about i see some confused faces
 
02:38:39.910 --> 02:38:39.920 align:start position:0%
difference between
 
02:38:44.630 --> 02:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:47.030 --> 02:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
so right so the difference is again so
 
02:38:48.630 --> 02:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
on the on the revenue side is what we
 
02:38:50.790 --> 02:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
take in so i'll use again belknap county
 
02:38:52.389 --> 02:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
we have bank of new hampshire pavilion
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
which hires a lot of police officers
 
02:38:55.429 --> 02:38:55.439 align:start position:0%
during the summer for their concerts to
 
02:38:57.030 --> 02:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
be able to maintain security that's an
 
02:38:59.750 --> 02:38:59.760 align:start position:0%
outside considered an outside detail and
 
02:39:02.150 --> 02:39:02.160 align:start position:0%
the various the town of guilford manages
 
02:39:04.870 --> 02:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
it and they they put money in but
 
02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
again the way it weirdly works is that
 
02:39:08.950 --> 02:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
in this case is that the town of
 
02:39:10.550 --> 02:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
guilford manages it
 
02:39:12.469 --> 02:39:12.479 align:start position:0%
we pay the bank of new hampshire pays
 
02:39:14.550 --> 02:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
the town of guilford who then pays the
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
police officers
 
02:39:19.030 --> 02:39:19.040 align:start position:0%
but the the county pays the police
 
02:39:21.429 --> 02:39:21.439 align:start position:0%
officers too so for their hourly rate so
 
02:39:23.030 --> 02:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
to speak they pay first and then later
 
02:39:24.870 --> 02:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
on collect the money so it gets kind of
 
02:39:26.870 --> 02:39:26.880 align:start position:0%
messy and the idea is with this reserve
 
02:39:28.870 --> 02:39:28.880 align:start position:0%
fund it would with this re revolving
 
02:39:31.270 --> 02:39:31.280 align:start position:0%
fund that would not be the case
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions yes representative
 
02:39:36.790 --> 02:39:36.800 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
02:39:39.429 --> 02:39:39.439 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
 
02:39:39.439 --> 02:39:40.309 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question
um

02:39:40.309 --> 02:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:42.150 --> 02:39:42.160 align:start position:0%
once established
 
02:39:42.160 --> 02:39:43.110 align:start position:0%
once established
this

02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:39:46.550 --> 02:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
continues in perpetuity is that your
 
02:39:49.349 --> 02:39:49.359 align:start position:0%
expectation or are you hamstringing the
 
02:39:49.359 --> 02:39:50.950 align:start position:0%
expectation or are you hamstringing the
future

02:39:50.950 --> 02:39:50.960 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:39:52.389 --> 02:39:52.399 align:start position:0%
boards are
 
02:39:53.990 --> 02:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
so again so
 
02:39:55.670 --> 02:39:55.680 align:start position:0%
once the fund is established the idea
 
02:39:57.590 --> 02:39:57.600 align:start position:0%
will be self-sustaining right so the
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
money that comes in from the revenues
 
02:40:01.910 --> 02:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
from the special detail will be higher
 
02:40:03.990 --> 02:40:04.000 align:start position:0%
than the revenue the expenses going out
 
02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:05.439 align:start position:0%
to pay the police officers are working
 
02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:07.359 align:start position:0%
that details so again the idea is it's a
 
02:40:09.030 --> 02:40:09.040 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining fund it'll keep the
 
02:40:10.950 --> 02:40:10.960 align:start position:0%
money coming in we'll pay for the future
 
02:40:12.710 --> 02:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
there'll be a one-time expenditure for
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
the county to be able to start the fund
 
02:40:15.990 --> 02:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
off and then once that's done there'll
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
be no more expenditures from county no
 
02:40:22.070 --> 02:40:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:25.990 --> 02:40:26.000 align:start position:0%
um i'm looking at page 2
 
02:40:28.070 --> 02:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
line 22
 
02:40:30.950 --> 02:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
facilitating transaction relative to
 
02:40:33.269 --> 02:40:33.279 align:start position:0%
group net metering and before that
 
02:40:36.950 --> 02:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
energy conservation so all these
 
02:40:39.190 --> 02:40:39.200 align:start position:0%
different line items
 
02:40:41.349 --> 02:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
are you going to be establishing um is
 
02:40:43.349 --> 02:40:43.359 align:start position:0%
the intent to have different evolving
 
02:40:45.269 --> 02:40:45.279 align:start position:0%
fund for all these
 
02:40:46.389 --> 02:40:46.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question again this
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
was taken from what's allowed by town so
 
02:40:50.070 --> 02:40:50.080 align:start position:0%
they cut and pasted everything that was
 
02:40:51.910 --> 02:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
in towns into all the other political
 
02:40:53.910 --> 02:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so there's uh it was all
 
02:40:55.269 --> 02:40:55.279 align:start position:0%
equal so again
 
02:40:57.429 --> 02:40:57.439 align:start position:0%
um if you were to establish a fund you
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
have to specify the purpose and that's
 
02:41:01.510 --> 02:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
in there so again if you wanted to do
 
02:41:03.750 --> 02:41:03.760 align:start position:0%
one for facilitating transactions
 
02:41:05.670 --> 02:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
relative to group net metering
 
02:41:07.910 --> 02:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed but you would set
 
02:41:09.990 --> 02:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
up a fund specifically for that with its
 
02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
dedicated purpose and its dedicated
 
02:41:13.429 --> 02:41:13.439 align:start position:0%
dedicated persons who are allowed to
 
02:41:16.070 --> 02:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
expend from that fund
 
02:41:17.910 --> 02:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative power
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you for
 
02:41:21.990 --> 02:41:22.000 align:start position:0%
taking my question so i want to be
 
02:41:22.000 --> 02:41:23.269 align:start position:0%
taking my question so i want to be
assured

02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
assured
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
that with regard to these revolving
 
02:41:28.790 --> 02:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
funds no monies shall be raised nor and
 
02:41:32.150 --> 02:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
appropriated by or through taxation so
 
02:41:35.670 --> 02:41:35.680 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at page 2 and line 25 where
 
02:41:37.670 --> 02:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
the language references
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
and any other revenues approved by the
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
legislative body now i understand that
 
02:41:46.150 --> 02:41:46.160 align:start position:0%
that's not taxation that's not monies
 
02:41:48.309 --> 02:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
being raised and appropriated through
 
02:41:51.190 --> 02:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
taxes but could you just clarify
 
02:41:52.950 --> 02:41:52.960 align:start position:0%
some examples of
 
02:41:52.960 --> 02:41:53.750 align:start position:0%
some examples of
what

02:41:53.750 --> 02:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:56.720 align:start position:0%
revenues approved by the legislative
 
02:41:58.550 --> 02:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
body might be
 
02:42:00.710 --> 02:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
no i actually don't think and i think
 
02:42:02.950 --> 02:42:02.960 align:start position:0%
that was a catch-all because um to the
 
02:42:05.030 --> 02:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
other other member before we're speaking
 
02:42:05.040 --> 02:42:06.070 align:start position:0%
other other member before we're speaking
about

02:42:06.070 --> 02:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:42:07.349 --> 02:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
sometimes we don't know all what's going
 
02:42:09.030 --> 02:42:09.040 align:start position:0%
to come up in the future the intention
 
02:42:11.269 --> 02:42:11.279 align:start position:0%
of the bill is that again because you're
 
02:42:13.670 --> 02:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
specifying when you create a fund you
 
02:42:15.510 --> 02:42:15.520 align:start position:0%
have to specify its purpose and you
 
02:42:17.110 --> 02:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
would also specify what the funding
 
02:42:19.110 --> 02:42:19.120 align:start position:0%
sources are that when you create the
 
02:42:21.990 --> 02:42:22.000 align:start position:0%
fund and so i think this is uh
 
02:42:24.230 --> 02:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh i guess if i if i were to look at
 
02:42:26.309 --> 02:42:26.319 align:start position:0%
this and i would use uh representative
 
02:42:26.319 --> 02:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
this and i would use uh representative
manjapudi's

02:42:28.150 --> 02:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
manjapudi's
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
statement about net metering so you may
 
02:42:31.830 --> 02:42:31.840 align:start position:0%
set up some sort of fund where the
 
02:42:33.429 --> 02:42:33.439 align:start position:0%
revenues coming in from that metering
 
02:42:35.429 --> 02:42:35.439 align:start position:0%
might go into a fund that would
 
02:42:35.439 --> 02:42:36.389 align:start position:0%
might go into a fund that would
future

02:42:36.389 --> 02:42:36.399 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:42:38.550 --> 02:42:38.560 align:start position:0%
fund other net metering projects within
 
02:42:40.389 --> 02:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
the county or town or city so rather
 
02:42:41.830 --> 02:42:41.840 align:start position:0%
than having so that it's a
 
02:42:43.510 --> 02:42:43.520 align:start position:0%
self-sustaining fund that allows growth
 
02:42:45.750 --> 02:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
within the community in a in a green
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
energy environment that could be the
 
02:42:49.269 --> 02:42:49.279 align:start position:0%
purpose again it's up to the legislative
 
02:42:51.750 --> 02:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
body to decide that but i think that's
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
the intent of that is to identify what
 
02:42:55.990 --> 02:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
that if there's a revenue source that's
 
02:42:57.510 --> 02:42:57.520 align:start position:0%
directly related to the purpose of the
 
02:42:59.190 --> 02:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
fund that revenue source could be used
 
02:43:01.910 --> 02:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:05.269 --> 02:43:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:06.550 --> 02:43:06.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you for
 
02:43:08.950 --> 02:43:08.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um this may be
 
02:43:11.110 --> 02:43:11.120 align:start position:0%
covered in here but
 
02:43:13.030 --> 02:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
on the wild
 
02:43:15.030 --> 02:43:15.040 align:start position:0%
aspect that a county might have some
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
extra money in a revolving fund could
 
02:43:17.680 --> 02:43:20.389 align:start position:0%
extra money in a revolving fund could
they

02:43:20.389 --> 02:43:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:23.269 --> 02:43:23.279 align:start position:0%
donate that to a town's revolving fund
 
02:43:25.670 --> 02:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
for the same purpose of
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
like an ambulance service from the
 
02:43:28.950 --> 02:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
county and the town
 
02:43:31.590 --> 02:43:31.600 align:start position:0%
so again i i i didn't hear all of your
 
02:43:32.630 --> 02:43:32.640 align:start position:0%
question you're a little too far from
 
02:43:34.070 --> 02:43:34.080 align:start position:0%
the mic so i couldn't hear you but if i
 
02:43:35.349 --> 02:43:35.359 align:start position:0%
understood your question about ambulance
 
02:43:37.750 --> 02:43:37.760 align:start position:0%
funds or donating money so again you
 
02:43:40.070 --> 02:43:40.080 align:start position:0%
could uh create a fund that would allow
 
02:43:41.830 --> 02:43:41.840 align:start position:0%
for donations again if that was one of
 
02:43:44.150 --> 02:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
your someone wanted some citizen one to
 
02:43:46.389 --> 02:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
donate money towards an ambulance again
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
my town also has an ambulance fund we
 
02:43:49.750 --> 02:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
use the ambulance billing process to
 
02:43:51.269 --> 02:43:51.279 align:start position:0%
keep that fund so we can pay for our
 
02:43:54.150 --> 02:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
next ambulance when we need it um so you
 
02:43:56.070 --> 02:43:56.080 align:start position:0%
could in theory do that also
 
02:43:57.269 --> 02:43:57.279 align:start position:0%
i don't know that many counties that
 
02:44:02.070 --> 02:44:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:04.550 --> 02:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
any further questions oh representative
 
02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:06.710 align:start position:0%
any further questions oh representative
tripp

02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
tripp
 
02:44:08.389 --> 02:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
02:44:10.070 --> 02:44:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my it was actually
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a question it's a uh
 
02:44:13.910 --> 02:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
there appears to be some clericals in
 
02:44:15.830 --> 02:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
02:44:19.110 --> 02:44:19.120 align:start position:0%
uh if we go to page two
 
02:44:21.190 --> 02:44:21.200 align:start position:0%
line 27
 
02:44:23.269 --> 02:44:23.279 align:start position:0%
it says shall not be considered part of
 
02:44:26.150 --> 02:44:26.160 align:start position:0%
the county's general surplus
 
02:44:27.830 --> 02:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
should that be uh
 
02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:30.309 align:start position:0%
should that be uh
city

02:44:30.309 --> 02:44:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:31.910 --> 02:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
yes again i think this was a cut and
 
02:44:33.830 --> 02:44:33.840 align:start position:0%
paste that though
 
02:44:35.750 --> 02:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
i'm just pointing out there's some
 
02:44:38.070 --> 02:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
clericals correct uh if you go to page
 
02:44:38.080 --> 02:44:39.910 align:start position:0%
clericals correct uh if you go to page
three

02:44:39.910 --> 02:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
three
 
02:44:42.790 --> 02:44:42.800 align:start position:0%
line 24 it says uh the county general
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
funds again right so it should be
 
02:44:46.070 --> 02:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
village districts so
 
02:44:47.510 --> 02:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
like i said there's some clericals yeah
 
02:44:49.030 --> 02:44:49.040 align:start position:0%
i think there was just an error by the
 
02:44:51.190 --> 02:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
ols and correcting it so it would need
 
02:44:53.190 --> 02:44:53.200 align:start position:0%
an amendment to clear that i'll be
 
02:44:54.389 --> 02:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
honest with you it wasn't our intention
 
02:44:55.910 --> 02:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
to scoop in all these other ones and i'd
 
02:44:57.429 --> 02:44:57.439 align:start position:0%
be completely okay with you removing the
 
02:44:58.870 --> 02:44:58.880 align:start position:0%
city villages and everything else and
 
02:44:59.990 --> 02:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
just make it about the county because
 
02:45:01.190 --> 02:45:01.200 align:start position:0%
that was the intention of this whole
 
02:45:01.200 --> 02:45:04.309 align:start position:0%
that was the intention of this whole
conversation

02:45:04.309 --> 02:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:09.990 --> 02:45:10.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:11.030 --> 02:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you
 
02:45:12.230 --> 02:45:12.240 align:start position:0%
committee members for taking my
 
02:45:12.240 --> 02:45:14.150 align:start position:0%
committee members for taking my
testimony

02:45:14.150 --> 02:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:45:15.429 --> 02:45:15.439 align:start position:0%
and we have
 
02:45:17.670 --> 02:45:17.680 align:start position:0%

02:45:17.680 --> 02:45:18.870 align:start position:0%
some additional testimony on this bill
from

02:45:18.870 --> 02:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
from

catherine

02:45:25.670 --> 02:45:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:27.510 --> 02:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
good morning once again for the record
 
02:45:29.030 --> 02:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
my name is catherine heck from the new
 
02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire municipal association and
 
02:45:32.790 --> 02:45:32.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for allowing me to speak mr
 
02:45:34.710 --> 02:45:34.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and committee members
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
we take no position on this bill as i
 
02:45:39.750 --> 02:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
did speak to the sponsor and the goal of
 
02:45:41.750 --> 02:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
this bill the intent was to allow
 
02:45:44.950 --> 02:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
counties to have the same powers as town
 
02:45:47.910 --> 02:45:47.920 align:start position:0%
cities and village districts we did want
 
02:45:50.389 --> 02:45:50.399 align:start position:0%
to point out um and i did speak to the
 
02:45:52.550 --> 02:45:52.560 align:start position:0%
representative who sponsored the bill
 
02:45:52.560 --> 02:45:53.510 align:start position:0%
representative who sponsored the bill
that

02:45:53.510 --> 02:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:45:55.429 --> 02:45:55.439 align:start position:0%
currently cities under
 
02:45:59.269 --> 02:45:59.279 align:start position:0%
441 do have the powers to open and run
 
02:46:00.950 --> 02:46:00.960 align:start position:0%
and establish
 
02:46:02.469 --> 02:46:02.479 align:start position:0%
these revolving funds because they have
 
02:46:04.070 --> 02:46:04.080 align:start position:0%
the same powers
 
02:46:08.389 --> 02:46:08.399 align:start position:0%
as a town and under rsa 52 1 village
 
02:46:11.510 --> 02:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
districts are allowed to
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
use any provision a town has once
 
02:46:15.990 --> 02:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
they're created to further the purpose
 
02:46:17.830 --> 02:46:17.840 align:start position:0%
for which they're created
 
02:46:17.840 --> 02:46:18.550 align:start position:0%
for which they're created
so

02:46:18.550 --> 02:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:46:21.030 --> 02:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
if they can if they're running a fire
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
safety program they can have it for the
 
02:46:26.630 --> 02:46:26.640 align:start position:0%
fire services for example because it's a
 
02:46:28.710 --> 02:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
specific reason so the law already
 
02:46:31.190 --> 02:46:31.200 align:start position:0%
allows for that and we are concerned
 
02:46:33.910 --> 02:46:33.920 align:start position:0%
that this actually doesn't clarify
 
02:46:33.920 --> 02:46:34.950 align:start position:0%
that this actually doesn't clarify
it

02:46:34.950 --> 02:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:46:36.790 --> 02:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
makes it less clear what the law would
 
02:46:38.550 --> 02:46:38.560 align:start position:0%
be because village districts could
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
interpret that they could expand
 
02:46:43.269 --> 02:46:43.279 align:start position:0%
their ability to open revolving funds
 
02:46:45.110 --> 02:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
for purposes for which they were not
 
02:46:47.349 --> 02:46:47.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily created
 
02:46:51.110 --> 02:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
so towns under rsa 3195-h that is the
 
02:46:52.950 --> 02:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
template in standard language that
 
02:46:55.429 --> 02:46:55.439 align:start position:0%
you're seeing throughout
 
02:46:57.349 --> 02:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
we have asked that the
 
02:47:01.670 --> 02:47:01.680 align:start position:0%
counties review this or we request that
 
02:47:04.389 --> 02:47:04.399 align:start position:0%
the committees because counties do not
 
02:47:06.309 --> 02:47:06.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily perform some of these
 
02:47:06.319 --> 02:47:07.510 align:start position:0%
necessarily perform some of these
functions

02:47:07.510 --> 02:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
functions
 
02:47:09.910 --> 02:47:09.920 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that the legislation and
 
02:47:11.429 --> 02:47:11.439 align:start position:0%
again we don't represent the counties
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
but would need to address
 
02:47:15.590 --> 02:47:15.600 align:start position:0%
items that counties do not currently
 
02:47:15.600 --> 02:47:17.190 align:start position:0%
items that counties do not currently
perform

02:47:17.190 --> 02:47:17.200 align:start position:0%
perform
 
02:47:19.030 --> 02:47:19.040 align:start position:0%
or have the capacity or the legal
 
02:47:20.870 --> 02:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
authority to perform
 
02:47:22.389 --> 02:47:22.399 align:start position:0%
and finally
 
02:47:24.469 --> 02:47:24.479 align:start position:0%
for consistency's sake
 
02:47:26.790 --> 02:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
if the committee wishes to leave the
 
02:47:29.510 --> 02:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
language as it is written for
 
02:47:31.750 --> 02:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
cities and village districts
 
02:47:33.269 --> 02:47:33.279 align:start position:0%
they're giving the
 
02:47:33.279 --> 02:47:34.710 align:start position:0%
they're giving the
commissions

02:47:34.710 --> 02:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
commissions
 
02:47:34.720 --> 02:47:35.510 align:start position:0%
commissions
the

02:47:35.510 --> 02:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:47:37.510 --> 02:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
02:47:39.110 --> 02:47:39.120 align:start position:0%
be the custodians of the fund and
 
02:47:41.349 --> 02:47:41.359 align:start position:0%
typically that's a treasurer's role to
 
02:47:43.590 --> 02:47:43.600 align:start position:0%
be the custodian not the governing body
 
02:47:45.349 --> 02:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
but a treasurer that needs to be
 
02:47:47.349 --> 02:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
separated to be consistent throughout
 
02:47:49.110 --> 02:47:49.120 align:start position:0%
the law
 
02:47:51.190 --> 02:47:51.200 align:start position:0%
and finally there was a question asked
 
02:47:55.590 --> 02:47:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:58.630 --> 02:47:58.640 align:start position:0%
fees and charges and other income
 
02:48:00.469 --> 02:48:00.479 align:start position:0%
the purpose of these
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
types of revolving funds is to have a
 
02:48:06.870 --> 02:48:06.880 align:start position:0%
revolving source for self-funding
 
02:48:08.710 --> 02:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
programs or
 
02:48:10.950 --> 02:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
to offset costs through self-funding as
 
02:48:13.910 --> 02:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
much of a program outside of taxation as
 
02:48:16.630 --> 02:48:16.640 align:start position:0%
possible so the legislative body when
 
02:48:19.830 --> 02:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
they create these funds allows for
 
02:48:22.070 --> 02:48:22.080 align:start position:0%
fees charges and any other income it
 
02:48:24.389 --> 02:48:24.399 align:start position:0%
sees fit during the creation of the fund
 
02:48:26.790 --> 02:48:26.800 align:start position:0%
to go in and recreation is one of the
 
02:48:29.190 --> 02:48:29.200 align:start position:0%
easier examples because if you have a
 
02:48:32.309 --> 02:48:32.319 align:start position:0%
baseball program and you charge 35
 
02:48:34.790 --> 02:48:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that's children can participate
 
02:48:37.429 --> 02:48:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's so it can continue to grow that
 
02:48:38.870 --> 02:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
program and you're not raising and
 
02:48:41.030 --> 02:48:41.040 align:start position:0%
appropriating those dollars in the
 
02:48:41.040 --> 02:48:42.150 align:start position:0%
appropriating those dollars in the
future

02:48:42.150 --> 02:48:42.160 align:start position:0%
future
 
02:48:43.990 --> 02:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
any surpluses in those funds can
 
02:48:46.070 --> 02:48:46.080 align:start position:0%
certainly be used only for the purpose
 
02:48:48.389 --> 02:48:48.399 align:start position:0%
for which the fund was created so they
 
02:48:51.110 --> 02:48:51.120 align:start position:0%
cannot be transferred to for other
 
02:48:52.710 --> 02:48:52.720 align:start position:0%
purposes if that makes sense so
 
02:48:55.670 --> 02:48:55.680 align:start position:0%
recreation cannot buy a fire truck
 
02:48:57.750 --> 02:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense so any surpluses
 
02:48:59.830 --> 02:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
that grow are to sustain the programs
 
02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
for which they were created and that is
 
02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:03.520 align:start position:0%
the design of the funds and i believe
 
02:49:05.190 --> 02:49:05.200 align:start position:0%
that's the intent of the sponsors to
 
02:49:08.150 --> 02:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
allow the county to have the same
 
02:49:11.030 --> 02:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
authority to do so
 
02:49:12.710 --> 02:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
any questions for nhma yes
 
02:49:14.150 --> 02:49:14.160 align:start position:0%
representative tripp
 
02:49:15.830 --> 02:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:49:17.110 --> 02:49:17.120 align:start position:0%
my question
 
02:49:17.120 --> 02:49:18.950 align:start position:0%
my question
uh

02:49:18.950 --> 02:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:49:21.910 --> 02:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
if uh a revolving fund is created for a
 
02:49:24.309 --> 02:49:24.319 align:start position:0%
purpose and that purpose goes away what
 
02:49:26.790 --> 02:49:26.800 align:start position:0%
happens to those funds
 
02:49:28.630 --> 02:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
so that has to be a vote at the town
 
02:49:28.640 --> 02:49:29.590 align:start position:0%
so that has to be a vote at the town
meeting

02:49:29.590 --> 02:49:29.600 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
02:49:32.790 --> 02:49:32.800 align:start position:0%
or by the legislative body to
 
02:49:35.590 --> 02:49:35.600 align:start position:0%
close the fund and repurpose those
 
02:49:38.150 --> 02:49:38.160 align:start position:0%
dollars and it should be still
 
02:49:39.910 --> 02:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
relatively within the intent for which
 
02:49:42.070 --> 02:49:42.080 align:start position:0%
it was created but that's a specific
 
02:49:44.469 --> 02:49:44.479 align:start position:0%
warrant article or vote by a legislative
 
02:49:47.750 --> 02:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
body sir thank you
 
02:49:49.670 --> 02:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
yes mr representative
 
02:49:51.910 --> 02:49:51.920 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chu thank you for taking
 
02:49:54.790 --> 02:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
my question so if a revolving fund is
 
02:49:54.800 --> 02:49:56.150 align:start position:0%
my question so if a revolving fund is
established

02:49:56.150 --> 02:49:56.160 align:start position:0%
established
 
02:49:58.790 --> 02:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
and could it be invested
 
02:49:58.800 --> 02:49:59.670 align:start position:0%
and could it be invested
to

02:49:59.670 --> 02:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:50:02.309 --> 02:50:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know separately to
 
02:50:06.070 --> 02:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
make it a more sustainable fund
 
02:50:08.389 --> 02:50:08.399 align:start position:0%
or does it uh come under
 
02:50:11.429 --> 02:50:11.439 align:start position:0%
other regulations that you know it's uh
 
02:50:13.349 --> 02:50:13.359 align:start position:0%
you mean an out you mean an additional
 
02:50:16.870 --> 02:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
investments um like to gain interest
 
02:50:18.950 --> 02:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
yes it can be in an interest for example
 
02:50:21.510 --> 02:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
it can be in an interest bearing account
 
02:50:23.190 --> 02:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
however it has to use all the prudent
 
02:50:25.030 --> 02:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
investor rules it certainly should never
 
02:50:26.469 --> 02:50:26.479 align:start position:0%
lose any principle i mean there's all
 
02:50:28.230 --> 02:50:28.240 align:start position:0%
sorts of rules that go around that but
 
02:50:30.230 --> 02:50:30.240 align:start position:0%
yes it can be in an interest-bearing
 
02:50:30.240 --> 02:50:31.190 align:start position:0%
yes it can be in an interest-bearing
account

03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
you can't
 
03:35:47.590 --> 03:35:47.600 align:start position:0%
once you're done speaking to the bill
 
03:35:49.990 --> 03:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
you can't continue to advocate for the
 
03:35:50.000 --> 03:35:50.950 align:start position:0%
you can't continue to advocate for the
bill

03:35:50.950 --> 03:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:35:54.229 --> 03:35:54.239 align:start position:0%

uh

03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:36:02.950 --> 03:36:02.960 align:start position:0%
probably the
 
03:36:05.030 --> 03:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
next session but
 
03:36:07.349 --> 03:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
yeah you can't advocate for the bill
 
03:36:08.870 --> 03:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
that's your bill
 
03:36:08.880 --> 03:36:10.229 align:start position:0%
that's your bill
um

03:36:10.229 --> 03:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:12.229 --> 03:36:12.239 align:start position:0%
okay so that that's after i go back to
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
my seat so i can speak to it now then
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
right all right so um
 
03:36:16.640 --> 03:36:17.830 align:start position:0%
right all right so um
so

03:36:17.830 --> 03:36:17.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:20.790 --> 03:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
this bill um is basically
 
03:36:24.229 --> 03:36:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:24.239 --> 03:36:25.750 align:start position:0%
 
requests

03:36:25.750 --> 03:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
requests
 
03:36:25.760 --> 03:36:28.150 align:start position:0%
requests
for

03:36:28.150 --> 03:36:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:30.950 --> 03:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
churches who
 
03:36:33.510 --> 03:36:33.520 align:start position:0%
build housing from being
 
03:36:36.070 --> 03:36:36.080 align:start position:0%

denied on the basis of
parking

03:36:38.229 --> 03:36:38.239 align:start position:0%
parking
 
03:36:41.750 --> 03:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
so it's based off of
 
03:36:41.760 --> 03:36:43.469 align:start position:0%
so it's based off of
ab

03:36:43.469 --> 03:36:43.479 align:start position:0%
ab
 
03:36:45.429 --> 03:36:45.439 align:start position:0%

03:36:49.439 --> 03:36:50.389 align:start position:0%
from 2020 in california
um

03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:52.950 --> 03:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
i i heard about their legislation
 
03:36:56.550 --> 03:36:56.560 align:start position:0%
and thought hey this could actually help
 
03:36:56.560 --> 03:36:58.229 align:start position:0%
and thought hey this could actually help
um

03:36:58.229 --> 03:36:58.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:01.349 --> 03:37:01.359 align:start position:0%
solve some problems that
 
03:37:03.830 --> 03:37:03.840 align:start position:0%
we're having here in new hampshire with
 
03:37:06.630 --> 03:37:06.640 align:start position:0%
housing um so you've heard
 
03:37:08.870 --> 03:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
you've probably all heard of um
 
03:37:11.750 --> 03:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
the term nimby for not my backyard and
 
03:37:13.429 --> 03:37:13.439 align:start position:0%
um some of you have probably also heard
 
03:37:16.790 --> 03:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
of the term embi for yes in my backyard
 
03:37:20.070 --> 03:37:20.080 align:start position:0%
the phrase associated with this is
 
03:37:20.080 --> 03:37:21.190 align:start position:0%
the phrase associated with this is
jagby

03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
jagby
 
03:37:23.590 --> 03:37:23.600 align:start position:0%
yes in god's backyard which i want to
 
03:37:25.190 --> 03:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
make that the title of the bill but oh
 
03:37:26.790 --> 03:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
else won't let me
 
03:37:26.800 --> 03:37:28.389 align:start position:0%
else won't let me
um

03:37:28.389 --> 03:37:28.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:31.030 --> 03:37:31.040 align:start position:0%
so basically one thing
 
03:37:34.070 --> 03:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:36.469 --> 03:37:36.479 align:start position:0%
urban development
 
03:37:36.479 --> 03:37:38.309 align:start position:0%
urban development
advocates

03:37:38.309 --> 03:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
advocates
 
03:37:38.319 --> 03:37:39.990 align:start position:0%
advocates
um

03:37:39.990 --> 03:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:42.389 --> 03:37:42.399 align:start position:0%
dislike is
 
03:37:45.590 --> 03:37:45.600 align:start position:0%
when there's a church with a really
 
03:37:47.269 --> 03:37:47.279 align:start position:0%
large parking lot
 
03:37:47.279 --> 03:37:48.309 align:start position:0%
large parking lot
and

03:37:48.309 --> 03:37:48.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:37:50.950 --> 03:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
it only gets used for
 
03:37:50.960 --> 03:37:52.469 align:start position:0%
it only gets used for
um

03:37:52.469 --> 03:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:54.550 --> 03:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
it only gets used like say once a week
 
03:37:56.469 --> 03:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
if the church only has services once a
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
week and some churches have agreed yeah
 
03:37:59.910 --> 03:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
we should
 
03:38:02.150 --> 03:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
we we might want to turn our parking lot
 
03:38:03.429 --> 03:38:03.439 align:start position:0%
into housing
 
03:38:05.269 --> 03:38:05.279 align:start position:0%
so they go and try to turn their parking
 
03:38:06.790 --> 03:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
lot into housing
 
03:38:06.800 --> 03:38:08.150 align:start position:0%
lot into housing
but

03:38:08.150 --> 03:38:08.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:38:08.160 --> 03:38:09.349 align:start position:0%
but
then

03:38:09.349 --> 03:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:38:15.910 --> 03:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:22.229 --> 03:38:22.239 align:start position:0%
if you look out the window there
 
03:38:23.670 --> 03:38:23.680 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
03:38:26.790 --> 03:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
the sacred heart church
 
03:38:26.800 --> 03:38:27.750 align:start position:0%
the sacred heart church
and

03:38:27.750 --> 03:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:38:29.429 --> 03:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
on pleasant street
 
03:38:29.439 --> 03:38:30.309 align:start position:0%
on pleasant street
that

03:38:30.309 --> 03:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:38:32.710 --> 03:38:32.720 align:start position:0%
used to be a church it was able to get
 
03:38:35.269 --> 03:38:35.279 align:start position:0%
turned into housing
 
03:38:35.279 --> 03:38:36.229 align:start position:0%
turned into housing
because

03:38:36.229 --> 03:38:36.239 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:38:39.189 --> 03:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
the church had completely shut down
 
03:38:40.870 --> 03:38:40.880 align:start position:0%
and just wasn't even being used as a
 
03:38:43.349 --> 03:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
church at all it was sold to
 
03:38:43.359 --> 03:38:44.950 align:start position:0%
church at all it was sold to
um

03:38:44.950 --> 03:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:47.429 --> 03:38:47.439 align:start position:0%
it was sold to someone else
 
03:38:50.710 --> 03:38:50.720 align:start position:0%
and then redeveloped so um
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
none of the usual
 
03:38:54.389 --> 03:38:54.399 align:start position:0%
religious zoning
 
03:38:57.110 --> 03:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
requirements applied anymore however
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
there's some other
 
03:39:03.670 --> 03:39:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:03.680 --> 03:39:06.870 align:start position:0%
 
where

03:39:06.870 --> 03:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.990 --> 03:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
the church hasn't closed entirely
 
03:39:13.189 --> 03:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
it's just got a declining
 
03:39:13.199 --> 03:39:15.030 align:start position:0%
it's just got a declining
congregation

03:39:15.030 --> 03:39:15.040 align:start position:0%
congregation
 
03:39:16.710 --> 03:39:16.720 align:start position:0%
and um
 
03:39:18.950 --> 03:39:18.960 align:start position:0%
they want to continue using
 
03:39:20.950 --> 03:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
their church
 
03:39:23.269 --> 03:39:23.279 align:start position:0%
as a church
 
03:39:23.279 --> 03:39:24.150 align:start position:0%
as a church
while

03:39:24.150 --> 03:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
while
 
03:39:24.160 --> 03:39:25.269 align:start position:0%
while
also

03:39:25.269 --> 03:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
also
 
03:39:27.429 --> 03:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
maybe turning their parking lot into
 
03:39:29.189 --> 03:39:29.199 align:start position:0%
housing or some of the rooms within the
 
03:39:30.870 --> 03:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
church into housing
 
03:39:30.880 --> 03:39:32.710 align:start position:0%
church into housing
um

03:39:32.710 --> 03:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:39:34.229 --> 03:39:34.239 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:39:36.870 --> 03:39:36.880 align:start position:0%
not quite sure if this is a conflict of
 
03:39:39.269 --> 03:39:39.279 align:start position:0%
interest or not but my own my own church
 
03:39:41.990 --> 03:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh wesley united methodist church um
 
03:39:44.550 --> 03:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
runs this program called family
 
03:39:47.189 --> 03:39:47.199 align:start position:0%
promise where um
 
03:39:50.389 --> 03:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
we house homeless people temporarily
 
03:39:52.790 --> 03:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
and want to set up
 
03:39:55.349 --> 03:39:55.359 align:start position:0%
the offices for this program within our
 
03:39:55.359 --> 03:39:56.630 align:start position:0%
the offices for this program within our
church

03:39:56.630 --> 03:39:56.640 align:start position:0%
church
 
03:39:58.309 --> 03:39:58.319 align:start position:0%
i i don't know if that would apply
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
specifically to
 
03:40:02.309 --> 03:40:02.319 align:start position:0%
this case since its offices rather than
 
03:40:05.189 --> 03:40:05.199 align:start position:0%
actual housing itself but
 
03:40:09.429 --> 03:40:09.439 align:start position:0%
just an idea of where i'm coming from
 
03:40:09.439 --> 03:40:11.510 align:start position:0%
just an idea of where i'm coming from
so

03:40:11.510 --> 03:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:40:13.750 --> 03:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
i see this as both a housing issue and a
 
03:40:16.070 --> 03:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
religious freedom issue
 
03:40:16.080 --> 03:40:17.349 align:start position:0%
religious freedom issue
um

03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:19.830 --> 03:40:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know many
 
03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
many religions and dominations see it as
 
03:40:24.550 --> 03:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
part of their calling
 
03:40:24.560 --> 03:40:26.229 align:start position:0%
part of their calling
to

03:40:26.229 --> 03:40:26.239 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:40:28.070 --> 03:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
help our
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
unhoused neighbors
 
03:40:32.790 --> 03:40:32.800 align:start position:0%
and i believe that we should be making
 
03:40:35.269 --> 03:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
it easier for them to do so
 
03:40:37.030 --> 03:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
rather than putting
 
03:40:37.040 --> 03:40:37.990 align:start position:0%
rather than putting
um

03:40:37.990 --> 03:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:40:39.990 --> 03:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
putting additional
 
03:40:40.000 --> 03:40:41.189 align:start position:0%
putting additional
requirements

03:40:41.189 --> 03:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:40:42.389 --> 03:40:42.399 align:start position:0%
on them
 
03:40:45.510 --> 03:40:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
um as for the specific language
 
03:40:51.590 --> 03:40:51.600 align:start position:0%
in the bill um
 
03:40:54.229 --> 03:40:54.239 align:start position:0%
yeah that's all
 
03:40:57.269 --> 03:40:57.279 align:start position:0%
basically i just asked ols to
 
03:40:57.279 --> 03:40:58.630 align:start position:0%
basically i just asked ols to
adapt

03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
adapt
 
03:40:58.640 --> 03:41:00.790 align:start position:0%
adapt
ab-1851

03:41:00.790 --> 03:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
ab-1851
 
03:41:02.469 --> 03:41:02.479 align:start position:0%
for me for
 
03:41:05.590 --> 03:41:05.600 align:start position:0%
the purposes of new hampshire law
 
03:41:05.600 --> 03:41:08.790 align:start position:0%
the purposes of new hampshire law
so

03:41:08.790 --> 03:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:13.110 --> 03:41:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:15.750 --> 03:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
planning boards from
 
03:41:19.510 --> 03:41:19.520 align:start position:0%
requiring that's where they got um
 
03:41:24.469 --> 03:41:24.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:24.479 --> 03:41:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:41:26.309 --> 03:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:41:29.670 --> 03:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
um i'm aware um
 
03:41:33.189 --> 03:41:33.199 align:start position:0%
there may be some objections about
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
local control um
 
03:41:37.590 --> 03:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
about since
 
03:41:40.229 --> 03:41:40.239 align:start position:0%
it prevents planning boards from being
 
03:41:43.510 --> 03:41:43.520 align:start position:0%
allowed to
 
03:41:43.520 --> 03:41:44.710 align:start position:0%
allowed to
prevent

03:41:44.710 --> 03:41:44.720 align:start position:0%
prevent
 
03:41:47.670 --> 03:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
it prevents playing boards
 
03:41:50.229 --> 03:41:50.239 align:start position:0%
from being allowed to make requirements
 
03:41:51.750 --> 03:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
for things
 
03:41:55.590 --> 03:41:55.600 align:start position:0%
but um i see it as
 
03:41:55.600 --> 03:41:56.950 align:start position:0%
but um i see it as
um

03:41:56.950 --> 03:41:56.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:59.750 --> 03:41:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:01.110 --> 03:42:01.120 align:start position:0%
make making
 
03:42:03.510 --> 03:42:03.520 align:start position:0%
an attempt to make local control
 
03:42:05.510 --> 03:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
even more local moving it from the
 
03:42:07.189 --> 03:42:07.199 align:start position:0%
municipal level to
 
03:42:10.710 --> 03:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
the congregation level um
 
03:42:10.720 --> 03:42:12.630 align:start position:0%
the congregation level um
so

03:42:12.630 --> 03:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:42:15.110 --> 03:42:15.120 align:start position:0%
and also
 
03:42:17.110 --> 03:42:17.120 align:start position:0%
so why focus on
 
03:42:19.670 --> 03:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
parking requirements specifically
 
03:42:21.910 --> 03:42:21.920 align:start position:0%
as opposed to other zoning requirements
 
03:42:24.550 --> 03:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
that might come into play for housing
 
03:42:28.070 --> 03:42:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:29.269 --> 03:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
so par
 
03:42:29.279 --> 03:42:32.710 align:start position:0%
so par
parking

03:42:32.710 --> 03:42:32.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:34.630 --> 03:42:34.640 align:start position:0%
one thing about
 
03:42:37.990 --> 03:42:38.000 align:start position:0%
parking is it contributes to
 
03:42:38.000 --> 03:42:39.269 align:start position:0%
parking is it contributes to
the

03:42:39.269 --> 03:42:39.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:42:42.469 --> 03:42:42.479 align:start position:0%
pervasive car culture that
 
03:42:44.550 --> 03:42:44.560 align:start position:0%
our state has i i don't have a car
 
03:42:48.070 --> 03:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:50.070 --> 03:42:50.080 align:start position:0%
it's often
 
03:42:51.750 --> 03:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
just the general assumption that
 
03:42:53.910 --> 03:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
everyone has a car
 
03:42:53.920 --> 03:42:54.870 align:start position:0%
everyone has a car
and

03:42:54.870 --> 03:42:54.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:56.309 --> 03:42:56.319 align:start position:0%
that um
 
03:42:58.550 --> 03:42:58.560 align:start position:0%
and everyone should have a car that
 
03:43:01.030 --> 03:43:01.040 align:start position:0%
gets reinforced by having parking
 
03:43:03.269 --> 03:43:03.279 align:start position:0%
requirements for things
 
03:43:03.279 --> 03:43:04.830 align:start position:0%
requirements for things
um

03:43:04.830 --> 03:43:04.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:07.349 --> 03:43:07.359 align:start position:0%
and it
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't and
 
03:43:10.389 --> 03:43:10.399 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really
 
03:43:12.550 --> 03:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
do much for
 
03:43:14.389 --> 03:43:14.399 align:start position:0%
those of us who are either
 
03:43:18.070 --> 03:43:18.080 align:start position:0%
too poor to afford a car or object to
 
03:43:20.870 --> 03:43:20.880 align:start position:0%
car ownership based on moral or
 
03:43:24.229 --> 03:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:26.389 --> 03:43:26.399 align:start position:0%
so i think
 
03:43:28.469 --> 03:43:28.479 align:start position:0%
it would be better to use
 
03:43:30.150 --> 03:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
parking spaces for housing people
 
03:43:30.160 --> 03:43:31.349 align:start position:0%
parking spaces for housing people
instead

03:43:31.349 --> 03:43:31.359 align:start position:0%
instead
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
03:43:38.710 --> 03:43:38.720 align:start position:0%
why i propose this legislation and
 
03:43:40.950 --> 03:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
i'll take any questions
 
03:43:43.030 --> 03:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
 
03:43:43.040 --> 03:43:45.110 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yes
representative

03:43:45.110 --> 03:43:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:43:49.189 --> 03:43:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for taking my
 
03:43:52.950 --> 03:43:52.960 align:start position:0%
question i have two questions one is are
 
03:43:52.960 --> 03:43:53.830 align:start position:0%
question i have two questions one is are
you

03:43:53.830 --> 03:43:53.840 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:43:53.840 --> 03:43:54.950 align:start position:0%
you
um

03:43:54.950 --> 03:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:57.429 --> 03:43:57.439 align:start position:0%
would this be transitional housing you
 
03:44:00.469 --> 03:44:00.479 align:start position:0%
talked about people without homes and
 
03:44:01.349 --> 03:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:44:03.590 --> 03:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
or would it be like a
 
03:44:06.150 --> 03:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
residential co-op where
 
03:44:06.160 --> 03:44:07.830 align:start position:0%
residential co-op where
it's

03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:44:12.710 --> 03:44:12.720 align:start position:0%
people who cannot afford on their own
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
to own
 
03:44:16.630 --> 03:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
a home or small and live
 
03:44:21.349 --> 03:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
and walkable community kind of thing so
 
03:44:21.359 --> 03:44:22.389 align:start position:0%
and walkable community kind of thing so
from

03:44:22.389 --> 03:44:22.399 align:start position:0%
from
 
03:44:25.830 --> 03:44:25.840 align:start position:0%
those two which kind of housing are you
 
03:44:27.349 --> 03:44:27.359 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
03:44:29.990 --> 03:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
um i mean i think either would be fine
 
03:44:32.870 --> 03:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
the legislation
 
03:44:35.510 --> 03:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
the legislation doesn't specify one or
 
03:44:36.550 --> 03:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
the other
 
03:44:38.550 --> 03:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
it just says um
 
03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
a developer
 
03:44:42.469 --> 03:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
developers it applies to housing
 
03:44:45.269 --> 03:44:45.279 align:start position:0%
development projects affiliated with a
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
religious institution
 
03:44:50.710 --> 03:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
so i think if
 
03:44:52.389 --> 03:44:52.399 align:start position:0%
a religious institution wants to do
 
03:44:55.510 --> 03:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
either of those ones that it could apply
 
03:44:58.229 --> 03:44:58.239 align:start position:0%
a follow-up minister yes
 
03:45:00.550 --> 03:45:00.560 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
03:45:03.110 --> 03:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
you know a few years ago over a decade
 
03:45:03.120 --> 03:45:04.070 align:start position:0%
you know a few years ago over a decade
ago

03:45:04.070 --> 03:45:04.080 align:start position:0%
ago
 
03:45:05.750 --> 03:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
nashua i was part of the national
 
03:45:07.510 --> 03:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
interfaith council
 
03:45:10.389 --> 03:45:10.399 align:start position:0%
and we had religious
 
03:45:13.510 --> 03:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
organizations churches and
 
03:45:13.520 --> 03:45:14.710 align:start position:0%
organizations churches and
temples

03:45:14.710 --> 03:45:14.720 align:start position:0%
temples
 
03:45:16.790 --> 03:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
hosting a whole
 
03:45:18.790 --> 03:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
group of
 
03:45:21.349 --> 03:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
people with no homes
 
03:45:24.630 --> 03:45:24.640 align:start position:0%
and transitional and they were housed
 
03:45:26.710 --> 03:45:26.720 align:start position:0%
temporarily i mean they could sleep but
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
you know they had to rotate and finally
 
03:45:31.750 --> 03:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
the group
 
03:45:35.830 --> 03:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.070 --> 03:45:38.080 align:start position:0%
school that had
 
03:45:41.590 --> 03:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
convent that had uh open space or the
 
03:45:43.750 --> 03:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
large space which made it a long
 
03:45:46.550 --> 03:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
long-term transitional uh housing which
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
was called the rosemary um
 
03:45:49.920 --> 03:45:51.030 align:start position:0%
was called the rosemary um
house

03:45:51.030 --> 03:45:51.040 align:start position:0%
house
 
03:45:54.229 --> 03:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
which gave extended period not like the
 
03:45:54.239 --> 03:45:55.510 align:start position:0%
which gave extended period not like the
short-term

03:45:55.510 --> 03:45:55.520 align:start position:0%
short-term
 
03:45:59.030 --> 03:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
transitional that helped significant
 
03:46:01.189 --> 03:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
number of families
 
03:46:03.189 --> 03:46:03.199 align:start position:0%
that had children
 
03:46:06.790 --> 03:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
that could stay in a home
 
03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
and could save
 
03:46:09.990 --> 03:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
get a job
 
03:46:13.349 --> 03:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
and move out in two years
 
03:46:15.990 --> 03:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
to have their own place so that kind of
 
03:46:18.389 --> 03:46:18.399 align:start position:0%
gave a good base
 
03:46:22.469 --> 03:46:22.479 align:start position:0%
in um you know nashua and area around
 
03:46:22.479 --> 03:46:23.830 align:start position:0%
in um you know nashua and area around
so

03:46:23.830 --> 03:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:46:26.309 --> 03:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
that you know from that thought process
 
03:46:28.710 --> 03:46:28.720 align:start position:0%
i'm asking if it could be you know at
 
03:46:31.910 --> 03:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
that time because we didn't need the
 
03:46:33.990 --> 03:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
new building it was in the basement of
 
03:46:34.000 --> 03:46:35.349 align:start position:0%
new building it was in the basement of
the

03:46:35.349 --> 03:46:35.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
churches but if this is in building
 
03:46:40.229 --> 03:46:40.239 align:start position:0%
something in a parking lot that would be
 
03:46:42.469 --> 03:46:42.479 align:start position:0%
a more permanent that could
 
03:46:42.479 --> 03:46:44.229 align:start position:0%
a more permanent that could
help

03:46:44.229 --> 03:46:44.239 align:start position:0%
help
 
03:46:46.070 --> 03:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
transition so
 
03:46:47.510 --> 03:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
with that
 
03:46:51.349 --> 03:46:51.359 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's a good example of
 
03:46:51.359 --> 03:46:52.469 align:start position:0%
yeah i think that's a good example of
a

03:46:52.469 --> 03:46:52.479 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:46:54.950 --> 03:46:54.960 align:start position:0%
situation that this legislation could
 
03:46:56.870 --> 03:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
help with
 
03:47:00.790 --> 03:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions yes
 
03:47:00.800 --> 03:47:02.830 align:start position:0%
any other comments or questions yes
representative

03:47:02.830 --> 03:47:02.840 align:start position:0%

taking my question
uh

03:47:07.750 --> 03:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:47:10.550 --> 03:47:10.560 align:start position:0%
i notice in your uh bill that you use
 
03:47:13.030 --> 03:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the phrase religious use
 
03:47:18.070 --> 03:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
uh parking spaces is is that a uh number
 
03:47:18.080 --> 03:47:20.790 align:start position:0%
uh parking spaces is is that a uh number
um

03:47:20.790 --> 03:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:20.800 --> 03:47:24.070 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:47:24.070 --> 03:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:26.790 --> 03:47:26.800 align:start position:0%
the it says the number of religious use
 
03:47:30.790 --> 03:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:32.710 --> 03:47:32.720 align:start position:0%
i mean it's not
 
03:47:34.150 --> 03:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
it's not saying
 
03:47:34.160 --> 03:47:35.189 align:start position:0%
it's not saying
um

03:47:35.189 --> 03:47:35.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
it's not setting like a statewide number
 
03:47:37.439 --> 03:47:39.189 align:start position:0%
it's not setting like a statewide number
that

03:47:39.189 --> 03:47:39.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:41.510 --> 03:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
um religious used parking spaces always
 
03:47:44.830 --> 03:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.349 --> 03:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
restricting what
 
03:47:47.359 --> 03:47:48.790 align:start position:0%
restricting what
criteria

03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
03:47:52.150 --> 03:47:52.160 align:start position:0%
local planning boards can set for
 
03:47:58.950 --> 03:47:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:00.790 --> 03:48:00.800 align:start position:0%
i noticed uh
 
03:48:02.870 --> 03:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
on the uh
 
03:48:05.269 --> 03:48:05.279 align:start position:0%
there's also a uh uh
 
03:48:07.030 --> 03:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
on line twenty it says planning board
 
03:48:09.990 --> 03:48:10.000 align:start position:0%
may require one parking space per unit
 
03:48:10.000 --> 03:48:11.030 align:start position:0%
may require one parking space per unit
uh

03:48:11.030 --> 03:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:48:22.469 --> 03:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:27.510 --> 03:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:28.870 --> 03:48:28.880 align:start position:0%
i think it's
 
03:48:30.469 --> 03:48:30.479 align:start position:0%
an exact
 
03:48:30.479 --> 03:48:34.710 align:start position:0%
an exact
um

03:48:34.710 --> 03:48:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
sn may require exactly one
 
03:48:37.920 --> 03:48:44.229 align:start position:0%
sn may require exactly one
um

03:48:44.229 --> 03:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:48.070 --> 03:48:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:50.150 --> 03:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
i think that's um
 
03:48:52.790 --> 03:48:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:57.349 --> 03:48:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:59.590 --> 03:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
handle the case of the legislation
 
03:48:59.600 --> 03:49:02.550 align:start position:0%
handle the case of the legislation
potentially

03:49:02.550 --> 03:49:02.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:02.560 --> 03:49:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
preventing

03:49:04.790 --> 03:49:04.800 align:start position:0%
preventing
 
03:49:06.389 --> 03:49:06.399 align:start position:0%
preventing planning boards from setting
 
03:49:09.349 --> 03:49:09.359 align:start position:0%
any parking requirements whatsoever
 
03:49:12.229 --> 03:49:12.239 align:start position:0%
i think instead it's just saying okay
 
03:49:15.910 --> 03:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:18.790 --> 03:49:18.800 align:start position:0%
you you can't set a requirement but
 
03:49:21.110 --> 03:49:21.120 align:start position:0%
it can just be this rather than
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
your current full range of requirements
 
03:49:27.269 --> 03:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
that can be set
 
03:49:29.349 --> 03:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:29.359 --> 03:49:30.389 align:start position:0%
thank you
yes

03:49:30.389 --> 03:49:30.399 align:start position:0%

yes

thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:49:36.830 --> 03:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for taking my
 
03:49:39.429 --> 03:49:39.439 align:start position:0%
question it's kind of an ill-formed
 
03:49:43.750 --> 03:49:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
do you anticipate or do you know of any
 
03:49:49.670 --> 03:49:49.680 align:start position:0%
religious organizations that have
 
03:49:49.680 --> 03:49:50.950 align:start position:0%
religious organizations that have
created

03:49:50.950 --> 03:49:50.960 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:49:53.189 --> 03:49:53.199 align:start position:0%
these kinds of housing
 
03:49:53.199 --> 03:49:54.950 align:start position:0%
these kinds of housing
developments

03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
developments
 
03:49:57.670 --> 03:49:57.680 align:start position:0%
and have those religious organizations
 
03:50:00.389 --> 03:50:00.399 align:start position:0%
had to set up a separate
 
03:50:03.349 --> 03:50:03.359 align:start position:0%
corporate entity to do so in other words
 
03:50:05.189 --> 03:50:05.199 align:start position:0%
could they no longer enjoy their
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
tax-exempt status
 
03:50:11.030 --> 03:50:11.040 align:start position:0%
if they became landlords or developers
 
03:50:13.429 --> 03:50:13.439 align:start position:0%
and and my and my
 
03:50:15.670 --> 03:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up question is
 
03:50:18.469 --> 03:50:18.479 align:start position:0%
can you anticipate any
 
03:50:18.479 --> 03:50:19.349 align:start position:0%
can you anticipate any
um

03:50:19.349 --> 03:50:19.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:21.510 --> 03:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
any objections by
 
03:50:23.990 --> 03:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
commercial developers who might claim
 
03:50:27.030 --> 03:50:27.040 align:start position:0%
that religious institutions were giving
 
03:50:29.590 --> 03:50:29.600 align:start position:0%
uh were being given an unfair advantage
 
03:50:35.510 --> 03:50:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:35.520 --> 03:50:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:50:37.910 --> 03:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:37.920 --> 03:50:41.750 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:50:41.750 --> 03:50:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:50:45.269 --> 03:50:45.279 align:start position:0%
um well as for the first question
 
03:50:45.279 --> 03:50:47.110 align:start position:0%
um well as for the first question
um

03:50:47.110 --> 03:50:47.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:48.630 --> 03:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
well this
 
03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
this uh the california legislation that
 
03:50:54.630 --> 03:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
this is based on has only been law for
 
03:50:54.640 --> 03:50:56.150 align:start position:0%
this is based on has only been law for
um

03:50:56.150 --> 03:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:56.160 --> 03:50:57.269 align:start position:0%
um
for

03:50:57.269 --> 03:50:57.279 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:50:59.349 --> 03:50:59.359 align:start position:0%
like a year
 
03:51:02.070 --> 03:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
and a few months at this point so i'm
 
03:51:03.830 --> 03:51:03.840 align:start position:0%
not quite
 
03:51:09.429 --> 03:51:09.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:09.439 --> 03:51:11.670 align:start position:0%
 
the

03:51:11.670 --> 03:51:11.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:14.150 --> 03:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
structuring of
 
03:51:17.189 --> 03:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
organizations to build this housing
 
03:51:19.830 --> 03:51:19.840 align:start position:0%
under the terms of legislation there are
 
03:51:19.840 --> 03:51:24.229 align:start position:0%
under the terms of legislation there are
using

03:51:24.229 --> 03:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:24.239 --> 03:51:26.389 align:start position:0%
 
and

03:51:26.389 --> 03:51:26.399 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:51:26.399 --> 03:51:32.150 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:51:32.150 --> 03:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:35.510 --> 03:51:35.520 align:start position:0%
as for the second one um
 
03:51:37.189 --> 03:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
03:51:39.670 --> 03:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
as to whether
 
03:51:39.680 --> 03:51:41.830 align:start position:0%
as to whether
it's

03:51:41.830 --> 03:51:41.840 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:51:41.840 --> 03:51:43.189 align:start position:0%
it's
um

03:51:43.189 --> 03:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
whether it's privileging
 
03:51:47.510 --> 03:51:47.520 align:start position:0%
religious institutions over commercial
 
03:51:49.030 --> 03:51:49.040 align:start position:0%
ones i mean
 
03:51:51.110 --> 03:51:51.120 align:start position:0%
i think so does our constitution it
 
03:51:52.870 --> 03:51:52.880 align:start position:0%
provides the freedom of religion but it
 
03:51:54.469 --> 03:51:54.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide for a freedom of
 
03:51:54.479 --> 03:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide for a freedom of
commerce

03:51:55.670 --> 03:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
commerce
 
03:51:58.389 --> 03:51:58.399 align:start position:0%
so um i think
 
03:52:01.030 --> 03:52:01.040 align:start position:0%
i think it's okay to be um
 
03:52:03.349 --> 03:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
i think it's okay to be preferencing
 
03:52:05.030 --> 03:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
religious institutions over commission
 
03:52:07.269 --> 03:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
commercial ones and
 
03:52:08.630 --> 03:52:08.640 align:start position:0%
that's um
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:13.120 --> 03:52:14.389 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:52:14.389 --> 03:52:14.399 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:52:16.389 --> 03:52:16.399 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
03:52:16.399 --> 03:52:18.630 align:start position:0%
representative um
gilman

03:52:18.630 --> 03:52:18.640 align:start position:0%
gilman
 
03:52:19.990 --> 03:52:20.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you
 
03:52:21.670 --> 03:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for taking my
 
03:52:21.680 --> 03:52:22.710 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for taking my
question

03:52:22.710 --> 03:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:52:22.720 --> 03:52:23.990 align:start position:0%
question
uh

03:52:23.990 --> 03:52:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
i am uh
 
03:52:27.510 --> 03:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
guessing at what
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
religious use parking spaces actually is
 
03:52:33.189 --> 03:52:33.199 align:start position:0%
defined as but i really think the
 
03:52:36.630 --> 03:52:36.640 align:start position:0%
religious institution affiliated housing
 
03:52:37.830 --> 03:52:37.840 align:start position:0%
has some
 
03:52:41.189 --> 03:52:41.199 align:start position:0%
uh opening spaces do you consider that
 
03:52:41.199 --> 03:52:42.550 align:start position:0%
uh opening spaces do you consider that
housing

03:52:42.550 --> 03:52:42.560 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:52:45.910 --> 03:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
uh for people who attend the church
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
on which
 
03:52:52.830 --> 03:52:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:56.550 --> 03:52:56.560 align:start position:0%
um could you rephrase the question
 
03:52:58.790 --> 03:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
um i i just want to know if you're in
 
03:52:58.800 --> 03:52:59.750 align:start position:0%
um i i just want to know if you're in
your

03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:53:02.070 --> 03:53:02.080 align:start position:0%
definition of religious institution
 
03:53:03.910 --> 03:53:03.920 align:start position:0%
affiliated housing
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
if one of the requirements of being
 
03:53:10.710 --> 03:53:10.720 align:start position:0%
uh renting one of those units is that
 
03:53:12.309 --> 03:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
they are a member of that house of
 
03:53:12.319 --> 03:53:13.670 align:start position:0%
they are a member of that house of
worship

03:53:13.670 --> 03:53:13.680 align:start position:0%
worship
 
03:53:16.150 --> 03:53:16.160 align:start position:0%
um i i don't think i don't think they
 
03:53:17.429 --> 03:53:17.439 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:53:17.439 --> 03:53:18.309 align:start position:0%
have to
so

03:53:18.309 --> 03:53:18.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:18.319 --> 03:53:21.670 align:start position:0%
so
um

03:53:21.670 --> 03:53:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:21.680 --> 03:53:22.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

03:53:22.389 --> 03:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:53:23.910 --> 03:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
yeah there's a breakdown between
 
03:53:26.710 --> 03:53:26.720 align:start position:0%
religious used parking spaces um
 
03:53:29.189 --> 03:53:29.199 align:start position:0%
and then other
 
03:53:32.469 --> 03:53:32.479 align:start position:0%
parking spaces so this is about
 
03:53:32.479 --> 03:53:33.990 align:start position:0%
parking spaces so this is about
replacing

03:53:33.990 --> 03:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
replacing
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
the religious use parking spaces with
 
03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
the other type of parking spaces
 
03:53:42.469 --> 03:53:42.479 align:start position:0%
so um
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
my assumption would be that
 
03:53:48.150 --> 03:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:51.030 --> 03:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
the if the um
 
03:53:51.040 --> 03:53:52.229 align:start position:0%
the if the um
religious

03:53:52.229 --> 03:53:52.239 align:start position:0%
religious
 
03:53:55.269 --> 03:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
used parking spaces
 
03:53:58.469 --> 03:53:58.479 align:start position:0%
can't currently be used
 
03:54:01.030 --> 03:54:01.040 align:start position:0%
as parking for housing
 
03:54:01.040 --> 03:54:02.309 align:start position:0%
as parking for housing
then

03:54:02.309 --> 03:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:54:02.319 --> 03:54:03.110 align:start position:0%
then
that

03:54:03.110 --> 03:54:03.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:54:07.110 --> 03:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
this legislation would mean that would
 
03:54:10.389 --> 03:54:10.399 align:start position:0%
remove that requirement and
 
03:54:12.910 --> 03:54:12.920 align:start position:0%
mean that they can be used for housing
 
03:54:15.030 --> 03:54:15.040 align:start position:0%
regardless of
 
03:54:17.189 --> 03:54:17.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not the person in that
 
03:54:20.469 --> 03:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
housing is a member of the
 
03:54:22.630 --> 03:54:22.640 align:start position:0%
institution or not
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
it would just be general purpose
 
03:54:28.630 --> 03:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
parking rather than specifically
 
03:54:33.990 --> 03:54:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:35.990 --> 03:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
i do um
 
03:54:38.710 --> 03:54:38.720 align:start position:0%
have you considered the
 
03:54:41.030 --> 03:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
tax implications of this
 
03:54:44.830 --> 03:54:44.840 align:start position:0%
um because if the housing is on
 
03:54:47.349 --> 03:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
uh non-profit
 
03:54:49.189 --> 03:54:49.199 align:start position:0%
church property
 
03:54:51.510 --> 03:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
then we're not paying any
 
03:54:53.670 --> 03:54:53.680 align:start position:0%
taxes for the
 
03:54:53.680 --> 03:54:57.189 align:start position:0%
taxes for the
living

03:54:57.189 --> 03:54:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:57.199 --> 03:54:58.790 align:start position:0%
 
housing

03:54:58.790 --> 03:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
housing
 
03:55:01.349 --> 03:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
or do they have to divide the lot so
 
03:55:03.670 --> 03:55:03.680 align:start position:0%
that there is the nonprofit church and
 
03:55:06.309 --> 03:55:06.319 align:start position:0%
then the for-profit
 
03:55:08.790 --> 03:55:08.800 align:start position:0%
so this is this legislation is just
 
03:55:08.800 --> 03:55:10.150 align:start position:0%
so this is this legislation is just
about

03:55:10.150 --> 03:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:55:11.429 --> 03:55:11.439 align:start position:0%
the um
 
03:55:14.550 --> 03:55:14.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why a planning board can
 
03:55:18.229 --> 03:55:18.239 align:start position:0%
deny permits for a housing project
 
03:55:21.030 --> 03:55:21.040 align:start position:0%
if a planning board wants to deny
 
03:55:23.030 --> 03:55:23.040 align:start position:0%
a permit for one of these projects based
 
03:55:23.040 --> 03:55:24.229 align:start position:0%
a permit for one of these projects based
on

03:55:24.229 --> 03:55:24.239 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:55:26.309 --> 03:55:26.319 align:start position:0%
tax grounds they can still do that
 
03:55:27.830 --> 03:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
because that's not about parking
 
03:55:27.840 --> 03:55:29.429 align:start position:0%
because that's not about parking
requirements

03:55:29.429 --> 03:55:29.439 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
it's just saying that
 
03:55:33.269 --> 03:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
it can't be
 
03:55:35.670 --> 03:55:35.680 align:start position:0%
it can't be solely due to parking it's
 
03:55:35.680 --> 03:55:38.550 align:start position:0%
it can't be solely due to parking it's
the

03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:42.469 --> 03:55:42.479 align:start position:0%
only thing it's saying here
 
03:55:44.870 --> 03:55:44.880 align:start position:0%
uh representative matthew pony
 
03:55:46.550 --> 03:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair thank you
 
03:55:48.150 --> 03:55:48.160 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for taking
 
03:55:50.550 --> 03:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
another question um i'm just trying to
 
03:55:50.560 --> 03:55:52.309 align:start position:0%
another question um i'm just trying to
clarify

03:55:52.309 --> 03:55:52.319 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
03:55:55.429 --> 03:55:55.439 align:start position:0%
parking lots are parking spaces
 
03:55:58.950 --> 03:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
for a religious um entity is based on
 
03:56:00.229 --> 03:56:00.239 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
03:56:02.630 --> 03:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
uh members in the congregation or
 
03:56:02.640 --> 03:56:03.990 align:start position:0%
uh members in the congregation or
attendance

03:56:03.990 --> 03:56:04.000 align:start position:0%
attendance
 
03:56:06.150 --> 03:56:06.160 align:start position:0%
on an average correct
 
03:56:06.160 --> 03:56:07.189 align:start position:0%
on an average correct
uh

03:56:07.189 --> 03:56:07.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:56:08.950 --> 03:56:08.960 align:start position:0%
i believe so that sounds correct or the
 
03:56:11.670 --> 03:56:11.680 align:start position:0%
capacity of the building that can hold
 
03:56:15.030 --> 03:56:15.040 align:start position:0%
200 whatever and then you have to
 
03:56:16.950 --> 03:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
offer so
 
03:56:21.710 --> 03:56:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:25.349 --> 03:56:25.359 align:start position:0%
addressing to use the parking lot so
 
03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
don't deny
 
03:56:29.750 --> 03:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
construction based i mean construction
 
03:56:34.150 --> 03:56:34.160 align:start position:0%
of housing on the parking lot based on
 
03:56:36.870 --> 03:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
the membership congregation and you also
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
alluded to the fact that dwindling
 
03:56:42.229 --> 03:56:42.239 align:start position:0%
congregation members so the church might
 
03:56:45.189 --> 03:56:45.199 align:start position:0%
have a capacity of 250 but currently
 
03:56:47.429 --> 03:56:47.439 align:start position:0%
only has 100 members
 
03:56:47.439 --> 03:56:48.309 align:start position:0%
only has 100 members
yeah

03:56:48.309 --> 03:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:56:50.950 --> 03:56:50.960 align:start position:0%
is that your intention
 
03:56:54.150 --> 03:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
um yeah i believe that this
 
03:56:57.349 --> 03:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
um addresses that
 
03:57:01.110 --> 03:57:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:04.389 --> 03:57:04.399 align:start position:0%
yes uh representative thank you mr chair
 
03:57:05.670 --> 03:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
03:57:07.670 --> 03:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
question does this bill or do you
 
03:57:09.269 --> 03:57:09.279 align:start position:0%
contemplate with this bill that we were
 
03:57:11.349 --> 03:57:11.359 align:start position:0%
only talking about one
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
lot or are you talking about all of the
 
03:57:13.920 --> 03:57:15.030 align:start position:0%
lot or are you talking about all of the
property

03:57:15.030 --> 03:57:15.040 align:start position:0%
property
 
03:57:17.910 --> 03:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
that is owned contiguous or not
 
03:57:21.189 --> 03:57:21.199 align:start position:0%
by the religious institution
 
03:57:32.830 --> 03:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:32.840 --> 03:57:34.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:57:34.790 --> 03:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:36.710 --> 03:57:36.720 align:start position:0%
so to be honest i'm not really too
 
03:57:39.429 --> 03:57:39.439 align:start position:0%
familiar with how the development
 
03:57:42.389 --> 03:57:42.399 align:start position:0%
process works my assumption would that
 
03:57:45.030 --> 03:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
would be that um
 
03:57:48.309 --> 03:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
it would be that it would just be done
 
03:57:55.429 --> 03:57:55.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:00.150 --> 03:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:02.550 --> 03:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
multi-unit projects
 
03:58:05.910 --> 03:58:05.920 align:start position:0%
in here as well um i'm i'm not sure if
 
03:58:08.309 --> 03:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
you'd like
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
if you'd like
 
03:58:12.309 --> 03:58:12.319 align:start position:0%
there to be language
 
03:58:17.670 --> 03:58:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:17.680 --> 03:58:20.550 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:58:20.550 --> 03:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:22.070 --> 03:58:22.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
03:58:23.750 --> 03:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative gallagher for taking my
 
03:58:26.229 --> 03:58:26.239 align:start position:0%
question are you aware of any religious
 
03:58:28.630 --> 03:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
institutions in new hampshire that are
 
03:58:30.790 --> 03:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
currently exploring
 
03:58:33.429 --> 03:58:33.439 align:start position:0%
having housing on their property
 
03:58:35.349 --> 03:58:35.359 align:start position:0%
and if so if if this has been an
 
03:58:37.269 --> 03:58:37.279 align:start position:0%
impediment to them
 
03:58:42.830 --> 03:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.840 --> 03:58:44.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:58:44.550 --> 03:58:44.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:44.560 --> 03:58:46.550 align:start position:0%
um
well

03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:58:46.560 --> 03:58:51.269 align:start position:0%
well
um

03:58:51.269 --> 03:58:51.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
i mean my own but
 
03:58:56.790 --> 03:58:56.800 align:start position:0%
um i i don't really
 
03:58:59.990 --> 03:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
know much um
 
03:59:01.670 --> 03:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
but yeah i
 
03:59:04.150 --> 03:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
i haven't really
 
03:59:06.950 --> 03:59:06.960 align:start position:0%
consulted much with
 
03:59:13.110 --> 03:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:14.950 --> 03:59:14.960 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
 
03:59:14.960 --> 03:59:19.189 align:start position:0%
any other questions for representative
gallagher

03:59:19.189 --> 03:59:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:20.710 --> 03:59:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:59:23.590 --> 03:59:23.600 align:start position:0%
and and now we have uh some commentary
 
03:59:26.070 --> 03:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
from the nhma
 
03:59:31.429 --> 03:59:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:34.550 --> 03:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
and nash feel feel free
 
03:59:37.510 --> 03:59:37.520 align:start position:0%
to wipe the mic with the clorox if you
 
03:59:37.520 --> 03:59:48.710 align:start position:0%
to wipe the mic with the clorox if you
want

03:59:48.710 --> 03:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:59:49.990 --> 03:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
nate gray is for the new hampshire
 
03:59:52.469 --> 03:59:52.479 align:start position:0%
municipal association we object to this
 
03:59:52.479 --> 03:59:53.830 align:start position:0%
municipal association we object to this
bill

03:59:53.830 --> 03:59:53.840 align:start position:0%
bill
 
03:59:56.389 --> 03:59:56.399 align:start position:0%
there are a couple items that i would
 
03:59:59.269 --> 03:59:59.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:00.710 --> 04:00:00.720 align:start position:0%
our main objection is this is a
 
04:00:03.189 --> 04:00:03.199 align:start position:0%
statewide zoning mandate which we oppose
 
04:00:03.199 --> 04:00:04.229 align:start position:0%
statewide zoning mandate which we oppose
generally

04:00:04.229 --> 04:00:04.239 align:start position:0%
generally
 
04:00:07.189 --> 04:00:07.199 align:start position:0%
we prefer that
 
04:00:09.990 --> 04:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
and current law provides that most local
 
04:00:11.750 --> 04:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
land use decisions are made at the local
 
04:00:11.760 --> 04:00:12.870 align:start position:0%
land use decisions are made at the local
level

04:00:12.870 --> 04:00:12.880 align:start position:0%
level
 
04:00:15.429 --> 04:00:15.439 align:start position:0%
and that's what we advocate for
 
04:00:17.189 --> 04:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple technical
 
04:00:19.349 --> 04:00:19.359 align:start position:0%
questions i have about the bill and i
 
04:00:21.110 --> 04:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
don't have answers to them
 
04:00:22.550 --> 04:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
as representative tripp pointed out
 
04:00:22.560 --> 04:00:23.510 align:start position:0%
as representative tripp pointed out
earlier

04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
04:00:25.110 --> 04:00:25.120 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of religious use
 
04:00:27.189 --> 04:00:27.199 align:start position:0%
parking spaces and i'd also note that
 
04:00:28.710 --> 04:00:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's no definition of religious
 
04:00:30.150 --> 04:00:30.160 align:start position:0%
institution affiliated housing
 
04:00:31.750 --> 04:00:31.760 align:start position:0%
development project
 
04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
um and that that leaves it a bit vague
 
04:00:35.349 --> 04:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
about how this would apply and
 
04:00:37.590 --> 04:00:37.600 align:start position:0%
specifically um
 
04:00:40.070 --> 04:00:40.080 align:start position:0%
how this would would act as a law i
 
04:00:41.830 --> 04:00:41.840 align:start position:0%
understand the sponsor's intent is to
 
04:00:41.840 --> 04:00:44.070 align:start position:0%
understand the sponsor's intent is to
allow

04:00:44.070 --> 04:00:44.080 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:00:45.750 --> 04:00:45.760 align:start position:0%
religious organizations with large
 
04:00:48.710 --> 04:00:48.720 align:start position:0%
parking lots um that are seen declining
 
04:00:50.710 --> 04:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
membership to convert a portion of those
 
04:00:53.269 --> 04:00:53.279 align:start position:0%
parking lots to housing
 
04:00:55.110 --> 04:00:55.120 align:start position:0%
but i don't think that's necessarily
 
04:00:59.590 --> 04:00:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:02.070 --> 04:01:02.080 align:start position:0%
i would also echo
 
04:01:03.590 --> 04:01:03.600 align:start position:0%
or i guess answering the affirmative
 
04:01:05.830 --> 04:01:05.840 align:start position:0%
representative manure's question that
 
04:01:05.840 --> 04:01:06.630 align:start position:0%
representative manure's question that
the

04:01:06.630 --> 04:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:01:09.349 --> 04:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
language here used is vague um so it's
 
04:01:11.030 --> 04:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
not clear that we're specifically
 
04:01:13.670 --> 04:01:13.680 align:start position:0%
talking about parking lots in all cases
 
04:01:15.429 --> 04:01:15.439 align:start position:0%
it could be the case that
 
04:01:16.790 --> 04:01:16.800 align:start position:0%
a religious
 
04:01:19.429 --> 04:01:19.439 align:start position:0%
institution whatever that means decides
 
04:01:21.510 --> 04:01:21.520 align:start position:0%
to develop some housing
 
04:01:24.150 --> 04:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
on another portion of their property and
 
04:01:24.160 --> 04:01:25.510 align:start position:0%
on another portion of their property and
that

04:01:25.510 --> 04:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:27.590 --> 04:01:27.600 align:start position:0%
under this uh provision appears to
 
04:01:30.309 --> 04:01:30.319 align:start position:0%
relate to how many parking spaces they
 
04:01:32.150 --> 04:01:32.160 align:start position:0%
they need and it's just not clear how
 
04:01:33.990 --> 04:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
that's going to interact
 
04:01:35.670 --> 04:01:35.680 align:start position:0%
and the last thing i want to point out
 
04:01:37.910 --> 04:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
um is that
 
04:01:39.670 --> 04:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
over in the judiciary committee i just
 
04:01:41.349 --> 04:01:41.359 align:start position:0%
learned as this committee was
 
04:01:43.990 --> 04:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
meeting earlier today
 
04:01:47.670 --> 04:01:47.680 align:start position:0%
there was a bipartisan recommendation of
 
04:01:51.670 --> 04:01:51.680 align:start position:0%
ought to pass on hb 1021 which for the
 
04:01:54.229 --> 04:01:54.239 align:start position:0%
record we opposed um appears we've lost
 
04:01:54.239 --> 04:01:55.110 align:start position:0%
record we opposed um appears we've lost
that

04:01:55.110 --> 04:01:55.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:01:59.429 --> 04:01:59.439 align:start position:0%
but that would modify rsa 674 colon
 
04:02:02.150 --> 04:02:02.160 align:start position:0%
75 or i guess add a new provision there
 
04:02:03.830 --> 04:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
that says no zoning ordinance or site
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
plan review
 
04:02:08.309 --> 04:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
regulations shall prohibit regulate
 
04:02:09.910 --> 04:02:09.920 align:start position:0%
or restrict the use of land or
 
04:02:12.870 --> 04:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
structures for religious purposes
 
04:02:16.229 --> 04:02:16.239 align:start position:0%
and it goes on from there um but that
 
04:02:19.750 --> 04:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
may have the same effect as this bill um
 
04:02:21.990 --> 04:02:22.000 align:start position:0%
i haven't analyzed the two
 
04:02:24.070 --> 04:02:24.080 align:start position:0%
um together but i wanted to point that
 
04:02:26.309 --> 04:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
out to the committee since i know um
 
04:02:27.830 --> 04:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's the policy of the general court to
 
04:02:29.590 --> 04:02:29.600 align:start position:0%
try to coordinate legislation where
 
04:02:29.600 --> 04:02:30.950 align:start position:0%
try to coordinate legislation where
possible

04:02:30.950 --> 04:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
possible
 
04:02:34.389 --> 04:02:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.399 --> 04:02:35.510 align:start position:0%
 
sure

04:02:35.510 --> 04:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:02:35.520 --> 04:02:36.389 align:start position:0%
sure
sure

04:02:36.389 --> 04:02:36.399 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:02:36.399 --> 04:02:37.269 align:start position:0%
sure
um

04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:39.990 --> 04:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
yeah if it turn if it turns out that
 
04:02:40.000 --> 04:02:40.950 align:start position:0%
yeah if it turn if it turns out that
the

04:02:40.950 --> 04:02:40.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
other bill is broader
 
04:02:46.630 --> 04:02:46.640 align:start position:0%
and um does in fact
 
04:02:48.389 --> 04:02:48.399 align:start position:0%
do the same thing as i'm trying to do
 
04:02:50.710 --> 04:02:50.720 align:start position:0%
here then i'd be
 
04:02:52.790 --> 04:02:52.800 align:start position:0%
i'd be okay with withdrawing this one
 
04:02:54.710 --> 04:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
and just letting the other one do its
 
04:02:54.720 --> 04:02:57.510 align:start position:0%
and just letting the other one do its
thing

04:02:57.510 --> 04:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:03:03.030 --> 04:03:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:06.870 --> 04:03:06.880 align:start position:0%
thank you seeing none thanks uh
 
04:03:09.990 --> 04:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
match grace
 
04:03:13.030 --> 04:03:13.040 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're out of speakers
 
04:03:16.150 --> 04:03:16.160 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to close the hearing
 
04:03:16.160 --> 04:03:18.630 align:start position:0%
so i'm going to close the hearing
on

04:03:18.630 --> 04:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:30.309 --> 04:03:30.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:31.670 --> 04:03:31.680 align:start position:0%

yes uh representative power thank you mr
 
04:04:43.830 --> 04:04:43.840 align:start position:0%

so will this bill be introduced on
 
04:04:47.429 --> 04:04:47.439 align:start position:0%

04:04:47.439 --> 04:04:48.389 align:start position:0%
monday or not
uh i

04:04:48.389 --> 04:04:48.399 align:start position:0%
uh i
 
04:04:50.870 --> 04:04:50.880 align:start position:0%
it could be uh with a with if there are
 
04:04:52.710 --> 04:04:52.720 align:start position:0%
more people here to
 
04:04:55.110 --> 04:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
carry that function out if not one of us
 
04:04:57.910 --> 04:04:57.920 align:start position:0%
can introduce the bill
 
04:05:00.389 --> 04:05:00.399 align:start position:0%
representative wrong your comment
 
04:05:03.590 --> 04:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
well i just wanted to say that i think
 
04:05:05.910 --> 04:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
that a lot of municipalities already
 
04:05:08.309 --> 04:05:08.319 align:start position:0%
have attendance requirements
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
for budget committee and and school
 
04:05:10.800 --> 04:05:11.990 align:start position:0%
for budget committee and and school
board

04:05:11.990 --> 04:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
board
 
04:05:14.870 --> 04:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
and i was just wondering why towns were
 
04:05:16.389 --> 04:05:16.399 align:start position:0%
omitted from this
 
04:05:18.950 --> 04:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
and village districts
 
04:05:20.790 --> 04:05:20.800 align:start position:0%
that that was just mine
 
04:05:22.309 --> 04:05:22.319 align:start position:0%
i think you're right
 
04:05:24.309 --> 04:05:24.319 align:start position:0%
i know in my town
 
04:05:26.710 --> 04:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
if you don't show up for a
 
04:05:29.269 --> 04:05:29.279 align:start position:0%
certain number of meetings in a row you
 
04:05:30.710 --> 04:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
kicked off the uh
 
04:05:32.389 --> 04:05:32.399 align:start position:0%
of the committee of
 
04:05:34.229 --> 04:05:34.239 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the
 
04:05:34.239 --> 04:05:35.269 align:start position:0%
i don't know about the
the

04:05:35.269 --> 04:05:35.279 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:05:36.790 --> 04:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
school board but
 
04:05:41.030 --> 04:05:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:44.389 --> 04:05:44.399 align:start position:0%
any other further comments before we uh
 
04:05:46.870 --> 04:05:46.880 align:start position:0%
end the session
 
04:05:47.990 --> 04:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
all right
 
04:05:50.710 --> 04:05:50.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative so uh so this would
 
04:05:59.510 --> 04:05:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:01.349 --> 04:06:01.359 align:start position:0%
well i'm more concerned with the elected
 
04:06:04.710 --> 04:06:04.720 align:start position:0%
not the appointed yes i i think that
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
removing electorate of elect elected
 
04:06:09.510 --> 04:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
officials is a very delicate
 
04:06:09.520 --> 04:06:10.710 align:start position:0%
officials is a very delicate
process

04:06:10.710 --> 04:06:10.720 align:start position:0%
process
 
04:06:13.030 --> 04:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
and i would uh think that this would
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
have to have
 
04:06:16.550 --> 04:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
a little more research done on it to see
 
04:06:16.560 --> 04:06:17.429 align:start position:0%
a little more research done on it to see
if

04:06:17.429 --> 04:06:17.439 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:06:19.349 --> 04:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here can actually be
 
04:06:19.359 --> 04:06:22.710 align:start position:0%
what we're saying here can actually be
done

04:06:22.710 --> 04:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:25.030 --> 04:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
removing an elected member
 
04:06:28.550 --> 04:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
of the school board or a budget
 
04:06:28.560 --> 04:06:31.510 align:start position:0%
of the school board or a budget
committee

04:06:31.510 --> 04:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:31.520 --> 04:06:38.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:06:38.870 --> 04:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:40.389 --> 04:06:40.399 align:start position:0%
she said it's discriminate
 
04:06:42.070 --> 04:06:42.080 align:start position:0%
discriminatory against people who have
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:47.670 --> 04:06:47.680 align:start position:0%
yes representative wrong
 
04:06:49.990 --> 04:06:50.000 align:start position:0%
yeah another question i would have for
 
04:06:51.670 --> 04:06:51.680 align:start position:0%
monday is that
 
04:06:53.030 --> 04:06:53.040 align:start position:0%
it says
 
04:06:54.790 --> 04:06:54.800 align:start position:0%
she'll be considered to have created a
 
04:06:54.800 --> 04:06:55.990 align:start position:0%
she'll be considered to have created a
vacancy

04:06:55.990 --> 04:06:56.000 align:start position:0%
vacancy
 
04:06:58.309 --> 04:06:58.319 align:start position:0%
so i'd want i guess that is removal from
 
04:07:00.710 --> 04:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
office if it's creating a vacancy or is
 
04:07:02.790 --> 04:07:02.800 align:start position:0%
it adding another person
 
04:07:02.800 --> 04:07:04.309 align:start position:0%
it adding another person
um

04:07:04.309 --> 04:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:07:07.030 --> 04:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so it is just following up on what
 
04:07:09.189 --> 04:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
representative tripp said
 
04:07:11.110 --> 04:07:11.120 align:start position:0%
i would consider that very seriously if
 
04:07:13.269 --> 04:07:13.279 align:start position:0%
we're taking away a position that the
 
04:07:15.030 --> 04:07:15.040 align:start position:0%
people have elected
 
04:07:16.309 --> 04:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
um because
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
there could there could have been an
 
04:07:19.670 --> 04:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
illness or surgery or what there could
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
be a lot of reasons thank you
 
04:07:25.830 --> 04:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
further questions comments
 
04:07:27.590 --> 04:07:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none uh
 
04:07:29.110 --> 04:07:29.120 align:start position:0%

04:07:29.120 --> 04:07:30.229 align:start position:0%
