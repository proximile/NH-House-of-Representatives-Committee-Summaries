house bill 2
 
00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:29.440 align:start position:0%

carry forward to 50
 
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:35.280 align:start position:0%
and that seems like it's going to make a
 
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:38.240 align:start position:0%
fair size hole in our revenues
 
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.350 align:start position:0%

one of the issues that we have
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
monica is this
 
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:34.000 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward which has been
 
00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:35.199 align:start position:0%
building up
 
00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
or last year we had
 
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:41.280 align:start position:0%
up to better than 270 million dollars
 
00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:43.520 align:start position:0%
is this a
 
00:07:45.909 --> 00:07:45.919 align:start position:0%
standard procedure that other states
 
00:07:45.919 --> 00:07:47.029 align:start position:0%
standard procedure that other states
follow

00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:51.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:54.160 align:start position:0%
separate from the
 
00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:56.840 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:00.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't know
 
00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.909 --> 00:08:07.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
and they want to limit it to 50
 
00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
of credit card forward of
 
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.309 align:start position:0%
of credit card forward of
taxes

00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:18.309 --> 00:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
and it causes a real problem
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
over the next few years
 
00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:22.639 align:start position:0%
so if you
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
help us out on this we appreciate it
 
00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
is it standard

me
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
um i'm gonna start with um a little bit
 
00:08:43.829 --> 00:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
of disclaimer i i have not had the
 
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to um
 
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
um to discuss this topic with the array
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
so what i can um
 
00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:54.959 align:start position:0%
so i i have um a little background
 
00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:57.200 align:start position:0%
um i guess i will say a little bit of a
 
00:08:59.829 --> 00:08:59.839 align:start position:0%
background on this issue
 
00:09:02.310 --> 00:09:02.320 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:09:04.790 --> 00:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
so i was hoping today and i believe on
 
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:07.360 align:start position:0%
the comptroller is is on the call today
 
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:09:10.949 --> 00:09:10.959 align:start position:0%
and a person from dra so i was hoping as
 
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
part of this conversation to also
 
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
understand um you know the impact of of
 
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
this change
 
00:09:21.509 --> 00:09:21.519 align:start position:0%
what i so so i what i can say is um
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
i am not familiar with what all the
 
00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:25.200 align:start position:0%
states do
 
00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
if if the change that i'm reading um
 
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:32.640 align:start position:0%
you know the the sums the amounts are
 
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.070 align:start position:0%
you know the the sums the amounts are
significant

00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
significant
 
00:09:35.590 --> 00:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
or are
 
00:09:37.829 --> 00:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
large significantly large so that will
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
definitely you know a change like this
 
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
one uh could certainly impact our
 
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.640 align:start position:0%
liquidity um since we've been uh
 
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:47.200 align:start position:0%
utilizing this um
 
00:09:48.790 --> 00:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
you know the they've been in our pool
 
00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
cash all this time and as someone will
 
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:54.160 align:start position:0%
you know a change like this one
 
00:09:56.870 --> 00:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
um it will be a significant change um on
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
how the state has been operating
 
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
and and again some of the numbers that
 
00:10:03.190 --> 00:10:03.200 align:start position:0%
i've seen
 
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
what i would love to understand is uh
 
00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:07.760 align:start position:0%
first of all i've been reading
 
00:10:09.269 --> 00:10:09.279 align:start position:0%
a bit reading about the impact on
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
revenue what i have not had the
 
00:10:13.509 --> 00:10:13.519 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss with tra is
 
00:10:13.519 --> 00:10:14.310 align:start position:0%
opportunity to discuss with tra is
is

00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:10:17.269 --> 00:10:17.279 align:start position:0%
how much of this is is actual cash
 
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
and so what i will need to understand is
 
00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:22.560 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of the cash the true cash
 
00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:23.590 align:start position:0%
the magnitude of the cash the true cash
impact

00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.710 align:start position:0%
impact
um

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:27.920 align:start position:0%
and how that will change the amount that
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
the state retains
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
and in also the timing of when
 
00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.630 align:start position:0%
and in also the timing of when
um

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:34.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
i guess well we go through this
 
00:10:37.829 --> 00:10:37.839 align:start position:0%
transition from
 
00:10:37.839 --> 00:10:39.350 align:start position:0%
transition from
um

00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
from taxpayers choosing
 
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
how to handle the overpayment so if
 
00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:45.760 align:start position:0%
that's going to change
 
00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
i i will need to understand the time and
 
00:10:50.389 --> 00:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
of when these funds are going to be
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
returned to taxpayers
 
00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
and injured and during that transition
 
00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
period um it would be important for us
 
00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
to to know
 
00:11:01.829 --> 00:11:01.839 align:start position:0%
um again how those funds will be
 
00:11:01.839 --> 00:11:03.030 align:start position:0%
um again how those funds will be
disbursed

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:03.040 align:start position:0%
disbursed
 
00:11:04.230 --> 00:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
in in
 
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:04.640 align:start position:0%
in in
um

00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:04.650 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:04.650 --> 00:11:06.230 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be on a monthly basis
 
00:11:09.990 --> 00:11:10.000 align:start position:0%
if it's going to be right after
 
00:11:13.190 --> 00:11:13.200 align:start position:0%
taxpayers file just details like that
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
our cash cycle is pretty consistent we
 
00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
have um
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
we have a clear picture of what our cash
 
00:11:22.069 --> 00:11:22.079 align:start position:0%
cycle looks like it really is based on
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
our budget and those are set most of
 
00:11:26.550 --> 00:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
them are set payments we you know we
 
00:11:28.949 --> 00:11:28.959 align:start position:0%
have the significant uh disbursements
 
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
are set in statute so
 
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:34.160 align:start position:0%
if if if you look at our cash uh year
 
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.040 align:start position:0%
year it's pretty consistent how we
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
um we have this um net inflows and and
 
00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.670 align:start position:0%
um we have this um net inflows and and
and

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
how our cash
 
00:11:43.120 --> 00:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
how our cash
um

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:44.790 align:start position:0%
um
hard

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:44.800 align:start position:0%
hard
 
00:11:47.910 --> 00:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
cash flow um operates so
 
00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:48.790 align:start position:0%
cash flow um operates so
um

00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:48.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:53.350 --> 00:11:53.360 align:start position:0%
again with this um large amounts
 
00:11:54.870 --> 00:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
just to change alone it would be
 
00:11:56.949 --> 00:11:56.959 align:start position:0%
important for for for
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
obviously we will have to work with dra
 
00:12:01.430 --> 00:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
really closely um to see how that's
 
00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
going to work so so that's what i can
 
00:12:06.069 --> 00:12:06.079 align:start position:0%
share with you and again um you know i
 
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:08.000 align:start position:0%
apologize for not having the background
 
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
i just have not had the opportunity to
 
00:12:12.069 --> 00:12:12.079 align:start position:0%
to speak to dra about this
 
00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:13.760 align:start position:0%
um i know there's some accounting
 
00:12:17.030 --> 00:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
concerns too and so um again i i guess
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
as part of this um this discussion i i'm
 
00:12:22.629 --> 00:12:22.639 align:start position:0%
hoping to also be educated
 
00:12:24.470 --> 00:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
and hear from the controller and and
 
00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:26.959 align:start position:0%
from dri about this issue
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
um and i'll be happy to ask answer any
 
00:12:32.150 --> 00:12:32.160 align:start position:0%
questions if i can at this time
 
00:12:33.990 --> 00:12:34.000 align:start position:0%
you did mention that
 
00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
you're not sure if this is
 
00:12:39.670 --> 00:12:39.680 align:start position:0%
all cash or not and i thought it was
 
00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:40.870 align:start position:0%
all cash or not and i thought it was
it's

00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
not it's all
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
to me it looks like it is all cash it's
 
00:12:47.750 --> 00:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
cash that came in the door
 
00:12:51.269 --> 00:12:51.279 align:start position:0%
the overpayment of taxes and our concern
 
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:12:56.949 --> 00:12:56.959 align:start position:0%
in 2017 it was like 172 million dollars
 
00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
in 2018 196 million
 
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:02.440 align:start position:0%
in 2019
 
00:13:04.710 --> 00:13:04.720 align:start position:0%
268 million
 
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:07.480 align:start position:0%
and we're standing in 20
 
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.110 --> 00:13:15.120 align:start position:0%
and if that's all cash then those are
 
00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:17.920 align:start position:0%
very large amounts that uh certainly are
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
liquidity we'll feel it and and and
 
00:13:21.829 --> 00:13:21.839 align:start position:0%
again so i think
 
00:13:21.839 --> 00:13:22.710 align:start position:0%
again so i think
um

00:13:22.710 --> 00:13:22.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
we will have to really work really
 
00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
closely with
 
00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760 align:start position:0%
with um department of revenue to
 
00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:30.160 align:start position:0%
understand how those funds will be
 
00:13:31.750 --> 00:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
um you know the sovereign payments will
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
be handled um so our liquidity is not
 
00:13:34.399 --> 00:13:36.150 align:start position:0%
be handled um so our liquidity is not
impacted

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.160 align:start position:0%
impacted
 
00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.629 align:start position:0%
impacted
okay

00:13:38.629 --> 00:13:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:41.440 align:start position:0%
maybe we could hear from dana the
 
00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:45.829 align:start position:0%
maybe we could hear from dana the
comptroller

00:13:45.829 --> 00:13:45.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
and dana is this a standard practice
 
00:13:55.590 --> 00:13:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:14.560 align:start position:0%
she is but she's muted
 
00:14:16.069 --> 00:14:16.079 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if she needs to unmute
 
00:14:16.079 --> 00:14:17.430 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if she needs to unmute
herself

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:17.440 align:start position:0%
herself
 
00:14:18.790 --> 00:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
dar six
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.230 --> 00:15:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
jenny

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
jenny
 
00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.829 align:start position:0%
jenny
jennings

00:15:07.829 --> 00:15:07.839 align:start position:0%
jennings
 
00:15:10.470 --> 00:15:10.480 align:start position:0%
dana's still there
 
00:15:12.790 --> 00:15:12.800 align:start position:0%
dana appears to be here and appears to
 
00:15:14.389 --> 00:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
be unmuted but
 
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
we can't hear her
 
00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:17.430 align:start position:0%
we can't hear her
um

00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
if she can hear us i would suggest
 
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:22.160 align:start position:0%
logging out and logging back in again
 
00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:31.829 --> 00:15:31.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:39.269 --> 00:15:39.279 align:start position:0%
we could hear from the dr the dra
 
00:15:39.279 --> 00:15:42.230 align:start position:0%
we could hear from the dr the dra
on

00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
 
what

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
to put the question to bed is that
 
00:15:49.509 --> 00:15:49.519 align:start position:0%
is this money
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
good morning representatives carolyn
 
00:16:01.829 --> 00:16:01.839 align:start position:0%
lear assistant commissioner with the new
 
00:16:03.829 --> 00:16:03.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire department of revenue
 
00:16:06.870 --> 00:16:06.880 align:start position:0%
um if possible could we also promote
 
00:16:09.509 --> 00:16:09.519 align:start position:0%
melissa rollins to a panelist if she
 
00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:12.720 align:start position:0%
isn't already i just i'll very quickly
 
00:16:15.430 --> 00:16:15.440 align:start position:0%
call on her to help out
 
00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:16.389 align:start position:0%
call on her to help out
um

00:16:16.389 --> 00:16:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:18.880 align:start position:0%
so the money
 
00:16:22.230 --> 00:16:22.240 align:start position:0%
that is reflected in our calculation of
 
00:16:24.949 --> 00:16:24.959 align:start position:0%
ccos is all cash that has already been
 
00:16:27.990 --> 00:16:28.000 align:start position:0%
received and deposited by the state
 
00:16:29.269 --> 00:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
um and monica king i'm sorry the
 
00:16:33.269 --> 00:16:33.279 align:start position:0%
treasurer can correct me if i'm
 
00:16:33.279 --> 00:16:34.550 align:start position:0%
treasurer can correct me if i'm
incorrect

00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
incorrect
 
00:16:36.150 --> 00:16:36.160 align:start position:0%
but i think the question was more how
 
00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
would we expect that money to leave the
 
00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.389 align:start position:0%
would we expect that money to leave the
state

00:16:40.389 --> 00:16:40.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
would it be the state
 
00:16:45.350 --> 00:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
cutting checks or would it be reduced
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
future revenue
 
00:16:48.949 --> 00:16:48.959 align:start position:0%
and i think the answer to that question
 
00:16:52.150 --> 00:16:52.160 align:start position:0%
is both we don't really know how
 
00:16:55.030 --> 00:16:55.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayer behavior will change
 
00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
in anticipation of
 
00:16:59.829 --> 00:16:59.839 align:start position:0%
new hampshire theoretically passing this
 
00:16:59.839 --> 00:17:01.350 align:start position:0%
new hampshire theoretically passing this
legislation

00:17:01.350 --> 00:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
some taxpayers could reduce their
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
estimated payments in anticipation of
 
00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:09.039 align:start position:0%
the change and then we would see this
 
00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:10.400 align:start position:0%
reflected as
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
reduced revenue in the future
 
00:17:16.309 --> 00:17:16.319 align:start position:0%
if taxpayers don't change their behavior
 
00:17:19.029 --> 00:17:19.039 align:start position:0%
and they file their returns and reflect
 
00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
a large cco on that return
 
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
we would then be issuing a refund and
 
00:17:26.309 --> 00:17:26.319 align:start position:0%
that would be real
 
00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200 align:start position:0%
real money being cut as a check
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
um going to taxpayers and i think what's
 
00:17:35.990 --> 00:17:36.000 align:start position:0%
a challenge about um predicting
 
00:17:38.630 --> 00:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
which we're more likely to see is that
 
00:17:40.390 --> 00:17:40.400 align:start position:0%
we're not aware of any state who has
 
00:17:41.830 --> 00:17:41.840 align:start position:0%
done this before
 
00:17:44.150 --> 00:17:44.160 align:start position:0%
so we're really just trying to predict
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
what taxpayer behavior will be
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
in response to this statutory change um
 
00:17:52.630 --> 00:17:52.640 align:start position:0%
the physical impact analysis that you
 
00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:53.510 align:start position:0%
the physical impact analysis that you
have

00:17:53.510 --> 00:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
received from us on this change
 
00:17:58.950 --> 00:17:58.960 align:start position:0%
you arrange
 
00:18:01.510 --> 00:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
that assumes both scenarios and i
 
00:18:04.710 --> 00:18:04.720 align:start position:0%
stopped it there absolutely carolyn you
 
00:18:06.150 --> 00:18:06.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you
 
00:18:08.789 --> 00:18:08.799 align:start position:0%
don't know of any other states that have
 
00:18:11.350 --> 00:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
done this before does that mean
 
00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:14.070 align:start position:0%
done this before does that mean
um

00:18:14.070 --> 00:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:15.990 --> 00:18:16.000 align:start position:0%
return the
 
00:18:18.549 --> 00:18:18.559 align:start position:0%
limit the credit carry forward
 
00:18:20.950 --> 00:18:20.960 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:18:23.590 --> 00:18:23.600 align:start position:0%
have care credit carry forward
 
00:18:26.470 --> 00:18:26.480 align:start position:0%
just give complete refunds
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:18:29.510 --> 00:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
representative we're not aware of any
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
state that has capped credit carry
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
forwards and required the taxpayer to
 
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:50.789 --> 00:18:50.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
good morning can you hear me

that um
 
00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
from an audit perspective this issue has
 
00:19:24.470 --> 00:19:24.480 align:start position:0%
been discussed for many years
 
00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:25.350 align:start position:0%
been discussed for many years
and

00:19:25.350 --> 00:19:25.360 align:start position:0%
and

specifically the comptroller's office
have

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
that worked with the ira to evaluate
 
00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:34.150 align:start position:0%
that worked with the ira to evaluate
this

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
what essentially is a liability to the
 
00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:37.430 align:start position:0%
what essentially is a liability to the
state

00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
so when you have payments that come in
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
that are overpaid
 
00:19:45.110 --> 00:19:45.120 align:start position:0%
we would
 
00:19:46.390 --> 00:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
in theory
 
00:19:48.870 --> 00:19:48.880 align:start position:0%
record a liability against that cash
 
00:19:51.110 --> 00:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
that came in the door so if it's
 
00:19:53.510 --> 00:19:53.520 align:start position:0%
expected that a future
 
00:19:55.590 --> 00:19:55.600 align:start position:0%
refund is coming
 
00:19:57.029 --> 00:19:57.039 align:start position:0%
and it relates to the current audit
 
00:19:59.350 --> 00:19:59.360 align:start position:0%
period the auditors would expect us to
 
00:20:02.310 --> 00:20:02.320 align:start position:0%
record a liability so it's not a matter
 
00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily of putting the cash aside
 
00:20:07.430 --> 00:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
and funding the liability in an escrow
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
account but it is expected that on the
 
00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
from a kafir perspective the state's
 
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
audited financial statements there would
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
be some reflection of this future
 
00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:19.760 align:start position:0%
liability and this issue has been
 
00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
discussed at length
 
00:20:25.190 --> 00:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
with the legislature and
 
00:20:28.230 --> 00:20:28.240 align:start position:0%
management for years
 
00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:30.880 align:start position:0%
what we have come to is that the
 
00:20:33.510 --> 00:20:33.520 align:start position:0%
auditors have given us an audit finding
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
the last two years
 
00:20:38.149 --> 00:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
it reflected in our audit financial
 
00:20:38.159 --> 00:20:39.909 align:start position:0%
it reflected in our audit financial
statements

00:20:39.909 --> 00:20:39.919 align:start position:0%
statements
 
00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:42.080 align:start position:0%
essentially disagreeing with the state's
 
00:20:44.310 --> 00:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
accounting position we have not recorded
 
00:20:47.110 --> 00:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
this as a liability in the general fund
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
because it would be a direct hit to
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
general fund surplus it would reduce our
 
00:20:53.669 --> 00:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue
 
00:20:53.679 --> 00:20:54.549 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue
and

00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:55.430 align:start position:0%
and
prior

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440 align:start position:0%
prior
 
00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:57.190 align:start position:0%
prior
years

00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:20:59.909 --> 00:20:59.919 align:start position:0%
legislative leaders have not wanted us
 
00:21:02.870 --> 00:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
to do this essentially they have agreed
 
00:21:05.270 --> 00:21:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the state's accounting position
 
00:21:09.510 --> 00:21:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.549 align:start position:0%
 
cash

00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
cash
 
00:21:14.230 --> 00:21:14.240 align:start position:0%
refunds paid is something we record
 
00:21:16.549 --> 00:21:16.559 align:start position:0%
but we have not taken the leap to
 
00:21:20.230 --> 00:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
necessarily record a hit to surplus per
 
00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
se for this item
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
and much of that has been because
 
00:21:26.230 --> 00:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of analysis of when
 
00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440 align:start position:0%
that refund actually goes out the door
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
and what how long we hold on to
 
00:21:34.630 --> 00:21:34.640 align:start position:0%
what they call it is
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
what the accounts refer to it as we hold
 
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money on account for them
 
00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:40.470 align:start position:0%
taxpayers money on account for them
essentially

00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.480 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:21:42.149 --> 00:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
for them to decide when they're going to
 
00:21:44.470 --> 00:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
apply it to a return
 
00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:46.480 align:start position:0%
or an estimated payment and so there's a
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
lot of analysis involved as to the
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
timing of what taxpayers typically
 
00:21:53.669 --> 00:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
decide to do in that regard
 
00:21:56.630 --> 00:21:56.640 align:start position:0%
so we balance that out with
 
00:21:59.630 --> 00:21:59.640 align:start position:0%
so we wouldn't be asked to record a full
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
270 million dollar liability what we've
 
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:05.200 align:start position:0%
what we've determined based on dras
 
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:08.320 align:start position:0%
analysis of taxpayer activity is that we
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
would be looking at about a 60 million
 
00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
dollar liability attributable to the
 
00:22:16.230 --> 00:22:16.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal year at hand so the last two
 
00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.190 align:start position:0%
fiscal year at hand so the last two
years

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:17.200 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
we have elected to not record a 60
 
00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:22.880 align:start position:0%
million dollar hit to surplus and the
 
00:22:25.669 --> 00:22:25.679 align:start position:0%
auditors have what they call passed on
 
00:22:27.830 --> 00:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
that adjustment meaning it wouldn't
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
change our general fund balance sheet to
 
00:22:31.510 --> 00:22:31.520 align:start position:0%
the extent that it would make the
 
00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
readers not be able to rely on our
 
00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
state's financial statements so they
 
00:22:39.110 --> 00:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
have allowed or agreed that we don't
 
00:22:41.909 --> 00:22:41.919 align:start position:0%
necessarily need to book that liability
 
00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
but they have had concerns and have
 
00:22:47.190 --> 00:22:47.200 align:start position:0%
expressed that to the fiscal committee
 
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:50.000 align:start position:0%
the last two years in our audit so
 
00:22:53.430 --> 00:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
it is a significant issue it's it isn't
 
00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:55.280 align:start position:0%
the full liability because again there
 
00:22:57.190 --> 00:22:57.200 align:start position:0%
are assumptions made as to when the
 
00:22:59.110 --> 00:22:59.120 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will actually
 
00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:01.120 align:start position:0%
use those credits up
 
00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
um so there's an entire analysis that
 
00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:06.000 align:start position:0%
gets done each year
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
but what it it if we did record the
 
00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:11.280 align:start position:0%
liability um it would be included in our
 
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
gap adjustments that we make each year
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
to make the kefir
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
as part of our final audited kaffir and
 
00:23:19.830 --> 00:23:19.840 align:start position:0%
it would directly reduce general fund
 
00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:24.390 align:start position:0%
it would directly reduce general fund
surplus

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:24.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:26.390 --> 00:23:26.400 align:start position:0%
i can entertain any questions on that
 
00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:29.590 align:start position:0%
i can entertain any questions on that
aspect

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
to the questions
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh represent almighty first
 
00:23:37.510 --> 00:23:37.520 align:start position:0%
followed by representing yours
 
00:23:40.549 --> 00:23:40.559 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think that uh
 
00:23:42.549 --> 00:23:42.559 align:start position:0%
representative brahmi had his hand up
 
00:23:46.630 --> 00:23:46.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:48.070 --> 00:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
i'd like
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like
 
00:23:49.679 --> 00:23:50.470 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd like
i

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:50.480 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:23:53.029 --> 00:23:53.039 align:start position:0%
i think it sounds like uh
 
00:23:56.230 --> 00:23:56.240 align:start position:0%
the comptroller knows more about this
 
00:24:00.549 --> 00:24:00.559 align:start position:0%
language that's in hb2 than anybody else
 
00:24:00.559 --> 00:24:01.430 align:start position:0%
language that's in hb2 than anybody else
on

00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.470 align:start position:0%
on
and

00:24:02.470 --> 00:24:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:05.029 --> 00:24:05.039 align:start position:0%
i am confused
 
00:24:07.750 --> 00:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
as to if we did this
 
00:24:11.909 --> 00:24:11.919 align:start position:0%
does it require that someone who has
 
00:24:14.870 --> 00:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
five million dollars in that credit
 
00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
carry forward right now
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
on to
 
00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.310 align:start position:0%
on to
take

00:24:20.310 --> 00:24:20.320 align:start position:0%
take
 
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:21.350 align:start position:0%
take
all

00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:24:23.269 --> 00:24:23.279 align:start position:0%
take back all
 
00:24:23.279 --> 00:24:24.549 align:start position:0%
take back all
but

00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:24:24.559 --> 00:24:25.430 align:start position:0%
but
on

00:24:25.430 --> 00:24:25.440 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
half of their current this year's
 
00:24:28.799 --> 00:24:29.830 align:start position:0%
half of their current this year's
on

00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:24:32.789 --> 00:24:32.799 align:start position:0%
my on credit carry forward
 
00:24:34.710 --> 00:24:34.720 align:start position:0%
on and
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
like about maybe 95
 
00:24:39.750 --> 00:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
of that 5 million and take it back this
 
00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:41.190 align:start position:0%
of that 5 million and take it back this
year

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:24:44.470 --> 00:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
and if not why not how does the language
 
00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.870 align:start position:0%
and if not why not how does the language
work

00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh well i would just say this is dana
 
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:51.760 align:start position:0%
again i would say that i wasn't involved
 
00:24:53.830 --> 00:24:53.840 align:start position:0%
in the drafting of house bill 2 so i
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
would defer to dra
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
if carolyn could weigh in on the
 
00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:00.960 align:start position:0%
transition time but i think what i would
 
00:25:03.029 --> 00:25:03.039 align:start position:0%
generally say about the language is it
 
00:25:03.990 --> 00:25:04.000 align:start position:0%
is a
 
00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
it would be in from an auditor
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
standpoint from our external auditors
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
kpmg it would be a step in the right
 
00:25:12.870 --> 00:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
direction to limit our exposure from a
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
liability standpoint at some point they
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
may decide that they cannot sign off on
 
00:25:22.230 --> 00:25:22.240 align:start position:0%
our current accounting policy um and and
 
00:25:24.390 --> 00:25:24.400 align:start position:0%
cannot be comfortable with it
 
00:25:26.549 --> 00:25:26.559 align:start position:0%
so this what this is one of the things
 
00:25:29.669 --> 00:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
we've discussed uh is a sort of a step
 
00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:31.440 align:start position:0%
in the right direction to
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
minimize the magnitude of this liability
 
00:25:37.110 --> 00:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
um so in that sense
 
00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
we would have to talk about as as you
 
00:25:41.430 --> 00:25:41.440 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative almi like the
 
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:42.789 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative almi like the
transition

00:25:42.789 --> 00:25:42.799 align:start position:0%
transition
 
00:25:42.799 --> 00:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
transition
and

00:25:44.310 --> 00:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:46.240 align:start position:0%
whether it would be implemented over
 
00:25:49.269 --> 00:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
time from a prospective standpoint that
 
00:25:51.269 --> 00:25:51.279 align:start position:0%
i would defer to uh department of
 
00:25:58.789 --> 00:25:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:58.799 --> 00:25:59.830 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:25:59.830 --> 00:25:59.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:03.590 --> 00:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
on we we need to talk to whoever created
 
00:26:04.950 --> 00:26:04.960 align:start position:0%
this language
 
00:26:06.710 --> 00:26:06.720 align:start position:0%
i think
 
00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
and we need we need to figure out a
 
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
transition that works
 
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:12.320 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:26:15.269 --> 00:26:15.279 align:start position:0%
the uh caroline could help us on that
 
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
carolyn you want to respond do you know
 
00:26:21.110 --> 00:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
did you help them with this language
 
00:26:22.470 --> 00:26:22.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative thank you the
 
00:26:24.549 --> 00:26:24.559 align:start position:0%
department could help the governor's
 
00:26:27.029 --> 00:26:27.039 align:start position:0%
office in drafting this language
 
00:26:27.039 --> 00:26:28.230 align:start position:0%
office in drafting this language
um

00:26:28.230 --> 00:26:28.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
the the change would be effective for
 
00:26:33.750 --> 00:26:33.760 align:start position:0%
taxable periods ending
 
00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:37.520 align:start position:0%
on or after december 31st 2022 so this
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
would be for tax year 2022 and to answer
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
your question representative almi
 
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.470 align:start position:0%
your question representative almi
yes

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:26:48.470 --> 00:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2023 if a taxpayer is
 
00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:50.070 align:start position:0%
in the spring of 2023 if a taxpayer is
reporting

00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
reporting
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
a cco
 
00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:52.390 align:start position:0%
a cco
their

00:26:52.390 --> 00:26:52.400 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:53.669 align:start position:0%
their
return

00:26:53.669 --> 00:26:53.679 align:start position:0%
return
 
00:26:57.510 --> 00:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
and that cco exceeds 50
 
00:27:00.310 --> 00:27:00.320 align:start position:0%
of their current year's liability they
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
will be sent a refund for the remainder
 
00:27:07.990 --> 00:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
as this is drafted
 
00:27:10.549 --> 00:27:10.559 align:start position:0%
could i ask a clarifying question just
 
00:27:12.070 --> 00:27:12.080 align:start position:0%
to make sure
 
00:27:13.190 --> 00:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:27:16.070 --> 00:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
if someone has had
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
five years of of on
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
money sitting with you
 
00:27:24.630 --> 00:27:24.640 align:start position:0%
are they going to be required to take
 
00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.430 align:start position:0%
are they going to be required to take
back

00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:27:29.510 --> 00:27:29.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.470 --> 00:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:27:32.230 --> 00:27:32.240 align:start position:0%
representative the answer to that
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
question is yes
 
00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason
 
00:27:38.389 --> 00:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
why is because
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
we when a cco was reported five years
 
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
we when a cco was reported five years
ago

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:45.520 align:start position:0%
that cco has been used up to pay the
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
taxpayers liability
 
00:27:49.909 --> 00:27:49.919 align:start position:0%
because we always operate on a first in
 
00:27:52.870 --> 00:27:52.880 align:start position:0%
first out basis so we're always using
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
the taxpayers oldest money first
 
00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
to satisfy their liability and it's the
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
new money
 
00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:00.310 align:start position:0%
new money
that

00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:28:02.549 --> 00:28:02.559 align:start position:0%
constitutes the cco
 
00:28:02.559 --> 00:28:03.350 align:start position:0%
constitutes the cco
um

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.710 align:start position:0%
um
so

00:28:04.710 --> 00:28:04.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:28:07.590 --> 00:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
so there isn't a cco that's five years
 
00:28:07.600 --> 00:28:08.050 align:start position:0%
so there isn't a cco that's five years
old

00:28:08.050 --> 00:28:08.060 align:start position:0%
old
 
00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.830 align:start position:0%
old
[Music]

00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
before we go to the next question
 
00:28:15.430 --> 00:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to put this out on the
 
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.269 align:start position:0%
uh i just want to put this out on the
table

00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
table
 
00:28:19.590 --> 00:28:19.600 align:start position:0%
if the taxpayer
 
00:28:21.510 --> 00:28:21.520 align:start position:0%
brought this money
 
00:28:24.630 --> 00:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
back to themselves as a refund
 
00:28:27.029 --> 00:28:27.039 align:start position:0%
and the taxpayer has
 
00:28:29.909 --> 00:28:29.919 align:start position:0%
is paying taxes the federal government
 
00:28:33.990 --> 00:28:34.000 align:start position:0%
they would pay 21 percent
 
00:28:36.389 --> 00:28:36.399 align:start position:0%
taxes on this money every dollar that
 
00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:38.320 align:start position:0%
they brought out
 
00:28:38.320 --> 00:28:39.590 align:start position:0%
they brought out
refunds

00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
back to themselves
 
00:28:44.710 --> 00:28:44.720 align:start position:0%
21 of that
 
00:28:47.750 --> 00:28:47.760 align:start position:0%
is that a correct statement
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
um your your correct representative that
 
00:28:58.389 --> 00:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
if a taxpayer receives a refund the
 
00:29:01.269 --> 00:29:01.279 align:start position:0%
state is going to issue them a 1099 and
 
00:29:02.870 --> 00:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
generally although i'm sure there are
 
00:29:05.430 --> 00:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
taxpayer specific
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
you know instances where this is not
 
00:29:09.750 --> 00:29:09.760 align:start position:0%
true generally that will be includable
 
00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
in income for that taxpayer
 
00:29:14.470 --> 00:29:14.480 align:start position:0%
the reason being
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayer would have
 
00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.669 align:start position:0%
that the taxpayer would have
deducted

00:29:17.669 --> 00:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
deducted
 
00:29:19.029 --> 00:29:19.039 align:start position:0%
that payment
 
00:29:21.190 --> 00:29:21.200 align:start position:0%
um as a business expense in the year
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
that it was paid
 
00:29:25.029 --> 00:29:25.039 align:start position:0%
so the taxpayer can
 
00:29:27.510 --> 00:29:27.520 align:start position:0%
park their money with us
 
00:29:30.710 --> 00:29:30.720 align:start position:0%
and not have to pay their federal taxes
 
00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
and take it out when they want to
 
00:29:37.430 --> 00:29:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:39.190 --> 00:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know if any of that is driving
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
representative major may i interrupt for
 
00:29:47.029 --> 00:29:47.039 align:start position:0%
a moment yes jimmy
 
00:29:47.039 --> 00:29:47.830 align:start position:0%
a moment yes jimmy
uh

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
matthew melo is
 
00:29:52.630 --> 00:29:52.640 align:start position:0%
has his hand up in the attendees
 
00:29:52.640 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
has his hand up in the attendees
list

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
hello mr chairman can you hear me uh yes
 
00:30:15.350 --> 00:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.789 --> 00:30:24.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:27.029 --> 00:30:27.039 align:start position:0%
the author
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
of this amendment
 
00:30:30.310 --> 00:30:30.320 align:start position:0%
will limit
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
could you tell us who that is
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
yes so this is language that did come
 
00:30:41.190 --> 00:30:41.200 align:start position:0%
from the governor's office during our
 
00:30:42.870 --> 00:30:42.880 align:start position:0%
phase of the budget
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
to address many of the concerns that
 
00:30:47.029 --> 00:30:47.039 align:start position:0%
have been brought forward by this
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
committee both today and also
 
00:30:52.950 --> 00:30:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:55.350 --> 00:30:55.360 align:start position:0%
what i would say is our intent is to
 
00:30:57.509 --> 00:30:57.519 align:start position:0%
lower the state's liability
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
that is held on our books in part
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
because of what
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
the comptroller has spoken to and also
 
00:31:05.750 --> 00:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
what dra has mentioned
 
00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
we ultimately want to get this to a spot
 
00:31:10.389 --> 00:31:10.399 align:start position:0%
where the fiscal impact could be spread
 
00:31:13.590 --> 00:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
out over a series of years
 
00:31:15.029 --> 00:31:15.039 align:start position:0%
and i think that the committee is
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
already considering a couple of ways to
 
00:31:19.509 --> 00:31:19.519 align:start position:0%
do that and in supplemental
 
00:31:21.269 --> 00:31:21.279 align:start position:0%
conversations that our office has had
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
with dra
 
00:31:25.430 --> 00:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
the 50 threshold
 
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:28.960 align:start position:0%
may be trying to solve the wrong problem
 
00:31:32.230 --> 00:31:32.240 align:start position:0%
essentially to say that it appears that
 
00:31:34.389 --> 00:31:34.399 align:start position:0%
the majority of the money that's been
 
00:31:38.310 --> 00:31:38.320 align:start position:0%
accrued as credit carryover
 
00:31:40.470 --> 00:31:40.480 align:start position:0%
liabilities for the state
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
are with businesses that are holding
 
00:31:45.830 --> 00:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
either more than 100 percent or in some
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
cases more than 200 percent
 
00:31:50.630 --> 00:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
of their annual liability
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
so there may be a way to resolve this
 
00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.830 align:start position:0%
so there may be a way to resolve this
problem

00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:31:56.630 --> 00:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
at a much higher threshold
 
00:31:59.590 --> 00:31:59.600 align:start position:0%
and still dramatically reduce the
 
00:32:02.310 --> 00:32:02.320 align:start position:0%
current liability the state has on its
 
00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.630 align:start position:0%
current liability the state has on its
books

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:08.149 --> 00:32:08.159 align:start position:0%
okay so then
 
00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:32:12.310 --> 00:32:12.320 align:start position:0%
limiting it to 50
 
00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%
if we went to 100 percent
 
00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.830 align:start position:0%
if we went to 100 percent
uh

00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:32:22.149 --> 00:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:24.389 --> 00:32:24.399 align:start position:0%
the effect on the state would be
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
spread out over a longer period of time
 
00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:29.120 align:start position:0%
as i was just saying
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh so the question is where do the bulk
 
00:32:35.029 --> 00:32:35.039 align:start position:0%
of these dollars originate from
 
00:32:37.430 --> 00:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
and our understanding when we first
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
wrote this language was that some
 
00:32:40.789 --> 00:32:40.799 align:start position:0%
companies are paying
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
you know more than their
 
00:32:45.909 --> 00:32:45.919 align:start position:0%
annual tax obligation for one reason or
 
00:32:45.919 --> 00:32:47.190 align:start position:0%
annual tax obligation for one reason or
another

00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:32:49.269 --> 00:32:49.279 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the money though is not with
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
the say small or mid-sized business
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
that's paying their next quarter or
 
00:32:56.389 --> 00:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
their next two quarters it's with
 
00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
companies that are for one reason or
 
00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.669 align:start position:0%
companies that are for one reason or
another

00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
another
paying

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:33:03.190 --> 00:33:03.200 align:start position:0%
more than two or three times their total
 
00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:05.350 align:start position:0%
more than two or three times their total
obligation

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
obligation
 
00:33:07.190 --> 00:33:07.200 align:start position:0%
and if we do want to reduce the
 
00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.870 align:start position:0%
and if we do want to reduce the
liabilities

00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
liabilities
 
00:33:10.549 --> 00:33:10.559 align:start position:0%
you could probably set a higher
 
00:33:13.430 --> 00:33:13.440 align:start position:0%
threshold either at say 200
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
of their liability
 
00:33:17.909 --> 00:33:17.919 align:start position:0%
or 100 of their liability
 
00:33:19.830 --> 00:33:19.840 align:start position:0%
and still reduce
 
00:33:22.710 --> 00:33:22.720 align:start position:0%
a a high percentage of what those
 
00:33:25.509 --> 00:33:25.519 align:start position:0%
outstanding current credit carryovers
 
00:33:25.519 --> 00:33:26.789 align:start position:0%
outstanding current credit carryovers
are

00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:28.640 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to phase it in you could
 
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.720 align:start position:0%
do a stepped approach
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:33:36.070 --> 00:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
over a period of three or five years
 
00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:38.960 align:start position:0%
that maximum amount of their
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
annual tax liability that they can hold
 
00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:45.440 align:start position:0%
maybe goes from 200 percent in year one
 
00:33:48.789 --> 00:33:48.799 align:start position:0%
to 150 in year two
 
00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:51.760 align:start position:0%
and then a hundred percent in year three
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
and then as taxpayers either modify
 
00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
their behavior
 
00:33:57.909 --> 00:33:57.919 align:start position:0%
or take refunds
 
00:34:00.389 --> 00:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
that would spread out where the fiscal
 
00:34:00.399 --> 00:34:01.509 align:start position:0%
that would spread out where the fiscal
impact

00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
impact
 
00:34:03.029 --> 00:34:03.039 align:start position:0%
of this change
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
uh would hit the state if you will
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
and every threshold
 
00:34:12.389 --> 00:34:12.399 align:start position:0%
takes about four years to phase in
 
00:34:15.589 --> 00:34:15.599 align:start position:0%
so if you went 200
 
00:34:17.750 --> 00:34:17.760 align:start position:0%
that would take four years
 
00:34:18.710 --> 00:34:18.720 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:34:21.109 --> 00:34:21.119 align:start position:0%
the next year you go to
 
00:34:21.119 --> 00:34:22.389 align:start position:0%
the next year you go to
100

00:34:22.389 --> 00:34:22.399 align:start position:0%
100
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
it would take
 
00:34:26.869 --> 00:34:26.879 align:start position:0%
four years by itself or not so
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.669 align:start position:0%
 
carolyn

00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
carolyn
 
00:34:37.990 --> 00:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
representative thank you the question is
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
is it true that it takes four years to
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
feel the impact
 
00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:43.990 align:start position:0%
feel the impact
of

00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:34:47.030 --> 00:34:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:49.919 align:start position:0%
yeah yes if they change the threshold to
 
00:34:49.919 --> 00:34:51.589 align:start position:0%
yeah yes if they change the threshold to
200

00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
and then maybe a year later
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
change it to
 
00:34:58.150 --> 00:34:58.160 align:start position:0%
100 percent
 
00:34:59.750 --> 00:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
you have a four year
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.670 --> 00:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
to take care of the 200 percent it would
 
00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:08.710 align:start position:0%
to take care of the 200 percent it would
happen

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:08.720 align:start position:0%
happen
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
and then the 100 would take an
 
00:35:13.270 --> 00:35:13.280 align:start position:0%
additional four years
 
00:35:18.630 --> 00:35:18.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:21.750 --> 00:35:21.760 align:start position:0%
representative if you might indulge me
 
00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
for a moment we've actually
 
00:35:26.230 --> 00:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
mapped that change out
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
and if you would be interested in having
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
melissa rollins share her screen to you
 
00:35:33.030 --> 00:35:33.040 align:start position:0%
she can actually
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
chris could you
 
00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:42.829 align:start position:0%
chris could you
arrange

00:35:42.829 --> 00:35:42.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.430 --> 00:35:45.440 align:start position:0%
that um she should be able to share if
 
00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:54.069 --> 00:35:54.079 align:start position:0%
can you see my screen
 
00:35:55.349 --> 00:35:55.359 align:start position:0%
we can
 
00:35:55.359 --> 00:35:56.950 align:start position:0%
we can
okay

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:59.510 align:start position:0%
okay
great

00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:36:01.109 --> 00:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
for the record melissa rollins senior
 
00:36:02.790 --> 00:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
financial analyst for the department of
 
00:36:04.710 --> 00:36:04.720 align:start position:0%
revenue um
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to focus on
 
00:36:09.190 --> 00:36:09.200 align:start position:0%
this section representative major to you
 
00:36:10.550 --> 00:36:10.560 align:start position:0%
to your question
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
you're correct um with the 50
 
00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:13.829 align:start position:0%
you're correct um with the 50
cap

00:36:13.829 --> 00:36:13.839 align:start position:0%
cap
 
00:36:16.630 --> 00:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
it is spread out if it's in one year
 
00:36:18.470 --> 00:36:18.480 align:start position:0%
if it affects one tax year it is spread
 
00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:20.960 align:start position:0%
out three to four tax years or three
 
00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
excuse me three to four fiscal years um
 
00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
based on taxpayers adjusting estimates
 
00:36:27.829 --> 00:36:27.839 align:start position:0%
and returns
 
00:36:29.510 --> 00:36:29.520 align:start position:0%
that can be seen
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
here this is the original impact in hb2
 
00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:35.920 align:start position:0%
so this affects one tax year and you can
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
see the impact is from 22 to 25
 
00:36:41.829 --> 00:36:41.839 align:start position:0%
depending on how taxpayers
 
00:36:41.839 --> 00:36:43.109 align:start position:0%
depending on how taxpayers
adjust

00:36:43.109 --> 00:36:43.119 align:start position:0%
adjust
 
00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:43.990 align:start position:0%
adjust
their

00:36:43.990 --> 00:36:44.000 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:36:47.109 --> 00:36:47.119 align:start position:0%
estimates and refunds
 
00:36:50.790 --> 00:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
just stay on that melissa just back up
 
00:36:52.790 --> 00:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
so that the first year
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
up to 30 million ahead
 
00:36:59.510 --> 00:36:59.520 align:start position:0%
the second year could be from five to 86
 
00:37:01.109 --> 00:37:01.119 align:start position:0%
million dollar hit
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
the third year 20 to 170 million dollar
 
00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:05.030 align:start position:0%
the third year 20 to 170 million dollar
head

00:37:05.030 --> 00:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
head
 
00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:07.200 align:start position:0%
and then the fourth year
 
00:37:10.470 --> 00:37:10.480 align:start position:0%
up to 25 million and then almost nothing
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%
that this year
 
00:37:13.750 --> 00:37:13.760 align:start position:0%
that's the way i read that
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:19.829 align:start position:0%
go ahead
so

00:37:19.829 --> 00:37:19.839 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:19.839 --> 00:37:20.870 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
following up with what
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
matt was speaking about we have done up
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
a couple additional options that are
 
00:37:31.109 --> 00:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
different from what's in hb2 um and it's
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
addressing the 100
 
00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:37.680 align:start position:0%
um cap on the liability and the 200 cap
 
00:37:39.270 --> 00:37:39.280 align:start position:0%
on the liability that matt was also
 
00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:40.640 align:start position:0%
speaking to
 
00:37:43.910 --> 00:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
so in this first scenario um that you
 
00:37:45.270 --> 00:37:45.280 align:start position:0%
see here
 
00:37:47.270 --> 00:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
this is addressing that and this looks
 
00:37:49.990 --> 00:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
at capping ccos at 200 percent of tax
 
00:37:52.950 --> 00:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
liability in tax year 22
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
and then it's a phased in approach a
 
00:37:58.230 --> 00:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of tax liability in tax
 
00:38:01.670 --> 00:38:01.680 align:start position:0%
year 2023 returns and then 75 for tax
 
00:38:05.349 --> 00:38:05.359 align:start position:0%
year 2024 and 50
 
00:38:09.030 --> 00:38:09.040 align:start position:0%
in 2025 and you can see this
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
spreads out the impact um for
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
several years uh versus the previous
 
00:38:17.990 --> 00:38:18.000 align:start position:0%
three to four years
 
00:38:19.829 --> 00:38:19.839 align:start position:0%
we could stop there
 
00:38:21.829 --> 00:38:21.839 align:start position:0%
and if you wanted to
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
come to a single number of the impact
 
00:38:28.310 --> 00:38:28.320 align:start position:0%
then if you just divided it by two it
 
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
would be a six million dollar impact the
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
first year uh
 
00:38:35.109 --> 00:38:35.119 align:start position:0%
about a 20 million dollar impact the
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
second year
 
00:38:39.589 --> 00:38:39.599 align:start position:0%
and then probably a 40 million dollar
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
impact the third year
 
00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.589 --> 00:38:49.599 align:start position:0%
probably about 30
 
00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
close to 30 million dollar impact
 
00:38:55.030 --> 00:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
and then the next year would be about
 
00:38:57.670 --> 00:38:57.680 align:start position:0%
a 20 million dollar impact
 
00:38:59.829 --> 00:38:59.839 align:start position:0%
and then the next year
 
00:39:02.069 --> 00:39:02.079 align:start position:0%
dropped out to about
 
00:39:03.829 --> 00:39:03.839 align:start position:0%
nine million dollar impact or ten
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
million times
 
00:39:07.430 --> 00:39:07.440 align:start position:0%
and then almost nothing the fifth year
 
00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:09.109 align:start position:0%
and then almost nothing the fifth year
okay

00:39:09.109 --> 00:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
yes i would only caution you on one area
 
00:39:15.430 --> 00:39:15.440 align:start position:0%
with doing the middle average
 
00:39:18.310 --> 00:39:18.320 align:start position:0%
we do know that the final reduction
 
00:39:21.030 --> 00:39:21.040 align:start position:0%
based on tax year 18 liability would
 
00:39:24.069 --> 00:39:24.079 align:start position:0%
need to be 137.3
 
00:39:26.069 --> 00:39:26.079 align:start position:0%
so i don't think you can use the average
 
00:39:28.630 --> 00:39:28.640 align:start position:0%
all the way down you'd have to
 
00:39:30.870 --> 00:39:30.880 align:start position:0%
if you if you assumed that the average
 
00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
would come in in the first couple of
 
00:39:35.349 --> 00:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
years then you would need to assume
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
high end on the next few years to get to
 
00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:38.440 align:start position:0%
a total of
 
00:39:41.510 --> 00:39:41.520 align:start position:0%
137.3 million in the final fiscal year
 
00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:43.270 align:start position:0%
137.3 million in the final fiscal year
okay

00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:39:44.950 --> 00:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
if that makes sense
 
00:39:46.470 --> 00:39:46.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:39:49.109 --> 00:39:49.119 align:start position:0%
okay and then the next option that we do
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
have based on conversations that we had
 
00:39:54.470 --> 00:39:54.480 align:start position:0%
in the previous committee meetings um
 
00:39:56.310 --> 00:39:56.320 align:start position:0%
was looking at maybe not going all the
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
way down to the 50 now that we are aware
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
that there are taxpayers with the large
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
ccos exceeding the hundred percent and
 
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:05.349 align:start position:0%
ccos exceeding the hundred percent and
200

00:40:05.349 --> 00:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
200
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
on their uh tax return
 
00:40:10.710 --> 00:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
is taking it to capping it at the bottom
 
00:40:12.390 --> 00:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
of a hundred percent so this would be a
 
00:40:14.790 --> 00:40:14.800 align:start position:0%
two-year phased-in approach
 
00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:18.079 align:start position:0%
with 200 percent capping at 200 for tax
 
00:40:18.079 --> 00:40:18.750 align:start position:0%
with 200 percent capping at 200 for tax
year

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:40:22.390 --> 00:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
2022 and then capping it at 100 for tax
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
year 2023
 
00:40:26.790 --> 00:40:26.800 align:start position:0%
and you can see
 
00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
this the first couple of years are
 
00:40:29.440 --> 00:40:30.710 align:start position:0%
this the first couple of years are
similar

00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:40:34.630 --> 00:40:34.640 align:start position:0%
to the chart that we just went over
 
00:40:36.790 --> 00:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
but then it doesn't drop as far
 
00:40:38.550 --> 00:40:38.560 align:start position:0%
where the end of fiscal impact instead
 
00:40:39.710 --> 00:40:39.720 align:start position:0%
of being
 
00:40:43.829 --> 00:40:43.839 align:start position:0%
137.3 million would instead be 92.3
 
00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:46.390 align:start position:0%
137.3 million would instead be 92.3
million

00:40:46.390 --> 00:40:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.349 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:40:47.349 --> 00:40:47.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:40:48.950 --> 00:40:48.960 align:start position:0%
rather than
 
00:40:51.750 --> 00:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
then we would be reducing our total
 
00:40:54.790 --> 00:40:54.800 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward from
 
00:40:57.589 --> 00:40:57.599 align:start position:0%
271 million 20 20
 
00:40:59.790 --> 00:40:59.800 align:start position:0%
down to almost
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
170 million
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:10.069 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh representative brownlee
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
well i uh let's just have the uh dana
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
react to this chart
 
00:41:20.309 --> 00:41:20.319 align:start position:0%
uh what i'm trying to understand my hand
 
00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:22.800 align:start position:0%
was up for dana from before
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
but uh i think this is a possible
 
00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:25.829 align:start position:0%
but uh i think this is a possible
solution

00:41:25.829 --> 00:41:25.839 align:start position:0%
solution
 
00:41:28.150 --> 00:41:28.160 align:start position:0%
uh and something we need to talk about
 
00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.430 align:start position:0%
uh and something we need to talk about
uh

00:41:29.430 --> 00:41:29.440 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:31.270 --> 00:41:31.280 align:start position:0%
you know picking one of these
 
00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.470 align:start position:0%
you know picking one of these
but

00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:41:34.950 --> 00:41:34.960 align:start position:0%
so let's just say that
 
00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
forget about these numbers for a moment
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
any number let's pick 125 million
 
00:41:40.950 --> 00:41:40.960 align:start position:0%
that that
 
00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.630 align:start position:0%
that that
uh

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
let's say we pick an option that results
 
00:41:47.030 --> 00:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
in 125 million dollars that has to and
 
00:41:48.950 --> 00:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
we have to write checks back
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
to the
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
to the taxpayers
 
00:41:55.670 --> 00:41:55.680 align:start position:0%
so on in the kafir
 
00:41:57.349 --> 00:41:57.359 align:start position:0%
what would that look like that hundred
 
00:41:59.349 --> 00:41:59.359 align:start position:0%
and twelve forty five million first off
 
00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:01.040 align:start position:0%
it's a cash issue because we have to
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
write checks
 
00:42:05.030 --> 00:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
back to the taxpayers 125 million we
 
00:42:06.870 --> 00:42:06.880 align:start position:0%
have to pay back and this is maybe this
 
00:42:09.190 --> 00:42:09.200 align:start position:0%
is a treasurer question as well
 
00:42:11.670 --> 00:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
but so if we have to do that
 
00:42:14.470 --> 00:42:14.480 align:start position:0%
what would that look like on the kafir
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
how would that appear i mean to me it's
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
it's an additional expense
 
00:42:20.710 --> 00:42:20.720 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't budgeted
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
unless we do decide to budget for this
 
00:42:27.829 --> 00:42:27.839 align:start position:0%
uh but uh can you explain how that would
 
00:42:29.589 --> 00:42:29.599 align:start position:0%
all work from an accounting standpoint
 
00:42:29.599 --> 00:42:31.109 align:start position:0%
all work from an accounting standpoint
dana

00:42:31.109 --> 00:42:31.119 align:start position:0%
dana
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for the question i do
 
00:42:36.150 --> 00:42:36.160 align:start position:0%
believe the so the revenue focus that
 
00:42:39.030 --> 00:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
you're accustomed to reviewing is our
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue reported net of
 
00:42:41.359 --> 00:42:42.630 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue reported net of
refunds

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:42.640 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
00:42:45.430 --> 00:42:45.440 align:start position:0%
so it's important to understand what the
 
00:42:47.910 --> 00:42:47.920 align:start position:0%
numbers you're seeing have already um
 
00:42:51.430 --> 00:42:51.440 align:start position:0%
any tax refunds that have been issued
 
00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:53.920 align:start position:0%
are already netted out of those numbers
 
00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:55.750 align:start position:0%
are already netted out of those numbers
um

00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:58.230 --> 00:42:58.240 align:start position:0%
that's the easiest way to explain it so
 
00:42:59.349 --> 00:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
similar which obviously
 
00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
spreading it out would be much better
 
00:43:06.230 --> 00:43:06.240 align:start position:0%
because it won't
 
00:43:08.710 --> 00:43:08.720 align:start position:0%
you know be an alarming difference
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
but we do have
 
00:43:12.470 --> 00:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
various um
 
00:43:15.190 --> 00:43:15.200 align:start position:0%
levels in our in our tax receipts each
 
00:43:17.349 --> 00:43:17.359 align:start position:0%
year and obviously 18 and 19 i just want
 
00:43:19.750 --> 00:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
to remind was a very high year so
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
um getting back to the
 
00:43:24.309 --> 00:43:24.319 align:start position:0%
the level of this overpayments in
 
00:43:26.710 --> 00:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
general business taxes were much higher
 
00:43:28.550 --> 00:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
in those years as well
 
00:43:30.550 --> 00:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
and so the overpayments is naturally
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
going to progress with that level of
 
00:43:35.270 --> 00:43:35.280 align:start position:0%
activity but this would um this would
 
00:43:37.109 --> 00:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
just be reported these overpayments
 
00:43:39.190 --> 00:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
would be net of our out of our
 
00:43:40.950 --> 00:43:40.960 align:start position:0%
unrestricted revenue numbers so you
 
00:43:42.390 --> 00:43:42.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily see it as an
 
00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.349 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily see it as an
expense

00:43:43.349 --> 00:43:43.359 align:start position:0%
expense
 
00:43:45.910 --> 00:43:45.920 align:start position:0%
um but we do provide a table in the
 
00:43:50.710 --> 00:43:50.720 align:start position:0%
focus of cash uh refunds for taxes so it
 
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:54.240 align:start position:0%
would be tracked and visible there
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:57.589 --> 00:43:57.599 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
 
00:43:57.599 --> 00:43:58.950 align:start position:0%
you're welcome
um

00:43:58.950 --> 00:43:58.960 align:start position:0%

um

do apologize
 
00:44:11.190 --> 00:44:11.200 align:start position:0%
am i the only person that doesn't
 
00:44:14.150 --> 00:44:14.160 align:start position:0%
understand these ranges
 
00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.190 align:start position:0%
understand these ranges
on

00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
that thank you why it is that that
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
somebody that has to take back three
 
00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
quarters of what is in their
 
00:44:28.550 --> 00:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
their uh
 
00:44:30.950 --> 00:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward
 
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.790 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward
from

00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:34.069 align:start position:0%
from
from

00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
year one or year two or whatever
 
00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.069 align:start position:0%
year one or year two or whatever
on

00:44:38.069 --> 00:44:38.079 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:40.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to take it back right away
 
00:44:44.550 --> 00:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
on are they allowed to to set up a
 
00:44:47.829 --> 00:44:47.839 align:start position:0%
schedule whereby they're going to do
 
00:44:47.839 --> 00:44:49.270 align:start position:0%
schedule whereby they're going to do
on

00:44:49.270 --> 00:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:50.710 align:start position:0%
on
lower

00:44:50.710 --> 00:44:50.720 align:start position:0%
lower
 
00:44:54.069 --> 00:44:54.079 align:start position:0%
estimate payments and lower payments for
 
00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
three four years is that what we're
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:45:00.710 --> 00:45:00.720 align:start position:0%
i represent this is carolyn lear
 
00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.589 align:start position:0%
i represent this is carolyn lear
um

00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:02.710 --> 00:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
so i
 
00:45:06.309 --> 00:45:06.319 align:start position:0%
i understand your confusion i think
 
00:45:09.349 --> 00:45:09.359 align:start position:0%
what is difficult about trying to
 
00:45:11.589 --> 00:45:11.599 align:start position:0%
predict how this will show up in
 
00:45:11.599 --> 00:45:12.710 align:start position:0%
predict how this will show up in
revenues

00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
00:45:15.190 --> 00:45:15.200 align:start position:0%
is that we actually just don't know
 
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:19.920 align:start position:0%
how taxpayers will respond we wouldn't
 
00:45:23.349 --> 00:45:23.359 align:start position:0%
quote unquote let them set up a schedule
 
00:45:25.750 --> 00:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
but certainly if a taxpayer knew that
 
00:45:27.750 --> 00:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
this change was coming
 
00:45:31.270 --> 00:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
we would expect some of them to choose
 
00:45:33.990 --> 00:45:34.000 align:start position:0%
to reduce their estimate payments
 
00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
um to avoid a situation where they were
 
00:45:39.430 --> 00:45:39.440 align:start position:0%
needlessly making estimate payments that
 
00:45:41.829 --> 00:45:41.839 align:start position:0%
were going to get refunded to them
 
00:45:43.910 --> 00:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
and that's why
 
00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
our analysis shows a impact in earlier
 
00:45:49.990 --> 00:45:50.000 align:start position:0%
years assuming that taxpayers would in
 
00:45:52.790 --> 00:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
fact start reducing their estimates
 
00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:55.040 align:start position:0%
certainly some taxpayers won't
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
change their behavior at all
 
00:45:59.750 --> 00:45:59.760 align:start position:0%
and those taxpayers
 
00:46:02.470 --> 00:46:02.480 align:start position:0%
wouldn't receive any of this money back
 
00:46:04.470 --> 00:46:04.480 align:start position:0%
until they ultimately filed their return
 
00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:06.240 align:start position:0%
and received a refund
 
00:46:09.270 --> 00:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
and that's why you also see the fiscal
 
00:46:12.150 --> 00:46:12.160 align:start position:0%
impact spread into later years
 
00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.109 align:start position:0%
impact spread into later years
um

00:46:13.109 --> 00:46:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
and so i think that's
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
sort of why it's difficult
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:46:21.910 --> 00:46:21.920 align:start position:0%
really pinpoint the year of impact for
 
00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:29.990 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:32.710 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

00:46:32.710 --> 00:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:34.870 --> 00:46:34.880 align:start position:0%
yes i still
 
00:46:37.349 --> 00:46:37.359 align:start position:0%
don't understand if we were using the
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
first on the original
 
00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:43.190 align:start position:0%
first on the original
charge

00:46:43.190 --> 00:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
charge
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.230 align:start position:0%
 
they

00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:46:53.430 --> 00:46:53.440 align:start position:0%
aren't they told in 2022
 
00:46:57.750 --> 00:46:57.760 align:start position:0%
that they have to take that money back
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
by the language or
 
00:47:03.109 --> 00:47:03.119 align:start position:0%
so the the language is applicable to
 
00:47:06.790 --> 00:47:06.800 align:start position:0%
taxes ending on or after december 31st
 
00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:08.630 align:start position:0%
taxes ending on or after december 31st
2023

00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
2023
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
so this is a 23 tax year um and so
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
taxpayers might decide to modify
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
their first quarterly estimate payments
 
00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:22.720 align:start position:0%
which would fall into fiscal year 2022
 
00:47:24.790 --> 00:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
but the remaining two estimate payments
 
00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
as well as their return payment would
 
00:47:32.069 --> 00:47:32.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so 2024 is when they
 
00:47:39.990 --> 00:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
would actually have to their tax year
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
23 which is our fiscal year 24 is when
 
00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:46.640 align:start position:0%
they would have to act
 
00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
and but they could start acting this
 
00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.549 align:start position:0%
and but they could start acting this
year

00:47:50.549 --> 00:47:50.559 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:47:54.470 --> 00:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.670 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:47:55.670 --> 00:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.670 align:start position:0%
representative
ames

00:47:57.670 --> 00:47:57.680 align:start position:0%
ames
 
00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
good thank you uh
 
00:48:03.030 --> 00:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
yeah mike my question goes back uh a
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
step here
 
00:48:04.319 --> 00:48:05.270 align:start position:0%
step here
um

00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:06.630 --> 00:48:06.640 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
00:48:08.870 --> 00:48:08.880 align:start position:0%
right now about uh
 
00:48:11.109 --> 00:48:11.119 align:start position:0%
sort of options for
 
00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:13.359 align:start position:0%
reducing the
 
00:48:15.910 --> 00:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
amount that's booked as uh a credit
 
00:48:18.549 --> 00:48:18.559 align:start position:0%
carryover um
 
00:48:20.790 --> 00:48:20.800 align:start position:0%
balance and uh
 
00:48:22.549 --> 00:48:22.559 align:start position:0%
i'd like to
 
00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:24.960 align:start position:0%
i'd like to be better informed on why we
 
00:48:26.710 --> 00:48:26.720 align:start position:0%
need to do this at all
 
00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:27.670 align:start position:0%
need to do this at all
um

00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
you know for years we've seen this
 
00:48:31.109 --> 00:48:31.119 align:start position:0%
credit carry over
 
00:48:33.190 --> 00:48:33.200 align:start position:0%
build up and
 
00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
to the credit if i may use that term of
 
00:48:38.790 --> 00:48:38.800 align:start position:0%
uh the chair uh he has
 
00:48:40.630 --> 00:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
expressed concern about that over the
 
00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:41.670 align:start position:0%
expressed concern about that over the
years

00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.630 align:start position:0%
years
um

00:48:42.630 --> 00:48:42.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:44.790 --> 00:48:44.800 align:start position:0%
so much so that i haven't forgotten that
 
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.990 align:start position:0%
so much so that i haven't forgotten that
um

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:46.829 align:start position:0%
um
and

00:48:46.829 --> 00:48:46.839 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:48:50.470 --> 00:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh and now here we are with a provision
 
00:48:52.069 --> 00:48:52.079 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
00:48:52.079 --> 00:48:52.870 align:start position:0%
in the budget
that

00:48:52.870 --> 00:48:52.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.910 align:start position:0%
that
uh

00:48:53.910 --> 00:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:55.620 --> 00:48:55.630 align:start position:0%
would mandate a
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:56.710 align:start position:0%
would mandate a
[Music]

00:48:56.710 --> 00:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:57.829 align:start position:0%
[Music]
reduction

00:48:57.829 --> 00:48:57.839 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:48:59.270 --> 00:48:59.280 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:49:01.910 --> 00:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
that balance and we're now discussing
 
00:49:04.470 --> 00:49:04.480 align:start position:0%
well maybe we don't have to
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
go quite so far maybe we can have have a
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
lesser cost that we'll have to
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
take account of in the budget
 
00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:14.390 align:start position:0%
take account of in the budget
um

00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
but uh are we sure that if we take that
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
lesser route then we'll be okay so what
 
00:49:22.790 --> 00:49:22.800 align:start position:0%
i'm asking what i what i'd like to see
 
00:49:24.549 --> 00:49:24.559 align:start position:0%
is the
 
00:49:24.559 --> 00:49:25.910 align:start position:0%
is the
um

00:49:25.910 --> 00:49:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
whatever information is available
 
00:49:30.710 --> 00:49:30.720 align:start position:0%
on this subject the
 
00:49:32.870 --> 00:49:32.880 align:start position:0%
comptroller said that
 
00:49:34.870 --> 00:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
the auditors have
 
00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720 align:start position:0%
quote passed
 
00:49:38.870 --> 00:49:38.880 align:start position:0%
unquote on this
 
00:49:40.470 --> 00:49:40.480 align:start position:0%
in uh
 
00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:42.800 align:start position:0%
in previous rounds of discussion around
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
the cafe but i've expressed concerns
 
00:49:48.390 --> 00:49:48.400 align:start position:0%
to the fiscal committee
 
00:49:50.150 --> 00:49:50.160 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen that
 
00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.670 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen that
discussion

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
00:49:53.910 --> 00:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
maybe i haven't been listening
 
00:49:55.510 --> 00:49:55.520 align:start position:0%
but i haven't seen it i don't know
 
00:49:58.470 --> 00:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
whether it's in writing but i'd like to
 
00:50:01.270 --> 00:50:01.280 align:start position:0%
see whatever there is and she also
 
00:50:03.030 --> 00:50:03.040 align:start position:0%
referred to
 
00:50:06.150 --> 00:50:06.160 align:start position:0%
an entire analysis that gets done each
 
00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:07.109 align:start position:0%
an entire analysis that gets done each
year

00:50:07.109 --> 00:50:07.119 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:09.349 --> 00:50:09.359 align:start position:0%
again i haven't seen that
 
00:50:11.109 --> 00:50:11.119 align:start position:0%
i'd really like to better understand
 
00:50:13.109 --> 00:50:13.119 align:start position:0%
this and get the best information that's
 
00:50:13.119 --> 00:50:14.549 align:start position:0%
this and get the best information that's
available

00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
available
 
00:50:17.750 --> 00:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
even if we reduce this
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
as is suggested to the lowest level
 
00:50:23.109 --> 00:50:23.119 align:start position:0%
the impact as i understand it on the
 
00:50:24.630 --> 00:50:24.640 align:start position:0%
budget would be
 
00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
let's say 20 million dollars 25 million
 
00:50:29.670 --> 00:50:29.680 align:start position:0%
dollars at the lowest
 
00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:33.520 align:start position:0%
level um for the next uh for the two
 
00:50:34.950 --> 00:50:34.960 align:start position:0%
years of the next
 
00:50:36.309 --> 00:50:36.319 align:start position:0%
next budget
 
00:50:39.030 --> 00:50:39.040 align:start position:0%
um well 25 million dollars if i've got
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
that right
 
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.349 align:start position:0%
that right
is

00:50:41.349 --> 00:50:41.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:50:44.150 --> 00:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of money i'm hearing from i
 
00:50:46.470 --> 00:50:46.480 align:start position:0%
imagine all of us are hearing from
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
members of the finance committee
 
00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
about their struggle to
 
00:50:52.950 --> 00:50:52.960 align:start position:0%
deal with
 
00:50:56.549 --> 00:50:56.559 align:start position:0%
the limitations of the
 
00:50:59.829 --> 00:50:59.839 align:start position:0%
revenues that they have to meet
 
00:51:01.430 --> 00:51:01.440 align:start position:0%
pressing needs
 
00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.309 align:start position:0%
pressing needs
so

00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:04.390 --> 00:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
if we're going to put if we're going to
 
00:51:07.030 --> 00:51:07.040 align:start position:0%
concur that something needs to be done
 
00:51:09.349 --> 00:51:09.359 align:start position:0%
and then try to figure out
 
00:51:12.069 --> 00:51:12.079 align:start position:0%
how much that is i think we need to be
 
00:51:12.079 --> 00:51:13.109 align:start position:0%
how much that is i think we need to be
on

00:51:13.109 --> 00:51:13.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
on footing that we understand and
 
00:51:17.750 --> 00:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
in truth i don't
 
00:51:19.510 --> 00:51:19.520 align:start position:0%
really understand right now the
 
00:51:22.549 --> 00:51:22.559 align:start position:0%
limitations and what the hazards are
 
00:51:23.910 --> 00:51:23.920 align:start position:0%
of uh
 
00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:26.480 align:start position:0%
of taking a different path if this is
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
something that needs to be addressed
 
00:51:30.150 --> 00:51:30.160 align:start position:0%
like i think it is something that needs
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
to be addressed i'll say that
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
from what i know
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
but my question then is what's available
 
00:51:38.790 --> 00:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
can we get better information on this
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
and i'd also like to know related to
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
that what other states are doing
 
00:51:46.390 --> 00:51:46.400 align:start position:0%
uh on this on this uh
 
00:51:48.829 --> 00:51:48.839 align:start position:0%
you know this
 
00:51:51.910 --> 00:51:51.920 align:start position:0%
phenomenon i'll call it a phenomenon
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
that occurs in the context of a very
 
00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:55.670 align:start position:0%
that occurs in the context of a very
complex

00:51:55.670 --> 00:51:55.680 align:start position:0%
complex
 
00:51:58.309 --> 00:51:58.319 align:start position:0%
tax collection and payment system
 
00:51:58.319 --> 00:51:59.589 align:start position:0%
tax collection and payment system
where

00:51:59.589 --> 00:51:59.599 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:52:02.150 --> 00:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
sort of uh it's it's a it's a moving
 
00:52:04.470 --> 00:52:04.480 align:start position:0%
target you've got estimates coming in
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
and there are estimates
 
00:52:08.549 --> 00:52:08.559 align:start position:0%
and then you've got a truing up process
 
00:52:11.270 --> 00:52:11.280 align:start position:0%
that occurs as new estimates are made
 
00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
and are flowing in
 
00:52:14.630 --> 00:52:14.640 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
so this cache that builds up one way or
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
another is it building up in the way it
 
00:52:21.349 --> 00:52:21.359 align:start position:0%
has been in new hampshire in other
 
00:52:21.359 --> 00:52:22.390 align:start position:0%
has been in new hampshire in other
states

00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.430 align:start position:0%
states
um

00:52:23.430 --> 00:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
so two
 
00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:26.309 align:start position:0%
so two
to

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:52:28.710 --> 00:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
two questions that are fairly
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
lengthy i'm sorry about that
 
00:52:33.030 --> 00:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
00:52:34.630 --> 00:52:34.640 align:start position:0%
i think representative
 
00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:40.710 --> 00:52:40.720 align:start position:0%
we need further clarification on why the
 
00:52:42.870 --> 00:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
audit is passed
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
and then the
 
00:52:49.109 --> 00:52:49.119 align:start position:0%
what is the analysis each year
 
00:52:51.109 --> 00:52:51.119 align:start position:0%
you should be able to understand that
 
00:52:51.119 --> 00:52:52.710 align:start position:0%
you should be able to understand that
better

00:52:52.710 --> 00:52:52.720 align:start position:0%
better
 
00:52:55.910 --> 00:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
and the results of those analysis so
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
maybe if the comptroller could respond
 
00:53:00.950 --> 00:53:00.960 align:start position:0%
to that
 
00:53:03.750 --> 00:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes um gladly thank you for the question
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
again that i think
 
00:53:08.309 --> 00:53:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames just explained um
 
00:53:11.190 --> 00:53:11.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what the struggle has been um it
 
00:53:14.069 --> 00:53:14.079 align:start position:0%
is a very complicated situation
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
what we a couple of things we do have
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
documentation i can certainly provide to
 
00:53:19.510 --> 00:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
we have a
 
00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:22.549 align:start position:0%
we have a
finding

00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
finding
 
00:53:25.030 --> 00:53:25.040 align:start position:0%
that came with the kafir presentation
 
00:53:26.150 --> 00:53:26.160 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
once we
 
00:53:30.150 --> 00:53:30.160 align:start position:0%
issued the fy20 kaffir they present that
 
00:53:32.390 --> 00:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
document to the fiscal committee and
 
00:53:34.390 --> 00:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:53:36.549 --> 00:53:36.559 align:start position:0%
goes along any findings that are of a
 
00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:38.720 align:start position:0%
significant magnitude and this is one of
 
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
significant magnitude and this is one of
them

00:53:39.670 --> 00:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
so for the last two years it has been
 
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:43.190 align:start position:0%
so for the last two years it has been
discussed

00:53:43.190 --> 00:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
discussed
 
00:53:44.470 --> 00:53:44.480 align:start position:0%
i think what
 
00:53:46.710 --> 00:53:46.720 align:start position:0%
in terms of why they passed on it is
 
00:53:48.870 --> 00:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
because with the analysis we've done
 
00:53:51.030 --> 00:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
which we can certainly provide copies of
 
00:53:52.630 --> 00:53:52.640 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
00:53:56.470 --> 00:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
it came down to a figure that was not
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
considered material to the state's
 
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.309 align:start position:0%
considered material to the state's
financial

00:54:00.309 --> 00:54:00.319 align:start position:0%
financial
 
00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
statements as a whole
 
00:54:04.230 --> 00:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
so again it's it's not that it's not a
 
00:54:06.390 --> 00:54:06.400 align:start position:0%
big number and that is why the auditors
 
00:54:10.309 --> 00:54:10.319 align:start position:0%
are concerned but from a a high-level
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
state's financial position as a whole
 
00:54:16.390 --> 00:54:16.400 align:start position:0%
booking or not booking this liability in
 
00:54:18.950 --> 00:54:18.960 align:start position:0%
the general fund would not sway
 
00:54:20.870 --> 00:54:20.880 align:start position:0%
the state's financial position as a
 
00:54:23.589 --> 00:54:23.599 align:start position:0%
whole so that is why they allowed us to
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
continue with our current accounting
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
practice and did not
 
00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:28.549 align:start position:0%
practice and did not
essentially

00:54:28.549 --> 00:54:28.559 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
00:54:31.030 --> 00:54:31.040 align:start position:0%
modify their opinion if they if they
 
00:54:34.150 --> 00:54:34.160 align:start position:0%
felt that this was unreasonable the
 
00:54:37.109 --> 00:54:37.119 align:start position:0%
auditors would modify their opinion
 
00:54:39.430 --> 00:54:39.440 align:start position:0%
and that would not be a good situation
 
00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:40.230 align:start position:0%
and that would not be a good situation
so

00:54:40.230 --> 00:54:40.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
we have been working with them on this
 
00:54:44.870 --> 00:54:44.880 align:start position:0%
providing as much documentation as we
 
00:54:47.589 --> 00:54:47.599 align:start position:0%
can but again it is it is an estimate
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
it's a moving target it's difficult to
 
00:54:52.230 --> 00:54:52.240 align:start position:0%
nail down exactly what the impact would
 
00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.109 align:start position:0%
nail down exactly what the impact would
be

00:54:53.109 --> 00:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
for all the reasons that have been
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
previously discussed
 
00:54:59.030 --> 00:54:59.040 align:start position:0%
so i think they
 
00:55:01.430 --> 00:55:01.440 align:start position:0%
they do believe strongly that the state
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
needs to do something
 
00:55:06.789 --> 00:55:06.799 align:start position:0%
i just want to clarify the the
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
item the the credit carry over the gross
 
00:55:11.990 --> 00:55:12.000 align:start position:0%
credit carryover is reported in an
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
annual report uh by the department of
 
00:55:17.510 --> 00:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
revenue but we haven't actually booked
 
00:55:19.750 --> 00:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
that liability in the kafir financial
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
statements in the audited financial
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
statements so that's that's the
 
00:55:25.829 --> 00:55:25.839 align:start position:0%
distinction it is it is a a known
 
00:55:28.630 --> 00:55:28.640 align:start position:0%
liability but technically unrecorded on
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
our books so that's problematic
 
00:55:33.750 --> 00:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
not completely unusual i mean there are
 
00:55:36.069 --> 00:55:36.079 align:start position:0%
instances when the state incurs
 
00:55:38.309 --> 00:55:38.319 align:start position:0%
liabilities that are unknown
 
00:55:41.030 --> 00:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh or just not material but
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
um when you talk about
 
00:55:52.230 --> 00:55:52.240 align:start position:0%
credit carry over
 
00:55:55.589 --> 00:55:55.599 align:start position:0%
more than a quarter of a billion dollars
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
and the auditors
 
00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:00.720 align:start position:0%
think that that's not
 
00:56:02.710 --> 00:56:02.720 align:start position:0%
that meaningful
 
00:56:05.829 --> 00:56:05.839 align:start position:0%
no it's it's that um that refers to the
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
gross uh
 
00:56:09.750 --> 00:56:09.760 align:start position:0%
just point in time so
 
00:56:11.910 --> 00:56:11.920 align:start position:0%
if you know the state were to shut down
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
today that would be everything we would
 
00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:16.640 align:start position:0%
owe to taxpayers obviously that's an
 
00:56:19.750 --> 00:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
unlikely scenario so what we what we
 
00:56:22.230 --> 00:56:22.240 align:start position:0%
analyze is how much of that gross
 
00:56:24.630 --> 00:56:24.640 align:start position:0%
liability is expected to get used in the
 
00:56:27.910 --> 00:56:27.920 align:start position:0%
short term as as as carolyn mentioned
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's it's an in and out type of building
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
liability and so we use up the oldest
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
and a new one gets created and when i
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
say we i mean the taxpayer when they
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
elect to utilize that
 
00:56:42.549 --> 00:56:42.559 align:start position:0%
uh liability so the auditors have um
 
00:56:44.950 --> 00:56:44.960 align:start position:0%
approved of our process in terms of
 
00:56:48.470 --> 00:56:48.480 align:start position:0%
analyzing that large number and coming
 
00:56:51.430 --> 00:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
up with a reasonable estimate of at june
 
00:56:54.230 --> 00:56:54.240 align:start position:0%
30 2020 what our true
 
00:56:56.230 --> 00:56:56.240 align:start position:0%
liability would be and that was in the
 
00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
range of 60 million dollars so the 60
 
00:57:01.510 --> 00:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
million dollar number is what they
 
00:57:03.990 --> 00:57:04.000 align:start position:0%
passed on and that's been the case the
 
00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:06.720 align:start position:0%
last two fiscal years
 
00:57:08.589 --> 00:57:08.599 align:start position:0%
up to up to 200
 
00:57:08.599 --> 00:57:10.549 align:start position:0%
up to up to 200
2017.

00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
00:57:11.390 --> 00:57:11.400 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
170 million dollars or less
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking 270 million
 
00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:18.390 align:start position:0%
and now we're talking 270 million
dollars

00:57:18.390 --> 00:57:18.400 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:57:21.109 --> 00:57:21.119 align:start position:0%
which is just a three-year period that's
 
00:57:23.430 --> 00:57:23.440 align:start position:0%
over a hundred million dollar
 
00:57:28.069 --> 00:57:28.079 align:start position:0%
it's not a 60 million dollar issue
 
00:57:28.079 --> 00:57:29.109 align:start position:0%
it's not a 60 million dollar issue
agreed

00:57:29.109 --> 00:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
agreed
 
00:57:31.270 --> 00:57:31.280 align:start position:0%
again what what the
 
00:57:35.030 --> 00:57:35.040 align:start position:0%
gross liability has grown with the
 
00:57:37.589 --> 00:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
tax base so our taxes that we've
 
00:57:40.069 --> 00:57:40.079 align:start position:0%
collected over the last three years if
 
00:57:44.470 --> 00:57:44.480 align:start position:0%
you compare fy 17 to 20 have also grown
 
00:57:46.309 --> 00:57:46.319 align:start position:0%
exponentially so
 
00:57:46.319 --> 00:57:47.190 align:start position:0%
exponentially so
that

00:57:47.190 --> 00:57:47.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:57:50.069 --> 00:57:50.079 align:start position:0%
gross carryover number has grown
 
00:57:52.150 --> 00:57:52.160 align:start position:0%
and they are concerned
 
00:57:55.109 --> 00:57:55.119 align:start position:0%
but they understood our analysis
 
00:57:56.230 --> 00:57:56.240 align:start position:0%
which was
 
00:57:59.109 --> 00:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
attributable to just fiscal 20 so when
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
they look at a liability they look at
 
00:58:03.510 --> 00:58:03.520 align:start position:0%
what would we have to pay out
 
00:58:05.670 --> 00:58:05.680 align:start position:0%
in the short term and that was the 60
 
00:58:08.390 --> 00:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
million number so the larger number is
 
00:58:09.990 --> 00:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
more of a long-term
 
00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:11.030 align:start position:0%
more of a long-term
view

00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
view
 
00:58:14.710 --> 00:58:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.829 --> 00:58:17.839 align:start position:0%
yes we can provide that information
 
00:58:17.839 --> 00:58:18.950 align:start position:0%
yes we can provide that information
um

00:58:18.950 --> 00:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:23.990 align:start position:0%
um
representative

00:58:23.990 --> 00:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:26.390 --> 00:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chair i had a couple of
 
00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:27.430 align:start position:0%
ah thank you mr chair i had a couple of
questions

00:58:27.430 --> 00:58:27.440 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:29.670 align:start position:0%
questions
um

00:58:29.670 --> 00:58:29.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:31.589 --> 00:58:31.599 align:start position:0%
previously it was stated that no other
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
state has
 
00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:36.480 align:start position:0%
a cap as this budget suggests
 
00:58:38.950 --> 00:58:38.960 align:start position:0%
what language is available from other
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
states is one thing i'd like to know
 
00:58:41.280 --> 00:58:43.030 align:start position:0%
states is one thing i'd like to know
and

00:58:43.030 --> 00:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:45.589 --> 00:58:45.599 align:start position:0%
following up on that is it appears to me
 
00:58:48.789 --> 00:58:48.799 align:start position:0%
that companies would put money or would
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
pay money on an estimated tax
 
00:58:54.309 --> 00:58:54.319 align:start position:0%
in a good year in order to have money
 
00:58:54.319 --> 00:58:55.349 align:start position:0%
in a good year in order to have money
there

00:58:55.349 --> 00:58:55.359 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:58:56.710 --> 00:58:56.720 align:start position:0%
in a bad year
 
00:58:59.510 --> 00:58:59.520 align:start position:0%
so wouldn't this
 
00:59:01.030 --> 00:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
be very very delatorious to business
 
00:59:06.549 --> 00:59:06.559 align:start position:0%
operations it seems to me would be
 
00:59:08.710 --> 00:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
hitting them with uh
 
00:59:10.710 --> 00:59:10.720 align:start position:0%
both they would money being paid back to
 
00:59:12.950 --> 00:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
them which they'd have to pay for
 
00:59:14.789 --> 00:59:14.799 align:start position:0%
and then they wouldn't have money hidden
 
00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:17.440 align:start position:0%
away to pay for a bad year
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:24.630 --> 00:59:24.640 align:start position:0%
representative early i can i can take
 
00:59:26.549 --> 00:59:26.559 align:start position:0%
that or at least parts of it
 
00:59:26.559 --> 00:59:27.510 align:start position:0%
that or at least parts of it
um

00:59:27.510 --> 00:59:27.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:29.270 --> 00:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i guess just to take this all a step
 
00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:30.069 align:start position:0%
and i guess just to take this all a step
back

00:59:30.069 --> 00:59:30.079 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
different ways that we could address a
 
00:59:35.270 --> 00:59:35.280 align:start position:0%
problem like this
 
00:59:37.829 --> 00:59:37.839 align:start position:0%
in one sense we could change our
 
00:59:40.470 --> 00:59:40.480 align:start position:0%
accounting process right to book this
 
00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:41.910 align:start position:0%
accounting process right to book this
liability

00:59:41.910 --> 00:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
liability
 
00:59:43.829 --> 00:59:43.839 align:start position:0%
that would satisfy some of the concerns
 
00:59:45.750 --> 00:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
have been raised by the auditors
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
the alternative and what
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
hb2 proposes to do
 
00:59:52.630 --> 00:59:52.640 align:start position:0%
is to reduce that liability
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
so that it is less of an issue under our
 
00:59:57.750 --> 00:59:57.760 align:start position:0%
current accounting procedure so those
 
00:59:59.510 --> 00:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
are the two different options you could
 
01:00:01.510 --> 01:00:01.520 align:start position:0%
do one or the other
 
01:00:02.789 --> 01:00:02.799 align:start position:0%
or in theory you could do them in
 
01:00:02.799 --> 01:00:03.910 align:start position:0%
or in theory you could do them in
concert

01:00:03.910 --> 01:00:03.920 align:start position:0%
concert
 
01:00:05.670 --> 01:00:05.680 align:start position:0%
but there are two ways to to look at
 
01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.710 align:start position:0%
but there are two ways to to look at
this

01:00:06.710 --> 01:00:06.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:00:08.309 --> 01:00:08.319 align:start position:0%
uh representative really to your
 
01:00:08.319 --> 01:00:09.430 align:start position:0%
uh representative really to your
question

01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:12.319 align:start position:0%
yes a business can put away more money
 
01:00:15.349 --> 01:00:15.359 align:start position:0%
in a good year but the other side of
 
01:00:18.069 --> 01:00:18.079 align:start position:0%
that in a bad year they have less of a
 
01:00:21.030 --> 01:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
tax liability because they had a bad
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
year so it
 
01:00:24.309 --> 01:00:24.319 align:start position:0%
it does kind of go in both directions
 
01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:25.520 align:start position:0%
there right you don't necessarily need
 
01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:26.720 align:start position:0%
to put money
 
01:00:29.670 --> 01:00:29.680 align:start position:0%
or overpay the state for those economic
 
01:00:32.630 --> 01:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
downturns because your your liability is
 
01:00:39.589 --> 01:00:39.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:42.950 --> 01:00:42.960 align:start position:0%
not quite sure that's accurate thank you
 
01:00:44.950 --> 01:00:44.960 align:start position:0%
for your information like the background
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
by the way
 
01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:47.430 align:start position:0%
by the way
cameron

01:00:47.430 --> 01:00:47.440 align:start position:0%
cameron
 
01:00:49.510 --> 01:00:49.520 align:start position:0%
major i had a follow-up on my earlier
 
01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.870 align:start position:0%
major i had a follow-up on my earlier
question

01:00:50.870 --> 01:00:50.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:53.760 align:start position:0%
and i somehow became muted and
 
01:00:55.270 --> 01:00:55.280 align:start position:0%
so if i could
 
01:00:56.950 --> 01:00:56.960 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:00:59.910 --> 01:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
it's really it's a it's a
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
it i had a second question
 
01:01:04.150 --> 01:01:04.160 align:start position:0%
representative uhler actually flagged it
 
01:01:05.670 --> 01:01:05.680 align:start position:0%
also is
 
01:01:07.910 --> 01:01:07.920 align:start position:0%
other states and what's happening in
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:01:11.990 --> 01:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of credit carry over build up
 
01:01:13.109 --> 01:01:13.119 align:start position:0%
or not
 
01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
and uh representative uhlery
 
01:01:17.349 --> 01:01:17.359 align:start position:0%
appropriately sort of expanded that
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
question to other states uh
 
01:01:22.309 --> 01:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
legal response to
 
01:01:22.319 --> 01:01:23.109 align:start position:0%
legal response to
the

01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:01:26.069 --> 01:01:26.079 align:start position:0%
potential of such a such a buildup how
 
01:01:29.910 --> 01:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.829 --> 01:01:31.839 align:start position:0%
hi representative this is carolyn from
 
01:01:35.589 --> 01:01:35.599 align:start position:0%
the dra if i might um i think what you
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
heard from dana is a discussion
 
01:01:42.549 --> 01:01:42.559 align:start position:0%
a bit ago about whether or not
 
01:01:45.190 --> 01:01:45.200 align:start position:0%
the amount that we calculate to be the
 
01:01:48.870 --> 01:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
cco liability is material as it relates
 
01:01:49.829 --> 01:01:49.839 align:start position:0%
to the
 
01:01:53.190 --> 01:01:53.200 align:start position:0%
state's overall revenue and i think why
 
01:01:55.589 --> 01:01:55.599 align:start position:0%
this isn't so much of an issue in other
 
01:01:57.990 --> 01:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
states is because
 
01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:01.520 align:start position:0%
one their business tax um
 
01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:03.680 align:start position:0%
business taxes make up much smaller
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
profit of their overall tax base
 
01:02:09.109 --> 01:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
and they have many more
 
01:02:11.829 --> 01:02:11.839 align:start position:0%
tax-based revenue streams
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
and so although this situation occurs in
 
01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:16.720 align:start position:0%
other states
 
01:02:19.829 --> 01:02:19.839 align:start position:0%
because business taxes are much less
 
01:02:21.589 --> 01:02:21.599 align:start position:0%
important to them
 
01:02:25.430 --> 01:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
the cco issue simply isn't material to
 
01:02:26.870 --> 01:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
their overall
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
financial position
 
01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.069 align:start position:0%
financial position
um

01:02:30.069 --> 01:02:30.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
which is why we have been unable i
 
01:02:34.549 --> 01:02:34.559 align:start position:0%
suggest um
 
01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
much from other states on this issue
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
it's sort of unique to us
 
01:02:41.430 --> 01:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
you've asked but you've not been able to
 
01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880 align:start position:0%
get anything
 
01:02:44.150 --> 01:02:44.160 align:start position:0%
that's accurate
 
01:02:46.470 --> 01:02:46.480 align:start position:0%
we we participate in a number of various
 
01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
um tax administration consortiums and
 
01:02:50.470 --> 01:02:50.480 align:start position:0%
groups and we've sent out this question
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
to list serves and haven't got much
 
01:02:54.950 --> 01:02:54.960 align:start position:0%
helpful in return good that's what i
 
01:02:57.829 --> 01:02:57.839 align:start position:0%
needed to know thank you all set up
 
01:02:57.839 --> 01:03:02.470 align:start position:0%
needed to know thank you all set up
yes

01:03:02.470 --> 01:03:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
um at the point i put my hand up we
 
01:03:08.309 --> 01:03:08.319 align:start position:0%
hadn't really shifted away from the
 
01:03:10.549 --> 01:03:10.559 align:start position:0%
liquidity questions to the accounting
 
01:03:10.559 --> 01:03:12.150 align:start position:0%
liquidity questions to the accounting
questions

01:03:12.150 --> 01:03:12.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:03:13.829 --> 01:03:13.839 align:start position:0%
but i think we need to have both of them
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
in the balance here
 
01:03:17.829 --> 01:03:17.839 align:start position:0%
and and anything you do may
 
01:03:19.270 --> 01:03:19.280 align:start position:0%
tend to affect
 
01:03:21.670 --> 01:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
liquidity more favorably accounting less
 
01:03:24.710 --> 01:03:24.720 align:start position:0%
favorably and vice versa
 
01:03:27.990 --> 01:03:28.000 align:start position:0%
so it seems to me it's very conventional
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
in taxation to have estimates which are
 
01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:32.960 align:start position:0%
just guesses
 
01:03:37.029 --> 01:03:37.039 align:start position:0%
and uh to then have an excess and
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
to leave it on account instead if to ask
 
01:03:40.230 --> 01:03:40.240 align:start position:0%
for a refund
 
01:03:41.670 --> 01:03:41.680 align:start position:0%
what seems to me here to be
 
01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.510 align:start position:0%
what seems to me here to be
unconventional

01:03:43.510 --> 01:03:43.520 align:start position:0%
unconventional
 
01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280 align:start position:0%
is the magnitude of it as matthew
 
01:03:47.270 --> 01:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
indicated there are examples
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
where business taxpayers have 200 to 300
 
01:03:50.559 --> 01:03:51.829 align:start position:0%
where business taxpayers have 200 to 300
percent

01:03:51.829 --> 01:03:51.839 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:03:54.789 --> 01:03:54.799 align:start position:0%
of their expected next year liability on
 
01:03:54.799 --> 01:03:56.069 align:start position:0%
of their expected next year liability on
account

01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:03:58.390 --> 01:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
and we've certainly seen a lot of growth
 
01:04:00.150 --> 01:04:00.160 align:start position:0%
in the last four years so
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
to state the obvious
 
01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
it's not just a question of a hit on
 
01:04:07.029 --> 01:04:07.039 align:start position:0%
revenue in the next several years but
 
01:04:09.109 --> 01:04:09.119 align:start position:0%
clearly we've been booking inflated
 
01:04:09.119 --> 01:04:10.470 align:start position:0%
clearly we've been booking inflated
revenue

01:04:10.470 --> 01:04:10.480 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
for at least the last four years
 
01:04:14.390 --> 01:04:14.400 align:start position:0%
every time this escalates
 
01:04:16.230 --> 01:04:16.240 align:start position:0%
we're essentially claiming more revenue
 
01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:17.029 align:start position:0%
we're essentially claiming more revenue
than

01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:04:19.589 --> 01:04:19.599 align:start position:0%
we believe and that deceives us
 
01:04:21.910 --> 01:04:21.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh you know what assumptions
 
01:04:23.430 --> 01:04:23.440 align:start position:0%
we make in the finance committee for
 
01:04:23.440 --> 01:04:25.109 align:start position:0%
we make in the finance committee for
spending

01:04:25.109 --> 01:04:25.119 align:start position:0%
spending
 
01:04:26.870 --> 01:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
so i guess my question while we're
 
01:04:29.430 --> 01:04:29.440 align:start position:0%
trying to solve this overhang
 
01:04:31.829 --> 01:04:31.839 align:start position:0%
is what are we going to do to solve or
 
01:04:31.839 --> 01:04:32.549 align:start position:0%
is what are we going to do to solve or
or

01:04:32.549 --> 01:04:32.559 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:04:34.870 --> 01:04:34.880 align:start position:0%
change our practices
 
01:04:36.549 --> 01:04:36.559 align:start position:0%
uh incrementally
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
uh it's one thing to say that there's a
 
01:04:44.150 --> 01:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
an estimate process and a surplus
 
01:04:46.069 --> 01:04:46.079 align:start position:0%
or a carry forward
 
01:04:47.829 --> 01:04:47.839 align:start position:0%
but it's an entirely different thing to
 
01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
say we don't book it
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
so why don't we have an annual
 
01:04:55.109 --> 01:04:55.119 align:start position:0%
reconciliation the estimates come in in
 
01:04:57.510 --> 01:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
quarters and at the end of the year
 
01:04:59.670 --> 01:04:59.680 align:start position:0%
a calculation is done and at least on
 
01:05:02.069 --> 01:05:02.079 align:start position:0%
that incremental basis for the year that
 
01:05:04.549 --> 01:05:04.559 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
01:05:07.270 --> 01:05:07.280 align:start position:0%
why don't we book the liability
 
01:05:09.510 --> 01:05:09.520 align:start position:0%
so i think coupled with this question of
 
01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
how to work off the overhang
 
01:05:17.829 --> 01:05:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:22.390 --> 01:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
and i can respond to that if you'd like
 
01:05:25.829 --> 01:05:25.839 align:start position:0%
um it's a great a great synopsis and it
 
01:05:28.470 --> 01:05:28.480 align:start position:0%
has that has been the the struggle
 
01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:29.349 align:start position:0%
has that has been the the struggle
um

01:05:29.349 --> 01:05:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:31.829 --> 01:05:31.839 align:start position:0%
we could book the entry
 
01:05:34.309 --> 01:05:34.319 align:start position:0%
and it would it would affect our surplus
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
that we report in our audited financial
 
01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:37.670 align:start position:0%
that we report in our audited financial
statements

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
statements
 
01:05:40.309 --> 01:05:40.319 align:start position:0%
what what path comptrollers have tried
 
01:05:42.710 --> 01:05:42.720 align:start position:0%
to avoid is sort of
 
01:05:45.990 --> 01:05:46.000 align:start position:0%
a concept of two sets of books so
 
01:05:47.029 --> 01:05:47.039 align:start position:0%
you make
 
01:05:49.910 --> 01:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
decisions budgetarily based on certain
 
01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:52.000 align:start position:0%
revenue estimates and we track how we do
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
with that if you have a large
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
end-of-year liability that sort of
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
throws all of that out and then reduces
 
01:06:02.470 --> 01:06:02.480 align:start position:0%
your surplus significantly there is a
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
thought process that over time
 
01:06:07.670 --> 01:06:07.680 align:start position:0%
budget writers will will sort of um
 
01:06:09.190 --> 01:06:09.200 align:start position:0%
discount that
 
01:06:11.670 --> 01:06:11.680 align:start position:0%
and add that back in
 
01:06:13.829 --> 01:06:13.839 align:start position:0%
in their minds so what we've tried to
 
01:06:15.829 --> 01:06:15.839 align:start position:0%
avoid is having an
 
01:06:18.549 --> 01:06:18.559 align:start position:0%
audited gap-based financial statement
 
01:06:21.510 --> 01:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
surplus number and a separate budgetary
 
01:06:23.670 --> 01:06:23.680 align:start position:0%
base or plus number we we've always
 
01:06:25.829 --> 01:06:25.839 align:start position:0%
wanted them to be consistent
 
01:06:25.839 --> 01:06:26.870 align:start position:0%
wanted them to be consistent
so

01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
there has not been a push to make this
 
01:06:32.069 --> 01:06:32.079 align:start position:0%
large end of year
 
01:06:36.150 --> 01:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
as you say reconciliation type entry
 
01:06:39.190 --> 01:06:39.200 align:start position:0%
just to avoid that thought over the over
 
01:06:41.910 --> 01:06:41.920 align:start position:0%
time becoming two different sets of
 
01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:43.349 align:start position:0%
time becoming two different sets of
numbers

01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:06:46.470 --> 01:06:46.480 align:start position:0%
if that helps
 
01:06:48.390 --> 01:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
i i guess i understand the thought
 
01:06:50.390 --> 01:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
process but it's sort of like we don't
 
01:06:52.549 --> 01:06:52.559 align:start position:0%
want to make the number
 
01:06:54.870 --> 01:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
explicit and vivid because they might
 
01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440 align:start position:0%
discount it versus let's hide it and be
 
01:07:01.670 --> 01:07:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:03.829 --> 01:07:03.839 align:start position:0%
right i mean i think from an accountant
 
01:07:06.470 --> 01:07:06.480 align:start position:0%
purely accountant standpoint uh booking
 
01:07:09.029 --> 01:07:09.039 align:start position:0%
the liability is the right thing to do
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
purely from the accounting standards but
 
01:07:13.270 --> 01:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
again then then you turn to the
 
01:07:16.150 --> 01:07:16.160 align:start position:0%
materiality discussion and with any type
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
of entry like this there's a
 
01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:20.480 align:start position:0%
determination by management and the
 
01:07:23.670 --> 01:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
auditors if it would materially change
 
01:07:25.430 --> 01:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
people's views of the financial
 
01:07:27.589 --> 01:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
statements again like you said we've
 
01:07:30.230 --> 01:07:30.240 align:start position:0%
potentially over collected so we've
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
reporting somewhat inflated revenue
 
01:07:34.309 --> 01:07:34.319 align:start position:0%
numbers and
 
01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:36.319 align:start position:0%
if we were to change that or would we
 
01:07:38.710 --> 01:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
would we materially change
 
01:07:41.349 --> 01:07:41.359 align:start position:0%
the user's view of our audit single
 
01:07:43.589 --> 01:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
statements and again with the number
 
01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
that we're talking
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
um from uh
 
01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:51.119 align:start position:0%
after we analyze the true liability um
 
01:07:53.029 --> 01:07:53.039 align:start position:0%
it has not been
 
01:07:55.750 --> 01:07:55.760 align:start position:0%
our view that it would materially change
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
a reader's view of the state's position
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
so danger if i understand that
 
01:08:03.670 --> 01:08:03.680 align:start position:0%
if you book it that's the correct thing
 
01:08:05.750 --> 01:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
to do if you don't book it and you keep
 
01:08:08.549 --> 01:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
the process the way it is it's more of a
 
01:08:08.559 --> 01:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
the process the way it is it's more of a
political

01:08:11.510 --> 01:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
political
 
01:08:14.390 --> 01:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
action that we take
 
01:08:15.670 --> 01:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
right i don't want to use the term
 
01:08:18.550 --> 01:08:18.560 align:start position:0%
correct or not correct because in all
 
01:08:19.749 --> 01:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
ways we
 
01:08:22.630 --> 01:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
we strive to follow
 
01:08:25.349 --> 01:08:25.359 align:start position:0%
gap accounting standards and we have an
 
01:08:27.510 --> 01:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
audited opinion that says in all
 
01:08:29.829 --> 01:08:29.839 align:start position:0%
material respects we do
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
so it is a political discussion
 
01:08:35.269 --> 01:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
01:08:37.430 --> 01:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
again there are certain
 
01:08:39.349 --> 01:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
view the surplus statement which is not
 
01:08:40.950 --> 01:08:40.960 align:start position:0%
an audited financial statement but it's
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
a highly used surplus statement
 
01:08:45.269 --> 01:08:45.279 align:start position:0%
in our financial statements
 
01:08:47.590 --> 01:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
the reality of that is that is the
 
01:08:51.189 --> 01:08:51.199 align:start position:0%
document that budget writers rely on
 
01:08:53.189 --> 01:08:53.199 align:start position:0%
so there has always been a political
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
side to this discussion
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
okay um any further questions on
 
01:09:03.189 --> 01:09:03.199 align:start position:0%
on this part if not i'm going to go to
 
01:09:03.199 --> 01:09:04.829 align:start position:0%
on this part if not i'm going to go to
represent

01:09:04.829 --> 01:09:04.839 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:09:06.870 --> 01:09:06.880 align:start position:0%

01:09:12.870 --> 01:09:12.880 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein thank you mr
 
01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.669 align:start position:0%
representative bernstein thank you mr
chair

01:09:13.669 --> 01:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
chair
 
01:09:16.309 --> 01:09:16.319 align:start position:0%
my question is from matthew twice during
 
01:09:18.070 --> 01:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
your opening remarks
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
you said uh for one reason or another
 
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.870 align:start position:0%
you said uh for one reason or another
companies

01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
have uh
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
remitted maybe two or they haven't
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
carried forward account 200 maybe 300
 
01:09:32.070 --> 01:09:32.080 align:start position:0%
percent of the tax liability
 
01:09:34.709 --> 01:09:34.719 align:start position:0%
one reason would be to minimize the
 
01:09:36.789 --> 01:09:36.799 align:start position:0%
federal tax liability are there other
 
01:09:39.669 --> 01:09:39.679 align:start position:0%
reasons why companies do this it just
 
01:09:39.679 --> 01:09:40.550 align:start position:0%
reasons why companies do this it just
seems

01:09:40.550 --> 01:09:40.560 align:start position:0%
seems
 
01:09:42.550 --> 01:09:42.560 align:start position:0%
unconscionable to have a whole pile of
 
01:09:44.709 --> 01:09:44.719 align:start position:0%
cash sitting in concord
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
when it could be in your own corporate
 
01:09:46.319 --> 01:09:47.349 align:start position:0%
when it could be in your own corporate
treasury

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
treasury
 
01:09:50.630 --> 01:09:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i would also invite dra to respond
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
but i think certainly you know if you
 
01:09:55.110 --> 01:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
want to mute your federal tax liability
 
01:09:57.430 --> 01:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
this is one way to do it the other thing
 
01:10:00.390 --> 01:10:00.400 align:start position:0%
to think about with large multinational
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
companies that file taxes in
 
01:10:05.030 --> 01:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
you know 50 different countries in 50
 
01:10:07.189 --> 01:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
different states new hampshire is just
 
01:10:09.669 --> 01:10:09.679 align:start position:0%
such a small piece of their
 
01:10:11.669 --> 01:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
overall tax
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
that it becomes a rounding error in some
 
01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:15.110 align:start position:0%
that it becomes a rounding error in some
instances

01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
instances
 
01:10:17.350 --> 01:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
so it's one of those things that it's
 
01:10:19.590 --> 01:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
easy to look at new hampshire you know
 
01:10:22.390 --> 01:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
as the the state officials that that you
 
01:10:23.910 --> 01:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
all are and you think we're the most
 
01:10:26.950 --> 01:10:26.960 align:start position:0%
important thing but for a fortune 500
 
01:10:28.709 --> 01:10:28.719 align:start position:0%
it might be a fraction of one percent of
 
01:10:30.550 --> 01:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
what they pay in tax
 
01:10:32.149 --> 01:10:32.159 align:start position:0%
um and it might just not have that same
 
01:10:33.669 --> 01:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
weight but carolyn if you have other
 
01:10:37.110 --> 01:10:37.120 align:start position:0%
thoughts on scenarios
 
01:10:39.030 --> 01:10:39.040 align:start position:0%
i think you have it exactly right matt
 
01:10:41.590 --> 01:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
it's i if you look at the demographic of
 
01:10:44.229 --> 01:10:44.239 align:start position:0%
taxpayer who has the most egregiously
 
01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.270 align:start position:0%
taxpayer who has the most egregiously
large

01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
large
 
01:10:48.709 --> 01:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
cco on account at the taxpayer that new
 
01:10:51.270 --> 01:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
hampshire's impact on their overall tax
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
picture is very very small
 
01:10:56.630 --> 01:10:56.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:59.270 --> 01:10:59.280 align:start position:0%
hey and carolyn
 
01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:00.149 align:start position:0%
hey and carolyn
how

01:11:00.149 --> 01:11:00.159 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:11:00.159 --> 01:11:01.110 align:start position:0%
how
high

01:11:01.110 --> 01:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
high
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
does the older payment go
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
melissa i don't know if you have the
 
01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:10.070 align:start position:0%
melissa i don't know if you have the
highest

01:11:10.070 --> 01:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
highest
 
01:11:11.750 --> 01:11:11.760 align:start position:0%
available to you right now to answer
 
01:11:16.229 --> 01:11:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:18.000 align:start position:0%
i don't have it in front of me at the
 
01:11:20.709 --> 01:11:20.719 align:start position:0%
moment but i can say there were um there
 
01:11:22.470 --> 01:11:22.480 align:start position:0%
were ones that were in the thousand to
 
01:11:24.149 --> 01:11:24.159 align:start position:0%
two thousand percent
 
01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
uh over the tax liability
 
01:11:29.669 --> 01:11:29.679 align:start position:0%
so it's all over the place
 
01:11:31.350 --> 01:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
it really is
 
01:11:34.790 --> 01:11:34.800 align:start position:0%
i think with the 102 or 200 you're
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
capturing the bulk of them the rest are
 
01:11:38.950 --> 01:11:38.960 align:start position:0%
probably outliers but they are they are
 
01:11:40.630 --> 01:11:40.640 align:start position:0%
there are some rather high ones out
 
01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:43.030 align:start position:0%
there are some rather high ones out
there

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.950 --> 01:11:44.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:11:46.950 --> 01:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
all right uh
 
01:11:50.310 --> 01:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:52.229 --> 01:11:52.239 align:start position:0%
another one that hasn't asked a question
 
01:11:56.709 --> 01:11:56.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:01.030 --> 01:12:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:04.229 --> 01:12:04.239 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman uh it's in regard
 
01:12:05.669 --> 01:12:05.679 align:start position:0%
to what
 
01:12:07.669 --> 01:12:07.679 align:start position:0%
representative ames said a few minutes
 
01:12:07.679 --> 01:12:08.550 align:start position:0%
representative ames said a few minutes
ago

01:12:08.550 --> 01:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
ago
 
01:12:10.709 --> 01:12:10.719 align:start position:0%
about why are we dealing with this at
 
01:12:10.719 --> 01:12:11.669 align:start position:0%
about why are we dealing with this at
all

01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:12:15.910 --> 01:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
so my question to you mr chairman is
 
01:12:19.510 --> 01:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
what exactly is our responsibility as
 
01:12:22.870 --> 01:12:22.880 align:start position:0%
the ways and means committee to do about
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
this situation are we going to have a
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor whether we're going
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
to go this way or that way or
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
are we just going to
 
01:12:34.310 --> 01:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
drop the whole issue all together
 
01:12:36.709 --> 01:12:36.719 align:start position:0%
as i started this discussion this
 
01:12:36.719 --> 01:12:39.510 align:start position:0%
as i started this discussion this
morning

01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
we

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:40.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:12:42.709 --> 01:12:42.719 align:start position:0%
called our comptroller treasurer and the
 
01:12:44.550 --> 01:12:44.560 align:start position:0%
dra together
 
01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
so we can better understand
 
01:12:50.709 --> 01:12:50.719 align:start position:0%
the legality of what's going on
 
01:12:52.470 --> 01:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
and is it a good
 
01:12:52.480 --> 01:12:53.590 align:start position:0%
and is it a good
practice

01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
practice
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
in our other states
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
practicing it the same way we are
 
01:12:59.910 --> 01:12:59.920 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:13:02.709 --> 01:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
also is there another if we continue
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
with this
 
01:13:06.470 --> 01:13:06.480 align:start position:0%
is there another way that we can do this
 
01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:07.910 align:start position:0%
is there another way that we can do this
which

01:13:07.910 --> 01:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
which
 
01:13:10.229 --> 01:13:10.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't make such an impact on our
 
01:13:10.239 --> 01:13:11.510 align:start position:0%
doesn't make such an impact on our
revenue

01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:13:14.310 --> 01:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
and that was a discussion so we could go
 
01:13:16.790 --> 01:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
through and then make a decision
 
01:13:19.669 --> 01:13:19.679 align:start position:0%
what we need to do because we are
 
01:13:22.470 --> 01:13:22.480 align:start position:0%
the committee that's responsible for
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
coming up with the estimates of what any
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
legislative changes proposed in house
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
bill 2 will have on our revenues and
 
01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:33.280 align:start position:0%
that's why we're here okay i get it
 
01:13:36.149 --> 01:13:36.159 align:start position:0%
thank you very much mr chairman
 
01:13:39.910 --> 01:13:39.920 align:start position:0%
okay uh representative romney
 
01:13:41.350 --> 01:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna uh
 
01:13:44.149 --> 01:13:44.159 align:start position:0%
again practical uh comment here
 
01:13:46.709 --> 01:13:46.719 align:start position:0%
obviously house ways and means
 
01:13:46.719 --> 01:13:47.910 align:start position:0%
obviously house ways and means
estimates

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
how much money that finance can budget
 
01:13:54.149 --> 01:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
to spend 22 and 23.
 
01:13:56.070 --> 01:13:56.080 align:start position:0%
and uh we've done our first pass at
 
01:13:57.830 --> 01:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
estimates we're going to be working on
 
01:14:00.630 --> 01:14:00.640 align:start position:0%
our second pass today and tomorrow
 
01:14:02.870 --> 01:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
but we also have gone through a house
 
01:14:04.229 --> 01:14:04.239 align:start position:0%
bill 2
 
01:14:06.630 --> 01:14:06.640 align:start position:0%
and have estimated the impact
 
01:14:09.189 --> 01:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
with the help of dra
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
on revenues
 
01:14:12.149 --> 01:14:12.159 align:start position:0%
that are
 
01:14:14.790 --> 01:14:14.800 align:start position:0%
come out to be negative uh in terms of
 
01:14:16.950 --> 01:14:16.960 align:start position:0%
some of the tax reductions
 
01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
some of the tax reductions
so

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
we we broke that news to to
 
01:14:22.390 --> 01:14:22.400 align:start position:0%
to finance
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
the question is
 
01:14:25.750 --> 01:14:25.760 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure
 
01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure
that

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:14:29.350 --> 01:14:29.360 align:start position:0%
this issue is the same
 
01:14:31.910 --> 01:14:31.920 align:start position:0%
and that we it looks like no matter what
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
option we choose if we decide to move
 
01:14:34.950 --> 01:14:34.960 align:start position:0%
forward with this
 
01:14:37.990 --> 01:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
that there is going to be a reduction in
 
01:14:39.750 --> 01:14:39.760 align:start position:0%
what i call revenue and you guys have
 
01:14:41.990 --> 01:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
got to correct me now
 
01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
for finance to be able to spend
 
01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.750 align:start position:0%
for finance to be able to spend
so

01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:46.880 align:start position:0%
you are
 
01:14:48.870 --> 01:14:48.880 align:start position:0%
is it appropriate for us to put in our
 
01:14:51.030 --> 01:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
list for finance
 
01:14:52.709 --> 01:14:52.719 align:start position:0%
an additional reduction depending on
 
01:14:54.630 --> 01:14:54.640 align:start position:0%
what we decide on
 
01:14:57.350 --> 01:14:57.360 align:start position:0%
to to say you have less money to spend i
 
01:14:59.270 --> 01:14:59.280 align:start position:0%
i want to understand this
 
01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:01.360 align:start position:0%
i'm still struggling between the cash
 
01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.470 align:start position:0%
i'm still struggling between the cash
issue

01:15:02.470 --> 01:15:02.480 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
and the revenue issue
 
01:15:06.310 --> 01:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
uh maybe maybe dra can start with that
 
01:15:22.709 --> 01:15:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:24.630 --> 01:15:24.640 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure
 
01:15:26.950 --> 01:15:26.960 align:start position:0%
that when we update our report for
 
01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:29.030 align:start position:0%
that when we update our report for
finance

01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
finance
 
01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.470 align:start position:0%
finance
that

01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
we and
 
01:15:34.310 --> 01:15:34.320 align:start position:0%
whatever option we pick here
 
01:15:37.030 --> 01:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
that it is indeed a reduction in revenue
 
01:15:40.790 --> 01:15:40.800 align:start position:0%
or money that that can be spent in in
 
01:15:44.070 --> 01:15:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:47.189 --> 01:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
yes this is dana call i would agree it
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
does need to be reflected because it
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
would be a reduction of unrestricted
 
01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.390 align:start position:0%
would be a reduction of unrestricted
revenue

01:15:52.390 --> 01:15:52.400 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
01:15:54.630 --> 01:15:54.640 align:start position:0%
and it depends which option you choose
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
as to how large it is in the 2223 period
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
i think that that was the presentation
 
01:16:03.270 --> 01:16:03.280 align:start position:0%
that melissa gave right i mean it sounds
 
01:16:05.430 --> 01:16:05.440 align:start position:0%
like a different question but
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
mr chair but i want i think it was
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
important to ask that
 
01:16:11.830 --> 01:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
and i have a second question
 
01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:14.159 align:start position:0%
for matt
 
01:16:14.159 --> 01:16:15.030 align:start position:0%
for matt
matt

01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
matt
 
01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:15.990 align:start position:0%
matt
would

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:16:18.950 --> 01:16:18.960 align:start position:0%
what if we decided to wait a year and
 
01:16:22.870 --> 01:16:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:24.790 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:27.350 --> 01:16:27.360 align:start position:0%
maybe even form a study within ways and
 
01:16:27.360 --> 01:16:28.550 align:start position:0%
maybe even form a study within ways and
means

01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
means
 
01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.350 align:start position:0%
means
to

01:16:29.350 --> 01:16:29.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:16:30.870 --> 01:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
study this more
 
01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like it's the end of the
 
01:16:33.990 --> 01:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
world here it's an issue that we've been
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
living with for a long time
 
01:16:36.719 --> 01:16:37.750 align:start position:0%
living with for a long time
uh

01:16:37.750 --> 01:16:37.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:38.550 align:start position:0%
uh
it's

01:16:38.550 --> 01:16:38.560 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:16:40.790 --> 01:16:40.800 align:start position:0%
this this hb2
 
01:16:40.800 --> 01:16:42.229 align:start position:0%
this this hb2
uh

01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:16:42.239 --> 01:16:43.189 align:start position:0%
uh
section

01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
section
 
01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%
has brought to light that that maybe we
 
01:16:49.669 --> 01:16:49.679 align:start position:0%
should be acting on this uh
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
what would the governor's reaction be if
 
01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:52.709 align:start position:0%
what would the governor's reaction be if
we

01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:16:54.790 --> 01:16:54.800 align:start position:0%
delayed this a year
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh to allow us to work on this
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
even more
 
01:17:00.390 --> 01:17:00.400 align:start position:0%
i would want to bring that back to the
 
01:17:02.709 --> 01:17:02.719 align:start position:0%
governor specifically but what i would
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
say is our intent is to find a way to
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
address this issue that
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
because again this is a one-time impact
 
01:17:11.669 --> 01:17:11.679 align:start position:0%
right once we've corrected if you will
 
01:17:13.590 --> 01:17:13.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's not an ongoing
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
uh year-to-year impact beyond just how
 
01:17:17.990 --> 01:17:18.000 align:start position:0%
it is
 
01:17:20.870 --> 01:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
dispersed between that initial phase-in
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
um so if it's a matter of pushing this
 
01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:25.120 align:start position:0%
out to taxable periods starting
 
01:17:28.950 --> 01:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
in or ending in 2023 or 2024 that could
 
01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
be one way
 
01:17:33.510 --> 01:17:33.520 align:start position:0%
but i believe it'd be difficult to do
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
this outside of the budget process
 
01:17:39.189 --> 01:17:39.199 align:start position:0%
because this is a a sizable one-time
 
01:17:41.189 --> 01:17:41.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
but let me report back and i'm happy to
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
circle up
 
01:17:48.470 --> 01:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
let me ask you follow up on then uh matt
 
01:17:48.480 --> 01:17:49.510 align:start position:0%
let me ask you follow up on then uh matt
uh

01:17:49.510 --> 01:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:17:51.910 --> 01:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
in your in your revenue estimates did
 
01:17:54.550 --> 01:17:54.560 align:start position:0%
you did you
 
01:17:58.070 --> 01:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
include the impact of this
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question
 
01:18:02.630 --> 01:18:02.640 align:start position:0%
representative abrami when we
 
01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
first approached this issue i think our
 
01:18:06.470 --> 01:18:06.480 align:start position:0%
position was the same as some of those
 
01:18:08.390 --> 01:18:08.400 align:start position:0%
members of the committee that understood
 
01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:11.840 align:start position:0%
this to be strictly a cash impact
 
01:18:13.669 --> 01:18:13.679 align:start position:0%
it's become apparent in subsequent
 
01:18:15.910 --> 01:18:15.920 align:start position:0%
conversations with dra that
 
01:18:18.470 --> 01:18:18.480 align:start position:0%
there is a one-time fiscal impact
 
01:18:20.709 --> 01:18:20.719 align:start position:0%
because of how the state has been
 
01:18:22.709 --> 01:18:22.719 align:start position:0%
booking this revenue
 
01:18:25.430 --> 01:18:25.440 align:start position:0%
so i can't point to a specific line in
 
01:18:27.669 --> 01:18:27.679 align:start position:0%
our revenue estimates
 
01:18:30.229 --> 01:18:30.239 align:start position:0%
that directly deal with this basin
 
01:18:32.470 --> 01:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
especially given the uncertainty
 
01:18:34.310 --> 01:18:34.320 align:start position:0%
over how this impact
 
01:18:37.830 --> 01:18:37.840 align:start position:0%
cascades across fiscal years
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
but we do understand now that there is a
 
01:18:42.149 --> 01:18:42.159 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact associated
 
01:18:49.110 --> 01:18:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
i just want to remind the committee
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
that you're all given a spreadsheet
 
01:18:56.709 --> 01:18:56.719 align:start position:0%
called changes in revenue due to
 
01:19:00.790 --> 01:19:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:02.390 --> 01:19:02.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
in there it shows the
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
impact for
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
house bill 2 has written
 
01:19:12.709 --> 01:19:12.719 align:start position:0%
what it would be if we use the mid-range
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
of those four years
 
01:19:17.510 --> 01:19:17.520 align:start position:0%
and on the
 
01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:19.760 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
that it would impact the taxes
 
01:19:25.830 --> 01:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
negatively in 22 by 15 men
 
01:19:29.030 --> 01:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
and 23 by 39.8 million
 
01:19:31.430 --> 01:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
but as we heard from
 
01:19:34.470 --> 01:19:34.480 align:start position:0%
melissa a little while ago
 
01:19:37.990 --> 01:19:38.000 align:start position:0%
she said that practically
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
rather it wouldn't be the mid-range it
 
01:19:42.310 --> 01:19:42.320 align:start position:0%
would be towards the higher end the
 
01:19:45.830 --> 01:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:48.709 align:start position:0%
 
then

01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.110 --> 01:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
and we're here today to understand
 
01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
what's going on here
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
and is it we go and do we want to
 
01:20:02.790 --> 01:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
continue it and that's why we have to
 
01:20:07.189 --> 01:20:07.199 align:start position:0%
control and the treasurer and the dra
 
01:20:09.110 --> 01:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
all right and there's been some good
 
01:20:09.120 --> 01:20:10.709 align:start position:0%
all right and there's been some good
questions

01:20:10.709 --> 01:20:10.719 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:20:12.950 --> 01:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
the next question is representative
 
01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:14.149 align:start position:0%
the next question is representative
elementary

01:20:14.149 --> 01:20:14.159 align:start position:0%
elementary
 
01:20:16.470 --> 01:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
followed by representative easy and
 
01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:18.950 align:start position:0%
followed by representative easy and
represented

01:20:18.950 --> 01:20:18.960 align:start position:0%
represented
 
01:20:20.950 --> 01:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:22.950 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
on

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:25.510 --> 01:20:25.520 align:start position:0%
the the only place that this can should
 
01:20:28.470 --> 01:20:28.480 align:start position:0%
go would be uh on a reduction of the
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
revenues from the business
 
01:20:33.350 --> 01:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
taxes and
 
01:20:37.350 --> 01:20:37.360 align:start position:0%
i've been on and
 
01:20:41.910 --> 01:20:41.920 align:start position:0%
i've been trying to think is there a way
 
01:20:45.669 --> 01:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
that we could set this up so that we
 
01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be using
 
01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.390 align:start position:0%
would be using
the

01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:48.400 --> 01:20:49.669 align:start position:0%
the
on

01:20:49.669 --> 01:20:49.679 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:53.669 --> 01:20:53.679 align:start position:0%
the ending up with the hundred percent
 
01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the dra is saying
 
01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.590 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the dra is saying
that

01:20:57.590 --> 01:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
it's mostly smaller businesses that are
 
01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
only paying a couple of
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
quarters in advance
 
01:21:07.110 --> 01:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
that consist of the ones under that and
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
that the problem is the ones that are
 
01:21:11.189 --> 01:21:11.199 align:start position:0%
keeping a hundred percent or more in
 
01:21:11.199 --> 01:21:12.629 align:start position:0%
keeping a hundred percent or more in
there

01:21:12.629 --> 01:21:12.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
but also spread it out
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
over more years would that make these
 
01:21:22.390 --> 01:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
ranges smaller so that we had some
 
01:21:26.149 --> 01:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
ability to forecast how much
 
01:21:28.070 --> 01:21:28.080 align:start position:0%
was going to have to be taken off the
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
business taxes each year as well as
 
01:21:33.270 --> 01:21:33.280 align:start position:0%
spread it out over more years so that it
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
would not be as painful to the budgets
 
01:21:38.709 --> 01:21:38.719 align:start position:0%
because i can i can see
 
01:21:41.669 --> 01:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
the finance committee ours and the
 
01:21:41.679 --> 01:21:42.709 align:start position:0%
the finance committee ours and the
sentence

01:21:42.709 --> 01:21:42.719 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
01:21:45.669 --> 01:21:45.679 align:start position:0%
on just removing
 
01:21:47.750 --> 01:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
this thing because they don't want to
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
deal with it as the fiscal committees
 
01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
have not wanted to deal with it
 
01:21:55.510 --> 01:21:55.520 align:start position:0%
but on this is a problem
 
01:21:58.229 --> 01:21:58.239 align:start position:0%
does not date back just five years or
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
ten years on
 
01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
represent the our chairman has been
 
01:22:04.470 --> 01:22:04.480 align:start position:0%
talking about this and i was talking
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
about it at the beginning and then kind
 
01:22:08.709 --> 01:22:08.719 align:start position:0%
of gave up
 
01:22:12.390 --> 01:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
about this since practically for maybe
 
01:22:13.830 --> 01:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
20 years
 
01:22:16.470 --> 01:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
and and it has been growing a lot during
 
01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:18.800 align:start position:0%
that time i think it must have taken a
 
01:22:21.750 --> 01:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
serious dip that we did not realize did
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
not get told about during the great
 
01:22:23.280 --> 01:22:24.550 align:start position:0%
not get told about during the great
recession

01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
recession
 
01:22:28.550 --> 01:22:28.560 align:start position:0%
because it was up there before that
 
01:22:31.430 --> 01:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
and came down at some point and went
 
01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:34.400 align:start position:0%
back up but it goes
 
01:22:37.590 --> 01:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
it dips at our times of worst pain when
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
the recession
 
01:22:42.070 --> 01:22:42.080 align:start position:0%
the recession is involved and the state
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
cannot afford but must pay back the
 
01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.390 align:start position:0%
cannot afford but must pay back the
refunds

01:22:46.390 --> 01:22:46.400 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
01:22:46.400 --> 01:22:47.510 align:start position:0%
refunds
so

01:22:47.510 --> 01:22:47.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:22:49.830 --> 01:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
i think that we do we do need to deal
 
01:22:51.910 --> 01:22:51.920 align:start position:0%
with it but if we could if there is a
 
01:22:53.590 --> 01:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
way to write this to
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
to spread out the pain
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
more evenly and longer
 
01:23:00.950 --> 01:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
uh that would be good
 
01:23:03.430 --> 01:23:03.440 align:start position:0%
thank you caroline and melissa can you
 
01:23:05.430 --> 01:23:05.440 align:start position:0%
respond to that
 
01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
about spreading it out
 
01:23:11.350 --> 01:23:11.360 align:start position:0%
my representative this is carolyn
 
01:23:11.360 --> 01:23:12.390 align:start position:0%
my representative this is carolyn
um

01:23:12.390 --> 01:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
we you saw our draft options we are
 
01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:16.470 align:start position:0%
we you saw our draft options we are
happy

01:23:16.470 --> 01:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
happy
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
to draft up some more options if that
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
would be helpful to the committee
 
01:23:24.149 --> 01:23:24.159 align:start position:0%
um two ideas that come to mind to me
 
01:23:26.790 --> 01:23:26.800 align:start position:0%
would be for us to show you what it
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
would look like if you capped ccos at
 
01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:32.229 align:start position:0%
would look like if you capped ccos at
200

01:23:32.229 --> 01:23:32.239 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
and stopped there or if you capped them
 
01:23:39.110 --> 01:23:39.120 align:start position:0%
at 200 percent but then waited
 
01:23:43.350 --> 01:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
um more waited a couple tax years before
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
implementing the second
 
01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.550 align:start position:0%
implementing the second
um

01:23:46.550 --> 01:23:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
second reduction to 100 i think both of
 
01:23:50.870 --> 01:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
those options
 
01:23:53.830 --> 01:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
would be ways to um
 
01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.870 align:start position:0%
would be ways to um
to

01:23:54.870 --> 01:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
spread out and minimize the fiscal
 
01:23:57.520 --> 01:23:58.709 align:start position:0%
spread out and minimize the fiscal
impact

01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:24:00.790 --> 01:24:00.800 align:start position:0%
do you have a
 
01:24:03.110 --> 01:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet showing that
 
01:24:05.669 --> 01:24:05.679 align:start position:0%
okay it's not correct now
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
but i just have a follow-up i think one
 
01:24:11.030 --> 01:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
of our problems is that this is just
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
showing up in the budget now
 
01:24:16.390 --> 01:24:16.400 align:start position:0%
to be done now and there hasn't been
 
01:24:19.430 --> 01:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
time to think it out a lot but if we
 
01:24:21.430 --> 01:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
leave it any longer
 
01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.629 align:start position:0%
leave it any longer
on

01:24:22.629 --> 01:24:22.639 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:24:25.750 --> 01:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
people may never do it again
 
01:24:28.149 --> 01:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
and it is really bad in recessions i
 
01:24:28.159 --> 01:24:29.270 align:start position:0%
and it is really bad in recessions i
think

01:24:29.270 --> 01:24:29.280 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:24:31.990 --> 01:24:32.000 align:start position:0%
but this is something you could do
 
01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.189 align:start position:0%
but this is something you could do
quickly

01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.199 --> 01:24:37.910 align:start position:0%
 
carolyn

01:24:37.910 --> 01:24:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:39.750 --> 01:24:39.760 align:start position:0%
yes i think we could turn that around
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:43.270 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
okay

01:24:43.270 --> 01:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:24:44.870 --> 01:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
are you all set for
 
01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:46.870 align:start position:0%
are you all set for
representatives

01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:24:50.709 --> 01:24:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i have a
 
01:24:55.110 --> 01:24:55.120 align:start position:0%
comment and then a question for dra
 
01:24:56.709 --> 01:24:56.719 align:start position:0%
first the comment
 
01:25:01.510 --> 01:25:01.520 align:start position:0%
is um basically that um
 
01:25:03.830 --> 01:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
it seems like we may have to do some
 
01:25:05.590 --> 01:25:05.600 align:start position:0%
sort of phased approach because if we do
 
01:25:08.709 --> 01:25:08.719 align:start position:0%
the quick cut at 50 percent
 
01:25:10.790 --> 01:25:10.800 align:start position:0%
over time we need to understand why this
 
01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
is going up because now it's 50 the
 
01:25:15.030 --> 01:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
increase will be smaller but if we're in
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
this direction where this is continuing
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
to increase
 
01:25:20.870 --> 01:25:20.880 align:start position:0%
even if you're sending 50 back but the
 
01:25:23.590 --> 01:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
total increase keeps increasing
 
01:25:25.030 --> 01:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
you're still gonna at some point say
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
okay now even though we're only allowing
 
01:25:28.310 --> 01:25:28.320 align:start position:0%
50 percent
 
01:25:29.910 --> 01:25:29.920 align:start position:0%
the number is huge again and we have to
 
01:25:31.750 --> 01:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
do another cut so we may have to look at
 
01:25:34.550 --> 01:25:34.560 align:start position:0%
some sort of uh phased approach
 
01:25:37.110 --> 01:25:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and then something that takes into
 
01:25:39.270 --> 01:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
account that it's continuing to increase
 
01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
or at least understand why it's
 
01:25:43.350 --> 01:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
continuing to increase to address that
 
01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.310 align:start position:0%
continuing to increase to address that
problem

01:25:44.310 --> 01:25:44.320 align:start position:0%
problem
 
01:25:46.550 --> 01:25:46.560 align:start position:0%
that's my comment the question for dra
 
01:25:46.560 --> 01:25:47.270 align:start position:0%
that's my comment the question for dra
is

01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:25:49.350 --> 01:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
one of the things that that i had asked
 
01:25:51.430 --> 01:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
in a previous meeting was
 
01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.790 align:start position:0%
in a previous meeting was
um

01:25:52.790 --> 01:25:52.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:55.030 --> 01:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
the idea is that companies are trying to
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
avoid federal tax and that's why they're
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
letting this number get so big but my
 
01:26:01.270 --> 01:26:01.280 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:26:04.070 --> 01:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
is that really true because i know that
 
01:26:05.990 --> 01:26:06.000 align:start position:0%
i mean i have an llc and if i've
 
01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:07.430 align:start position:0%
i mean i have an llc and if i've
overpaid

01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
overpaid
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
then i get a 1099 g
 
01:26:11.350 --> 01:26:11.360 align:start position:0%
and that that money then has to be
 
01:26:14.470 --> 01:26:14.480 align:start position:0%
applied uh as income so i'm not sure how
 
01:26:16.629 --> 01:26:16.639 align:start position:0%
companies are avoiding federal tax by
 
01:26:18.310 --> 01:26:18.320 align:start position:0%
letting this number build up so i would
 
01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:22.800 align:start position:0%
ask dra that that question
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:26:25.590 --> 01:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
representative i understand that the
 
01:26:28.870 --> 01:26:28.880 align:start position:0%
state only issues 1099 g's when we pay a
 
01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:30.229 align:start position:0%
state only issues 1099 g's when we pay a
refund

01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
refund
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
um we don't issue a 109g
 
01:26:36.310 --> 01:26:36.320 align:start position:0%
for a taxpayer having a cco on their
 
01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.430 align:start position:0%
for a taxpayer having a cco on their
account

01:26:37.430 --> 01:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
account
 
01:26:40.310 --> 01:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
and i believe the logic behind that is
 
01:26:43.110 --> 01:26:43.120 align:start position:0%
that we don't know whether the cco on
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
their account is um actually intended to
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
be a payment of their upcoming estimate
 
01:26:51.110 --> 01:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
liability versus
 
01:26:52.950 --> 01:26:52.960 align:start position:0%
extra money that they're just parking
 
01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.950 align:start position:0%
extra money that they're just parking
there

01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh follow-up
 
01:26:59.510 --> 01:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
in my case i don't ask for a refund i
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
leave the money there
 
01:27:01.679 --> 01:27:02.470 align:start position:0%
leave the money there
and

01:27:02.470 --> 01:27:02.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
so it can pay for
 
01:27:08.070 --> 01:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
um future tax liability
 
01:27:10.229 --> 01:27:10.239 align:start position:0%
so i am still getting a 1099 g even
 
01:27:15.270 --> 01:27:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:16.550 --> 01:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
or if you
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
to send me that information offline i
 
01:27:20.470 --> 01:27:20.480 align:start position:0%
can certainly look into that and
 
01:27:21.990 --> 01:27:22.000 align:start position:0%
understand why that
 
01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:23.280 align:start position:0%
is happening
 
01:27:25.830 --> 01:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's also happening on my personal
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
tax where my wife and i are proprietors
 
01:27:30.070 --> 01:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
and some rental property and when we've
 
01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:31.270 align:start position:0%
and some rental property and when we've
overpaid

01:27:31.270 --> 01:27:31.280 align:start position:0%
overpaid
 
01:27:33.830 --> 01:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
the next you know next uh tax cycle we
 
01:27:35.750 --> 01:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
get a 1099 g
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
even though i never again even there i
 
01:27:38.870 --> 01:27:38.880 align:start position:0%
don't ask for a refund
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
so i it seems like it's a general policy
 
01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
but yeah i can
 
01:27:49.189 --> 01:27:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:49.199 --> 01:27:51.910 align:start position:0%
 
representatives

01:27:51.910 --> 01:27:51.920 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:27:53.510 --> 01:27:53.520 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
i just want to be sure that we get the
 
01:27:57.270 --> 01:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
written analysis there's a question to
 
01:27:59.350 --> 01:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
the chair to make sure we get
 
01:27:59.360 --> 01:28:00.629 align:start position:0%
the chair to make sure we get
the

01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:02.800 align:start position:0%
background information that we talked
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
about earlier with the controller
 
01:28:08.149 --> 01:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
and also the
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh analyses that have been done of
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
different options by dra so far that was
 
01:28:15.510 --> 01:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
shown by melissa on
 
01:28:17.189 --> 01:28:17.199 align:start position:0%
the screen
 
01:28:18.390 --> 01:28:18.400 align:start position:0%
and then i
 
01:28:20.709 --> 01:28:20.719 align:start position:0%
it's really a comment i guess uh it was
 
01:28:22.470 --> 01:28:22.480 align:start position:0%
said that this is
 
01:28:25.110 --> 01:28:25.120 align:start position:0%
a one-time problem a correction would be
 
01:28:26.709 --> 01:28:26.719 align:start position:0%
a one-time thing
 
01:28:29.750 --> 01:28:29.760 align:start position:0%
i i don't think so i think that it
 
01:28:32.709 --> 01:28:32.719 align:start position:0%
relates to how we estimate revenues
 
01:28:36.229 --> 01:28:36.239 align:start position:0%
and uh i believe this statement is true
 
01:28:38.470 --> 01:28:38.480 align:start position:0%
that in effect we've been over
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
estimating revenues for the business tax
 
01:28:44.229 --> 01:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
in at least the recent years
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
because they have included
 
01:28:50.550 --> 01:28:50.560 align:start position:0%
or they've failed to include refunds
 
01:28:54.070 --> 01:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
that the businesses are entitled to but
 
01:28:55.510 --> 01:28:55.520 align:start position:0%
don't ask for
 
01:28:57.350 --> 01:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's that overhang that uh
 
01:29:01.110 --> 01:29:01.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:03.830 --> 01:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
spillsbury uh spoke to
 
01:29:06.070 --> 01:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh so that's a comment but i'd like to
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
get that information
 
01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:08.830 align:start position:0%
get that information
right

01:29:08.830 --> 01:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:29:14.229 --> 01:29:14.239 align:start position:0%
so the action items with the controller
 
01:29:15.430 --> 01:29:15.440 align:start position:0%
is to get
 
01:29:17.910 --> 01:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
the analysis each year
 
01:29:19.830 --> 01:29:19.840 align:start position:0%
and then also why
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
the audit is passed
 
01:29:25.510 --> 01:29:25.520 align:start position:0%
pass on this issue from booking
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
and non-booking
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
and from the dra to look at
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
different analysis
 
01:29:33.920 --> 01:29:34.870 align:start position:0%
different analysis
uh

01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:29:38.149 --> 01:29:38.159 align:start position:0%
say a 100 trigger versus a two hundred
 
01:29:45.669 --> 01:29:45.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:47.430 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:29:50.310 --> 01:29:50.320 align:start position:0%
that's what i have for the reaction
 
01:30:00.310 --> 01:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:03.590 --> 01:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
just a comment uh mr chair uh finances
 
01:30:05.669 --> 01:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
is going to be looking for us to do the
 
01:30:07.430 --> 01:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
updated revenues
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
and give the updated revenues on friday
 
01:30:13.350 --> 01:30:13.360 align:start position:0%
and they've been really pushing for that
 
01:30:13.360 --> 01:30:14.229 align:start position:0%
and they've been really pushing for that
and

01:30:14.229 --> 01:30:14.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:16.390 --> 01:30:16.400 align:start position:0%
it doesn't sound like
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
we're going to have a conclusion on this
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
piece uh by then
 
01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
unless we strive hard to come up with a
 
01:30:26.790 --> 01:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
a compromise
 
01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
so we're going to have to go in with our
 
01:30:30.550 --> 01:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
best guess on this
 
01:30:32.629 --> 01:30:32.639 align:start position:0%
uh for them because they want to have
 
01:30:35.110 --> 01:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
their their uh budget done by sometime
 
01:30:36.629 --> 01:30:36.639 align:start position:0%
next week i guess
 
01:30:37.990 --> 01:30:38.000 align:start position:0%
uh and that's why they've been pushing
 
01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:38.790 align:start position:0%
uh and that's why they've been pushing
us

01:30:38.790 --> 01:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
us
 
01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.830 align:start position:0%
us
so

01:30:39.830 --> 01:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:30:43.030 --> 01:30:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh i i don't know i i'm not quite sure
 
01:30:45.110 --> 01:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
what we're gonna tell finance on friday
 
01:30:47.669 --> 01:30:47.679 align:start position:0%
when it comes to this particular item
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
other than give them a range i guess
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
01:30:52.870 --> 01:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
but that's just a comment or i don't
 
01:30:55.669 --> 01:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
know if you want to react to that but
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
yes we will have to have revenues
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
finished tomorrow so we can give the
 
01:31:03.910 --> 01:31:03.920 align:start position:0%
finance on
 
01:31:06.870 --> 01:31:06.880 align:start position:0%
friday and what i'm hoping is the ra can
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
give us their spreadsheet
 
01:31:11.189 --> 01:31:11.199 align:start position:0%
looking at it
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the 100
 
01:31:15.030 --> 01:31:15.040 align:start position:0%
million and 100
 
01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:16.470 align:start position:0%
million and 100
200

01:31:16.470 --> 01:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
200
 
01:31:16.480 --> 01:31:17.270 align:start position:0%
200
so

01:31:17.270 --> 01:31:17.280 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:31:19.830 --> 01:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
we have more so we can make an
 
01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:21.030 align:start position:0%
we have more so we can make an
investment

01:31:21.030 --> 01:31:21.040 align:start position:0%
investment
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
from what the uh
 
01:31:26.950 --> 01:31:26.960 align:start position:0%
falls legislation looks like right now
 
01:31:29.189 --> 01:31:29.199 align:start position:0%
so we'd make an amendment
 
01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:31.440 align:start position:0%
to incorporate that if we don't make an
 
01:31:33.669 --> 01:31:33.679 align:start position:0%
amendment to incorporate that
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
then we have to use
 
01:31:36.790 --> 01:31:36.800 align:start position:0%
the limit
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
that uh we'll have to use what's in
 
01:31:40.870 --> 01:31:40.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 now
 
01:31:42.790 --> 01:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
a 50
 
01:31:44.629 --> 01:31:44.639 align:start position:0%
trigger point
 
01:31:47.430 --> 01:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
and then we have from the dra with the
 
01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:48.629 align:start position:0%
and then we have from the dra with the
ranges

01:31:48.629 --> 01:31:48.639 align:start position:0%
ranges
 
01:31:51.430 --> 01:31:51.440 align:start position:0%
and what we'll need for the r8
 
01:31:51.440 --> 01:31:52.310 align:start position:0%
and what we'll need for the r8
is

01:31:52.310 --> 01:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:31:53.669 --> 01:31:53.679 align:start position:0%
do we pick
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
towards the top of the range
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
or can we do the middle of the range for
 
01:32:00.229 --> 01:32:00.239 align:start position:0%
those two years
 
01:32:01.990 --> 01:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
so so the plan is to have that done by
 
01:32:05.110 --> 01:32:05.120 align:start position:0%
tomorrow then yes okay that's what i
 
01:32:06.950 --> 01:32:06.960 align:start position:0%
just wanted we have a lot of work to do
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
between now and tomorrow right now
 
01:32:13.270 --> 01:32:13.280 align:start position:0%
we're concentrating on the
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
on the legislation in the house bill 2
 
01:32:16.880 --> 01:32:17.590 align:start position:0%
on the legislation in the house bill 2
that

01:32:17.590 --> 01:32:17.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
only affects this credit move forward
 
01:32:23.270 --> 01:32:23.280 align:start position:0%
when we get through with this discussion
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
we will go through and review the rest
 
01:32:27.110 --> 01:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:32:29.990 --> 01:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
and they're in hospital too but i think
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
they're pretty well set
 
01:32:33.030 --> 01:32:33.040 align:start position:0%
and mr chair
 
01:32:34.390 --> 01:32:34.400 align:start position:0%
i i hope that we can get the
 
01:32:37.030 --> 01:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
comptroller's uh background information
 
01:32:38.149 --> 01:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:32:40.790 --> 01:32:40.800 align:start position:0%
on the same timetable
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
and contol
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
provide us that information
 
01:32:46.950 --> 01:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
i can
 
01:32:48.550 --> 01:32:48.560 align:start position:0%
i can send that out just after this
 
01:32:48.560 --> 01:32:49.430 align:start position:0%
i can send that out just after this
meeting

01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
much and what do we need on this issue
 
01:32:58.310 --> 01:32:58.320 align:start position:0%
mr chairman
 
01:32:58.320 --> 01:32:59.750 align:start position:0%

01:33:24.550 --> 01:33:24.560 align:start position:0%
anything else on this issue

other issues
 
01:33:46.790 --> 01:33:46.800 align:start position:0%
the other items
 
01:33:49.510 --> 01:33:49.520 align:start position:0%
there are legislative changes
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%

and just
 
01:33:56.149 --> 01:33:56.159 align:start position:0%
just to review them
 
01:33:58.229 --> 01:33:58.239 align:start position:0%
you each have the
 
01:34:02.629 --> 01:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.070 --> 01:34:06.080 align:start position:0%
dated 316 which was yesterday
 
01:34:07.750 --> 01:34:07.760 align:start position:0%
and i'd like
 
01:34:11.110 --> 01:34:11.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:15.030 --> 01:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
we need affirmation from the dra
 
01:34:20.550 --> 01:34:20.560 align:start position:0%
the first item is the additional dra
 
01:34:20.560 --> 01:34:22.229 align:start position:0%
the first item is the additional dra
auditors

01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
auditors
 
01:34:25.510 --> 01:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
that's actually in house bill 1

that's actually in house bill 1
and

01:34:26.390 --> 01:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:34:28.470 --> 01:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
that would produce
 
01:34:31.990 --> 01:34:32.000 align:start position:0%
positive revenue of 700 000 thousand fy
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
22 and 3.2 million fy 23.

i got a very uh
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
partial on thing from
 
01:34:49.350 --> 01:34:49.360 align:start position:0%
from you that didn't include the
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
auditors at all
 
01:34:53.189 --> 01:34:53.199 align:start position:0%
is that what we were talking about
 
01:34:56.550 --> 01:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
the one i sent out yesterday does chris
 
01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.430 --> 01:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.430 --> 01:35:09.440 align:start position:0%
do you see it now
 
01:35:12.149 --> 01:35:12.159 align:start position:0%
okay there is the online toke
 
01:35:15.030 --> 01:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
this is additional dre auditors
 
01:35:17.590 --> 01:35:17.600 align:start position:0%
it's actually in house bill 1
 
01:35:17.600 --> 01:35:18.790 align:start position:0%
it's actually in house bill 1
and

01:35:18.790 --> 01:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
it would bring in
 
01:35:26.070 --> 01:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
positive 700 022 and 3.2 million and 23.
 
01:35:28.950 --> 01:35:28.960 align:start position:0%
and the question to the dra these
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative those are good
 
01:35:33.440 --> 01:35:36.070 align:start position:0%
yes representative those are good
estimates

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee
 
01:35:41.590 --> 01:35:41.600 align:start position:0%
uh norm
 
01:35:41.600 --> 01:35:43.830 align:start position:0%
uh norm
brownie

01:35:43.830 --> 01:35:43.840 align:start position:0%
brownie
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
would it be helpful
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
for finance to in some of these and some
 
01:35:52.070 --> 01:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
of these we have it going out to 25
 
01:35:54.149 --> 01:35:54.159 align:start position:0%
and others we don't
 
01:35:54.159 --> 01:35:55.189 align:start position:0%
and others we don't
um

01:35:55.189 --> 01:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be helpful to them to see
 
01:35:58.950 --> 01:35:58.960 align:start position:0%
what what some of this financial impact
 
01:36:01.510 --> 01:36:01.520 align:start position:0%
going all the way out to 25 would be
 
01:36:05.109 --> 01:36:05.119 align:start position:0%
the reason you see the 24 25
 
01:36:05.119 --> 01:36:06.310 align:start position:0%
the reason you see the 24 25
is

01:36:06.310 --> 01:36:06.320 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
i wanted to see it myself
 
01:36:10.629 --> 01:36:10.639 align:start position:0%
okay but we need to
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
give them the impact on 22 and 23.
 
01:36:18.310 --> 01:36:18.320 align:start position:0%
and i thought by
 
01:36:21.350 --> 01:36:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh i would imagine that like on the
 
01:36:21.360 --> 01:36:22.629 align:start position:0%
uh i would imagine that like on the
auditors

01:36:22.629 --> 01:36:22.639 align:start position:0%
auditors
 
01:36:25.669 --> 01:36:25.679 align:start position:0%
it would settle down close to the 3.2 in
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
the out years i'm not sure
 
01:36:30.950 --> 01:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
but we didn't ask the dra that
 
01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:32.870 align:start position:0%
but we didn't ask the dra that
information

01:36:32.870 --> 01:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:36:34.470 --> 01:36:34.480 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.430 align:start position:0%
all right
okay

01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:36:36.629 --> 01:36:36.639 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:36:38.629 --> 01:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
meals in room tax decrease from eight
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
and a half percent from nine percent to
 
01:36:42.870 --> 01:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
eight and a half percent with decreased
 
01:36:45.350 --> 01:36:45.360 align:start position:0%
revenue is 11.4 million
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
and fy 22 because it's implemented uh
 
01:36:53.910 --> 01:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
in october
 
01:36:57.750 --> 01:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
and 11 point i'm 19 million fy23 are
 
01:36:57.760 --> 01:36:58.550 align:start position:0%
and 11 point i'm 19 million fy23 are
those

01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
still good estimates uh carolyn or
 
01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.470 align:start position:0%
still good estimates uh carolyn or
melissa

01:37:04.470 --> 01:37:04.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:12.229 --> 01:37:12.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative allenby followed by
 
01:37:15.790 --> 01:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:22.229 --> 01:37:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:28.390 --> 01:37:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.390 --> 01:37:30.400 align:start position:0%
you're still muted
 
01:37:33.270 --> 01:37:33.280 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i was trying to read this in
 
01:37:35.910 --> 01:37:35.920 align:start position:0%
another format so that i could see it
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
because i do not have a copy of this one
 
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:39.830 align:start position:0%
because i do not have a copy of this one
on

01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:40.870 align:start position:0%
on
but

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
on i was on trying to check
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
i think that they based this decrease on
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
what was earned in
 
01:37:52.950 --> 01:37:52.960 align:start position:0%
in uh 2018
 
01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:53.830 align:start position:0%
in uh 2018
or

01:37:53.830 --> 01:37:53.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:54.550 align:start position:0%
or
no

01:37:54.550 --> 01:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:37:56.629 --> 01:37:56.639 align:start position:0%
no this one was 2020. that's right there
 
01:38:00.709 --> 01:38:00.719 align:start position:0%
was another one the bet one was 2018.
 
01:38:02.709 --> 01:38:02.719 align:start position:0%
so the actual
 
01:38:05.830 --> 01:38:05.840 align:start position:0%
dollar numbers are related to
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
to the crash we had in 2020 for
 
01:38:11.910 --> 01:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms and to what we were
 
01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.270 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms and to what we were
getting

01:38:13.270 --> 01:38:13.280 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.149 align:start position:0%
getting
in

01:38:14.149 --> 01:38:14.159 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:14.159 --> 01:38:15.109 align:start position:0%
in
in

01:38:15.109 --> 01:38:15.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
fy 18 i think it was
 
01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:19.189 align:start position:0%
fy 18 i think it was
for

01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:38:23.109 --> 01:38:23.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:24.790 --> 01:38:24.800 align:start position:0%
and these
 
01:38:27.669 --> 01:38:27.679 align:start position:0%
reduction revenues the reduction in
 
01:38:31.270 --> 01:38:31.280 align:start position:0%
revenues from h hr
 
01:38:36.550 --> 01:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
any sort of questions on the meals and
 
01:38:42.390 --> 01:38:42.400 align:start position:0%
rooms uh yeah i've got a question
 
01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:43.669 align:start position:0%
rooms uh yeah i've got a question
yeah

01:38:43.669 --> 01:38:43.679 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:38:44.790 --> 01:38:44.800 align:start position:0%
and it really relates to what
 
01:38:46.390 --> 01:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
representative army was just bringing up
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
but i think that the um
 
01:38:51.590 --> 01:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
to the extent to which we make an
 
01:38:54.229 --> 01:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
adjustment in the meals and rooms
 
01:38:55.750 --> 01:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
revenues for
 
01:38:59.030 --> 01:38:59.040 align:start position:0%
21 22 and 23 there's a direct
 
01:39:00.950 --> 01:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
relationship to
 
01:39:03.750 --> 01:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
um the money that will
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
not come in if the rate's reduced
 
01:39:09.990 --> 01:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
and we should be working off of
 
01:39:12.550 --> 01:39:12.560 align:start position:0%
those figures rather than
 
01:39:14.310 --> 01:39:14.320 align:start position:0%
old figures
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
it's the 8.5 percent that we
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
levied instead of 9
 
01:39:23.590 --> 01:39:23.600 align:start position:0%
i got my numbers right
 
01:39:25.510 --> 01:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
in those years
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
against the activity the
 
01:39:30.709 --> 01:39:30.719 align:start position:0%
the amount of uh
 
01:39:33.430 --> 01:39:33.440 align:start position:0%
of rums and meals that are
 
01:39:35.109 --> 01:39:35.119 align:start position:0%
sales that are made
 
01:39:37.430 --> 01:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
and it's not the amount of sales that
 
01:39:41.189 --> 01:39:41.199 align:start position:0%
were made years ago
 
01:39:43.109 --> 01:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
so i think that it's not a huge impact
 
01:39:44.709 --> 01:39:44.719 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a
 
01:39:46.390 --> 01:39:46.400 align:start position:0%
two or three million four million i
 
01:39:47.590 --> 01:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
01:39:50.070 --> 01:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
it needs to be i i believe has to be
 
01:39:50.080 --> 01:39:51.830 align:start position:0%
it needs to be i i believe has to be
addressed

01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:39:55.510 --> 01:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
with a correction for the school
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
building aid and
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
and i think there was one other thing
 
01:39:59.440 --> 01:40:01.910 align:start position:0%
and i think there was one other thing
there

01:40:01.910 --> 01:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:17.030 --> 01:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
do you have
 
01:40:19.430 --> 01:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
any comments
 
01:40:25.189 --> 01:40:25.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
um this is carolyn representative um
 
01:40:28.639 --> 01:40:30.229 align:start position:0%
um this is carolyn representative um
certainly

01:40:30.229 --> 01:40:30.239 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
01:40:32.149 --> 01:40:32.159 align:start position:0%
our our analysis
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
analyses always
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
look back to the most recently completed
 
01:40:39.430 --> 01:40:39.440 align:start position:0%
tax year um we
 
01:40:42.950 --> 01:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
customarily don't attempt to sort of
 
01:40:45.030 --> 01:40:45.040 align:start position:0%
predict what revenues are going to be in
 
01:40:47.430 --> 01:40:47.440 align:start position:0%
future years to calculate
 
01:40:50.149 --> 01:40:50.159 align:start position:0%
impacts um which is not to say that it
 
01:40:51.990 --> 01:40:52.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it would be inappropriate for
 
01:40:55.510 --> 01:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
you to do so um but but we instead rely
 
01:40:59.030 --> 01:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
on the most recently completed um data
 
01:41:02.830 --> 01:41:02.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:05.830 --> 01:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
have okay
 
01:41:08.310 --> 01:41:08.320 align:start position:0%
so represent ames on
 
01:41:10.390 --> 01:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
01:41:15.189 --> 01:41:15.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:17.830 --> 01:41:17.840 align:start position:0%
and 22 and
 
01:41:19.990 --> 01:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
do you have an estimate
 
01:41:22.629 --> 01:41:22.639 align:start position:0%
well my calculation
 
01:41:25.350 --> 01:41:25.360 align:start position:0%
and i believe i just got some scribbling
 
01:41:28.629 --> 01:41:28.639 align:start position:0%
from late last night to be honest
 
01:41:31.350 --> 01:41:31.360 align:start position:0%
i think i used the governor's
 
01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:32.550 align:start position:0%
i think i used the governor's
number

01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:41:32.560 --> 01:41:33.550 align:start position:0%
number
of

01:41:33.550 --> 01:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:41:35.590 --> 01:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
363.2 million
 
01:41:37.350 --> 01:41:37.360 align:start position:0%
you have to look to see if that squares
 
01:41:38.550 --> 01:41:38.560 align:start position:0%
with things
 
01:41:41.350 --> 01:41:41.360 align:start position:0%
and then made the calculation and i came
 
01:41:43.669 --> 01:41:43.679 align:start position:0%
up with 30.2
 
01:41:43.679 --> 01:41:44.830 align:start position:0%
up with 30.2
million

01:41:44.830 --> 01:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.550 align:start position:0%
million
loss

01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
loss
 
01:41:48.550 --> 01:41:48.560 align:start position:0%
now that could be wrong somebody needs
 
01:41:51.109 --> 01:41:51.119 align:start position:0%
to correct this i don't know
 
01:41:54.709 --> 01:41:54.719 align:start position:0%
but you asked so i'm telling
 
01:41:58.229 --> 01:41:58.239 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to be reviewing
 
01:42:01.669 --> 01:42:01.679 align:start position:0%
our estimates
 
01:42:03.990 --> 01:42:04.000 align:start position:0%
right after we do the hb
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
two items
 
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
two items
uh

01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.310 align:start position:0%
uh
these

01:42:08.310 --> 01:42:08.320 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:42:12.550 --> 01:42:12.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:15.109 --> 01:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
and what the dra
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
figures they would
 
01:42:19.030 --> 01:42:19.040 align:start position:0%
either increase or decrease revenues in
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:26.830 --> 01:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:30.470 --> 01:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
saying uh to make corrections for the
 
01:42:33.830 --> 01:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax and you use the
 
01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:38.070 align:start position:0%
meals and rooms tax and you use the
governor's

01:42:38.070 --> 01:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:40.790 --> 01:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
numbers for the meals and rooms tax
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
i think i did
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
i think i think what we should use
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
because we're talking about we
 
01:42:49.990 --> 01:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
you know our version of this
 
01:42:52.709 --> 01:42:52.719 align:start position:0%
is we should have our meals on rooms tax
 
01:42:52.719 --> 01:42:54.709 align:start position:0%
is we should have our meals on rooms tax
estimates

01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:42:58.229 --> 01:42:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh at the current current law rate
 
01:43:00.870 --> 01:43:00.880 align:start position:0%
going forward
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
in hand have those numbers in hand
 
01:43:07.189 --> 01:43:07.199 align:start position:0%
and then the question is okay
 
01:43:09.109 --> 01:43:09.119 align:start position:0%
if instead of a nine percent rate we
 
01:43:12.149 --> 01:43:12.159 align:start position:0%
have an eight point five percent rate
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
how does that play out
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
how does that affect that
 
01:43:19.189 --> 01:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
estimate that we've arrived at
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
using the nine percent rate
 
01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:24.320 align:start position:0%
and of course we deduct uh the school
 
01:43:26.229 --> 01:43:26.239 align:start position:0%
building loan and so forth and the
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
commissions uh figure into this analysis
 
01:43:31.270 --> 01:43:31.280 align:start position:0%
too by the way
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
i guess
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
it plays out a 2.7
 
01:43:35.990 --> 01:43:36.000 align:start position:0%
allowed 3
 
01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:37.189 align:start position:0%
allowed 3
commission

01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:43:38.629 --> 01:43:38.639 align:start position:0%
anyway the analysis is just a
 
01:43:45.030 --> 01:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
once we
 
01:43:48.790 --> 01:43:48.800 align:start position:0%
go through our regular revenues
 
01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:50.400 align:start position:0%
i think so
 
01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:52.470 align:start position:0%
i think so
okay

01:43:52.470 --> 01:43:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:43:55.510 --> 01:43:55.520 align:start position:0%
the next item is the bt threshold
 
01:43:58.870 --> 01:43:58.880 align:start position:0%
increased to 250 000 and the
 
01:44:00.390 --> 01:44:00.400 align:start position:0%
also the
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
business independent value increasing
 
01:44:05.030 --> 01:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
250 000.
 
01:44:09.750 --> 01:44:09.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
change in fy 22
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:23.510 align:start position:0%
 
the

01:44:23.510 --> 01:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:44:27.189 --> 01:44:27.199 align:start position:0%
next one is the bet rate decrease
 
01:44:30.550 --> 01:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
to 0.55 percent from
 
01:44:30.560 --> 01:44:32.310 align:start position:0%
to 0.55 percent from
0.6

01:44:32.310 --> 01:44:32.320 align:start position:0%
0.6
 
01:44:34.629 --> 01:44:34.639 align:start position:0%
in hospital too
 
01:44:36.390 --> 01:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:44:39.030 --> 01:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
change would be
 
01:44:41.510 --> 01:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
it would affect our revenue
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
additional negative 4.7 million dollars
 
01:44:47.270 --> 01:44:47.280 align:start position:0%
and 22.
 
01:44:55.830 --> 01:44:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
the next is the offsetting bpt
 
01:45:04.629 --> 01:45:04.639 align:start position:0%
revenue increase
 
01:45:07.350 --> 01:45:07.360 align:start position:0%
due to the
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
decrease in bt rate
 
01:45:10.800 --> 01:45:11.910 align:start position:0%
decrease in bt rate
so

01:45:11.910 --> 01:45:11.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:45:14.629 --> 01:45:14.639 align:start position:0%
in fy23
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
if you use the credit
 
01:45:19.030 --> 01:45:19.040 align:start position:0%
most of that credit
 
01:45:22.229 --> 01:45:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:22.239 --> 01:45:23.350 align:start position:0%
 
then

01:45:23.350 --> 01:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:25.350 align:start position:0%
then
the

01:45:25.350 --> 01:45:25.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:45:25.360 --> 01:45:29.189 align:start position:0%
the
bpt

01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:32.870 --> 01:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
revenue increase is going to be
 
01:45:35.830 --> 01:45:35.840 align:start position:0%
2.8 million dollars
 
01:45:39.990 --> 01:45:40.000 align:start position:0%
and an increase of 8.1 due to the 13.3
 
01:45:40.000 --> 01:45:41.270 align:start position:0%
and an increase of 8.1 due to the 13.3
million

01:45:41.270 --> 01:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.390 align:start position:0%
million
decrease

01:45:42.390 --> 01:45:42.400 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
because you're using less credit
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh the next the ib ind tax your phase
 
01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:53.910 align:start position:0%
uh the next the ib ind tax your phase
out

01:45:53.910 --> 01:45:53.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
that have no effect on
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
as the legislation's written no effect
 
01:46:00.790 --> 01:46:00.800 align:start position:0%
in 22
 
01:46:03.669 --> 01:46:03.679 align:start position:0%
minus 6.3 million dollars
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
in 23
 
01:46:09.750 --> 01:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
and then it would increase
 
01:46:12.310 --> 01:46:12.320 align:start position:0%
each year after
 
01:46:13.910 --> 01:46:13.920 align:start position:0%
i'm on this one
 
01:46:16.470 --> 01:46:16.480 align:start position:0%
am i muted or not i don't know
 
01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:18.310 align:start position:0%
am i muted or not i don't know
uh

01:46:18.310 --> 01:46:18.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
this is representative ames if i may yes
 
01:46:21.840 --> 01:46:22.190 align:start position:0%
this is representative ames if i may yes
um

01:46:22.190 --> 01:46:22.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:23.430 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:46:23.430 --> 01:46:23.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:46:26.790 --> 01:46:26.800 align:start position:0%
i think this is
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
this too gets affected by adjusted
 
01:46:30.159 --> 01:46:32.229 align:start position:0%
this too gets affected by adjusted
um

01:46:32.229 --> 01:46:32.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:34.950 --> 01:46:34.960 align:start position:0%
estimates that we make on the
 
01:46:38.709 --> 01:46:38.719 align:start position:0%
base the 21 fiscal year 21
 
01:46:42.229 --> 01:46:42.239 align:start position:0%
ind 22 and 23 given the current five
 
01:46:43.669 --> 01:46:43.679 align:start position:0%
percent rate
 
01:46:43.679 --> 01:46:45.430 align:start position:0%
percent rate
um

01:46:45.430 --> 01:46:45.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:47.430 --> 01:46:47.440 align:start position:0%
certainly for the future years
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
um probably for fy23 the number the fy23
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
number i believe should be a little bit
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
higher because our ind
 
01:47:00.550 --> 01:47:00.560 align:start position:0%
number the current rate is going to be
 
01:47:02.470 --> 01:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
higher i believe
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
and in the
 
01:47:05.750 --> 01:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
years after that
 
01:47:07.590 --> 01:47:07.600 align:start position:0%
it will be higher
 
01:47:08.950 --> 01:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have a higher
 
01:47:10.790 --> 01:47:10.800 align:start position:0%
higher number to start with
 
01:47:14.390 --> 01:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
so when you are on the
 
01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.510 align:start position:0%
so when you are on the
estimates

01:47:15.510 --> 01:47:15.520 align:start position:0%
estimates
 
01:47:17.270 --> 01:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to this
 
01:47:17.280 --> 01:47:20.229 align:start position:0%
we'll come back to this
right

01:47:20.229 --> 01:47:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:25.990 --> 01:47:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.109 --> 01:47:29.119 align:start position:0%
would not affect the 22
 
01:47:32.149 --> 01:47:32.159 align:start position:0%
but an estimate of 20 million dollars
 
01:47:39.750 --> 01:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.510 --> 01:47:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.669 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:47:45.669 --> 01:47:45.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
didn't that check doesn't that 12
 
01:47:50.470 --> 01:47:50.480 align:start position:0%
million dollar change in 22
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
pack yes it does um i don't have it
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
right in front of me it should be lower
 
01:47:57.189 --> 01:47:57.199 align:start position:0%
it'll take time to roll it out if it
 
01:47:57.199 --> 01:47:58.229 align:start position:0%
it'll take time to roll it out if it
passes

01:47:58.229 --> 01:47:58.239 align:start position:0%
passes
 
01:48:00.149 --> 01:48:00.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
01:48:02.390 --> 01:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
it is low and we're gonna have to
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
correct that number i have a comment on
 
01:48:04.880 --> 01:48:05.669 align:start position:0%
correct that number i have a comment on
that

01:48:05.669 --> 01:48:05.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:48:05.679 --> 01:48:07.030 align:start position:0%
that
yes

01:48:07.030 --> 01:48:07.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.470 align:start position:0%
yes
um

01:48:08.470 --> 01:48:08.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:11.590 --> 01:48:11.600 align:start position:0%
okay the fiscal analysis of
 
01:48:12.950 --> 01:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
of that bill
 
01:48:17.350 --> 01:48:17.360 align:start position:0%
um i forgot the number is 626.
 
01:48:19.830 --> 01:48:19.840 align:start position:0%
626 yes yeah
 
01:48:21.590 --> 01:48:21.600 align:start position:0%
i think uh
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
i have a question about that uh the uh
 
01:48:26.550 --> 01:48:26.560 align:start position:0%
analysis assumes a 12
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
takeout or
 
01:48:30.070 --> 01:48:30.080 align:start position:0%
uh commit uh i call it's called a
 
01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.510 align:start position:0%
uh commit uh i call it's called a
commission

01:48:31.510 --> 01:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
commission
 
01:48:33.669 --> 01:48:33.679 align:start position:0%
the rest stays with the people who are
 
01:48:33.679 --> 01:48:35.910 align:start position:0%
the rest stays with the people who are
gambling

01:48:35.910 --> 01:48:35.920 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:37.510 align:start position:0%
gambling
and

01:48:37.510 --> 01:48:37.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
the twelve percent is the maximum
 
01:48:42.629 --> 01:48:42.639 align:start position:0%
allowed by the bill
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
in practice and i believe in the
 
01:48:47.510 --> 01:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
testimony we've received
 
01:48:50.470 --> 01:48:50.480 align:start position:0%
the takeout is about eight percent
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
um not 12 percent
 
01:48:54.790 --> 01:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
you'll remember
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
presentations that took that eight
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
percent and then divided it amongst the
 
01:49:00.950 --> 01:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
state and the charities and the
 
01:49:03.189 --> 01:49:03.199 align:start position:0%
operators um
 
01:49:03.199 --> 01:49:04.709 align:start position:0%
operators um
and

01:49:04.709 --> 01:49:04.719 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:06.790 --> 01:49:06.800 align:start position:0%
so if you work off of an eight percent
 
01:49:08.709 --> 01:49:08.719 align:start position:0%
you're going to get a smaller number for
 
01:49:09.830 --> 01:49:09.840 align:start position:0%
the state
 
01:49:12.870 --> 01:49:12.880 align:start position:0%
takeoff take out i believe eight percent
 
01:49:15.189 --> 01:49:15.199 align:start position:0%
uh i think the testimony or documents
 
01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:16.960 align:start position:0%
that we received
 
01:49:19.830 --> 01:49:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh is consistent with what the
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
other states that have historic horse
 
01:49:23.350 --> 01:49:23.360 align:start position:0%
racing gaming
 
01:49:27.910 --> 01:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
have uh have taken out um and uh that we
 
01:49:29.510 --> 01:49:29.520 align:start position:0%
should be working off of that lower
 
01:49:31.350 --> 01:49:31.360 align:start position:0%
number and making the calculation of the
 
01:49:31.360 --> 01:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
number and making the calculation of the
state's

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
state's
 
01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:34.550 align:start position:0%
state's
um

01:49:34.550 --> 01:49:34.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:37.990 --> 01:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
prospective revenue from this
 
01:49:39.589 --> 01:49:39.599 align:start position:0%
norm can i respond
 
01:49:39.599 --> 01:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
norm can i respond
yes

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:44.229 --> 01:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
uh again the 12 million uh
 
01:49:45.910 --> 01:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
comes from lottery
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
i can check at lunch
 
01:49:50.470 --> 01:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh double check at lunch to see
 
01:49:52.070 --> 01:49:52.080 align:start position:0%
how they did the math
 
01:49:53.510 --> 01:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
is that okay
 
01:49:53.520 --> 01:49:54.470 align:start position:0%
is that okay
yep

01:49:54.470 --> 01:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
that makes sense and i just make sure
 
01:49:58.470 --> 01:49:58.480 align:start position:0%
you're asked about the 12 versus the
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
eight percent of some
 
01:50:03.109 --> 01:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
assumption whether they use the 12 or
 
01:50:04.709 --> 01:50:04.719 align:start position:0%
it probably i think they probably use 10
 
01:50:04.719 --> 01:50:05.750 align:start position:0%
it probably i think they probably use 10
percent

01:50:05.750 --> 01:50:05.760 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:06.629 align:start position:0%
percent
uh

01:50:06.629 --> 01:50:06.639 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:09.030 --> 01:50:09.040 align:start position:0%
the calculation is clear uh patrick it's
 
01:50:11.350 --> 01:50:11.360 align:start position:0%
right there on the face of the
 
01:50:13.990 --> 01:50:14.000 align:start position:0%
thing is twelve percent of the uh
 
01:50:16.070 --> 01:50:16.080 align:start position:0%
i'm forgetting the uh gambling number
 
01:50:18.149 --> 01:50:18.159 align:start position:0%
but it's the gross gaming uh gross
 
01:50:20.310 --> 01:50:20.320 align:start position:0%
amount bet
 
01:50:25.030 --> 01:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:28.629 --> 01:50:28.639 align:start position:0%
12 and 12. it's 12 12 is the commission
 
01:50:30.550 --> 01:50:30.560 align:start position:0%
um that's the maximum commission in the
 
01:50:32.470 --> 01:50:32.480 align:start position:0%
bill i mean yeah the way that the math
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
works is
 
01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.189 align:start position:0%
works is
right

01:50:35.189 --> 01:50:35.199 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:50:38.149 --> 01:50:38.159 align:start position:0%
yeah we if we use the 12 percent well it
 
01:50:39.910 --> 01:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter what we have 12 percent
 
01:50:42.629 --> 01:50:42.639 align:start position:0%
then 25 of the 12 goes to the state and
 
01:50:42.639 --> 01:50:44.070 align:start position:0%
then 25 of the 12 goes to the state and
charities

01:50:44.070 --> 01:50:44.080 align:start position:0%
charities
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
and of that 25
 
01:50:50.229 --> 01:50:50.239 align:start position:0%
uh 35 goes to the charities that's the
 
01:50:52.390 --> 01:50:52.400 align:start position:0%
way that match plays out but i'll double
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
check i'll double check that i have to
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.189 --> 01:50:59.199 align:start position:0%
right there's a pretty extensive fiscal
 
01:51:01.109 --> 01:51:01.119 align:start position:0%
note that i have in my folder here and
 
01:51:03.589 --> 01:51:03.599 align:start position:0%
it did talk about on
 
01:51:08.149 --> 01:51:08.159 align:start position:0%
using in 80 uh 88 i think it was going
 
01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:10.080 align:start position:0%
back to the charity
 
01:51:12.550 --> 01:51:12.560 align:start position:0%
no 88 questions
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
the players
 
01:51:13.760 --> 01:51:15.830 align:start position:0%
the players
yeah

01:51:15.830 --> 01:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:51:18.830 --> 01:51:18.840 align:start position:0%
okay you're gonna check
 
01:51:21.350 --> 01:51:21.360 align:start position:0%
okay the um
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
the next is
 
01:51:25.189 --> 01:51:25.199 align:start position:0%
we don't have the
 
01:51:25.199 --> 01:51:25.990 align:start position:0%
we don't have the
clear

01:51:25.990 --> 01:51:26.000 align:start position:0%
clear
 
01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:27.830 align:start position:0%
clear
clarification

01:51:27.830 --> 01:51:27.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:51:30.229 --> 01:51:30.239 align:start position:0%
the business profits tax credit carry
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
forward limited to 50
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
and what i did here is i used the middle
 
01:51:38.390 --> 01:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
of shows on
 
01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:39.830 align:start position:0%
of shows on
15

01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
15
 
01:51:43.430 --> 01:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
on the first year 0 to 32
 
01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:44.629 align:start position:0%
on the first year 0 to 32
and

01:51:44.629 --> 01:51:44.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:46.709 --> 01:51:46.719 align:start position:0%
in the mid range
 
01:51:50.070 --> 01:51:50.080 align:start position:0%
on the other but according to melissa
 
01:51:52.229 --> 01:51:52.239 align:start position:0%
it really should be towards the other
 
01:51:52.239 --> 01:51:53.270 align:start position:0%
it really should be towards the other
end

01:51:53.270 --> 01:51:53.280 align:start position:0%
end
 
01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:55.270 align:start position:0%
end
and

01:51:55.270 --> 01:51:55.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:51:58.390 --> 01:51:58.400 align:start position:0%
we'll just wait until we hear from
 
01:52:01.750 --> 01:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
the dra on this before we plug numbers
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:52:08.229 --> 01:52:08.239 align:start position:0%
the next line 11 which is house bill 591
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
lynn ober wanted me to put this in here
 
01:52:14.310 --> 01:52:14.320 align:start position:0%
because they're putting house bill 591
 
01:52:16.709 --> 01:52:16.719 align:start position:0%
liquor license fees
 
01:52:16.719 --> 01:52:17.750 align:start position:0%
liquor license fees
into

01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
into
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
the two
 
01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it amounts to 36
 
01:52:26.070 --> 01:52:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:28.390 --> 01:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
just to make it complete so i put it in
 
01:52:28.400 --> 01:52:30.229 align:start position:0%
just to make it complete so i put it in
there

01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:33.750 --> 01:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
these cdf numbers that you see below
 
01:52:37.350 --> 01:52:37.360 align:start position:0%
are the credit carry forward numbers
 
01:52:38.950 --> 01:52:38.960 align:start position:0%
that i picked up from
 
01:52:42.390 --> 01:52:42.400 align:start position:0%
the bra for those various years just
 
01:52:44.390 --> 01:52:44.400 align:start position:0%
give you some idea what the magnitude of
 
01:52:47.189 --> 01:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:47.199 --> 01:52:48.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:51.270 --> 01:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm major this is chris um i'm gonna go
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
back to the liquor license fee for a
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
second yes
 
01:52:56.470 --> 01:52:56.480 align:start position:0%
that's actually a plus not a minus i
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
know it's small dollars but just
 
01:53:00.629 --> 01:53:00.639 align:start position:0%
it is a plus
 
01:53:02.470 --> 01:53:02.480 align:start position:0%
so change that
 
01:53:06.149 --> 01:53:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:14.070 --> 01:53:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:16.550 --> 01:53:16.560 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to also comment that
 
01:53:16.560 --> 01:53:18.229 align:start position:0%
i guess i'd like to also comment that
that

01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:53:20.629 --> 01:53:20.639 align:start position:0%
particularly for the ind
 
01:53:24.310 --> 01:53:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:26.390 --> 01:53:26.400 align:start position:0%
more a complete presentation would have
 
01:53:29.109 --> 01:53:29.119 align:start position:0%
fy 26 and 27
 
01:53:32.470 --> 01:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:35.270 --> 01:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
and would show in the end 135 million
 
01:53:38.470 --> 01:53:38.480 align:start position:0%
dollars or 130 or whatever number we
 
01:53:41.910 --> 01:53:41.920 align:start position:0%
fix on loss
 
01:53:44.229 --> 01:53:44.239 align:start position:0%
you'd like to have it shown on this
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
i really would i think that's uh that's
 
01:53:48.229 --> 01:53:48.239 align:start position:0%
a part of the picture that's also you
 
01:53:48.239 --> 01:53:49.270 align:start position:0%
a part of the picture that's also you
know

01:53:49.270 --> 01:53:49.280 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:53:51.910 --> 01:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
you can do that
 
01:53:54.390 --> 01:53:54.400 align:start position:0%
so can you do that uh add that
 
01:53:54.400 --> 01:54:00.149 align:start position:0%
so can you do that uh add that
chris

01:54:00.149 --> 01:54:00.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:01.830 --> 01:54:01.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i just gotta find the information
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i can add it okay
 
01:54:06.629 --> 01:54:06.639 align:start position:0%
um got too many files open at the moment
 
01:54:06.639 --> 01:54:08.790 align:start position:0%
um got too many files open at the moment
too

01:54:08.790 --> 01:54:08.800 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:54:11.750 --> 01:54:11.760 align:start position:0%
now what i would like to do is
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
go into
 
01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:17.350 align:start position:0%
go into
regular

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:17.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:19.430 align:start position:0%
 
revenues

01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
revenues
 
01:54:23.350 --> 01:54:23.360 align:start position:0%
and chris has
 
01:54:25.990 --> 01:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
sent out the worksheets
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
and before i do that
 
01:54:32.070 --> 01:54:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.180 --> 01:55:37.190 align:start position:0%

01:59:21.030 --> 01:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:23.109 --> 01:59:23.119 align:start position:0%
yeah chris

can you bring up
 
01:59:28.830 --> 01:59:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that the dre
 
01:59:34.390 --> 01:59:34.400 align:start position:0%
would put out on the 10th of march
 
01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:35.589 align:start position:0%
would put out on the 10th of march
their

01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:59:39.109 --> 01:59:39.119 align:start position:0%
newer estimate range
 
01:59:41.030 --> 01:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
yeah i can do that okay that's what
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.590 --> 01:59:49.600 align:start position:0%

janine
 
02:00:03.750 --> 02:00:03.760 align:start position:0%
is going to bring up the spreadsheet
 
02:00:06.310 --> 02:00:06.320 align:start position:0%
that the dra put out on the 10th of
 
02:00:06.320 --> 02:00:07.270 align:start position:0%
that the dra put out on the 10th of
march

02:00:07.270 --> 02:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
march
 
02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.229 align:start position:0%
march
that

02:00:08.229 --> 02:00:08.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:00:11.350 --> 02:00:11.360 align:start position:0%
everybody should have a copy of but
 
02:00:13.510 --> 02:00:13.520 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to see it on the
 
02:00:13.520 --> 02:00:30.390 align:start position:0%
they'll be able to see it on the
screen

02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:30.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:30.400 --> 02:00:44.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:00:55.189 --> 02:00:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:57.350 --> 02:00:57.360 align:start position:0%
i let devin
 
02:01:00.950 --> 02:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
rodrick in just in case he's needed oh

thank you
 
02:01:04.159 --> 02:01:15.109 align:start position:0%
thank you
yeah

02:01:15.109 --> 02:01:15.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:17.589 --> 02:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
yeah i think mostly everybody should be
 
02:01:23.669 --> 02:01:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.310 --> 02:01:26.320 align:start position:0%
you have one hand raised that's our
 
02:01:26.320 --> 02:01:31.750 align:start position:0%
you have one hand raised that's our
guest

02:01:31.750 --> 02:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:35.030 --> 02:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
excuse me i i don't know if i have this
 
02:01:38.790 --> 02:01:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:40.790 --> 02:01:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative omni sent me quite a few
 
02:01:42.629 --> 02:01:42.639 align:start position:0%
things but i don't
 
02:01:44.790 --> 02:01:44.800 align:start position:0%
the only spreadsheet i got was the one
 
02:01:55.030 --> 02:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.040 --> 02:01:55.910 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:01:55.910 --> 02:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
i thought i did send it to you but it's
 
02:01:59.679 --> 02:02:00.470 align:start position:0%
i thought i did send it to you but it's
just

02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:02:02.830 --> 02:02:02.840 align:start position:0%
it's a single page it isn't really a
 
02:02:06.390 --> 02:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:10.149 --> 02:02:10.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:12.950 --> 02:02:12.960 align:start position:0%
and and that's what it's entitled i may
 
02:02:15.350 --> 02:02:15.360 align:start position:0%
have put dra in the front of it so you'd
 
02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:21.109 align:start position:0%
have put dra in the front of it so you'd
know

02:02:21.109 --> 02:02:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:30.229 --> 02:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to look at than our
 
02:02:34.870 --> 02:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:36.629 --> 02:02:36.639 align:start position:0%
that green on there is almost the same
 
02:02:45.350 --> 02:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:49.270 --> 02:02:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
okay uh what i want to do next
 
02:02:54.709 --> 02:02:54.719 align:start position:0%
since we have the dra
 
02:02:57.510 --> 02:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
is to go over the dra revenues
 
02:02:57.520 --> 02:03:00.070 align:start position:0%
is to go over the dra revenues
associated

02:03:00.070 --> 02:03:00.080 align:start position:0%
associated
 
02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:01.350 align:start position:0%
associated
with

02:03:01.350 --> 02:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
our total revenues
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
and they provided us a sheet dated
 
02:03:08.870 --> 02:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
march 10th
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
which up
 
02:03:14.310 --> 02:03:14.320 align:start position:0%
updates their revenue estimates
 
02:03:18.470 --> 02:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
and the first is the business taxes
 
02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.629 align:start position:0%
and the first is the business taxes
and

02:03:20.629 --> 02:03:20.639 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
the committee agreed on fy 21 of 809.8
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
in the business taxes
 
02:03:30.270 --> 02:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
and eight
 
02:03:33.109 --> 02:03:33.119 align:start position:0%
26.5 million dollars
 
02:03:35.510 --> 02:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
on fy 22
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
and 840 million dollars
 
02:03:41.189 --> 02:03:41.199 align:start position:0%
on fy 23.
 
02:03:44.709 --> 02:03:44.719 align:start position:0%
uh you can see as we go out in years we
 
02:03:49.510 --> 02:03:49.520 align:start position:0%
deviate a lot more so now if the dra
 
02:03:49.520 --> 02:03:52.229 align:start position:0%
deviate a lot more so now if the dra
would

02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:54.229 --> 02:03:54.239 align:start position:0%
explain what they did
 
02:03:55.589 --> 02:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
for changes
 
02:04:00.790 --> 02:04:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:02.950 --> 02:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative major for
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
the record melissa rollins senior
 
02:04:05.990 --> 02:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
financial analyst at department of
 
02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:07.109 align:start position:0%
financial analyst at department of
revenue

02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
02:04:10.629 --> 02:04:10.639 align:start position:0%
um so this was just a quick update when
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
i say quick i just mean we kept all our
 
02:04:14.550 --> 02:04:14.560 align:start position:0%
assumptions the same that we have
 
02:04:16.470 --> 02:04:16.480 align:start position:0%
previou previously
 
02:04:19.510 --> 02:04:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh presented to you all we did in this
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
scenario is take out february estimates
 
02:04:25.350 --> 02:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
and reduce them with february actuals
 
02:04:27.990 --> 02:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
and because business taxes
 
02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:29.750 align:start position:0%
and because business taxes
performed

02:04:29.750 --> 02:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
performed
 
02:04:33.030 --> 02:04:33.040 align:start position:0%
much higher than we anticipated
 
02:04:35.830 --> 02:04:35.840 align:start position:0%
for february the number range has
 
02:04:38.149 --> 02:04:38.159 align:start position:0%
increased what i do want to note that
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
special about
 
02:04:41.990 --> 02:04:42.000 align:start position:0%
are different about business taxes for
 
02:04:43.910 --> 02:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21
 
02:04:46.790 --> 02:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
is that in february february we did
 
02:04:49.030 --> 02:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
receive some anomalous tax notice
 
02:04:50.629 --> 02:04:50.639 align:start position:0%
payment activity
 
02:04:52.390 --> 02:04:52.400 align:start position:0%
that we do not anticipate
 
02:04:55.990 --> 02:04:56.000 align:start position:0%
to continue in 22 and 23. so that being
 
02:04:58.709 --> 02:04:58.719 align:start position:0%
said it was about 10 million dollars
 
02:05:00.629 --> 02:05:00.639 align:start position:0%
which should be recognized in fiscal
 
02:05:04.229 --> 02:05:04.239 align:start position:0%
year 21 and is included in our ranges
 
02:05:06.870 --> 02:05:06.880 align:start position:0%
however when we did the growth for 22
 
02:05:10.229 --> 02:05:10.239 align:start position:0%
and 23 or for 22 excuse me we received
 
02:05:12.790 --> 02:05:12.800 align:start position:0%
removed 10 million from the fiscal year
 
02:05:14.229 --> 02:05:14.239 align:start position:0%
21 base
 
02:05:15.350 --> 02:05:15.360 align:start position:0%
and grew
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
that figure by the 1
 
02:05:18.830 --> 02:05:18.840 align:start position:0%
in 3
 
02:05:21.430 --> 02:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
percent i think that's the only
 
02:05:23.589 --> 02:05:23.599 align:start position:0%
difference that we did on these except
 
02:05:25.910 --> 02:05:25.920 align:start position:0%
again remove our february estimates for
 
02:05:27.990 --> 02:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
our low and high and replace them with
 
02:05:34.790 --> 02:05:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.800 --> 02:05:35.589 align:start position:0%
 
and

02:05:35.589 --> 02:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:05:35.599 --> 02:05:36.870 align:start position:0%
and
um

02:05:36.870 --> 02:05:36.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:40.229 --> 02:05:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:43.589 --> 02:05:43.599 align:start position:0%
your low was 799.8
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.430 --> 02:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
and so they went up quite a bit in fy
 
02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:57.270 align:start position:0%
and so they went up quite a bit in fy
21.

02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.870 --> 02:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
what we did
 
02:06:07.830 --> 02:06:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.069 --> 02:06:12.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:12.079 --> 02:06:14.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:18.310 --> 02:06:18.320 align:start position:0%
and you only did this because of
 
02:06:21.669 --> 02:06:21.679 align:start position:0%
the february results
 
02:06:23.350 --> 02:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
you made these changes based on the
 
02:06:26.310 --> 02:06:26.320 align:start position:0%
february results
 
02:06:29.189 --> 02:06:29.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
and that would affect
 
02:06:35.350 --> 02:06:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:37.189 --> 02:06:37.199 align:start position:0%
questions from many
 
02:06:37.199 --> 02:06:45.990 align:start position:0%
questions from many
reps

02:06:45.990 --> 02:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:48.790 --> 02:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
susan you muted
 
02:06:51.430 --> 02:06:51.440 align:start position:0%
um you didn't finish calling me i
 
02:06:51.440 --> 02:06:52.470 align:start position:0%
um you didn't finish calling me i
thought

02:06:52.470 --> 02:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
thought
 
02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.750 align:start position:0%
thought
um

02:06:53.750 --> 02:06:53.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:55.830 --> 02:06:55.840 align:start position:0%
are we only dealing with 21 right now
 
02:06:57.990 --> 02:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to question the growth
 
02:06:58.000 --> 02:06:59.189 align:start position:0%
because i wanted to question the growth
numbers

02:06:59.189 --> 02:06:59.199 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:04.870 --> 02:07:04.880 align:start position:0%
21 right now
 
02:07:04.880 --> 02:07:06.709 align:start position:0%
21 right now
um

02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is there's the 8 17
 
02:07:13.910 --> 02:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
that you have in 21 does not show that
 
02:07:16.629 --> 02:07:16.639 align:start position:0%
at 10 million dollars
 
02:07:17.750 --> 02:07:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh no
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
no the 817 includes the 10 million
 
02:07:23.030 --> 02:07:23.040 align:start position:0%
so it should be
 
02:07:26.149 --> 02:07:26.159 align:start position:0%
if you want to compare with our numbers
 
02:07:26.159 --> 02:07:27.550 align:start position:0%
if you want to compare with our numbers
your

02:07:27.550 --> 02:07:27.560 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:07:30.030 --> 02:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
807.0 and we were
 
02:07:32.950 --> 02:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
809.8 which is
 
02:07:35.990 --> 02:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:37.669 --> 02:07:37.679 align:start position:0%
that's for growing
 
02:07:41.589 --> 02:07:41.599 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22 however in fiscal year 21
 
02:07:43.589 --> 02:07:43.599 align:start position:0%
you want to res you want to include that
 
02:07:45.669 --> 02:07:45.679 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable
 
02:07:45.679 --> 02:07:47.669 align:start position:0%
anomalous receivable
so

02:07:47.669 --> 02:07:47.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:50.390 --> 02:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
you would want to add 10 million into
 
02:07:54.550 --> 02:07:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.560 --> 02:07:55.589 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:07:55.589 --> 02:07:55.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:07:57.510 --> 02:07:57.520 align:start position:0%
if we added 10 million into our
 
02:08:00.229 --> 02:08:00.239 align:start position:0%
estimates for 21 it would be
 
02:08:00.239 --> 02:08:01.750 align:start position:0%
estimates for 21 it would be
819.8

02:08:01.750 --> 02:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
819.8
 
02:08:06.470 --> 02:08:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:08.790 --> 02:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
that's correct
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:15.189 --> 02:08:15.199 align:start position:0%
thank you i still i i'm particularly
 
02:08:17.750 --> 02:08:17.760 align:start position:0%
interested in 22 and 23 so i don't want
 
02:08:20.390 --> 02:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
to talk until then thanks okay well
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's what we're on now as 20 and 22
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
you you took the 817
 
02:08:28.790 --> 02:08:28.800 align:start position:0%
and you increased it one and three
 
02:08:31.910 --> 02:08:31.920 align:start position:0%
percent which gave you the 815
 
02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:34.830 align:start position:0%
percent which gave you the 815
what

02:08:34.830 --> 02:08:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:38.709 --> 02:08:38.719 align:start position:0%
no we removed 10 million we moved the 10
 
02:08:41.189 --> 02:08:41.199 align:start position:0%
million yes to grow the base because we
 
02:08:42.950 --> 02:08:42.960 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate that happening again
 
02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
in 22.
 
02:08:47.589 --> 02:08:47.599 align:start position:0%
and so you used 07
 
02:08:50.870 --> 02:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
by 1 to give you 815
 
02:08:52.470 --> 02:08:52.480 align:start position:0%
and then the three percent gives you
 
02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:56.470 align:start position:0%
and then the three percent gives you
855.9

02:08:56.470 --> 02:08:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:01.750 --> 02:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:05.109 --> 02:09:05.119 align:start position:0%
mr chairman if we're on 22-23 can i ask
 
02:09:07.109 --> 02:09:07.119 align:start position:0%
my question yes
 
02:09:08.149 --> 02:09:08.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:09:08.159 --> 02:09:09.189 align:start position:0%
thank you
on

02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:09.199 --> 02:09:10.629 align:start position:0%
on
i'm

02:09:10.629 --> 02:09:10.639 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
wondering originally you set growth
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
rates in 22
 
02:09:16.000 --> 02:09:16.950 align:start position:0%
rates in 22
uh

02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:09:21.350 --> 02:09:21.360 align:start position:0%
22 of uh one to three percent
 
02:09:24.310 --> 02:09:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh thinking that it would be slow to
 
02:09:27.109 --> 02:09:27.119 align:start position:0%
take off that was before
 
02:09:27.119 --> 02:09:27.990 align:start position:0%
take off that was before
on

02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:31.510 --> 02:09:31.520 align:start position:0%
the recovery package i think in december
 
02:09:34.069 --> 02:09:34.079 align:start position:0%
but certainly before the american
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
recovery plan
 
02:09:39.350 --> 02:09:39.360 align:start position:0%
on that's just been passed and i've been
 
02:09:43.430 --> 02:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
reading the blasts going out from my
 
02:09:46.470 --> 02:09:46.480 align:start position:0%
uh regional chamber of commerce the
 
02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
upper valley business alliance telling
 
02:09:51.030 --> 02:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
people about all the things they can
 
02:09:52.790 --> 02:09:52.800 align:start position:0%
apply for and that they have to start
 
02:09:54.790 --> 02:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
applying immediately
 
02:09:54.800 --> 02:09:55.910 align:start position:0%
applying immediately
on

02:09:55.910 --> 02:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:09:57.589 --> 02:09:57.599 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:09:59.109 --> 02:09:59.119 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering
 
02:10:01.030 --> 02:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
if one if
 
02:10:05.030 --> 02:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
if the growth path is going to be more
 
02:10:05.040 --> 02:10:05.910 align:start position:0%
if the growth path is going to be more
for

02:10:05.910 --> 02:10:05.920 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:10:05.920 --> 02:10:07.430 align:start position:0%
for
22

02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:10:10.870 --> 02:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe less for 23 than
 
02:10:13.109 --> 02:10:13.119 align:start position:0%
than what you'd originally been looking
 
02:10:13.119 --> 02:10:15.910 align:start position:0%
than what you'd originally been looking
at

02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:17.830 --> 02:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
sure i think first off i just want to
 
02:10:19.270 --> 02:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
say that's a great question and a great
 
02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.470 align:start position:0%
say that's a great question and a great
point

02:10:20.470 --> 02:10:20.480 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:10:23.990 --> 02:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
we have not re-analyzed our numbers
 
02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:24.280 align:start position:0%
we have not re-analyzed our numbers
for

02:10:24.280 --> 02:10:24.290 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:10:24.290 --> 02:10:25.430 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:10:28.390 --> 02:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
for fiscal year 22 or fiscal year 23 we
 
02:10:31.189 --> 02:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
intend to do that um the end of this
 
02:10:31.199 --> 02:10:32.229 align:start position:0%
intend to do that um the end of this
month

02:10:32.229 --> 02:10:32.239 align:start position:0%
month
 
02:10:33.750 --> 02:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
obviously like you said the stimulus
 
02:10:35.430 --> 02:10:35.440 align:start position:0%
package came in since we've done to what
 
02:10:37.189 --> 02:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
the one to three percent range and the
 
02:10:39.109 --> 02:10:39.119 align:start position:0%
four to six percent revenues have also
 
02:10:41.589 --> 02:10:41.599 align:start position:0%
come in um a little bit ahead of it so
 
02:10:43.430 --> 02:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
we're definitely
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
planning on looking that again looking
 
02:10:47.270 --> 02:10:47.280 align:start position:0%
at that again to see if the one to three
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
still makes sense and the four to six
 
02:10:54.870 --> 02:10:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:56.470 --> 02:10:56.480 align:start position:0%
so you'll be adjusting
 
02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:57.109 align:start position:0%
so you'll be adjusting
the

02:10:57.109 --> 02:10:57.119 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:10:59.189 --> 02:10:59.199 align:start position:0%
end of the month
 
02:11:03.750 --> 02:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:06.790 --> 02:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
like to consider adjusting before then
 
02:11:13.109 --> 02:11:13.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:17.270 --> 02:11:17.280 align:start position:0%
and what would your recommendation be
 
02:11:17.280 --> 02:11:19.510 align:start position:0%
and what would your recommendation be
represented

02:11:19.510 --> 02:11:19.520 align:start position:0%
represented
 
02:11:19.520 --> 02:11:29.030 align:start position:0%
represented
elmi

02:11:29.030 --> 02:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:42.470 --> 02:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:44.149 --> 02:11:44.159 align:start position:0%
my laptop just pulled something up on
 
02:11:47.510 --> 02:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
top of you i'm sorry uh this would be
 
02:11:50.390 --> 02:11:50.400 align:start position:0%
totally off the wall but
 
02:11:50.400 --> 02:11:51.990 align:start position:0%
totally off the wall but
but

02:11:51.990 --> 02:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:11:53.109 --> 02:11:53.119 align:start position:0%
i would
 
02:11:55.030 --> 02:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking about
 
02:11:59.990 --> 02:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh fy 22 on this summer through
 
02:12:01.589 --> 02:12:01.599 align:start position:0%
next summer
 
02:12:01.599 --> 02:12:03.990 align:start position:0%
next summer
and

02:12:03.990 --> 02:12:04.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:04.000 --> 02:12:04.790 align:start position:0%
 
on

02:12:04.790 --> 02:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:12:07.910 --> 02:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
the restaurants in particular and and
 
02:12:11.189 --> 02:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
lodging are getting quite a boost uh the
 
02:12:14.069 --> 02:12:14.079 align:start position:0%
tourism markets seem to be
 
02:12:14.079 --> 02:12:15.270 align:start position:0%
tourism markets seem to be
growing

02:12:15.270 --> 02:12:15.280 align:start position:0%
growing
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
quite a lot right now uh
 
02:12:18.639 --> 02:12:20.950 align:start position:0%
quite a lot right now uh
and

02:12:20.950 --> 02:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:12:23.030 --> 02:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
the question is whether there would be
 
02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:24.880 align:start position:0%
growth in the biggest
 
02:12:27.910 --> 02:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
companies that are the ones that we are
 
02:12:30.390 --> 02:12:30.400 align:start position:0%
on getting most of our business taxes
 
02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:31.270 align:start position:0%
on getting most of our business taxes
from

02:12:31.270 --> 02:12:31.280 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:12:32.950 --> 02:12:32.960 align:start position:0%
and which have been doing very well with
 
02:12:34.790 --> 02:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
 
02:12:34.800 --> 02:12:37.430 align:start position:0%
the pandemic
on

02:12:37.430 --> 02:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
so i
 
02:12:42.790 --> 02:12:42.800 align:start position:0%
i can't wrap my head too much around
 
02:12:44.870 --> 02:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
this but i would like to
 
02:12:44.880 --> 02:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
this but i would like to
to

02:12:47.750 --> 02:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:50.950 --> 02:12:50.960 align:start position:0%
maybe conservatively promote that to two
 
02:12:52.950 --> 02:12:52.960 align:start position:0%
percent to four percent in the first
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:58.390 --> 02:12:58.400 align:start position:0%
maybe four to five percent the year
 
02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:01.030 align:start position:0%
maybe four to five percent the year
after

02:13:01.030 --> 02:13:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:03.109 align:start position:0%
 
so

02:13:03.109 --> 02:13:03.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:13:05.030 --> 02:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
so you're recommending two to four
 
02:13:10.149 --> 02:13:10.159 align:start position:0%
percent for the 22 i mean yeah 22 and
 
02:13:12.950 --> 02:13:12.960 align:start position:0%
and what for 23.
 
02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:13.910 align:start position:0%
and what for 23.
um

02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:13:17.430 --> 02:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
four to five percent
 
02:13:20.069 --> 02:13:20.079 align:start position:0%
not not quite as much growth because it
 
02:13:21.990 --> 02:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
would already be occurring
 
02:13:24.550 --> 02:13:24.560 align:start position:0%
this year and this next year starting
 
02:13:28.550 --> 02:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:30.470 --> 02:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
actually starting in a few
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:36.069 --> 02:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
02:13:38.870 --> 02:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
represent ames
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
02:13:44.550 --> 02:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
so first on fiscal year 21
 
02:13:46.149 --> 02:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
we're now
 
02:13:48.229 --> 02:13:48.239 align:start position:0%
more than halfway through march
 
02:13:48.239 --> 02:13:49.510 align:start position:0%
more than halfway through march
and

02:13:49.510 --> 02:13:49.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:13:51.189 --> 02:13:51.199 align:start position:0%
so my question
 
02:13:53.990 --> 02:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
to melissa is
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
whether and i think we've gotten some
 
02:13:56.159 --> 02:13:59.270 align:start position:0%
whether and i think we've gotten some
revenue

02:13:59.270 --> 02:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:02.870 --> 02:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
reports uh for the last couple of days
 
02:14:05.990 --> 02:14:06.000 align:start position:0%
which for business taxes
 
02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:07.030 align:start position:0%
which for business taxes
are

02:14:07.030 --> 02:14:07.040 align:start position:0%
are
 
02:14:09.430 --> 02:14:09.440 align:start position:0%
look pretty good at least what i saw
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen today's
 
02:14:11.280 --> 02:14:12.470 align:start position:0%
i haven't seen today's
so

02:14:12.470 --> 02:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:14:14.390 --> 02:14:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know this is an unfair question but
 
02:14:17.750 --> 02:14:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh can can you
 
02:14:20.629 --> 02:14:20.639 align:start position:0%
are you more optimistic about march
 
02:14:23.669 --> 02:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
now than the uh number that we have
 
02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
before us
 
02:14:25.040 --> 02:14:27.750 align:start position:0%
before us
assumes

02:14:27.750 --> 02:14:27.760 align:start position:0%
assumes
 
02:14:29.669 --> 02:14:29.679 align:start position:0%
i think that's a great a great question
 
02:14:31.109 --> 02:14:31.119 align:start position:0%
representative ames i was actually
 
02:14:32.870 --> 02:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
thinking the same thing before coming in
 
02:14:36.069 --> 02:14:36.079 align:start position:0%
here and seeing um the report today
 
02:14:38.950 --> 02:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
as you know the revenue flows in now
 
02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
pretty heavily and we get a good idea
 
02:14:43.510 --> 02:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
this week of where we're ending in march
 
02:14:45.189 --> 02:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
and as you stated
 
02:14:49.189 --> 02:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
including um the revenue we received on
 
02:14:51.030 --> 02:14:51.040 align:start position:0%
monday um
 
02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:53.360 align:start position:0%
it's looking it's looking optimistic
 
02:14:55.510 --> 02:14:55.520 align:start position:0%
it's looking better than i think we had
 
02:14:58.870 --> 02:14:58.880 align:start position:0%
anticipated uh the the factor that's
 
02:15:00.629 --> 02:15:00.639 align:start position:0%
holding out a little bit is what we
 
02:15:03.189 --> 02:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
issue for refunds and how much that
 
02:15:04.790 --> 02:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
decreases it
 
02:15:04.800 --> 02:15:05.750 align:start position:0%
decreases it
uh

02:15:05.750 --> 02:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:15:07.589 --> 02:15:07.599 align:start position:0%
however we can get a slight idea of
 
02:15:09.430 --> 02:15:09.440 align:start position:0%
what's sitting out there
 
02:15:11.669 --> 02:15:11.679 align:start position:0%
and there isn't anything
 
02:15:13.669 --> 02:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
major that would push us at this point
 
02:15:15.430 --> 02:15:15.440 align:start position:0%
past what we looked at last year for
 
02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.709 align:start position:0%
past what we looked at last year for
refunds

02:15:16.709 --> 02:15:16.719 align:start position:0%
refunds
 
02:15:19.189 --> 02:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
so i definitely think
 
02:15:20.790 --> 02:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
obviously again i want to have it one
 
02:15:22.550 --> 02:15:22.560 align:start position:0%
more thing that april is a big month as
 
02:15:24.550 --> 02:15:24.560 align:start position:0%
you know um right now we're basically
 
02:15:26.629 --> 02:15:26.639 align:start position:0%
looking at partnerships for partnership
 
02:15:29.350 --> 02:15:29.360 align:start position:0%
returns but if we waste based
 
02:15:32.149 --> 02:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
on the trend that we're seeing so far
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
i think there's definitely room in
 
02:15:36.950 --> 02:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 to move up your range or
 
02:15:39.430 --> 02:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
your number for fiscal year 21
 
02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:40.390 align:start position:0%
your number for fiscal year 21
um

02:15:40.390 --> 02:15:40.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
based on the performance so far for
 
02:15:42.639 --> 02:15:44.790 align:start position:0%
based on the performance so far for
march

02:15:44.790 --> 02:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
march
 
02:15:47.109 --> 02:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
i have a related question that you're
 
02:15:47.119 --> 02:15:48.709 align:start position:0%
i have a related question that you're
mentioning

02:15:48.709 --> 02:15:48.719 align:start position:0%
mentioning
 
02:15:50.470 --> 02:15:50.480 align:start position:0%
what do you call it refunds
 
02:15:53.270 --> 02:15:53.280 align:start position:0%
um triggers uh i haven't really
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
understood that
 
02:15:58.629 --> 02:15:58.639 align:start position:0%
when does dra report out refunds
 
02:16:00.950 --> 02:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
is is there a delay there while you sort
 
02:16:03.109 --> 02:16:03.119 align:start position:0%
of gather them together or
 
02:16:05.350 --> 02:16:05.360 align:start position:0%
do they just get reported out as they
 
02:16:05.360 --> 02:16:06.470 align:start position:0%
do they just get reported out as they
come

02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
come
 
02:16:10.069 --> 02:16:10.079 align:start position:0%
sure so we issue refunds every wednesday
 
02:16:12.390 --> 02:16:12.400 align:start position:0%
they do go through a review process so
 
02:16:14.550 --> 02:16:14.560 align:start position:0%
some refunds if they
 
02:16:16.629 --> 02:16:16.639 align:start position:0%
come in and nothing has changed on the
 
02:16:18.629 --> 02:16:18.639 align:start position:0%
return meaning there's no math errors
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
that anything changed those refunds get
 
02:16:22.709 --> 02:16:22.719 align:start position:0%
automatically auto issued is what we
 
02:16:25.030 --> 02:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
called and they get issued right away
 
02:16:27.189 --> 02:16:27.199 align:start position:0%
if they have issues where what their
 
02:16:29.189 --> 02:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
refund is is different than what they
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
requested then those do get reviewed by
 
02:16:34.389 --> 02:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
our taxpayer services group or if they
 
02:16:36.389 --> 02:16:36.399 align:start position:0%
are large dollar numbers they do get
 
02:16:38.309 --> 02:16:38.319 align:start position:0%
bumped to our audit division
 
02:16:40.070 --> 02:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:16:43.030 --> 02:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
does slow the process down but we try to
 
02:16:45.110 --> 02:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
avoid at all costs paying interest on
 
02:16:47.589 --> 02:16:47.599 align:start position:0%
these refunds which is accrued after 60
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
days and we very rarely hit that so
 
02:16:52.309 --> 02:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
we're issuing and turning these around
 
02:16:54.070 --> 02:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
within 60 days of receiving these
 
02:16:55.589 --> 02:16:55.599 align:start position:0%
refunds as long as we have all the
 
02:16:57.750 --> 02:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
information needed and i think what you
 
02:17:00.230 --> 02:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
said is that you don't have a big bunch
 
02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:01.190 align:start position:0%
said is that you don't have a big bunch
of

02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:17:03.509 --> 02:17:03.519 align:start position:0%
questionable refunds sitting there that
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
are under review
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so we're always monitoring these on
 
02:17:09.830 --> 02:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
a regular basis we have a report we have
 
02:17:12.870 --> 02:17:12.880 align:start position:0%
um we do have refund sitting out i think
 
02:17:14.870 --> 02:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
last time we looked it was around three
 
02:17:17.509 --> 02:17:17.519 align:start position:0%
or four million dollars again those get
 
02:17:19.190 --> 02:17:19.200 align:start position:0%
reviewed first so they're not always
 
02:17:21.349 --> 02:17:21.359 align:start position:0%
accurate but looking at that number
 
02:17:23.589 --> 02:17:23.599 align:start position:0%
which was as of a couple of days ago
 
02:17:25.270 --> 02:17:25.280 align:start position:0%
that would equal if we issued all of
 
02:17:27.669 --> 02:17:27.679 align:start position:0%
those that would put us at the same spot
 
02:17:29.910 --> 02:17:29.920 align:start position:0%
as last year but again those are
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
unreviewed refunds so they understand
 
02:17:33.429 --> 02:17:33.439 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
 
02:17:33.439 --> 02:17:35.030 align:start position:0%
that's helpful
um

02:17:35.030 --> 02:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:17:37.270 --> 02:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
okay and mr chair if i could uh just
 
02:17:43.190 --> 02:17:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:45.669 --> 02:17:45.679 align:start position:0%
melissa you said that
 
02:17:45.679 --> 02:17:46.469 align:start position:0%
melissa you said that
you

02:17:46.469 --> 02:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:17:50.709 --> 02:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
if you hold the refund for over 60 days
 
02:17:52.709 --> 02:17:52.719 align:start position:0%
you have to pay interest
 
02:17:53.910 --> 02:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
02:17:56.389 --> 02:17:56.399 align:start position:0%
only for those that request a refund
 
02:17:56.399 --> 02:17:57.190 align:start position:0%
only for those that request a refund
right

02:17:57.190 --> 02:17:57.200 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:00.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct but on the credit carry
 
02:18:00.160 --> 02:18:01.589 align:start position:0%
that's correct but on the credit carry
forward

02:18:01.589 --> 02:18:01.599 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:18:04.070 --> 02:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
when you refund that
 
02:18:06.070 --> 02:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
are there is there any interest paid on
 
02:18:06.080 --> 02:18:07.509 align:start position:0%
are there is there any interest paid on
that

02:18:07.509 --> 02:18:07.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:10.469 --> 02:18:10.479 align:start position:0%
i think i again and carolyn can correct
 
02:18:12.870 --> 02:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
me if i'm wrong i believe those again
 
02:18:15.509 --> 02:18:15.519 align:start position:0%
it's 60 days so it's not considered a
 
02:18:17.910 --> 02:18:17.920 align:start position:0%
refund request until it's requested as a
 
02:18:19.910 --> 02:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
refund it's not um when the money came
 
02:18:23.270 --> 02:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
in because of that um usage of money so
 
02:18:24.950 --> 02:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
once they request that refund interest
 
02:18:25.990 --> 02:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
is paid
 
02:18:27.910 --> 02:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
if we exceed 60 days from the request of
 
02:18:30.790 --> 02:18:30.800 align:start position:0%
the refund what about if hospital two
 
02:18:30.800 --> 02:18:32.070 align:start position:0%
the refund what about if hospital two
passes

02:18:32.070 --> 02:18:32.080 align:start position:0%
passes
 
02:18:32.080 --> 02:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
passes
and

02:18:32.870 --> 02:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:18:34.389 --> 02:18:34.399 align:start position:0%
and you have to
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
a particular business
 
02:18:40.469 --> 02:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
a million dollars over the 50
 
02:18:40.479 --> 02:18:41.910 align:start position:0%
a million dollars over the 50
point

02:18:41.910 --> 02:18:41.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
02:18:43.349 --> 02:18:43.359 align:start position:0%
do you have to pay
 
02:18:45.750 --> 02:18:45.760 align:start position:0%
interest on that
 
02:18:47.990 --> 02:18:48.000 align:start position:0%
i believe again the ref it would can be
 
02:18:49.990 --> 02:18:50.000 align:start position:0%
considered a refund request once they
 
02:18:53.349 --> 02:18:53.359 align:start position:0%
file their 2023 return and that 50 is
 
02:18:55.429 --> 02:18:55.439 align:start position:0%
calculated we would then have 60 days to
 
02:18:55.439 --> 02:18:56.230 align:start position:0%
calculated we would then have 60 days to
pay

02:18:56.230 --> 02:18:56.240 align:start position:0%
pay
 
02:18:58.070 --> 02:18:58.080 align:start position:0%
that and if we hit it within the 60 days
 
02:19:00.070 --> 02:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be paying interest
 
02:19:01.750 --> 02:19:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay even though it comes from the
 
02:19:02.870 --> 02:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
credit card
 
02:19:02.880 --> 02:19:03.910 align:start position:0%
credit card
forward

02:19:03.910 --> 02:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:19:06.070 --> 02:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you go ahead
 
02:19:06.080 --> 02:19:07.270 align:start position:0%
yes okay thank you go ahead
representative

02:19:07.270 --> 02:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:08.309 align:start position:0%
representative
sorry

02:19:08.309 --> 02:19:08.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
02:19:13.750 --> 02:19:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:17.990 --> 02:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
so turning to 22 and 23
 
02:19:19.509 --> 02:19:19.519 align:start position:0%
i just wanted to pick up on what
 
02:19:21.349 --> 02:19:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative volney
 
02:19:24.389 --> 02:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
had uh suggested i think
 
02:19:27.190 --> 02:19:27.200 align:start position:0%
certainly i and probably all of us are
 
02:19:28.469 --> 02:19:28.479 align:start position:0%
feeling more
 
02:19:31.190 --> 02:19:31.200 align:start position:0%
optimistic uh than we were and i it's
 
02:19:34.469 --> 02:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
probably true of dra
 
02:19:36.549 --> 02:19:36.559 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:19:39.910 --> 02:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
the changes that have occurred both
 
02:19:42.549 --> 02:19:42.559 align:start position:0%
with the with the vaccine and the kohit
 
02:19:44.389 --> 02:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
19 and
 
02:19:47.349 --> 02:19:47.359 align:start position:0%
with the enactment of the
 
02:19:50.389 --> 02:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
federal uh stimulus bill
 
02:19:53.110 --> 02:19:53.120 align:start position:0%
america restores act or something like
 
02:19:53.120 --> 02:19:55.190 align:start position:0%
america restores act or something like
that

02:19:55.190 --> 02:19:55.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:19:55.200 --> 02:19:55.850 align:start position:0%
that
and

02:19:55.850 --> 02:19:55.860 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
and
[Music]

02:19:57.590 --> 02:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:19:59.110 --> 02:19:59.120 align:start position:0%
and also
 
02:20:00.630 --> 02:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
just the
 
02:20:02.790 --> 02:20:02.800 align:start position:0%
the pent-up
 
02:20:05.190 --> 02:20:05.200 align:start position:0%
demand that's out there we all know
 
02:20:08.790 --> 02:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
about that and people are feeling um
 
02:20:11.510 --> 02:20:11.520 align:start position:0%
increasingly able to do what they've
 
02:20:12.950 --> 02:20:12.960 align:start position:0%
been wanting to do
 
02:20:15.510 --> 02:20:15.520 align:start position:0%
so i think this all adds up to
 
02:20:18.389 --> 02:20:18.399 align:start position:0%
a lot of economic activity
 
02:20:19.510 --> 02:20:19.520 align:start position:0%
i'm not
 
02:20:21.270 --> 02:20:21.280 align:start position:0%
i think this is really going to happen
 
02:20:23.270 --> 02:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
across the nation but uh
 
02:20:25.190 --> 02:20:25.200 align:start position:0%
also in new hampshire
 
02:20:25.200 --> 02:20:26.469 align:start position:0%
also in new hampshire
and

02:20:26.469 --> 02:20:26.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
that leads me to be optimistic and i i
 
02:20:32.150 --> 02:20:32.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't embrace i don't
 
02:20:34.150 --> 02:20:34.160 align:start position:0%
this isn't hard science obviously but
 
02:20:36.150 --> 02:20:36.160 align:start position:0%
the two two
 
02:20:39.030 --> 02:20:39.040 align:start position:0%
to four percent range um but i would in
 
02:20:41.190 --> 02:20:41.200 align:start position:0%
this in the following year because i've
 
02:20:44.070 --> 02:20:44.080 align:start position:0%
seen a number of forecasts that do this
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
i would have at the high end of the
 
02:20:47.590 --> 02:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
range the six percent that dra is
 
02:20:49.670 --> 02:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
showing here
 
02:20:52.150 --> 02:20:52.160 align:start position:0%
the professional forecasters are all
 
02:20:54.469 --> 02:20:54.479 align:start position:0%
upping their forecasts
 
02:20:54.479 --> 02:20:55.750 align:start position:0%
upping their forecasts
um

02:20:55.750 --> 02:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:58.550 --> 02:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
and they're clearly feeling as as
 
02:21:01.190 --> 02:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
liberated and optimistic as
 
02:21:03.990 --> 02:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
as the rest of us um so that's my
 
02:21:06.070 --> 02:21:06.080 align:start position:0%
comment on that you would say four to
 
02:21:07.349 --> 02:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
02:21:07.359 --> 02:21:08.230 align:start position:0%
seven percent
six

02:21:08.230 --> 02:21:08.240 align:start position:0%
six
 
02:21:09.830 --> 02:21:09.840 align:start position:0%
six to seven
 
02:21:20.450 --> 02:21:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:20.460 --> 02:21:23.270 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:21:23.270 --> 02:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:21:25.830 --> 02:21:25.840 align:start position:0%
thank you i want to go back to 2021 and
 
02:21:27.990 --> 02:21:28.000 align:start position:0%
sorry if i missed something but if i
 
02:21:29.990 --> 02:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
look at the dra
 
02:21:33.349 --> 02:21:33.359 align:start position:0%
high and low it would seem like 828
 
02:21:36.870 --> 02:21:36.880 align:start position:0%
million would be fy 21. you could walk
 
02:21:39.550 --> 02:21:39.560 align:start position:0%
the 10 million out and then use
 
02:21:44.469 --> 02:21:44.479 align:start position:0%
818 million for the base for 22.23
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
and then i'd also go along with the
 
02:21:48.630 --> 02:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
other representatives that we could now
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
boost up the percents after 2021.
 
02:21:55.910 --> 02:21:55.920 align:start position:0%
you use the base of how much on 21
 
02:21:59.070 --> 02:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
for 21 first based on theirs it would be
 
02:22:01.030 --> 02:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
828 million
 
02:22:03.510 --> 02:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
but then you take out the 10 million
 
02:22:06.630 --> 02:22:06.640 align:start position:0%
and then for 22 and 23 you use 818
 
02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:12.950 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:22:12.950 --> 02:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:22:16.790 --> 02:22:16.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:16.800 --> 02:22:21.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:22:21.670 --> 02:22:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:25.110 --> 02:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
and would you repeat again for the 22
 
02:22:28.150 --> 02:22:28.160 align:start position:0%
what i'd do for 22 and 23 i would just
 
02:22:30.230 --> 02:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
support what the other people have said
 
02:22:31.990 --> 02:22:32.000 align:start position:0%
that i think we should increase the
 
02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:33.190 align:start position:0%
that i think we should increase the
percents

02:22:33.190 --> 02:22:33.200 align:start position:0%
percents
 
02:22:36.950 --> 02:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
the total four and the uh four to six
 
02:22:39.590 --> 02:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
correct okay
 
02:22:47.030 --> 02:22:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:48.870 --> 02:22:48.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you've already answered my
 
02:22:48.880 --> 02:22:50.389 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry you've already answered my
question

02:22:50.389 --> 02:22:50.399 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:22:59.429 --> 02:22:59.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:04.070 --> 02:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:05.830 --> 02:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um
 
02:23:07.429 --> 02:23:07.439 align:start position:0%
can you give us a sense of what we're
 
02:23:08.950 --> 02:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
going to do tomorrow when we come up
 
02:23:10.790 --> 02:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
with final numbers
 
02:23:13.030 --> 02:23:13.040 align:start position:0%
how we're going to approach this i know
 
02:23:15.030 --> 02:23:15.040 align:start position:0%
individuals are now giving their
 
02:23:16.870 --> 02:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts about where they think this
 
02:23:18.630 --> 02:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
should wind up
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
which is great
 
02:23:22.870 --> 02:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
but what's the process tomorrow are we
 
02:23:25.590 --> 02:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
going to each provide enough numbers
 
02:23:27.510 --> 02:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
to the the revenues they think that we
 
02:23:28.790 --> 02:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
should change
 
02:23:31.590 --> 02:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
and take an average uh how how are we
 
02:23:33.750 --> 02:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to proceed tomorrow so we we have
 
02:23:35.110 --> 02:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
a better sense
 
02:23:37.270 --> 02:23:37.280 align:start position:0%
that's what i figured today today we
 
02:23:40.950 --> 02:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
would go through all the dra webinars
 
02:23:42.870 --> 02:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
tomorrow morning
 
02:23:47.190 --> 02:23:47.200 align:start position:0%
we would go through the
 
02:23:53.830 --> 02:23:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:55.910 --> 02:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
 
02:23:55.920 --> 02:23:57.270 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole
doing

02:23:57.270 --> 02:23:57.280 align:start position:0%
doing
 
02:23:59.590 --> 02:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
all the revenues
 
02:24:02.150 --> 02:24:02.160 align:start position:0%
and what i would suggest is that this
 
02:24:04.710 --> 02:24:04.720 align:start position:0%
afternoon when we're through
 
02:24:06.389 --> 02:24:06.399 align:start position:0%
with the dra
 
02:24:09.670 --> 02:24:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:11.990 --> 02:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
democrats caucus
 
02:24:14.870 --> 02:24:14.880 align:start position:0%
and we'll caucus the republicans
 
02:24:16.389 --> 02:24:16.399 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
we'll get together tomorrow
 
02:24:21.270 --> 02:24:21.280 align:start position:0%
we'll recaucus
 
02:24:24.309 --> 02:24:24.319 align:start position:0%
today we'll be caucusing on the
 
02:24:26.710 --> 02:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
era revenues and that's the bulk of the
 
02:24:29.990 --> 02:24:30.000 align:start position:0%
revenues and also
 
02:24:33.510 --> 02:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
focusing on what we heard
 
02:24:35.349 --> 02:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
relative to the
 
02:24:38.790 --> 02:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
credit carryover tomorrow we should have
 
02:24:40.790 --> 02:24:40.800 align:start position:0%
the information from
 
02:24:43.270 --> 02:24:43.280 align:start position:0%
the comptroller and the dra
 
02:24:47.270 --> 02:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
so to help us make that decision
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
on the credit carryover effect
 
02:24:52.230 --> 02:24:52.240 align:start position:0%
so what we would be doing tomorrow is
 
02:24:54.070 --> 02:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
like we did last time that we would be
 
02:24:56.550 --> 02:24:56.560 align:start position:0%
working off of a uh
 
02:24:58.550 --> 02:24:58.560 align:start position:0%
one republican number and one democrat
 
02:25:02.469 --> 02:25:02.479 align:start position:0%
number and then trying to compromise um
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
make it a lot easier yes yes
 
02:25:07.190 --> 02:25:07.200 align:start position:0%
and the only other i have
 
02:25:08.790 --> 02:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
mr chair is that
 
02:25:10.550 --> 02:25:10.560 align:start position:0%
when we think about the business taxes
 
02:25:13.110 --> 02:25:13.120 align:start position:0%
again when it comes to 23
 
02:25:15.429 --> 02:25:15.439 align:start position:0%
having to do a single sales factor
 
02:25:15.439 --> 02:25:16.389 align:start position:0%
having to do a single sales factor
um

02:25:16.389 --> 02:25:16.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
i i think we we assumed that single
 
02:25:21.349 --> 02:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
sales factor is going to go into effect
 
02:25:24.230 --> 02:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
and coming up with the numbers and then
 
02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:25.030 align:start position:0%
and coming up with the numbers and then
that

02:25:25.030 --> 02:25:25.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:25:27.590 --> 02:25:27.600 align:start position:0%
for 23 and business taxes that and on
 
02:25:29.190 --> 02:25:29.200 align:start position:0%
the other sheet
 
02:25:30.950 --> 02:25:30.960 align:start position:0%
we indicate that there's still a 20
 
02:25:33.110 --> 02:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
million dollar
 
02:25:35.670 --> 02:25:35.680 align:start position:0%
difference that if if indeed it winds up
 
02:25:38.230 --> 02:25:38.240 align:start position:0%
that and by the way just fyi for
 
02:25:38.240 --> 02:25:39.270 align:start position:0%
that and by the way just fyi for
everybody

02:25:39.270 --> 02:25:39.280 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:25:42.230 --> 02:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
i'll be testifying on monday and senate
 
02:25:43.910 --> 02:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
uh ways and means
 
02:25:45.270 --> 02:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
on our bill
 
02:25:46.950 --> 02:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
uh that uh
 
02:25:49.830 --> 02:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
will delay the single sales factor
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
that that's coming up on monday and i
 
02:25:53.349 --> 02:25:53.359 align:start position:0%
did talk to the chair
 
02:25:55.670 --> 02:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
of senate finance
 
02:25:58.070 --> 02:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
uh he called me about it and i explained
 
02:25:59.910 --> 02:25:59.920 align:start position:0%
our position
 
02:26:01.750 --> 02:26:01.760 align:start position:0%
and he even suggested well what if we
 
02:26:03.670 --> 02:26:03.680 align:start position:0%
only hold off a year instead of three
 
02:26:05.429 --> 02:26:05.439 align:start position:0%
years four years
 
02:26:07.270 --> 02:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
and i said well
 
02:26:09.750 --> 02:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
let's talk i know to the whole committee
 
02:26:12.070 --> 02:26:12.080 align:start position:0%
you know so anyway but
 
02:26:14.469 --> 02:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
so i i i just want to put that out there
 
02:26:14.479 --> 02:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
so i i i just want to put that out there
but

02:26:15.990 --> 02:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:26:20.630 --> 02:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
law is single sas factor goes into place
 
02:26:22.550 --> 02:26:22.560 align:start position:0%
in 23
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
for uh and that we should think that way
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that
 
02:26:28.950 --> 02:26:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know unless we change our mind
 
02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:29.990 align:start position:0%
you know unless we change our mind
that

02:26:29.990 --> 02:26:30.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:26:31.750 --> 02:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
and on the sheet that we give to finance
 
02:26:33.030 --> 02:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to reduce
 
02:26:35.510 --> 02:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
if they decide to put
 
02:26:37.830 --> 02:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
into house bill 2
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
the impact is 20 million dollars
 
02:26:43.030 --> 02:26:43.040 align:start position:0%
back into the business taxes so when
 
02:26:45.190 --> 02:26:45.200 align:start position:0%
you're thinking about the number
 
02:26:48.389 --> 02:26:48.399 align:start position:0%
think of it that way in two pieces we do
 
02:26:51.110 --> 02:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
the revenues tomorrow
 
02:26:54.230 --> 02:26:54.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to do two things
 
02:26:54.240 --> 02:26:55.190 align:start position:0%
we're going to do two things
one

02:26:55.190 --> 02:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
one
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
is the revenues
 
02:26:59.349 --> 02:26:59.359 align:start position:0%
using current law
 
02:27:04.070 --> 02:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
as if we're generating a new hr11
 
02:27:06.309 --> 02:27:06.319 align:start position:0%
we're also going to do
 
02:27:06.319 --> 02:27:07.990 align:start position:0%
we're also going to do
hb2

02:27:07.990 --> 02:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
which b2 will have the single sales
 
02:27:13.510 --> 02:27:13.520 align:start position:0%
factor in there and that's where we'll
 
02:27:15.510 --> 02:27:15.520 align:start position:0%
put the effect on
 
02:27:19.750 --> 02:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
single sales factor into the hb2 numbers
 
02:27:20.710 --> 02:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
but the
 
02:27:23.349 --> 02:27:23.359 align:start position:0%
house resolution numbers has to be
 
02:27:26.070 --> 02:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:26.080 --> 02:27:27.030 align:start position:0%
 
right

02:27:27.030 --> 02:27:27.040 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:28.389 --> 02:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
i'm agreeing
 
02:27:31.429 --> 02:27:31.439 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
02:27:31.439 --> 02:27:32.309 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
oh

02:27:32.309 --> 02:27:32.319 align:start position:0%
oh
 
02:27:34.710 --> 02:27:34.720 align:start position:0%
anything else representative romney nope
 
02:27:37.590 --> 02:27:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:38.469 --> 02:27:38.479 align:start position:0%
all right
 
02:27:38.479 --> 02:27:39.830 align:start position:0%
all right
um

02:27:39.830 --> 02:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:40.630 align:start position:0%
um
so

02:27:40.630 --> 02:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:27:43.590 --> 02:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
what we're discussing now will help
 
02:27:46.230 --> 02:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
in both of our caucuses
 
02:27:49.510 --> 02:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
as we try to come up with what we
 
02:27:52.150 --> 02:27:52.160 align:start position:0%
estimate these revenues
 
02:27:55.910 --> 02:27:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:59.429 --> 02:27:59.439 align:start position:0%
change in the economy the
 
02:28:01.270 --> 02:28:01.280 align:start position:0%
vaccinations and
 
02:28:03.910 --> 02:28:03.920 align:start position:0%
the stimulus payments obviously
 
02:28:05.910 --> 02:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
we don't have the
 
02:28:08.469 --> 02:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
analysis in this payment i've asked for
 
02:28:08.479 --> 02:28:09.349 align:start position:0%
analysis in this payment i've asked for
it

02:28:09.349 --> 02:28:09.359 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:28:11.110 --> 02:28:11.120 align:start position:0%
nobody has it at this point in time but
 
02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
just as soon as we get
 
02:28:15.830 --> 02:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
this is available we'll be meeting we'll
 
02:28:17.110 --> 02:28:17.120 align:start position:0%
go over that
 
02:28:19.670 --> 02:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
and then that'll show up in our april
 
02:28:19.680 --> 02:28:22.550 align:start position:0%
and then that'll show up in our april
estimates

02:28:22.550 --> 02:28:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
all right anything else
 
02:28:28.150 --> 02:28:28.160 align:start position:0%
mr chair yes um i think uh maybe
 
02:28:30.309 --> 02:28:30.319 align:start position:0%
yesterday you uh
 
02:28:32.790 --> 02:28:32.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ppp
 
02:28:32.800 --> 02:28:33.830 align:start position:0%
mentioned the ppp
issue

02:28:33.830 --> 02:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
issue
 
02:28:33.840 --> 02:28:35.349 align:start position:0%
issue
yes

02:28:35.349 --> 02:28:35.359 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:28:35.359 --> 02:28:36.230 align:start position:0%
yes
um

02:28:36.230 --> 02:28:36.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:37.670 --> 02:28:37.680 align:start position:0%
what's how are we going to deal with
 
02:28:37.680 --> 02:28:38.630 align:start position:0%
what's how are we going to deal with
that

02:28:38.630 --> 02:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:39.510 align:start position:0%
that
um

02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:39.520 --> 02:28:40.790 align:start position:0%
um
what

02:28:40.790 --> 02:28:40.800 align:start position:0%
what
 
02:28:43.590 --> 02:28:43.600 align:start position:0%
that should be coming over as senate
 
02:28:46.550 --> 02:28:46.560 align:start position:0%
bill 40 i believe
 
02:28:46.560 --> 02:28:49.429 align:start position:0%
bill 40 i believe
and

02:28:49.429 --> 02:28:49.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:49.439 --> 02:28:50.309 align:start position:0%
 
if

02:28:50.309 --> 02:28:50.319 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:28:53.190 --> 02:28:53.200 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come over
 
02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:54.870 align:start position:0%
it doesn't come over
if

02:28:54.870 --> 02:28:54.880 align:start position:0%
if
 
02:28:57.910 --> 02:28:57.920 align:start position:0%
if they treat that the same as they did
 
02:28:59.030 --> 02:28:59.040 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:00.070 align:start position:0%
the uh
split

02:29:00.070 --> 02:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
split
 
02:29:02.150 --> 02:29:02.160 align:start position:0%
the meals and room taxes they passed it
 
02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:03.830 align:start position:0%
the meals and room taxes they passed it
unanimously

02:29:03.830 --> 02:29:03.840 align:start position:0%
unanimously
 
02:29:06.790 --> 02:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
and then tabled it so they can use it
 
02:29:10.630 --> 02:29:10.640 align:start position:0%
in the uh in their budget
 
02:29:12.710 --> 02:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
the ppp
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
that came out of their committee
 
02:29:17.990 --> 02:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
i guess unanimous
 
02:29:20.030 --> 02:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
then it will be going to the full
 
02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:27.429 --> 02:29:27.439 align:start position:0%
we're going to spend time on that
 
02:29:29.670 --> 02:29:29.680 align:start position:0%
i don't agree with that and there's a
 
02:29:31.830 --> 02:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
lot of other factors that we need to
 
02:29:33.830 --> 02:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
take into consideration
 
02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
and we'll do that
 
02:29:37.590 --> 02:29:37.600 align:start position:0%
once we get the budget numbers squared
 
02:29:37.600 --> 02:29:38.790 align:start position:0%
once we get the budget numbers squared
away

02:29:38.790 --> 02:29:38.800 align:start position:0%
away
 
02:29:41.190 --> 02:29:41.200 align:start position:0%
i have a uh
 
02:29:43.510 --> 02:29:43.520 align:start position:0%
additional wrinkle that
 
02:29:45.190 --> 02:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
came to my attention
 
02:29:48.469 --> 02:29:48.479 align:start position:0%
i guess when was it this morning
 
02:29:50.790 --> 02:29:50.800 align:start position:0%
early this morning um
 
02:29:52.710 --> 02:29:52.720 align:start position:0%
from tax notes
 
02:29:54.630 --> 02:29:54.640 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:29:56.550 --> 02:29:56.560 align:start position:0%
the it relates to the ppp and the
 
02:30:00.070 --> 02:30:00.080 align:start position:0%
taxability of it so our situation is uh
 
02:30:02.950 --> 02:30:02.960 align:start position:0%
our tax supplies and the question the
 
02:30:04.870 --> 02:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
proposal is to
 
02:30:08.070 --> 02:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
retroactively remove them
 
02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:09.510 align:start position:0%
retroactively remove them
the

02:30:09.510 --> 02:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
new stimulus bill
 
02:30:13.110 --> 02:30:13.120 align:start position:0%
has a provision in it
 
02:30:15.110 --> 02:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
that prohibits
 
02:30:18.630 --> 02:30:18.640 align:start position:0%
states from reducing
 
02:30:21.030 --> 02:30:21.040 align:start position:0%
from using stimulus money
 
02:30:21.040 --> 02:30:22.230 align:start position:0%
from using stimulus money
to

02:30:22.230 --> 02:30:22.240 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:30:24.150 --> 02:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes
 
02:30:24.160 --> 02:30:25.349 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes
and

02:30:25.349 --> 02:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:30:25.359 --> 02:30:26.550 align:start position:0%
and
the

02:30:26.550 --> 02:30:26.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:30:31.349 --> 02:30:31.359 align:start position:0%
the tax note related to california where
 
02:30:32.389 --> 02:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
they've got a
 
02:30:34.309 --> 02:30:34.319 align:start position:0%
different situation but they've been
 
02:30:34.319 --> 02:30:35.510 align:start position:0%
different situation but they've been
advised

02:30:35.510 --> 02:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
advised
 
02:30:37.670 --> 02:30:37.680 align:start position:0%
they've they pulled back on a proposal
 
02:30:38.950 --> 02:30:38.960 align:start position:0%
that would
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
relate to the taxation of
 
02:30:41.359 --> 02:30:43.349 align:start position:0%
relate to the taxation of
ppp

02:30:43.349 --> 02:30:43.359 align:start position:0%
ppp
 
02:30:44.950 --> 02:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
because of
 
02:30:47.590 --> 02:30:47.600 align:start position:0%
concerns they had
 
02:30:48.710 --> 02:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
that it might
 
02:30:51.030 --> 02:30:51.040 align:start position:0%
their proposed action might not comply
 
02:30:53.750 --> 02:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
with that tax that new restriction
 
02:30:54.950 --> 02:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
that's in
 
02:30:57.110 --> 02:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
the new stimulus bill
 
02:30:59.349 --> 02:30:59.359 align:start position:0%
so i wonder if dra could take a look at
 
02:31:01.270 --> 02:31:01.280 align:start position:0%
that and
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:08.389 --> 02:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
carolyn and melissa did you get that
 
02:31:13.110 --> 02:31:13.120 align:start position:0%
my representative i'm very aware of um
 
02:31:15.510 --> 02:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
what that what you're speaking of we've
 
02:31:19.270 --> 02:31:19.280 align:start position:0%
been monitoring it as have other states
 
02:31:21.270 --> 02:31:21.280 align:start position:0%
and we've heard some noise
 
02:31:24.150 --> 02:31:24.160 align:start position:0%
um across various list serves i would
 
02:31:26.710 --> 02:31:26.720 align:start position:0%
suggest um to the committee
 
02:31:30.230 --> 02:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
that that issue is probable probably
 
02:31:30.240 --> 02:31:31.750 align:start position:0%
that that issue is probable probably
exceeds

02:31:31.750 --> 02:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
exceeds
 
02:31:34.870 --> 02:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
our capacity to advise you
 
02:31:37.830 --> 02:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
um relative to potential tax cuts and i
 
02:31:37.840 --> 02:31:38.790 align:start position:0%
um relative to potential tax cuts and i
think

02:31:38.790 --> 02:31:38.800 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:31:40.790 --> 02:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
probably is more appropriately addressed
 
02:31:43.190 --> 02:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
to the department of justice i'm happy
 
02:31:46.150 --> 02:31:46.160 align:start position:0%
to facilitate the transfer of that issue
 
02:31:49.510 --> 02:31:49.520 align:start position:0%
to them um but that's that's a big issue
 
02:31:51.590 --> 02:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
for sure
 
02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:31:55.270 --> 02:31:55.280 align:start position:0%
i agree it's a big issue and that's a
 
02:31:58.550 --> 02:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
mr chair on
 
02:32:03.270 --> 02:32:03.280 align:start position:0%
i've done a certain amount of of trying
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
to understand this with the uh staff of
 
02:32:09.590 --> 02:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
the delegation in d.c
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
and the answers that i'm getting are
 
02:32:14.950 --> 02:32:14.960 align:start position:0%
essentially that this is all been booted
 
02:32:17.190 --> 02:32:17.200 align:start position:0%
to the u.s treasurer
 
02:32:20.230 --> 02:32:20.240 align:start position:0%
on and that that person is supposed to
 
02:32:20.240 --> 02:32:23.030 align:start position:0%
on and that that person is supposed to
clarify

02:32:23.030 --> 02:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:25.349 --> 02:32:25.359 align:start position:0%
clarify things
 
02:32:28.389 --> 02:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
and that on
 
02:32:28.399 --> 02:32:29.510 align:start position:0%
and that on
on

02:32:29.510 --> 02:32:29.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:32:32.070 --> 02:32:32.080 align:start position:0%
we will have some um
 
02:32:36.070 --> 02:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
pushing from the the uh senators from
 
02:32:37.429 --> 02:32:37.439 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:32:39.830 --> 02:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
to try to get
 
02:32:42.550 --> 02:32:42.560 align:start position:0%
get on results that are advantageous to
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
02:32:43.680 --> 02:32:44.389 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
but

02:32:44.389 --> 02:32:44.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:32:47.990 --> 02:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
that's about all i could collect
 
02:32:50.710 --> 02:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
i i think once you see the analysis i've
 
02:32:53.590 --> 02:32:53.600 align:start position:0%
been working on
 
02:32:56.710 --> 02:32:56.720 align:start position:0%
on the ppp
 
02:32:58.630 --> 02:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
i hope you get the same
 
02:33:01.349 --> 02:33:01.359 align:start position:0%
reaction that i have
 
02:33:02.710 --> 02:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
number one
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
we are
 
02:33:06.469 --> 02:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
different from every other state
 
02:33:06.479 --> 02:33:07.590 align:start position:0%
different from every other state
our

02:33:07.590 --> 02:33:07.600 align:start position:0%
our
 
02:33:09.830 --> 02:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
corporate business tax
 
02:33:12.469 --> 02:33:12.479 align:start position:0%
represents a huge amount of our total
 
02:33:12.479 --> 02:33:13.750 align:start position:0%
represents a huge amount of our total
taxes

02:33:13.750 --> 02:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
02:33:16.150 --> 02:33:16.160 align:start position:0%
and the corporate business tax in all
 
02:33:19.429 --> 02:33:19.439 align:start position:0%
the other states represents a very small
 
02:33:21.990 --> 02:33:22.000 align:start position:0%
amount of their total taxes some it's
 
02:33:24.630 --> 02:33:24.640 align:start position:0%
zero but the vast majority
 
02:33:27.590 --> 02:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
represents about zero to six percent of
 
02:33:29.750 --> 02:33:29.760 align:start position:0%
their total taxes
 
02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:32.550 align:start position:0%
their total taxes
so

02:33:32.550 --> 02:33:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:34.630 --> 02:33:34.640 align:start position:0%
they can do what they want with the pp
 
02:33:36.630 --> 02:33:36.640 align:start position:0%
and it doesn't make much of an effect
 
02:33:38.469 --> 02:33:38.479 align:start position:0%
but it sure makes a whale of an effect
 
02:33:40.070 --> 02:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire
 
02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:42.240 align:start position:0%
if if we
 
02:33:45.750 --> 02:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:48.640 align:start position:0%
if if we remove that from the taxes
 
02:33:49.910 --> 02:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
coming in
 
02:33:52.630 --> 02:33:52.640 align:start position:0%
because it already is removed
 
02:33:54.710 --> 02:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
if they use the money the way they're
 
02:33:56.309 --> 02:33:56.319 align:start position:0%
supposed to
 
02:33:57.670 --> 02:33:57.680 align:start position:0%
is that
 
02:33:59.910 --> 02:33:59.920 align:start position:0%
that's money coming in
 
02:34:01.270 --> 02:34:01.280 align:start position:0%
then you which is
 
02:34:03.590 --> 02:34:03.600 align:start position:0%
six at least sixty percent
 
02:34:05.830 --> 02:34:05.840 align:start position:0%
towards wages
 
02:34:07.990 --> 02:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
then you get the federal deduction
 
02:34:09.030 --> 02:34:09.040 align:start position:0%
but then
 
02:34:12.150 --> 02:34:12.160 align:start position:0%
you also get to do the deduction
 
02:34:14.230 --> 02:34:14.240 align:start position:0%
because it's an expense
 
02:34:17.110 --> 02:34:17.120 align:start position:0%
you also get the deduction
 
02:34:20.389 --> 02:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:24.150 --> 02:34:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:26.230 --> 02:34:26.240 align:start position:0%
spend it
 
02:34:29.429 --> 02:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
on things such as
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
rents and all the other things that's a
 
02:34:33.670 --> 02:34:33.680 align:start position:0%
deduction so if you use it for what's
 
02:34:36.870 --> 02:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
intended you don't take taxes on it and
 
02:34:39.030 --> 02:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
if you and then if you take
 
02:34:39.040 --> 02:34:40.070 align:start position:0%
if you and then if you take
and

02:34:40.070 --> 02:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:34:41.750 --> 02:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
and get another deduction you get a
 
02:34:43.429 --> 02:34:43.439 align:start position:0%
double deduction
 
02:34:46.630 --> 02:34:46.640 align:start position:0%
massachusetts doesn't tax it
 
02:34:48.870 --> 02:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
but they tax it
 
02:34:51.190 --> 02:34:51.200 align:start position:0%
as personal
 
02:34:51.200 --> 02:34:53.190 align:start position:0%
as personal
income

02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
income
 
02:34:56.710 --> 02:34:56.720 align:start position:0%
for the corporation at five percent
 
02:34:59.270 --> 02:34:59.280 align:start position:0%
and then they also tax
 
02:35:01.270 --> 02:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
the wages
 
02:35:03.190 --> 02:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
as the income tax
 
02:35:05.270 --> 02:35:05.280 align:start position:0%
they also tax
 
02:35:06.469 --> 02:35:06.479 align:start position:0%
anything that's
 
02:35:08.630 --> 02:35:08.640 align:start position:0%
that these people they got the wages
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
buying certain goods and
 
02:35:13.510 --> 02:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
services and so
 
02:35:16.230 --> 02:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
they get more back they don't pay taxes
 
02:35:18.870 --> 02:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
on it plus they're also generating taxes
 
02:35:20.550 --> 02:35:20.560 align:start position:0%
from personal income tax in the total
 
02:35:20.560 --> 02:35:21.830 align:start position:0%
from personal income tax in the total
amounts

02:35:21.830 --> 02:35:21.840 align:start position:0%
amounts
 
02:35:24.550 --> 02:35:24.560 align:start position:0%
and the taxes from their income tax on
 
02:35:27.349 --> 02:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
the wages and taxes from
 
02:35:27.359 --> 02:35:28.550 align:start position:0%
the wages and taxes from
the

02:35:28.550 --> 02:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:35:31.270 --> 02:35:31.280 align:start position:0%
sale of goods and services and
 
02:35:33.349 --> 02:35:33.359 align:start position:0%
and i've compared it to other states too
 
02:35:33.359 --> 02:35:34.870 align:start position:0%
and i've compared it to other states too
so

02:35:34.870 --> 02:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:35:36.070 --> 02:35:36.080 align:start position:0%
i didn't
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
let's go on to this pack we need to get
 
02:35:41.429 --> 02:35:41.439 align:start position:0%
these revenues out first
 
02:35:41.439 --> 02:35:43.510 align:start position:0%
these revenues out first
okay

02:35:43.510 --> 02:35:43.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:35:48.230 --> 02:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:48.240 --> 02:35:49.590 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:35:49.590 --> 02:35:49.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:51.429 --> 02:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
the next
 
02:35:54.550 --> 02:35:54.560 align:start position:0%
anything else on the business taxes
 
02:35:57.750 --> 02:35:57.760 align:start position:0%
what time is it going to be
 
02:36:02.070 --> 02:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:04.469 --> 02:36:04.479 align:start position:0%
and using the dra
 
02:36:08.870 --> 02:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
march 10
 
02:36:13.190 --> 02:36:13.200 align:start position:0%
melissa or caroline you want to
 
02:36:17.110 --> 02:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
tell us what you what you did on this
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
so again for meals and rentals
 
02:36:22.630 --> 02:36:22.640 align:start position:0%
we removed our february estimate and
 
02:36:25.910 --> 02:36:25.920 align:start position:0%
replaced it with february actuals which
 
02:36:27.910 --> 02:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
as you can see it is bigger than our
 
02:36:29.590 --> 02:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
original estimate because february
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
performed better than what we
 
02:36:35.030 --> 02:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
expected for m r
 
02:36:36.950 --> 02:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
and then again we haven't made any
 
02:36:38.950 --> 02:36:38.960 align:start position:0%
modifications on any of the taxes growth
 
02:36:41.910 --> 02:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
rates for 22 and 23 so we still have the
 
02:36:44.710 --> 02:36:44.720 align:start position:0%
8 to 11 percent for 22
 
02:36:47.750 --> 02:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
and the 4 to 6 percent for 23.
 
02:36:49.910 --> 02:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
and how that compares with our estimates
 
02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:55.990 --> 02:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
the low is you know 2.7
 
02:36:57.510 --> 02:36:57.520 align:start position:0%
for 21
 
02:36:57.520 --> 02:36:58.309 align:start position:0%
for 21
and

02:36:58.309 --> 02:36:58.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:36:59.590 --> 02:36:59.600 align:start position:0%
compared to
 
02:37:02.230 --> 02:37:02.240 align:start position:0%
the estimated 301
 
02:37:04.389 --> 02:37:04.399 align:start position:0%
and their high is 320 so we're on the
 
02:37:08.389 --> 02:37:08.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:09.670 --> 02:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
and then
 
02:37:11.110 --> 02:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
as far as
 
02:37:11.120 --> 02:37:13.190 align:start position:0%
as far as
22

02:37:13.190 --> 02:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
22
 
02:37:15.429 --> 02:37:15.439 align:start position:0%
we estimate 328
 
02:37:17.830 --> 02:37:17.840 align:start position:0%
and we're on the low side of their
 
02:37:17.840 --> 02:37:19.030 align:start position:0%
and we're on the low side of their
estimate

02:37:19.030 --> 02:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
02:37:23.270 --> 02:37:23.280 align:start position:0%
and 29 we estimate 349 and we're also on
 
02:37:26.150 --> 02:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
the low side so
 
02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:30.230 align:start position:0%
the low side so
comments

02:37:30.230 --> 02:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:35.750 --> 02:37:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:39.110 --> 02:37:39.120 align:start position:0%
the restaurants are starting to pick up
 
02:37:42.469 --> 02:37:42.479 align:start position:0%
people are getting inoculated
 
02:37:44.870 --> 02:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
the economy is picking up
 
02:37:48.230 --> 02:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
it's going to have an effect on
 
02:37:50.389 --> 02:37:50.399 align:start position:0%
on these things it's up to us to
 
02:37:52.469 --> 02:37:52.479 align:start position:0%
determine what that's going to be
 
02:37:54.389 --> 02:37:54.399 align:start position:0%
represented southwest
 
02:37:56.469 --> 02:37:56.479 align:start position:0%
uh yes this is
 
02:37:58.230 --> 02:37:58.240 align:start position:0%
really the one that's always concerned
 
02:38:00.630 --> 02:38:00.640 align:start position:0%
me the most i think it'll be
 
02:38:02.710 --> 02:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
really impactful what happens with
 
02:38:02.720 --> 02:38:03.830 align:start position:0%
really impactful what happens with
tourism

02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
tourism
 
02:38:06.070 --> 02:38:06.080 align:start position:0%
and especially the venues that are near
 
02:38:07.670 --> 02:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
theaters and
 
02:38:09.510 --> 02:38:09.520 align:start position:0%
all those kinds of things that may be
 
02:38:11.030 --> 02:38:11.040 align:start position:0%
slow to open
 
02:38:13.590 --> 02:38:13.600 align:start position:0%
but i don't really know the breakdown of
 
02:38:13.600 --> 02:38:14.550 align:start position:0%
but i don't really know the breakdown of
um

02:38:14.550 --> 02:38:14.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:38:16.870 --> 02:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals as far as how many are
 
02:38:18.950 --> 02:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
just the mcdonald's places you know so
 
02:38:21.670 --> 02:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
on but i think it is going to be uneven
 
02:38:24.070 --> 02:38:24.080 align:start position:0%
um depending on where those businesses
 
02:38:26.550 --> 02:38:26.560 align:start position:0%
are located and what activities are
 
02:38:29.270 --> 02:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
around them
 
02:38:31.030 --> 02:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
okay uh
 
02:38:31.040 --> 02:38:32.230 align:start position:0%
okay uh

administration
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the banks this time
 
02:40:30.710 --> 02:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
dollar capped so on the people that
 
02:40:32.950 --> 02:40:32.960 align:start position:0%
apply first get it so they're telling
 
02:40:36.070 --> 02:40:36.080 align:start position:0%
everybody uh go get that
 
02:40:40.070 --> 02:40:40.080 align:start position:0%

02:40:58.880 --> 02:40:59.990 align:start position:0%
troops and all the rest of it
and

02:40:59.990 --> 02:41:00.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:02.550 --> 02:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
that one is both allowing them to apply
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
to for ppp as well as for a grant
 
02:41:08.950 --> 02:41:08.960 align:start position:0%
program that the small business
 
02:41:11.349 --> 02:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
administration is
 
02:41:13.349 --> 02:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
administering also and they're
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
apparently ramping up for it right now
 
02:41:19.429 --> 02:41:19.439 align:start position:0%
there's some other stuff for general
 
02:41:22.230 --> 02:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
businesses on quite a bit of stuff for
 
02:41:23.910 --> 02:41:23.920 align:start position:0%
general businesses but this one is
 
02:41:26.630 --> 02:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
specific for the rooms and mail stacks
 
02:41:28.710 --> 02:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
they didn't get
 
02:41:30.790 --> 02:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
much help on
 
02:41:33.670 --> 02:41:33.680 align:start position:0%
the previous time because they are small
 
02:41:33.680 --> 02:41:34.469 align:start position:0%
the previous time because they are small
and

02:41:34.469 --> 02:41:34.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:41:36.950 --> 02:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
it was going through banks and
 
02:41:38.469 --> 02:41:38.479 align:start position:0%
if you didn't have a good banking
 
02:41:40.710 --> 02:41:40.720 align:start position:0%
relationship you didn't manage to get in
 
02:41:42.469 --> 02:41:42.479 align:start position:0%
on the front of the queue
 
02:41:45.670 --> 02:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
but um that's on i think going to be
 
02:41:49.110 --> 02:41:49.120 align:start position:0%
significant in on rescuing and booting
 
02:41:52.389 --> 02:41:52.399 align:start position:0%
up those of our restaurants and
 
02:41:55.030 --> 02:41:55.040 align:start position:0%
ins and such that have survived up till
 
02:41:55.040 --> 02:41:56.230 align:start position:0%
ins and such that have survived up till
now

02:41:56.230 --> 02:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
now
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
and on getting them ready for this
 
02:42:01.060 --> 02:42:01.070 align:start position:0%
summer when um
 
02:42:01.070 --> 02:42:02.309 align:start position:0%
summer when um
[Music]

02:42:02.309 --> 02:42:02.319 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:42:05.429 --> 02:42:05.439 align:start position:0%
most of the people that on we would be
 
02:42:07.750 --> 02:42:07.760 align:start position:0%
seeing as tourists will have been
 
02:42:07.760 --> 02:42:09.110 align:start position:0%
seeing as tourists will have been
vaccinated

02:42:09.110 --> 02:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
vaccinated
 
02:42:12.070 --> 02:42:12.080 align:start position:0%
by then and are raring to get out of
 
02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
their houses in their immediate
 
02:42:16.150 --> 02:42:16.160 align:start position:0%
environments and have been
 
02:42:19.830 --> 02:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
apparently booking up very fast um
 
02:42:21.670 --> 02:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of the tourist venues in new
 
02:42:21.680 --> 02:42:23.110 align:start position:0%
a lot of the tourist venues in new
hampshire

02:42:23.110 --> 02:42:23.120 align:start position:0%

susan

02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:24.160 align:start position:0%
susan
 
02:42:25.510 --> 02:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
will be
 
02:42:25.520 --> 02:42:26.950 align:start position:0%
will be
1400

02:42:26.950 --> 02:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
1400
 
02:42:28.790 --> 02:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
uh checks that are going out to
 
02:42:31.349 --> 02:42:31.359 align:start position:0%
everybody which may send some more
 
02:42:34.230 --> 02:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
locals out to eat thanks
 
02:42:36.469 --> 02:42:36.479 align:start position:0%
susan does that say anything about the
 
02:42:38.710 --> 02:42:38.720 align:start position:0%
federal funds that are going for small
 
02:42:40.469 --> 02:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
to be distributed by the small
 
02:42:44.710 --> 02:42:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
i can i can send the
 
02:42:50.389 --> 02:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
the emails that i got from them directly
 
02:42:52.070 --> 02:42:52.080 align:start position:0%
to everybody
 
02:42:55.030 --> 02:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
why don't you do that because i'm i i'm
 
02:42:57.429 --> 02:42:57.439 align:start position:0%
concerned that
 
02:42:59.510 --> 02:42:59.520 align:start position:0%
they may send
 
02:43:02.710 --> 02:43:02.720 align:start position:0%
a greater portion of that funds to
 
02:43:04.550 --> 02:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
certain types of states than other
 
02:43:04.560 --> 02:43:05.670 align:start position:0%
certain types of states than other
states

02:43:05.670 --> 02:43:05.680 align:start position:0%
states
 
02:43:09.110 --> 02:43:09.120 align:start position:0%
or is it distributed on a per population
 
02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:10.790 align:start position:0%
or is it distributed on a per population
basis

02:43:10.790 --> 02:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
basis
 
02:43:14.630 --> 02:43:14.640 align:start position:0%
on the restaurant revitalization fund
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
is dollar capped across the country so
 
02:43:20.790 --> 02:43:20.800 align:start position:0%
it depends on our chambers of commerce
 
02:43:23.670 --> 02:43:23.680 align:start position:0%
doing what our chamber of commerce just
 
02:43:26.230 --> 02:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
did which is to send it out immediately
 
02:43:28.790 --> 02:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
to all of the people and give them the
 
02:43:31.670 --> 02:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
steps they need to use to start the
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
application before the application is
 
02:43:38.309 --> 02:43:38.319 align:start position:0%
open okay all right
 
02:43:40.309 --> 02:43:40.319 align:start position:0%
so if you could send that to the
 
02:43:42.469 --> 02:43:42.479 align:start position:0%
committee great
 
02:43:45.990 --> 02:43:46.000 align:start position:0%
uh representative offline
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you mr chairman i just wanted
 
02:43:51.590 --> 02:43:51.600 align:start position:0%
to also you know reiterate that i
 
02:43:53.670 --> 02:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
believe between the pent-up demand the
 
02:43:56.150 --> 02:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
stimulus coming in um
 
02:43:57.990 --> 02:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
for tourism that's going to enable
 
02:43:59.910 --> 02:43:59.920 align:start position:0%
tourism and also you're seeing state
 
02:43:59.920 --> 02:44:01.030 align:start position:0%
tourism and also you're seeing state
parks

02:44:01.030 --> 02:44:01.040 align:start position:0%
parks
 
02:44:03.510 --> 02:44:03.520 align:start position:0%
um talk about a full and open summer and
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
that they're pushing for that on hampton
 
02:44:05.120 --> 02:44:06.710 align:start position:0%
that they're pushing for that on hampton
beach

02:44:06.710 --> 02:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
beach
 
02:44:09.030 --> 02:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
um i think you've got the federal
 
02:44:10.950 --> 02:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
government saying that they want
 
02:44:13.269 --> 02:44:13.279 align:start position:0%
uh all states to have vaccinations
 
02:44:15.110 --> 02:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
available to all adults by may 1st and
 
02:44:16.630 --> 02:44:16.640 align:start position:0%
the governor has said that we're on
 
02:44:18.790 --> 02:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
track for that so i think all things
 
02:44:21.510 --> 02:44:21.520 align:start position:0%
considered i would tend to anticipate a
 
02:44:23.750 --> 02:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
summer much more like
 
02:44:27.910 --> 02:44:27.920 align:start position:0%
2019 than 20 20. um
 
02:44:29.750 --> 02:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
and and i know that affects
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
you know when you look at the the tax
 
02:44:35.030 --> 02:44:35.040 align:start position:0%
cut for meals and rooms that would mean
 
02:44:37.750 --> 02:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
a greater loss of potential revenue
 
02:44:41.190 --> 02:44:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:41.200 --> 02:44:45.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:44:45.510 --> 02:44:45.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:47.030 --> 02:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
any questions of
 
02:44:47.040 --> 02:44:48.550 align:start position:0%
any questions of
offline

02:44:48.550 --> 02:44:48.560 align:start position:0%
offline
 
02:44:51.750 --> 02:44:51.760 align:start position:0%
not representative bromley
 
02:44:53.590 --> 02:44:53.600 align:start position:0%
yeah the the real elephant in the room
 
02:44:53.600 --> 02:44:54.870 align:start position:0%
yeah the the real elephant in the room
is

02:44:54.870 --> 02:44:54.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
02:44:56.630 --> 02:44:56.640 align:start position:0%
is when will the state of emergency be
 
02:44:56.640 --> 02:44:58.230 align:start position:0%
is when will the state of emergency be
lifted

02:44:58.230 --> 02:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
lifted
 
02:45:00.070 --> 02:45:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm starting to hear rumblings that it
 
02:45:02.150 --> 02:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
may be sooner than we think
 
02:45:04.389 --> 02:45:04.399 align:start position:0%
but i i've we've never got verification
 
02:45:05.750 --> 02:45:05.760 align:start position:0%
on that
 
02:45:05.760 --> 02:45:06.710 align:start position:0%
on that
uh

02:45:06.710 --> 02:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:08.230 --> 02:45:08.240 align:start position:0%
maybe that's something we could try with
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
the governor's office uh he may not be
 
02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:11.520 align:start position:0%
willing to
 
02:45:13.110 --> 02:45:13.120 align:start position:0%
play that hand
 
02:45:14.550 --> 02:45:14.560 align:start position:0%
uh but
 
02:45:17.510 --> 02:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
uh but that is there are states that are
 
02:45:19.269 --> 02:45:19.279 align:start position:0%
starting to really seriously look at
 
02:45:21.349 --> 02:45:21.359 align:start position:0%
race and i think they've already done
 
02:45:23.030 --> 02:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
a lifting the states of emergency in
 
02:45:24.550 --> 02:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
their states
 
02:45:24.560 --> 02:45:25.910 align:start position:0%
their states
um

02:45:25.910 --> 02:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:28.309 --> 02:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
now that doesn't mean that when meals
 
02:45:30.070 --> 02:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
and rooms and rentals
 
02:45:32.550 --> 02:45:32.560 align:start position:0%
that even after that would happen that
 
02:45:35.590 --> 02:45:35.600 align:start position:0%
that there'd still be people slow to
 
02:45:37.269 --> 02:45:37.279 align:start position:0%
go back to our restaurant or to a
 
02:45:37.279 --> 02:45:38.469 align:start position:0%
go back to our restaurant or to a
theater

02:45:38.469 --> 02:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
theater
 
02:45:38.479 --> 02:45:39.269 align:start position:0%
theater
uh

02:45:39.269 --> 02:45:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:45:40.950 --> 02:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
you know uh
 
02:45:43.269 --> 02:45:43.279 align:start position:0%
but that over time i'm sure that will
 
02:45:45.269 --> 02:45:45.279 align:start position:0%
that will evolve but
 
02:45:45.279 --> 02:45:46.309 align:start position:0%
that will evolve but
um

02:45:46.309 --> 02:45:46.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:45:47.830 --> 02:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
i think the timing on the raising of
 
02:45:49.349 --> 02:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
this of the lifting of the state of
 
02:45:52.630 --> 02:45:52.640 align:start position:0%
emergency is a important thing
 
02:45:55.190 --> 02:45:55.200 align:start position:0%
so i don't know how we get the feel for
 
02:45:58.630 --> 02:45:58.640 align:start position:0%
that but uh just a comment then but
 
02:45:59.990 --> 02:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
maybe some of you and i missed here we
 
02:46:01.910 --> 02:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
could chat about
 
02:46:10.950 --> 02:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:13.830 --> 02:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so but i'll look again
 
02:46:13.840 --> 02:46:15.510 align:start position:0%
i don't believe so but i'll look again
okay

02:46:15.510 --> 02:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:15.520 --> 02:46:17.030 align:start position:0%
okay
yeah

02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
you only see a few people
 
02:46:20.550 --> 02:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
yeah he's not there
 
02:46:20.560 --> 02:46:22.070 align:start position:0%
yeah he's not there
okay

02:46:22.070 --> 02:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:24.150 --> 02:46:24.160 align:start position:0%
that's a good question to ask now i've
 
02:46:26.309 --> 02:46:26.319 align:start position:0%
heard some rumblings of when it would be
 
02:46:28.469 --> 02:46:28.479 align:start position:0%
but it's just rumblings
 
02:46:29.750 --> 02:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah but we said
 
02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:32.160 align:start position:0%
i just sent that out
 
02:46:32.160 --> 02:46:33.750 align:start position:0%
i just sent that out
okay

02:46:33.750 --> 02:46:33.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:46:35.670 --> 02:46:35.680 align:start position:0%
representative southwest
 
02:46:37.030 --> 02:46:37.040 align:start position:0%
just um
 
02:46:38.790 --> 02:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
you know on the news when it listed the
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
states where covet was increasing new
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
hampshire right now is one of the top
 
02:46:45.910 --> 02:46:45.920 align:start position:0%
ones probably because of the colleges
 
02:46:48.550 --> 02:46:48.560 align:start position:0%
so that may impact the decision to end
 
02:46:50.630 --> 02:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
the mandate um
 
02:46:52.710 --> 02:46:52.720 align:start position:0%
that is based on percent so it isn't
 
02:46:54.389 --> 02:46:54.399 align:start position:0%
necessarily a lot of people
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
but we were listed in the bad column
 
02:47:00.230 --> 02:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:02.870 --> 02:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah in the schools uh our schools just
 
02:47:04.790 --> 02:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
got locked out again because of the
 
02:47:07.429 --> 02:47:07.439 align:start position:0%
wrestling match that happened in bedford
 
02:47:10.070 --> 02:47:10.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:12.469 --> 02:47:12.479 align:start position:0%
i've been walked out for at least a
 
02:47:16.230 --> 02:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:16.240 --> 02:47:17.910 align:start position:0%
 
um

02:47:17.910 --> 02:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:47:19.750 --> 02:47:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on the males and
 
02:47:19.760 --> 02:47:24.389 align:start position:0%
okay anything else on the males and
rooms

02:47:24.389 --> 02:47:24.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:27.429 --> 02:47:27.439 align:start position:0%
the tobacco tax
 
02:47:31.030 --> 02:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:35.670 --> 02:47:35.680 align:start position:0%
we had in 21 247
 
02:47:38.550 --> 02:47:38.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:39.670 --> 02:47:39.680 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
right in between the low and the high of
 
02:47:46.230 --> 02:47:46.240 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
02:47:48.670 --> 02:47:48.680 align:start position:0%
and for 22 we had
 
02:47:48.680 --> 02:47:50.469 align:start position:0%
and for 22 we had
244.8

02:47:50.469 --> 02:47:50.479 align:start position:0%
244.8
 
02:47:54.630 --> 02:47:54.640 align:start position:0%
which is again right between there's
 
02:47:57.830 --> 02:47:57.840 align:start position:0%
uh 240.5
 
02:48:00.150 --> 02:48:00.160 align:start position:0%
which is probably close to the middle of
 
02:48:05.030 --> 02:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:05.040 --> 02:48:06.230 align:start position:0%
 
any

02:48:06.230 --> 02:48:06.240 align:start position:0%
any
 
02:48:13.429 --> 02:48:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:16.710 --> 02:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
the interest in dividend tax
 
02:48:18.550 --> 02:48:18.560 align:start position:0%
and again this is
 
02:48:21.269 --> 02:48:21.279 align:start position:0%
we have to use the current law
 
02:48:21.279 --> 02:48:22.469 align:start position:0%
we have to use the current law
and

02:48:22.469 --> 02:48:22.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:23.670 --> 02:48:23.680 align:start position:0%
to address
 
02:48:26.070 --> 02:48:26.080 align:start position:0%
the legislation we do that in hospital
 
02:48:26.080 --> 02:48:27.429 align:start position:0%
the legislation we do that in hospital
through

02:48:27.429 --> 02:48:27.439 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:48:30.630 --> 02:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
an interest in dividend
 
02:48:33.510 --> 02:48:33.520 align:start position:0%
we came up with 128.8
 
02:48:35.190 --> 02:48:35.200 align:start position:0%
which is
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
somewhere close to the middle of what
 
02:48:39.910 --> 02:48:39.920 align:start position:0%
the dra estimates
 
02:48:43.349 --> 02:48:43.359 align:start position:0%
and for 22
 
02:48:44.750 --> 02:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
we estimated
 
02:48:48.469 --> 02:48:48.479 align:start position:0%
136.5 which is again in the middle
 
02:48:49.910 --> 02:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the dra
 
02:48:53.349 --> 02:48:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:55.030 --> 02:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
which is probably close to the middle
 
02:48:59.590 --> 02:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:03.030 --> 02:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
questions on interest and dividends
 
02:49:03.040 --> 02:49:06.150 align:start position:0%
questions on interest and dividends
comments

02:49:06.150 --> 02:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:07.910 --> 02:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
the communication
 
02:49:07.920 --> 02:49:10.550 align:start position:0%
the communication
facts

02:49:10.550 --> 02:49:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:13.349 --> 02:49:13.359 align:start position:0%
is the agency does a
 
02:49:16.710 --> 02:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
good job on that i don't see any
 
02:49:19.269 --> 02:49:19.279 align:start position:0%
changes where close to what the agency
 
02:49:19.279 --> 02:49:21.830 align:start position:0%
changes where close to what the agency
has

02:49:21.830 --> 02:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:24.550 --> 02:49:24.560 align:start position:0%
questions or comments
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:32.309 --> 02:49:32.319 align:start position:0%
we had 191.8
 
02:49:35.510 --> 02:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
for fy21
 
02:49:38.550 --> 02:49:38.560 align:start position:0%
which is on the low side
 
02:49:41.910 --> 02:49:41.920 align:start position:0%
but things have changed a bit
 
02:49:46.150 --> 02:49:46.160 align:start position:0%
and for 22 we had 180.3
 
02:49:48.630 --> 02:49:48.640 align:start position:0%
which is somewhere in between
 
02:49:50.710 --> 02:49:50.720 align:start position:0%
their estimates
 
02:49:53.269 --> 02:49:53.279 align:start position:0%
and in 23
 
02:49:56.469 --> 02:49:56.479 align:start position:0%
we had 168.8
 
02:50:01.190 --> 02:50:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:03.670 --> 02:50:03.680 align:start position:0%
any comments questions on the real
 
02:50:03.680 --> 02:50:12.309 align:start position:0%
any comments questions on the real
estate

02:50:12.309 --> 02:50:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:15.670 --> 02:50:15.680 align:start position:0%
i've been trying to compare the agency's
 
02:50:18.309 --> 02:50:18.319 align:start position:0%
estimates from january with these and
 
02:50:21.269 --> 02:50:21.279 align:start position:0%
and this one they have put up
 
02:50:21.279 --> 02:50:22.550 align:start position:0%
and this one they have put up
on

02:50:22.550 --> 02:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
on
 
02:50:24.870 --> 02:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
more than more than the ones you've been
 
02:50:26.710 --> 02:50:26.720 align:start position:0%
talking about recently
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
on by some because the market just keeps
 
02:50:31.429 --> 02:50:31.439 align:start position:0%
on being there
 
02:50:31.439 --> 02:50:33.269 align:start position:0%
on being there
but

02:50:33.269 --> 02:50:33.279 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:50:35.429 --> 02:50:35.439 align:start position:0%
i just want to point that out
 
02:50:35.439 --> 02:50:37.670 align:start position:0%
i just want to point that out
okay

02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:50:40.469 --> 02:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
any other represent uh south side
 
02:50:42.950 --> 02:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh thank you just a general comment
 
02:50:45.830 --> 02:50:45.840 align:start position:0%
as as usual the usual the usually the
 
02:50:48.389 --> 02:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
case it does look like the first two
 
02:50:49.830 --> 02:50:49.840 align:start position:0%
taxes are really the ones we're gonna
 
02:50:51.750 --> 02:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
have to spend most of the time on
 
02:50:54.389 --> 02:50:54.399 align:start position:0%
and those also seem to be the ones where
 
02:50:56.070 --> 02:50:56.080 align:start position:0%
you know we may be able to move things
 
02:50:56.080 --> 02:50:57.190 align:start position:0%
you know we may be able to move things
more

02:50:57.190 --> 02:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:51:00.230 --> 02:51:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh confidently upwards
 
02:51:04.550 --> 02:51:04.560 align:start position:0%
yeah and we probably want to keep a
 
02:51:06.790 --> 02:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
an eye on the real estate transfer tax
 
02:51:11.030 --> 02:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:14.240 align:start position:0%
any other questions or comments on the
 
02:51:16.830 --> 02:51:16.840 align:start position:0%
vra type
 
02:51:20.150 --> 02:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
taxes how about uh okay representative
 
02:51:20.160 --> 02:51:21.590 align:start position:0%
taxes how about uh okay representative
romney

02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
romney
 
02:51:24.389 --> 02:51:24.399 align:start position:0%
yeah can we decide uh now
 
02:51:26.550 --> 02:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh which of these
 
02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:27.429 align:start position:0%
uh which of these
we

02:51:27.429 --> 02:51:27.439 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:51:27.439 --> 02:51:28.230 align:start position:0%
we
feel

02:51:28.230 --> 02:51:28.240 align:start position:0%
feel
 
02:51:30.070 --> 02:51:30.080 align:start position:0%
it should be no change like for instance
 
02:51:31.830 --> 02:51:31.840 align:start position:0%
communication service tax i'm going to
 
02:51:34.389 --> 02:51:34.399 align:start position:0%
do that now oh okay good you yeah okay
 
02:51:36.150 --> 02:51:36.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:51:37.590 --> 02:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
well we're gonna
 
02:51:42.309 --> 02:51:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:44.830 --> 02:51:44.840 align:start position:0%
but what i was getting at is that
 
02:51:47.910 --> 02:51:47.920 align:start position:0%
um mr chair what i was getting at is if
 
02:51:49.110 --> 02:51:49.120 align:start position:0%
we're going to have caucuses this
 
02:51:49.120 --> 02:51:50.469 align:start position:0%
we're going to have caucuses this
afternoon

02:51:50.469 --> 02:51:50.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:51:52.630 --> 02:51:52.640 align:start position:0%
i mean if there is there seems to be a
 
02:51:54.230 --> 02:51:54.240 align:start position:0%
couple of taxes here that we
 
02:51:56.710 --> 02:51:56.720 align:start position:0%
aren't worthy of discussing
 
02:51:58.870 --> 02:51:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh and if we can agree right now
 
02:52:00.950 --> 02:52:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll just stay with
 
02:52:02.630 --> 02:52:02.640 align:start position:0%
where we are for it the two that i come
 
02:52:04.950 --> 02:52:04.960 align:start position:0%
to mind are the communication services
 
02:52:04.960 --> 02:52:06.230 align:start position:0%
to mind are the communication services
tax

02:52:06.230 --> 02:52:06.240 align:start position:0%
tax
 
02:52:07.269 --> 02:52:07.279 align:start position:0%
and the
 
02:52:09.429 --> 02:52:09.439 align:start position:0%
utility property tax
 
02:52:12.710 --> 02:52:12.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to take these up tomorrow
 
02:52:14.790 --> 02:52:14.800 align:start position:0%
and we have caucuses
 
02:52:17.030 --> 02:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
coming this afternoon all right so our
 
02:52:18.550 --> 02:52:18.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation in the caucus may be
 
02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:20.560 align:start position:0%
don't don't change these
 
02:52:20.560 --> 02:52:21.670 align:start position:0%
don't don't change these
right

02:52:21.670 --> 02:52:21.680 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:52:26.830 --> 02:52:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
uh how about melissa or carolyn do you
 
02:52:32.389 --> 02:52:32.399 align:start position:0%
have anything else to add
 
02:52:33.750 --> 02:52:33.760 align:start position:0%
while we're
 
02:52:37.349 --> 02:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
considering changes to the revenues
 
02:52:40.830 --> 02:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
that we have to give to the finance
 
02:52:43.190 --> 02:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee um i would just say i think
 
02:52:45.030 --> 02:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
you're spot on the taxes that are
 
02:52:47.190 --> 02:52:47.200 align:start position:0%
definitely um
 
02:52:49.590 --> 02:52:49.600 align:start position:0%
could be reviewed our business taxes m r
 
02:52:50.950 --> 02:52:50.960 align:start position:0%
and rhett you know those are the ones
 
02:52:53.190 --> 02:52:53.200 align:start position:0%
that have been the hardest to predict um
 
02:52:55.750 --> 02:52:55.760 align:start position:0%
during this pandemic we do know that
 
02:52:57.349 --> 02:52:57.359 align:start position:0%
meals and rentals last month performed
 
02:53:00.230 --> 02:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
better than we anticipated uh so i think
 
02:53:02.710 --> 02:53:02.720 align:start position:0%
there is a little bit of wiggle room
 
02:53:05.269 --> 02:53:05.279 align:start position:0%
maybe towards our higher end with that
 
02:53:07.590 --> 02:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
and same with business taxes as we said
 
02:53:07.600 --> 02:53:09.190 align:start position:0%
and same with business taxes as we said
um

02:53:09.190 --> 02:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:53:11.990 --> 02:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes for march so far looking
 
02:53:13.830 --> 02:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
looking good again you know i always
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
carry out that with we do have some more
 
02:53:17.510 --> 02:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
days and we have refunds and then we
 
02:53:19.190 --> 02:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
have april as well
 
02:53:22.389 --> 02:53:22.399 align:start position:0%
uh and and lastly rhett looks like it's
 
02:53:23.910 --> 02:53:23.920 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:26.560 align:start position:0%
another good month
 
02:53:28.389 --> 02:53:28.399 align:start position:0%
looking at today's report which i'm not
 
02:53:30.550 --> 02:53:30.560 align:start position:0%
sure you have received yet
 
02:53:33.750 --> 02:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
we are 33 percent of head of plan and
 
02:53:36.950 --> 02:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
basically most of rat funds are in
 
02:53:40.710 --> 02:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
um so that
 
02:53:43.590 --> 02:53:43.600 align:start position:0%
looking at our february reign or excuse
 
02:53:45.830 --> 02:53:45.840 align:start position:0%
me our march range um
 
02:53:48.550 --> 02:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
would be towards the middle of the range
 
02:53:51.910 --> 02:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
for rhett if that helps at all for march
 
02:53:54.389 --> 02:53:54.399 align:start position:0%
i just saw something today or was it
 
02:53:57.349 --> 02:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
might have been yesterday that on
 
02:53:58.870 --> 02:53:58.880 align:start position:0%
sale of homes
 
02:53:58.880 --> 02:53:59.590 align:start position:0%
sale of homes
that

02:53:59.590 --> 02:53:59.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:54:02.309 --> 02:54:02.319 align:start position:0%
just about every sale
 
02:54:02.319 --> 02:54:03.190 align:start position:0%
just about every sale
they're

02:54:03.190 --> 02:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
they're
 
02:54:05.750 --> 02:54:05.760 align:start position:0%
competing with each other driving the
 
02:54:08.550 --> 02:54:08.560 align:start position:0%
asking price up
 
02:54:11.590 --> 02:54:11.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:14.560 align:start position:0%
in new hampshire and that's great for us
 
02:54:19.269 --> 02:54:19.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:54:21.269 --> 02:54:21.279 align:start position:0%
yeah i'd just like to comment on that i
 
02:54:23.269 --> 02:54:23.279 align:start position:0%
i think
 
02:54:24.790 --> 02:54:24.800 align:start position:0%
there are two
 
02:54:27.510 --> 02:54:27.520 align:start position:0%
factors to watch one is the price which
 
02:54:29.110 --> 02:54:29.120 align:start position:0%
is going up
 
02:54:29.120 --> 02:54:30.309 align:start position:0%
is going up
um

02:54:30.309 --> 02:54:30.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:32.230 --> 02:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
and that's certainly good
 
02:54:35.830 --> 02:54:35.840 align:start position:0%
in terms of our revenue but um the other
 
02:54:37.510 --> 02:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
factor is supply
 
02:54:39.110 --> 02:54:39.120 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:54:42.150 --> 02:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
right now it's uh as everybody knows is
 
02:54:43.990 --> 02:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
it's super tight that's part of the
 
02:54:46.230 --> 02:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
reason prices are going up i think in
 
02:54:49.190 --> 02:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
jeffrey we've got one home for sale
 
02:54:51.590 --> 02:54:51.600 align:start position:0%
it was zero homes
 
02:54:53.910 --> 02:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
a few days ago
 
02:54:53.920 --> 02:54:55.830 align:start position:0%
a few days ago
but

02:54:55.830 --> 02:54:55.840 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:54:59.590 --> 02:54:59.600 align:start position:0%
when price goes up often supply
 
02:55:02.389 --> 02:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
expands at least that's what the theory
 
02:55:04.230 --> 02:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
tells us and uh
 
02:55:06.150 --> 02:55:06.160 align:start position:0%
so it's a little hard to predict there
 
02:55:09.269 --> 02:55:09.279 align:start position:0%
but uh i i certainly be optimistic about
 
02:55:10.550 --> 02:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
the future
 
02:55:13.670 --> 02:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh given that the uh the demand and
 
02:55:15.349 --> 02:55:15.359 align:start position:0%
everything else we've talked about about
 
02:55:17.030 --> 02:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
the economy uh
 
02:55:17.040 --> 02:55:19.590 align:start position:0%
the economy uh
today

02:55:19.590 --> 02:55:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:21.910 --> 02:55:21.920 align:start position:0%
right when the
 
02:55:23.830 --> 02:55:23.840 align:start position:0%
price goes up it's usually because the
 
02:55:26.230 --> 02:55:26.240 align:start position:0%
inventory is is low
 
02:55:26.240 --> 02:55:27.190 align:start position:0%
inventory is is low
and

02:55:27.190 --> 02:55:27.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:55:27.200 --> 02:55:28.070 align:start position:0%
and
we

02:55:28.070 --> 02:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
we
 
02:55:30.389 --> 02:55:30.399 align:start position:0%
really don't see that much
 
02:55:33.269 --> 02:55:33.279 align:start position:0%
new construction
 
02:55:35.990 --> 02:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's people moving people deciding okay
 
02:55:37.830 --> 02:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
now we can unload this house and get a
 
02:55:40.150 --> 02:55:40.160 align:start position:0%
lot of money for it and go somewhere
 
02:55:40.160 --> 02:55:40.950 align:start position:0%
lot of money for it and go somewhere
else

02:55:40.950 --> 02:55:40.960 align:start position:0%
else
 
02:55:44.790 --> 02:55:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:46.550 --> 02:55:46.560 align:start position:0%
is that going to create a
 
02:55:47.910 --> 02:55:47.920 align:start position:0%
bubble like
 
02:55:52.630 --> 02:55:52.640 align:start position:0%
in 2008 when the prices collapse
 
02:55:54.389 --> 02:55:54.399 align:start position:0%
i don't know
 
02:55:55.830 --> 02:55:55.840 align:start position:0%
nobody knows
 
02:55:59.269 --> 02:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
so many things here
 
02:56:01.269 --> 02:56:01.279 align:start position:0%
i mean we have to be careful what we do
 
02:56:04.710 --> 02:56:04.720 align:start position:0%
make life interesting yep it sure does
 
02:56:06.870 --> 02:56:06.880 align:start position:0%
um represented yearly followed by
 
02:56:09.590 --> 02:56:09.600 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
 
02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:10.710 align:start position:0%
representative elmi
yeah

02:56:10.710 --> 02:56:10.720 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:56:13.910 --> 02:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
zillow has a 14 increase
 
02:56:15.349 --> 02:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
year over year
 
02:56:20.070 --> 02:56:20.080 align:start position:0%
but only a 4.5 for the first two weeks
 
02:56:21.349 --> 02:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
of the year
 
02:56:23.670 --> 02:56:23.680 align:start position:0%
it looks like the price is going to go
 
02:56:28.150 --> 02:56:28.160 align:start position:0%
up but not uh a great deal in addition
 
02:56:30.309 --> 02:56:30.319 align:start position:0%
new home uh bills
 
02:56:34.070 --> 02:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
are are way way down um
 
02:56:37.030 --> 02:56:37.040 align:start position:0%
which indicates that existing home sales
 
02:56:40.150 --> 02:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
is going to be the primary source so
 
02:56:43.349 --> 02:56:43.359 align:start position:0%
that it looks like this is a ball but
 
02:56:45.349 --> 02:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
where you are in the bubble
 
02:56:45.359 --> 02:56:46.070 align:start position:0%
where you are in the bubble
and

02:56:46.070 --> 02:56:46.080 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:56:48.309 --> 02:56:48.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know that's that's the question
 
02:56:50.230 --> 02:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
as to where we are are we on the build
 
02:56:53.670 --> 02:56:53.680 align:start position:0%
side or are we getting ready to bust
 
02:56:54.950 --> 02:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
well on
 
02:56:57.670 --> 02:56:57.680 align:start position:0%
2008 we were building
 
02:56:59.670 --> 02:56:59.680 align:start position:0%
many many homes
 
02:57:02.070 --> 02:57:02.080 align:start position:0%
and the price was really high
 
02:57:03.910 --> 02:57:03.920 align:start position:0%
and then the bubble bust
 
02:57:05.750 --> 02:57:05.760 align:start position:0%
had a lot of inventory
 
02:57:08.630 --> 02:57:08.640 align:start position:0%
the values went down
 
02:57:08.640 --> 02:57:08.900 align:start position:0%
the values went down
the

02:57:08.900 --> 02:57:08.910 align:start position:0%

02:57:11.750 --> 02:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
hudson
 
02:57:14.389 --> 02:57:14.399 align:start position:0%
i sit on the hudson planning board and
 
02:57:16.710 --> 02:57:16.720 align:start position:0%
new home developments there haven't been
 
02:57:19.269 --> 02:57:19.279 align:start position:0%
any new home developments there has been
 
02:57:22.150 --> 02:57:22.160 align:start position:0%
a development in hudson but
 
02:57:24.630 --> 02:57:24.640 align:start position:0%
we'll find out about that next next week
 
02:57:25.670 --> 02:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
as to
 
02:57:27.590 --> 02:57:27.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not that goes through
 
02:57:30.790 --> 02:57:30.800 align:start position:0%
but uh new home developments
 
02:57:32.630 --> 02:57:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh we haven't had any
 
02:57:34.230 --> 02:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
uh for
 
02:57:34.240 --> 02:57:35.429 align:start position:0%
uh for
months

02:57:35.429 --> 02:57:35.439 align:start position:0%
months
 
02:57:35.439 --> 02:57:36.950 align:start position:0%
months
just

02:57:36.950 --> 02:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
just
 
02:57:39.910 --> 02:57:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh get some point
 
02:57:42.630 --> 02:57:42.640 align:start position:0%
representative lane you have your hands
 
02:57:46.389 --> 02:57:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh yes thank you mr chair um i used to
 
02:57:48.230 --> 02:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
be on the new hampshire housing finance
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
authority board
 
02:57:51.830 --> 02:57:51.840 align:start position:0%
and i can tell you that the demand is
 
02:57:53.910 --> 02:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
really more in the quote workforce
 
02:57:56.150 --> 02:57:56.160 align:start position:0%
housing or affordable housing
 
02:57:58.870 --> 02:57:58.880 align:start position:0%
which is why so many housing advocates
 
02:58:01.429 --> 02:58:01.439 align:start position:0%
are trying to get those new homes built
 
02:58:03.590 --> 02:58:03.600 align:start position:0%
and those new units built because really
 
02:58:06.389 --> 02:58:06.399 align:start position:0%
the demand is not for the higher end
 
02:58:06.399 --> 02:58:07.670 align:start position:0%
the demand is not for the higher end
homes

02:58:07.670 --> 02:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
homes
 
02:58:10.150 --> 02:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
they sell but the demand is really at
 
02:58:12.230 --> 02:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
more of the lower to moderate priced
 
02:58:14.230 --> 02:58:14.240 align:start position:0%
homes the first home buyer homes and
 
02:58:17.030 --> 02:58:17.040 align:start position:0%
those are the ones we need to build
 
02:58:19.510 --> 02:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
it may not generate as much transfer tax
 
02:58:21.349 --> 02:58:21.359 align:start position:0%
but it certainly will help solve the
 
02:58:24.230 --> 02:58:24.240 align:start position:0%
housing crisis
 
02:58:26.870 --> 02:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
for what all that's worth
 
02:58:29.110 --> 02:58:29.120 align:start position:0%
it's extremely important
 
02:58:31.990 --> 02:58:32.000 align:start position:0%
and they haven't found a way to fix that
 
02:58:32.000 --> 02:58:34.070 align:start position:0%
and they haven't found a way to fix that
yet

02:58:34.070 --> 02:58:34.080 align:start position:0%
yet
 
02:58:34.080 --> 02:58:35.030 align:start position:0%
yet
um

02:58:35.030 --> 02:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:37.110 --> 02:58:37.120 align:start position:0%
representative blocksman um can i make a
 
02:58:39.910 --> 02:58:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:42.950 --> 02:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh yes represent a lot often
 
02:58:45.750 --> 02:58:45.760 align:start position:0%
you know i do think when you look at the
 
02:58:48.230 --> 02:58:48.240 align:start position:0%
deficit of housing supply even though
 
02:58:49.670 --> 02:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
even if these were
 
02:58:51.030 --> 02:58:51.040 align:start position:0%
in these homes that we need are
 
02:58:53.510 --> 02:58:53.520 align:start position:0%
potentially less valuable
 
02:58:56.389 --> 02:58:56.399 align:start position:0%
on their own and individually
 
02:58:57.830 --> 02:58:57.840 align:start position:0%
any aggregate
 
02:58:59.429 --> 02:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
there's so much demand that if we were
 
02:59:01.750 --> 02:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
able to meet supply you know
 
02:59:03.429 --> 02:59:03.439 align:start position:0%
be a significant
 
02:59:03.439 --> 02:59:04.790 align:start position:0%
be a significant
boost

02:59:04.790 --> 02:59:04.800 align:start position:0%
boost
 
02:59:09.510 --> 02:59:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:11.429 --> 02:59:11.439 align:start position:0%
not you know not a loss just because
 
02:59:12.950 --> 02:59:12.960 align:start position:0%
they're less valuable because on the
 
02:59:15.030 --> 02:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
aggregate that the demand is there the
 
02:59:17.349 --> 02:59:17.359 align:start position:0%
new year's there
 
02:59:20.070 --> 02:59:20.080 align:start position:0%
what would you project
 
02:59:20.080 --> 02:59:21.269 align:start position:0%
what would you project
say

02:59:21.269 --> 02:59:21.279 align:start position:0%
say
 
02:59:27.590 --> 02:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:27.600 --> 02:59:28.630 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:59:28.630 --> 02:59:28.640 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:59:31.269 --> 02:59:31.279 align:start position:0%
you know i know we had
 
02:59:33.429 --> 02:59:33.439 align:start position:0%
the governor's priority to implement
 
02:59:34.870 --> 02:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
those those
 
02:59:37.110 --> 02:59:37.120 align:start position:0%
dual housing bills and they were voted
 
02:59:38.710 --> 02:59:38.720 align:start position:0%
down and so i think
 
02:59:40.150 --> 02:59:40.160 align:start position:0%
the projected
 
02:59:42.950 --> 02:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
activity that we're hoping for is
 
02:59:44.710 --> 02:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
uh now up in the air unless the senate
 
02:59:47.670 --> 02:59:47.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:48.950 --> 02:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
so i'm not sure that we're going to be
 
02:59:50.389 --> 02:59:50.399 align:start position:0%
able to create that additional housing
 
02:59:54.389 --> 02:59:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:58.630 --> 02:59:58.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:01.830 --> 03:00:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:04.309 --> 03:00:04.319 align:start position:0%
oh i was going to talk about that too
 
03:00:07.830 --> 03:00:07.840 align:start position:0%
that they put that bill on the table
 
03:00:07.840 --> 03:00:08.790 align:start position:0%
that they put that bill on the table
on

03:00:08.790 --> 03:00:08.800 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:00:14.630 --> 03:00:14.640 align:start position:0%
and and this does it also affects the um
 
03:00:17.429 --> 03:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
our our economy and the business taxes
 
03:00:17.439 --> 03:00:18.469 align:start position:0%
our our economy and the business taxes
because

03:00:18.469 --> 03:00:18.479 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:00:21.510 --> 03:00:21.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of places that want to expand
 
03:00:24.150 --> 03:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
cannot get housing for the people that
 
03:00:26.230 --> 03:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
they're trying to in fact come in and
 
03:00:27.830 --> 03:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
that is uh
 
03:00:32.150 --> 03:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
the middle of the upper middle on
 
03:00:32.160 --> 03:00:33.349 align:start position:0%
the middle of the upper middle on
on

03:00:33.349 --> 03:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:00:35.750 --> 03:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
salaried people as well
 
03:00:39.269 --> 03:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
as the people that are our cleaners and
 
03:00:41.429 --> 03:00:41.439 align:start position:0%
our carpenters and
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
others but
 
03:00:46.710 --> 03:00:46.720 align:start position:0%
on i don't think we've
 
03:00:49.349 --> 03:00:49.359 align:start position:0%
tried to talk with the
 
03:00:51.910 --> 03:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
housing board or some on the realtor's
 
03:00:54.870 --> 03:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
board that whether they've got recent
 
03:00:58.710 --> 03:00:58.720 align:start position:0%
data on permits
 
03:01:00.630 --> 03:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
for the state as versus for our
 
03:01:02.389 --> 03:01:02.399 align:start position:0%
individual towns
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
lebanon is
 
03:01:06.710 --> 03:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
full of housing permits at this point
 
03:01:09.030 --> 03:01:09.040 align:start position:0%
and and they're working their way
 
03:01:11.670 --> 03:01:11.680 align:start position:0%
through the final details of lawsuits
 
03:01:13.990 --> 03:01:14.000 align:start position:0%
and things
 
03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:01:15.200 --> 03:01:16.870 align:start position:0%
thank you
representative

03:01:16.870 --> 03:01:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:01:20.150 --> 03:01:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh thank you in dover um they approved
 
03:01:22.389 --> 03:01:22.399 align:start position:0%
building i think it's 40 cottage style
 
03:01:25.429 --> 03:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
homes and uh the builder is actually the
 
03:01:27.110 --> 03:01:27.120 align:start position:0%
owner of the company where many of those
 
03:01:28.710 --> 03:01:28.720 align:start position:0%
people are working
 
03:01:30.389 --> 03:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
and he was having the same problem
 
03:01:32.389 --> 03:01:32.399 align:start position:0%
that's been mentioned before that he
 
03:01:34.790 --> 03:01:34.800 align:start position:0%
couldn't find any way for his employees
 
03:01:36.309 --> 03:01:36.319 align:start position:0%
to live nearby
 
03:01:38.230 --> 03:01:38.240 align:start position:0%
so this is at least a beginning he's
 
03:01:40.870 --> 03:01:40.880 align:start position:0%
doing 40 of them um but it does seem
 
03:01:43.429 --> 03:01:43.439 align:start position:0%
like a good um kind of compromise for
 
03:01:43.439 --> 03:01:49.190 align:start position:0%
like a good um kind of compromise for
now

03:01:49.190 --> 03:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:52.070 --> 03:01:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:54.309 --> 03:01:54.319 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on any of these
 
03:01:54.319 --> 03:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
questions or comments on any of these
taxes

03:02:01.030 --> 03:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:04.950 --> 03:02:04.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:08.150 --> 03:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:10.790 --> 03:02:10.800 align:start position:0%
i uh during our five-minute break i i
 
03:02:13.429 --> 03:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
did call charlie mcintyre
 
03:02:16.550 --> 03:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
um and this is counter-intuitive but
 
03:02:19.910 --> 03:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
using the 12 was the conservative number
 
03:02:22.309 --> 03:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
uh because what happens is if
 
03:02:23.910 --> 03:02:23.920 align:start position:0%
if it if
 
03:02:26.230 --> 03:02:26.240 align:start position:0%
if it goes down to 10 or 8 percent it
 
03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:27.910 align:start position:0%
if it goes down to 10 or 8 percent it
actually

03:02:27.910 --> 03:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:02:27.920 --> 03:02:29.190 align:start position:0%
actually
uh

03:02:29.190 --> 03:02:29.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
goes to the
 
03:02:33.830 --> 03:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
uh to the owners
 
03:02:33.840 --> 03:02:35.670 align:start position:0%
uh to the owners
then

03:02:35.670 --> 03:02:35.680 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:02:35.680 --> 03:02:36.870 align:start position:0%
then
uh

03:02:36.870 --> 03:02:36.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:02:39.269 --> 03:02:39.279 align:start position:0%
the actual number of people that play
 
03:02:41.990 --> 03:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
increases the handle goes up
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
because moore goes back to the people
 
03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:46.230 align:start position:0%
because moore goes back to the people
playing

03:02:46.230 --> 03:02:46.240 align:start position:0%
playing
 
03:02:48.630 --> 03:02:48.640 align:start position:0%
so the 12
 
03:02:51.110 --> 03:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
is the conservative number
 
03:02:53.590 --> 03:02:53.600 align:start position:0%
and they chose that purposely to keep to
 
03:02:55.830 --> 03:02:55.840 align:start position:0%
be conservative on their estimate of
 
03:02:59.429 --> 03:02:59.439 align:start position:0%
revenue from historic racing
 
03:03:01.670 --> 03:03:01.680 align:start position:0%
so what would the uh
 
03:03:04.309 --> 03:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
actual dollar number be for
 
03:03:04.319 --> 03:03:07.990 align:start position:0%
actual dollar number be for
2022

03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.990 --> 03:03:10.000 align:start position:0%
again we're we're using the conservative
 
03:03:12.630 --> 03:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
oh i didn't ask that uh um
 
03:03:14.309 --> 03:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
i can get that
 
03:03:15.910 --> 03:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and that's what i know they
 
03:03:17.910 --> 03:03:17.920 align:start position:0%
prorated it um
 
03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:19.830 align:start position:0%
prorated it um
yes

03:03:19.830 --> 03:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
okay because
 
03:03:23.910 --> 03:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
it would not it would not go into effect
 
03:03:26.070 --> 03:03:26.080 align:start position:0%
for a while it had to there's some setup
 
03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:27.750 align:start position:0%
for a while it had to there's some setup
time

03:03:27.750 --> 03:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:03:29.750 --> 03:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
i'll get that for for tomorrow i'll have
 
03:03:31.030 --> 03:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
that for tomorrow
 
03:03:33.190 --> 03:03:33.200 align:start position:0%
i just i just say
 
03:03:33.200 --> 03:03:35.349 align:start position:0%
i just i just say
um

03:03:35.349 --> 03:03:35.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:36.710 --> 03:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
that that
 
03:03:38.389 --> 03:03:38.399 align:start position:0%
we we probably have to go forward we
 
03:03:40.630 --> 03:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
don't have enough time but that's
 
03:03:44.070 --> 03:03:44.080 align:start position:0%
certainly a subject i'd like to ex
 
03:03:44.080 --> 03:03:45.349 align:start position:0%
certainly a subject i'd like to ex
to

03:03:45.349 --> 03:03:45.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:45.359 --> 03:03:46.309 align:start position:0%
to
to

03:03:46.309 --> 03:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:03:46.319 --> 03:03:47.269 align:start position:0%
to
um

03:03:47.269 --> 03:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:47.279 --> 03:03:48.469 align:start position:0%
um
explore

03:03:48.469 --> 03:03:48.479 align:start position:0%
explore
 
03:03:52.870 --> 03:03:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:56.790 --> 03:03:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:58.550 --> 03:03:58.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know when we can do that
 
03:03:58.560 --> 03:03:59.429 align:start position:0%
yeah i don't know when we can do that
but

03:03:59.429 --> 03:03:59.439 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:04:01.590 --> 03:04:01.600 align:start position:0%
however you want to do it
 
03:04:03.510 --> 03:04:03.520 align:start position:0%
represent major he's coming in tomorrow
 
03:04:03.520 --> 03:04:05.030 align:start position:0%
represent major he's coming in tomorrow
morning

03:04:05.030 --> 03:04:05.040 align:start position:0%
morning
 
03:04:08.230 --> 03:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
oh good perfect
 
03:04:11.510 --> 03:04:11.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i wasn't doing one thing
 
03:04:13.830 --> 03:04:13.840 align:start position:0%
any of the agency had to have to do with
 
03:04:15.750 --> 03:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
the other revenue streams that we didn't
 
03:04:17.269 --> 03:04:17.279 align:start position:0%
discuss today
 
03:04:17.279 --> 03:04:18.469 align:start position:0%
discuss today
um

03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:20.150 --> 03:04:20.160 align:start position:0%
especially if we
 
03:04:22.870 --> 03:04:22.880 align:start position:0%
feel that they're going to the economy
 
03:04:25.590 --> 03:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
is going to change their revenues
 
03:04:27.190 --> 03:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:04:30.469 --> 03:04:30.479 align:start position:0%
we'll be talking tomorrow
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:35.269 --> 03:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:04:37.510 --> 03:04:37.520 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest is that
 
03:04:37.520 --> 03:04:39.429 align:start position:0%
what i would suggest is that
representation

03:04:39.429 --> 03:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
representation
 
03:04:43.510 --> 03:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
you have a practice of your members
 
03:04:45.910 --> 03:04:45.920 align:start position:0%
maybe this afternoon and we'll have a
 
03:04:47.990 --> 03:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
caucus of our members this afternoon
 
03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:51.520 align:start position:0%
we'll discuss these revenues so mr chair
 
03:04:53.830 --> 03:04:53.840 align:start position:0%
should uh uh well at least for the
 
03:04:55.670 --> 03:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
republican side should we come uh
 
03:04:55.680 --> 03:04:57.190 align:start position:0%
republican side should we come uh
prepared

03:04:57.190 --> 03:04:57.200 align:start position:0%
prepared
 
03:05:00.150 --> 03:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh with a high and a low or uh our best
 
03:05:03.190 --> 03:05:03.200 align:start position:0%
guess on on the on the midpoint on these
 
03:05:04.870 --> 03:05:04.880 align:start position:0%
to the meeting
 
03:05:07.830 --> 03:05:07.840 align:start position:0%
i would start with the high and low okay
 
03:05:10.070 --> 03:05:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:05:11.990 --> 03:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:05:13.990 --> 03:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
i'm planning to have the
 
03:05:15.830 --> 03:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
caucus around
 
03:05:18.630 --> 03:05:18.640 align:start position:0%
three o'clock if anybody hasn't
 
03:05:20.309 --> 03:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
let me know
 
03:05:21.670 --> 03:05:21.680 align:start position:0%
and i don't know when you're gonna have
 
03:05:23.830 --> 03:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
your caucus
 
03:05:23.840 --> 03:05:25.429 align:start position:0%
your caucus
susan

03:05:25.429 --> 03:05:25.439 align:start position:0%
susan
 
03:05:28.070 --> 03:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
yes and we were going to have a really
 
03:05:30.550 --> 03:05:30.560 align:start position:0%
quick one at lunch which was our only
 
03:05:32.790 --> 03:05:32.800 align:start position:0%
time available today
 
03:05:35.990 --> 03:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
on we can't start at three it's too late
 
03:05:36.000 --> 03:05:36.790 align:start position:0%
on we can't start at three it's too late
for

03:05:36.790 --> 03:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:05:38.870 --> 03:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
representative ames
 
03:05:38.880 --> 03:05:39.750 align:start position:0%
representative ames
but

03:05:39.750 --> 03:05:39.760 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:05:41.990 --> 03:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
and we need some time to think about
 
03:05:42.000 --> 03:05:43.190 align:start position:0%
and we need some time to think about
this

03:05:43.190 --> 03:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:05:43.200 --> 03:05:44.830 align:start position:0%
this
so

03:05:44.830 --> 03:05:44.840 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:05:47.429 --> 03:05:47.439 align:start position:0%
on i think
 
03:05:50.950 --> 03:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
maybe on representative ames could you
 
03:05:54.469 --> 03:05:54.479 align:start position:0%
set us up for a different time starting
 
03:05:57.910 --> 03:05:57.920 align:start position:0%
at two do you think
 
03:06:00.710 --> 03:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
so that everybody in our caucus will
 
03:06:02.389 --> 03:06:02.399 align:start position:0%
have time to
 
03:06:03.830 --> 03:06:03.840 align:start position:0%
think about
 
03:06:03.840 --> 03:06:04.870 align:start position:0%
think about
on

03:06:04.870 --> 03:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:06:08.630 --> 03:06:08.640 align:start position:0%
the numbers until two o'clock
 
03:06:08.640 --> 03:06:10.150 align:start position:0%
the numbers until two o'clock
okay

03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:06:13.190 --> 03:06:13.200 align:start position:0%
both of those numbers and these that we
 
03:06:16.309 --> 03:06:16.319 align:start position:0%
discussed today yes
 
03:06:16.319 --> 03:06:18.070 align:start position:0%
discussed today yes
exactly

03:06:18.070 --> 03:06:18.080 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
03:06:20.870 --> 03:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
good okay thank you
 
03:06:23.830 --> 03:06:23.840 align:start position:0%
and i suggest we just look just look at
 
03:06:26.950 --> 03:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
the business taxes meals and rooms and
 
03:06:29.510 --> 03:06:29.520 align:start position:0%
real estate transfer tax
 
03:06:32.630 --> 03:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
as well as everything in hb2
 
03:06:34.790 --> 03:06:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah do something not break into the
 
03:06:37.590 --> 03:06:37.600 align:start position:0%
middle of the day like two o'clock how
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
about four
 
03:06:41.830 --> 03:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
i can't do it representative ames has to
 
03:06:46.389 --> 03:06:46.399 align:start position:0%
leave and he is he is going to be our
 
03:06:48.550 --> 03:06:48.560 align:start position:0%
our uh
 
03:06:51.830 --> 03:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
group to our what do you call it zoom
 
03:06:53.830 --> 03:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
host can can we just stick to the
 
03:06:56.710 --> 03:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
original plan i'm sorry i've got uh you
 
03:06:58.070 --> 03:06:58.080 align:start position:0%
know other
 
03:07:00.550 --> 03:07:00.560 align:start position:0%
in this matter so can we just none of us
 
03:07:02.389 --> 03:07:02.399 align:start position:0%
are going to have time to think about
 
03:07:03.910 --> 03:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
this ahead
 
03:07:06.750 --> 03:07:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:11.750 --> 03:07:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we're going to be thinking about it
 
03:07:14.710 --> 03:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
i'd rather go ahead with noon myself and
 
03:07:16.309 --> 03:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
things too
 
03:07:18.389 --> 03:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
yeah i've already made all my numbers i
 
03:07:23.670 --> 03:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:27.110 --> 03:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
most of yesterday doing administration
 
03:07:27.120 --> 03:07:28.230 align:start position:0%
most of yesterday doing administration
but

03:07:28.230 --> 03:07:28.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:07:30.710 --> 03:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay uh we'll we'll
 
03:07:31.990 --> 03:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
start at
 
03:07:35.590 --> 03:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
12 and go till whenever we have to we'll
 
03:07:37.269 --> 03:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
start at 12 30.
 
03:07:39.349 --> 03:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
twelve thirty okay
 
03:07:40.469 --> 03:07:40.479 align:start position:0%
oh yes
 
03:07:42.230 --> 03:07:42.240 align:start position:0%
oh eight now
 
03:07:44.230 --> 03:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
and people can eat their lunches while
 
03:07:46.389 --> 03:07:46.399 align:start position:0%
we're talking
 
03:07:48.230 --> 03:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
for the republicans it's three o'clock
 
03:07:48.240 --> 03:07:49.910 align:start position:0%
for the republicans it's three o'clock
okay

03:07:49.910 --> 03:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:07:53.429 --> 03:07:53.439 align:start position:0%
norm you got two hands up uh
 
03:07:55.190 --> 03:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
so you'll send something out i'll
 
03:07:56.950 --> 03:07:56.960 align:start position:0%
represent you
 
03:07:56.960 --> 03:07:57.830 align:start position:0%
represent you
no

03:07:57.830 --> 03:07:57.840 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:07:59.750 --> 03:07:59.760 align:start position:0%
yes i was wondering if we could do it a
 
03:08:01.110 --> 03:08:01.120 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier
 
03:08:01.120 --> 03:08:01.990 align:start position:0%
little bit earlier
um

03:08:01.990 --> 03:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:08:04.550 --> 03:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
i do have i will run up against a
 
03:08:07.349 --> 03:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
conflict if we start at three
 
03:08:09.349 --> 03:08:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh it depends how long it takes i mean
 
03:08:09.359 --> 03:08:10.070 align:start position:0%
uh it depends how long it takes i mean
if

03:08:10.070 --> 03:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
if
 
03:08:11.429 --> 03:08:11.439 align:start position:0%
i doubt we're gonna be done in half an
 
03:08:14.230 --> 03:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
hour so is it possible to start at two
 
03:08:14.240 --> 03:08:15.830 align:start position:0%
hour so is it possible to start at two
yes

03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:08:17.670 --> 03:08:17.680 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem starting at
 
03:08:17.680 --> 03:08:18.710 align:start position:0%
does anybody have a problem starting at
two

03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:08:21.590 --> 03:08:21.600 align:start position:0%
mr chair three works better for me but i
 
03:08:22.950 --> 03:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
would get the sense of the rest of the
 
03:08:22.960 --> 03:08:27.269 align:start position:0%
would get the sense of the rest of the
members

03:08:27.269 --> 03:08:27.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:29.269 --> 03:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
well has his hand up as well and
 
03:08:30.630 --> 03:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
herschel no
 
03:08:34.469 --> 03:08:34.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:36.550 --> 03:08:36.560 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair um i think three
 
03:08:38.469 --> 03:08:38.479 align:start position:0%
o'clock would also work better for me
 
03:08:41.349 --> 03:08:41.359 align:start position:0%
but um again if it's a big problem for
 
03:08:44.309 --> 03:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
others i can be flexible
 
03:08:50.469 --> 03:08:50.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:51.590 --> 03:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's going to take this
 
03:08:51.600 --> 03:08:52.790 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's going to take this
long

03:08:52.790 --> 03:08:52.800 align:start position:0%
long
 
03:08:54.469 --> 03:08:54.479 align:start position:0%
so yeah 2 30
 
03:08:56.630 --> 03:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
2 30. can i
 
03:08:58.870 --> 03:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion yes
 
03:08:58.880 --> 03:08:59.670 align:start position:0%
make a suggestion yes
um

03:08:59.670 --> 03:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:02.469 --> 03:09:02.479 align:start position:0%
can we can we just get on it as soon as
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
this one's over and get it done so that
 
03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
because i have appointments this
 
03:09:05.840 --> 03:09:09.030 align:start position:0%
because i have appointments this
afternoon

03:09:09.030 --> 03:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:10.710 --> 03:09:10.720 align:start position:0%
oh that would work for me if we could
 
03:09:12.710 --> 03:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
start at one or something like that as
 
03:09:12.720 --> 03:09:13.510 align:start position:0%
start at one or something like that as
well

03:09:13.510 --> 03:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:09:15.190 --> 03:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
just need a few minutes to put some
 
03:09:18.070 --> 03:09:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:19.030 --> 03:09:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:09:23.910 --> 03:09:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:26.070 --> 03:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
that's mr chair
 
03:09:28.070 --> 03:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
130 might not be it's kind of like
 
03:09:29.429 --> 03:09:29.439 align:start position:0%
splitting the difference so we have to
 
03:09:31.670 --> 03:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
sit around for an hour i would rather do
 
03:09:33.990 --> 03:09:34.000 align:start position:0%
230 or do
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
do it right now but i think some people
 
03:09:37.990 --> 03:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
want to collect their thoughts so if 230
 
03:09:40.150 --> 03:09:40.160 align:start position:0%
works with everyone i think that
 
03:09:45.030 --> 03:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
norm paul has had his hand up paul paul
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
i'm going to be getting my shot right
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
about that time but i i worked up some
 
03:09:54.790 --> 03:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
of my numbers last night so i'll refine
 
03:09:56.950 --> 03:09:56.960 align:start position:0%
them and i'll forward them to either you
 
03:10:02.229 --> 03:10:02.239 align:start position:0%
or to pat mr chair okay thank you
 
03:10:03.510 --> 03:10:03.520 align:start position:0%
then why don't
 
03:10:06.870 --> 03:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
we do it at 2 30
 
03:10:07.910 --> 03:10:07.920 align:start position:0%
and that's
 
03:10:10.469 --> 03:10:10.479 align:start position:0%
right on the borderline of satisfying
 
03:10:12.870 --> 03:10:12.880 align:start position:0%
most people
 
03:10:12.880 --> 03:10:15.349 align:start position:0%
most people
okay

03:10:15.349 --> 03:10:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:17.910 --> 03:10:17.920 align:start position:0%
i'll get the link sent out right away
 
03:10:20.070 --> 03:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
and for the democrats
 
03:10:22.389 --> 03:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
for the democrats i've sent out the link
 
03:10:25.349 --> 03:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
already and if you can't find it
 
03:10:27.429 --> 03:10:27.439 align:start position:0%
please send me an email and i'll make
 
03:10:29.910 --> 03:10:29.920 align:start position:0%
sure you get it
 
03:10:32.389 --> 03:10:32.399 align:start position:0%
all right then i'm going to uh
 
03:10:33.990 --> 03:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
close it
 
03:10:34.000 --> 03:10:34.870 align:start position:0%
close it
okay

03:10:34.870 --> 03:10:34.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:10:36.630 --> 03:10:36.640 align:start position:0%
dick dick does that mean that we're
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
going to have to stop by two no
 
03:10:42.389 --> 03:10:42.399 align:start position:0%
no it does not
 
03:10:44.309 --> 03:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
so we're gonna start at 12 30 and i hope
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
we stop by two but uh who knows
 
03:11:04.870 --> 03:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.880 --> 03:11:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
you
