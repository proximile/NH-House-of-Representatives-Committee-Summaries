00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:28.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 align:start position:0%
good morning welcome is the committee on
 
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 align:start position:0%
housing we're going to get started if
 
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
you'd like to shut the door go
 
00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
ahead um let's get started with the
 
00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
I pledge aliance to the flag of the
 
00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 align:start position:0%
United States of America to the Republic
 
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 align:start position:0%
for which stands one nation under God
 
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 align:start position:0%
indivisible with liy and justice for
 
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 align:start position:0%
all all right so today is meant to be
 
00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 align:start position:0%
very very informal um this is an
 
00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the committee to work
 
00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 align:start position:0%
through um some of the bills that we
 
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 align:start position:0%
heard that we have already had a public
 
00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 align:start position:0%
hearing on um so I have another number
 
00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 align:start position:0%
of bills that
 
00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:06.239 align:start position:0%
um I have noticed that I think we should
 
00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
talk about as a full committee um and I
 
00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 align:start position:0%
believe representative Howland has a
 
00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 align:start position:0%
work session for a bill that we that we
 
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 align:start position:0%
um sent to subcommittee at 2:00 but um
 
00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 align:start position:0%
my plan is to hopefully get through this
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
around 12:30 12:45 and then send you all
 
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 align:start position:0%
home unless you're on the subcommittee
 
00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 align:start position:0%
and then you know so we might not break
 
00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 align:start position:0%
for lunch I'm just going to try to power
 
00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:28.070 align:start position:0%
for lunch I'm just going to try to power
through

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
through
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
this um
 
00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
so for the newer members this is a great
 
00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:34.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity for you to um just kind of
 
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 align:start position:0%
look at look at the legislation if you
 
00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 align:start position:0%
have edits or something You' like to say
 
00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:39.799 align:start position:0%
about it this is done in public so feel
 
00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 align:start position:0%
free to add um input we're not taking
 
00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 align:start position:0%
any votes on these bills today but I'd
 
00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 align:start position:0%
like to know how the
 
00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
what YouTube's on yeah YouTube's on yep
 
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to know how the committee
 
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
feels about these bills and some of the
 
00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
changes so I've brought quite a number
 
00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:58.159 align:start position:0%
of recommended changes to um the bills
 
00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
that I introduced last week but um I
 
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 align:start position:0%
guess we'll just go right in numerical
 
00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 align:start position:0%
order so um the first bill I have is HB
 
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 align:start position:0%
296 um if the committee me remembers
 
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
last week that or a couple weeks ago
 
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 align:start position:0%
that was representative Lads bill um
 
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 align:start position:0%
relative to private roads um I'm
 
00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
relatively supportive of the concept I
 
00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 align:start position:0%
think that it needs an amendment U my my
 
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
personal recommendation as chair is that
 
00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 align:start position:0%
we amend it to only allow the local
 
00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 align:start position:0%
government to review if a
 
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle can access the private
 
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
road I think that was what we heard from
 
00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 align:start position:0%
the public hearing was the only like
 
00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
necessity of a private road like you
 
00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 align:start position:0%
know what what's the municipality's
 
00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 align:start position:0%
interest in regulating private road I
 
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
think to at least allow emergency
 
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
vehicle access but I'm open to the open
 
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
to suggestions from the committee
 
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.950 align:start position:0%
to suggestions from the committee
representative

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 align:start position:0%
Grant I agree that that's probably one
 
00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 align:start position:0%
of the most important um in my question
 
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 align:start position:0%
the other day on this particular thing
 
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 align:start position:0%
the other thing I was getting at is the
 
00:05:03.749 --> 00:05:03.759 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the road how are we going
 
00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
to guarantee or how how's the town going
 
00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:08.919 align:start position:0%
to get a guarantee that that Road's
 
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
going to be maintained so that a
 
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle can get in there on
 
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960 align:start position:0%
the fire department for 20 years you get
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
on a small Road like that the first one
 
00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 align:start position:0%
gets stuck you're done yeah
 
00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:23.039 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 align:start position:0%
jont what I've seen a lot of times with
 
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
newly created private roads is that the
 
00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:28.039 align:start position:0%
towns are actually requiring them to
 
00:05:30.029 --> 00:05:30.039 align:start position:0%
build build them to town stand ards or
 
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:32.440 align:start position:0%
per regulations and I think this is a
 
00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 align:start position:0%
good idea and one thing that would make
 
00:05:35.990 --> 00:05:36.000 align:start position:0%
it a little bit beneficial is if the
 
00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
town is built to town standards which
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
would satisfy that representative's
 
00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 align:start position:0%
issue um the town would have to
 
00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
acknowledge those frontages along those
 
00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
along those roads a lot of times right
 
00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:46.919 align:start position:0%
now that's the at least what I've seen
 
00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.600 align:start position:0%
the main hurdle is that the frontage
 
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
isn't acknowledged on something other
 
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:52.360 align:start position:0%
than a u you know a town-owned
 
00:05:55.309 --> 00:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
highway represent Howen uh so that's
 
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
exactly my point uh so that RSA uh 231
 
00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:02.919 align:start position:0%
colon 81- a is like maintenance of
 
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
private roads I actually have a cabin on
 
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:08.240 align:start position:0%
a private road and the difficulty we
 
00:06:11.309 --> 00:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
have is that there's there is no
 
00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
document right now that actually
 
00:06:14.909 --> 00:06:14.919 align:start position:0%
regulates the maintenance of the private
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
road it's kind of like an urban legend
 
00:06:20.029 --> 00:06:20.039 align:start position:0%
uh $400 that stayed that way for five
 
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 align:start position:0%
years and believe it or not my wife is
 
00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 align:start position:0%
actually the collector of the money and
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
so it gets really difficult when the
 
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:29.840 align:start position:0%
properties turn over in uh to do you
 
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.080 align:start position:0%
maintain it I my neighbor who will
 
00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
remain nameless one of them will not pay
 
00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 align:start position:0%
the road fee in theory we can sue them
 
00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:40.280 align:start position:0%
if for not paying it but it's really
 
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
messy um in terms of uh emergency
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
vehicles getting there in the winter
 
00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:47.479 align:start position:0%
down my road that's why you have to have
 
00:06:49.749 --> 00:06:49.759 align:start position:0%
an extra insurance waiver on there for
 
00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 align:start position:0%
fire because if there's a fire your
 
00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:54.440 align:start position:0%
house is going to burn down it's like we
 
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.160 align:start position:0%
do plow but forget about it so I think
 
00:06:59.230 --> 00:06:59.240 align:start position:0%
the biggest uh thing I would change
 
00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
along your lines too is that we just add
 
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
the word existing um if you want to
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
bypass the planning board on existing uh
 
00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 align:start position:0%
private roads that's fine they the T the
 
00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:12.479 align:start position:0%
town actually has you still fall under
 
00:07:15.029 --> 00:07:15.039 align:start position:0%
the town's building permit stuff and on
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
our road there's been a lot of building
 
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
that has occurred my neighbor did a new
 
00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
garage with a office over the top and
 
00:07:22.749 --> 00:07:22.759 align:start position:0%
there's been two new houses that have
 
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:26.120 align:start position:0%
been built um so that's fine I think the
 
00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:27.400 align:start position:0%
bigger issue you're going to have with
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
permitting on the road for us s you're
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
probably going to have to pull a
 
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
shoreline protection uh permit and the
 
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:35.680 align:start position:0%
state you're probably going to have to
 
00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:37.120 align:start position:0%
pull you definitely going to have to
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
pull a septic permit so the permitting
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be an issue it's the
 
00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.240 align:start position:0%
maintenance of the road uh and in the
 
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:44.560 align:start position:0%
spring if you come in and you're going
 
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
to build that road and the uh or you're
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
going to build the new house and the
 
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
road is soft and you damage the road
 
00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:53.560 align:start position:0%
bringing in a big truck who pays for the
 
00:07:56.550 --> 00:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
fixing of it so that's my issue
 
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.080 align:start position:0%
hopefully you don't if you do New Roads
 
00:08:00.710 --> 00:08:00.720 align:start position:0%
please don't do it that way because it's
 
00:08:04.589 --> 00:08:04.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:07.589 --> 00:08:07.599 align:start position:0%
in other
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
feedback um so representative Howland
 
00:08:13.189 --> 00:08:13.199 align:start position:0%
yes do you have um
 
00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:17.800 align:start position:0%
recommended changes to this bill or I
 
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:20.800 align:start position:0%
think it's one word existing roads right
 
00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:27.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:40.389 --> 00:08:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
um it would be on the last line where it
 
00:08:46.509 --> 00:08:46.519 align:start position:0%
says um has voted to authorize the
 
00:08:48.190 --> 00:08:48.200 align:start position:0%
issuance of building permits for the
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
erection of build uh erection of
 
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
buildings on said on said existing
 
00:08:59.910 --> 00:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
question okay yep represent page Al
 
00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:04.120 align:start position:0%
would you want it in the
 
00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959 align:start position:0%
prior passage as well after after
 
00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:08.720 align:start position:0%
establishing that the existing private
 
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.120 align:start position:0%
road yeah put at both spots yeah well
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
there was a a grammatical change too
 
00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
right because on line four it says after
 
00:09:20.230 --> 00:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
establishing that the private road
 
00:09:24.630 --> 00:09:24.640 align:start position:0%
identified complies with so scratch and
 
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:26.360 align:start position:0%
and then say complies
 
00:09:31.069 --> 00:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
with okay so two existing
 
00:09:32.389 --> 00:09:32.399 align:start position:0%
are you volunteering to draft an
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
amendment sure
 
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:37.509 align:start position:0%
amendment sure
sure

00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:41.200 align:start position:0%
great represent buo yeah I was I was
 
00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
just going to say that I you know I
 
00:09:44.509 --> 00:09:44.519 align:start position:0%
think the testimony that we got from
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
attorney Paul Alano um in his proposed
 
00:09:50.069 --> 00:09:50.079 align:start position:0%
um amendment to this legislation I think
 
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.160 align:start position:0%
was actually really really really
 
00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
insightful because I you know I'm I know
 
00:09:56.190 --> 00:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
that his practice deals with this
 
00:09:59.110 --> 00:09:59.120 align:start position:0%
specific issue frequently and I think
 
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:01.560 align:start position:0%
that you know just the simple you know
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
or you know uh just the or after
 
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
determining the road is suitable
 
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
condition for travel by emergency
 
00:10:09.710 --> 00:10:09.720 align:start position:0%
vehicles I think that pretty much does
 
00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:11.839 align:start position:0%
it I understand your concern about you
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
know maintaining you know an existing
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
private road or if there's a new private
 
00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:18.480 align:start position:0%
road or whatever um but I think that you
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
know this legislation as contemplated is
 
00:10:25.670 --> 00:10:25.680 align:start position:0%
really targeted at fixing this one issue
 
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:27.480 align:start position:0%
um you know if you add it in existing I
 
00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:28.880 align:start position:0%
don't know if the legislation would be
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
as imp F but I also don't know you know
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
given the entire rest of the statute
 
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:37.480 align:start position:0%
what the impact of that would be um you
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
know as drafted it doesn't say anything
 
00:10:40.949 --> 00:10:40.959 align:start position:0%
about existing or not it just says the
 
00:10:43.670 --> 00:10:43.680 align:start position:0%
road um so I mean I would be in favor of
 
00:10:45.949 --> 00:10:45.959 align:start position:0%
just a nice clean Amendment saying let's
 
00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
just see that it's suitable for travel
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
by emergency vehicles and then move
 
00:10:54.629 --> 00:10:54.639 align:start position:0%
on representative Dumont then
 
00:10:56.949 --> 00:10:56.959 align:start position:0%
Paige I would agree I've always thought
 
00:10:59.389 --> 00:10:59.399 align:start position:0%
this was a funny issue I don't see an
 
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
problem on the local level or at the
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
state level of uh a private road being
 
00:11:05.629 --> 00:11:05.639 align:start position:0%
allowed the same rights as one that's on
 
00:11:07.629 --> 00:11:07.639 align:start position:0%
a public Highway a lot of times what
 
00:11:09.069 --> 00:11:09.079 align:start position:0%
happens is the individuals that own the
 
00:11:10.509 --> 00:11:10.519 align:start position:0%
parcels along those private roads
 
00:11:12.590 --> 00:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
typically have an HOA developed or they
 
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
have deed um they have incumbrances on
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
the deed that say what they need to do
 
00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
to maintain that um and I don't think
 
00:11:20.509 --> 00:11:20.519 align:start position:0%
there's a problem with allowing people
 
00:11:22.110 --> 00:11:22.120 align:start position:0%
to choose how they want to maintain that
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
road um it it's a difference it's a
 
00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
different kind of property but very
 
00:11:30.629 --> 00:11:30.639 align:start position:0%
rarely do you see uh um larger issues I
 
00:11:31.910 --> 00:11:31.920 align:start position:0%
think there's issues all across the
 
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:33.240 align:start position:0%
place but I don't think it's just
 
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:34.720 align:start position:0%
specific to private
 
00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
roads represent paage thank you
 
00:11:41.430 --> 00:11:41.440 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying
 
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
to I don't feel particularly strongly
 
00:11:45.550 --> 00:11:45.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill one way or another and I
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
think many of us um feel the same way I
 
00:11:50.829 --> 00:11:50.839 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that we are
 
00:11:52.990 --> 00:11:53.000 align:start position:0%
understanding the sponsor's intent and I
 
00:11:57.710 --> 00:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
think the the the amendment that Paul
 
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:00.720 align:start position:0%
alfano supplied to us as some as a
 
00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.829 align:start position:0%
alfano supplied to us as some as a
potential

00:12:01.829 --> 00:12:01.839 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean I feel like it it
 
00:12:05.629 --> 00:12:05.639 align:start position:0%
really changes the intent of the bill
 
00:12:08.269 --> 00:12:08.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we should not consider it
 
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:11.800 align:start position:0%
but you know the bill basically cuts out
 
00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
this review and comment by the planning
 
00:12:16.710 --> 00:12:16.720 align:start position:0%
board piece right and
 
00:12:19.790 --> 00:12:19.800 align:start position:0%
um and this am this amendment would
 
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
leave that part intact so I'm not I
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
don't feel strongly about it one way or
 
00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:25.880 align:start position:0%
another but I just want to make sure
 
00:12:27.750 --> 00:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
that we are recognizing what the sponsor
 
00:12:29.710 --> 00:12:29.720 align:start position:0%
intended to do with the bill
 
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:31.880 align:start position:0%
because I think that alfano amendment is
 
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.509 align:start position:0%
because I think that alfano amendment is
something

00:12:33.509 --> 00:12:33.519 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:12:35.949 --> 00:12:35.959 align:start position:0%
different um representative
 
00:12:35.959 --> 00:12:37.590 align:start position:0%
different um representative
Axton

00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
Axton
 
00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
so I have a property very very similar
 
00:12:43.949 --> 00:12:43.959 align:start position:0%
to what uh representative Howen
 
00:12:47.269 --> 00:12:47.279 align:start position:0%
described it's on a 50 or 60 year old
 
00:12:51.629 --> 00:12:51.639 align:start position:0%
private road and we get a bill and you
 
00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
can pay it not pay it whatever floats
 
00:12:58.230 --> 00:12:58.240 align:start position:0%
your boat and in the spring they we we
 
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
have a gate and they CL the road there
 
00:13:03.670 --> 00:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
are probably a dozen houses on the road
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
it's a very nice little
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
Community my there are one or two
 
00:13:12.910 --> 00:13:12.920 align:start position:0%
building Lots there so my concern this
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
is in the let let us do no harm in the
 
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:18.040 align:start position:0%
attempt to do good category my my
 
00:13:19.829 --> 00:13:19.839 align:start position:0%
concerns are I don't feel particularly
 
00:13:24.470 --> 00:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
badly about the bill but I think uh my
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
concern would be in in my
 
00:13:31.590 --> 00:13:31.600 align:start position:0%
case the if if I went to pull a building
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
permit to build on the lot adjacent to
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
me uh the town of Fitz William would
 
00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
likely issue it subject to the
 
00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:43.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate wetlands and septic designs
 
00:13:45.069 --> 00:13:45.079 align:start position:0%
but it would never go to the planning
 
00:13:48.310 --> 00:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
board because it's a it's a existing lot
 
00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:49.389 align:start position:0%
board because it's a it's a existing lot
of

00:13:49.389 --> 00:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
record uh there is one next to my house
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
and so my concern is that we're if I
 
00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
read this correctly we're now almost
 
00:14:00.189 --> 00:14:00.199 align:start position:0%
required ing that everything go to the
 
00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:02.880 align:start position:0%
planning board and I I don't know and I
 
00:14:05.790 --> 00:14:05.800 align:start position:0%
can tell you for a fact that uh in the
 
00:14:09.749 --> 00:14:09.759 align:start position:0%
case of my road it's not suitable for
 
00:14:11.710 --> 00:14:11.720 align:start position:0%
turning a firet truck around
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
in uh it's quite quite the effort to get
 
00:14:17.150 --> 00:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
a firetruck down there back it up it's a
 
00:14:19.189 --> 00:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
like a 18-point turn when you get to the
 
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:22.600 align:start position:0%
end of it so uh because when you get to
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
the end there's there's a guy has a
 
00:14:26.189 --> 00:14:26.199 align:start position:0%
tennis court there it's a lovely house
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
but so my concern is that we are able to
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
exclude this from at least from existing
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
private roads that would be an issue a
 
00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
concern um I was yeah I miss Burns
 
00:14:41.870 --> 00:14:41.880 align:start position:0%
you're in the room hello do you mind
 
00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:44.920 align:start position:0%
coming up and um talking with us briefly
 
00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.350 align:start position:0%
coming up and um talking with us briefly
about

00:14:50.350 --> 00:14:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
this can you remind me of nh's position
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
I believe you had recommended changes to
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
this yes we were actually in support um
 
00:15:01.509 --> 00:15:01.519 align:start position:0%
of House Bill 296 we had the recommended
 
00:15:03.189 --> 00:15:03.199 align:start position:0%
grammatical change which you've already
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
noted um I was not able to stay for
 
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:09.519 align:start position:0%
attorney Alfano's uh testimony so I
 
00:15:11.910 --> 00:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
haven't seen the language that he
 
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
suggested I we are generally in support
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
because we think it gives another option
 
00:15:21.150 --> 00:15:21.160 align:start position:0%
another way for uh towns to approve
 
00:15:23.910 --> 00:15:23.920 align:start position:0%
building on uh private RADS right right
 
00:15:26.350 --> 00:15:26.360 align:start position:0%
now as you've noted it's after review
 
00:15:28.509 --> 00:15:28.519 align:start position:0%
and comment by the planning board uh but
 
00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
approved by the governing body so this
 
00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:32.040 align:start position:0%
would give them an option to actually
 
00:15:35.069 --> 00:15:35.079 align:start position:0%
set a governing body policy and it could
 
00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
go directly through the governing body
 
00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:38.319 align:start position:0%
rather through the standard review and
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
comment by the planning board and then
 
00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:42.040 align:start position:0%
approval by the governing body so in
 
00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:43.880 align:start position:0%
that way it creates potential new
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
flexibility that may be positive for a
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
community um I've heard some comments
 
00:15:52.470 --> 00:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
about one of the interesting things
 
00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:55.399 align:start position:0%
about this statute is the question of
 
00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:58.360 align:start position:0%
why the planning board is involved in
 
00:16:01.069 --> 00:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
reviewing building on private roads
 
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:03.920 align:start position:0%
Because unless you have a change of use
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
to a multif family or to a business
 
00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:07.720 align:start position:0%
you're not involving the planning board
 
00:16:09.430 --> 00:16:09.440 align:start position:0%
right the planning board's not involved
 
00:16:11.829 --> 00:16:11.839 align:start position:0%
in approving your your single family you
 
00:16:14.470 --> 00:16:14.480 align:start position:0%
know building the reason that I think
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
the main reason the planning board is in
 
00:16:19.389 --> 00:16:19.399 align:start position:0%
this statute is there's a concept called
 
00:16:22.670 --> 00:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
premature and Scattered development and
 
00:16:24.470 --> 00:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
part of what I think the statute is
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
trying to do is give the planning board
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
the ability to weigh in and say you know
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
know we don't have any homes over in
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
that area and if you put uh that one
 
00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
home on that private road 20 mi away
 
00:16:39.069 --> 00:16:39.079 align:start position:0%
from the next you know bit of
 
00:16:40.829 --> 00:16:40.839 align:start position:0%
civilization we're going to start
 
00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
creating this scattered uh development
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
kind of concept in the town and and
 
00:16:46.910 --> 00:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
that's not uh maybe that's not positive
 
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:48.680 align:start position:0%
for health and safety I I think that's
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
part of the reason the planning board is
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
involved here is to give that comment
 
00:16:56.309 --> 00:16:56.319 align:start position:0%
and they can't Trump the select board
 
00:16:58.230 --> 00:16:58.240 align:start position:0%
they review and comment under the
 
00:17:01.309 --> 00:17:01.319 align:start position:0%
current statute but they can't override
 
00:17:03.389 --> 00:17:03.399 align:start position:0%
the governing body's ability to approve
 
00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:06.319 align:start position:0%
these building permits um but to your
 
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:08.360 align:start position:0%
original question yes we were supportive
 
00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.360 align:start position:0%
we think it's just another mechanism
 
00:17:14.390 --> 00:17:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay and I have a I have a question um I
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
don't remember who this was but there
 
00:17:18.189 --> 00:17:18.199 align:start position:0%
was public testimony um talking about
 
00:17:19.909 --> 00:17:19.919 align:start position:0%
amending this with the same Lang
 
00:17:21.870 --> 00:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
language for class six roads yes I I
 
00:17:24.590 --> 00:17:24.600 align:start position:0%
mentioned that that you might want to uh
 
00:17:26.230 --> 00:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
thank you that you might want to miror
 
00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
the previous paragraph RSA yes correct
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
and that it might make sense to do that
 
00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:34.960 align:start position:0%
they are two different types of roads
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
but the idea is that they are both non
 
00:17:40.510 --> 00:17:40.520 align:start position:0%
municipally maintained roads so they
 
00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
have their own concerns with respect to
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
adding new homes can you talk to me
 
00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:46.640 align:start position:0%
about the what the current law states
 
00:17:49.390 --> 00:17:49.400 align:start position:0%
around Classics roads if that is similar
 
00:17:51.789 --> 00:17:51.799 align:start position:0%
to this one it's almost the same
 
00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:53.720 align:start position:0%
language there might just be I could
 
00:17:56.470 --> 00:17:56.480 align:start position:0%
pull it up on my I I could pull it up
 
00:18:03.710 --> 00:18:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
language but I know you have it there in
 
00:18:15.390 --> 00:18:15.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:19.630 align:start position:0%
 
you

00:18:19.630 --> 00:18:19.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:22.360 align:start position:0%
okay does that yes that helps are there
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
other questions Miss
 
00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:27.960 align:start position:0%
Burns thank you appreciate your help um
 
00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:29.720 align:start position:0%
so how's the commit you feel about
 
00:18:31.710 --> 00:18:31.720 align:start position:0%
making those recommended
 
00:18:35.630 --> 00:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
changes to C1 in the RSA right before
 
00:18:38.710 --> 00:18:38.720 align:start position:0%
adding class six represent Howland so
 
00:18:41.070 --> 00:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
I'm I mean to her Point that's why I put
 
00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.640 align:start position:0%
existing the existing Pro the existing
 
00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
Road you probably already did a
 
00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:47.400 align:start position:0%
subdivision right I mean the
 
00:18:49.870 --> 00:18:49.880 align:start position:0%
theoretically there is a property out
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
there that you could subdivide maybe but
 
00:18:55.870 --> 00:18:55.880 align:start position:0%
the road already exists and to
 
00:18:58.110 --> 00:18:58.120 align:start position:0%
representative dumont's point I I think
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
most plan boards that are sayane when
 
00:19:02.230 --> 00:19:02.240 align:start position:0%
you go into a subdivision regulation
 
00:19:04.669 --> 00:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
you're not it's not like YouTube where
 
00:19:07.830 --> 00:19:07.840 align:start position:0%
they have like this remote cabin out 20
 
00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:09.640 align:start position:0%
miles and there's this winding road that
 
00:19:11.470 --> 00:19:11.480 align:start position:0%
somehow you get out there you really
 
00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:14.440 align:start position:0%
don't want to do that and so I'm hopeful
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
that most planning boards are sane
 
00:19:19.070 --> 00:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
enough not to do that that you really do
 
00:19:20.470 --> 00:19:20.480 align:start position:0%
have have thought through what the road
 
00:19:23.190 --> 00:19:23.200 align:start position:0%
is how it's scattered but unfortunately
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
the existing roads already exist and
 
00:19:27.029 --> 00:19:27.039 align:start position:0%
it's like they the existing Road
 
00:19:28.110 --> 00:19:28.120 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go through the
 
00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:30.720 align:start position:0%
planning board anyway if you have if
 
00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
they've already done the subdivision
 
00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:34.760 align:start position:0%
regulation with it and you're going to
 
00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:36.720 align:start position:0%
get a building permit on that existing
 
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:38.200 align:start position:0%
Private Road you should just be
 
00:19:40.110 --> 00:19:40.120 align:start position:0%
following what the municipality said are
 
00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
the rules it should be pretty
 
00:19:43.830 --> 00:19:43.840 align:start position:0%
streamlined uh again as I said you're
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
probably if it's waterbased which
 
00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of these up on the Lakes
 
00:19:49.870 --> 00:19:49.880 align:start position:0%
Region you're going to be pulling state
 
00:19:52.149 --> 00:19:52.159 align:start position:0%
permits for the septic and the shoreline
 
00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:54.280 align:start position:0%
permit for sure you know when you look
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
at it as a state permit so I just think
 
00:19:59.149 --> 00:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
they're a separate animal and and
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a cautionary tale about it
 
00:20:02.830 --> 00:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
because while our road has been really
 
00:20:05.830 --> 00:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
wellmaintained across the way they are
 
00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:07.640 align:start position:0%
fighting about it they definitely need
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
to do some drainage and probably put in
 
00:20:10.549 --> 00:20:10.559 align:start position:0%
a culvert and they don't want to spend
 
00:20:13.390 --> 00:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
the money in the road you could get an
 
00:20:15.990 --> 00:20:16.000 align:start position:0%
emergency vehicle in there a car is a
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
little hairy but to your point our road
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
is the same way in the winter time to
 
00:20:22.110 --> 00:20:22.120 align:start position:0%
get there with a fire truck you're going
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
to have I think you're probably going to
 
00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:26.000 align:start position:0%
have to have DPW comeing with a plow
 
00:20:28.350 --> 00:20:28.360 align:start position:0%
truck first and salt it and then get
 
00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:30.400 align:start position:0%
your fire truck in there and even when
 
00:20:31.950 --> 00:20:31.960 align:start position:0%
you got the fire truck in there there's
 
00:20:34.590 --> 00:20:34.600 align:start position:0%
nowhere to pump you they chop a hole in
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
the lake maybe and I try to pump by
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
which time your house will have already
 
00:20:44.789 --> 00:20:44.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
point okay so where we at with
 
00:20:52.270 --> 00:20:52.280 align:start position:0%
this representative
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
Dumont I think for existing Lots this
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
would satisfy that but I guess the issue
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
that I that I think is more more
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
important is a lot of times
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities currently don't want to
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
take over New Roads that are created and
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
when they don't want to take over New
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
Roads that are created that creates
 
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.200 align:start position:0%
private roads and most subdivision or
 
00:21:10.950 --> 00:21:10.960 align:start position:0%
ordinances that are that are written
 
00:21:13.230 --> 00:21:13.240 align:start position:0%
don't acknowledge private roads as legal
 
00:21:15.070 --> 00:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
Frontage and I think that this bill
 
00:21:16.510 --> 00:21:16.520 align:start position:0%
could fix two issues I think it could
 
00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
fix that issue as well as acknowledging
 
00:21:21.310 --> 00:21:21.320 align:start position:0%
Frontage on private roads for for uh new
 
00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:23.240 align:start position:0%
subdivisions to be to be
 
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:30.909 --> 00:21:30.919 align:start position:0%
representative acent do you have
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
something well I I mean I don't think
 
00:21:36.909 --> 00:21:36.919 align:start position:0%
any of this is mutually exclusive I
 
00:21:38.990 --> 00:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
think you're fixing you can fix the one
 
00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
problem I think you need to we need to
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
reward just a little bit put existing
 
00:21:46.870 --> 00:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
Road in there and leave that out it's a
 
00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:49.400 align:start position:0%
interesting the the description of the
 
00:21:53.110 --> 00:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
various issues that in in in the towns
 
00:21:56.269 --> 00:21:56.279 align:start position:0%
that I represent I could I can give a
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
handful of examples of a house literally
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
a mile down a Class 6 Road 3,000 ft off
 
00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:07.559 align:start position:0%
of the class 6 Road and so these things
 
00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:09.360 align:start position:0%
are out there and I think it's important
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
to leave the and if it burns it burns
 
00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:17.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.789 --> 00:22:20.799 align:start position:0%
it okay so um in my position of
 
00:22:22.190 --> 00:22:22.200 align:start position:0%
Delegation as chair I'm going to
 
00:22:23.510 --> 00:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
delegate representative Dumont and
 
00:22:25.789 --> 00:22:25.799 align:start position:0%
Howland to work out an amendment and
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
come back to us if that works all right
 
00:22:32.549 --> 00:22:32.559 align:start position:0%
right great okay let's move on to HB
 
00:22:35.230 --> 00:22:35.240 align:start position:0%
382 um that is one that is near and dear
 
00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:36.720 align:start position:0%
to my heart but I want to know how the
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
committee feels about this that's
 
00:22:39.909 --> 00:22:39.919 align:start position:0%
removing the Authority for
 
00:22:41.390 --> 00:22:41.400 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate mandatory
 
00:22:45.029 --> 00:22:45.039 align:start position:0%
on-site parking requirements um where's
 
00:22:46.269 --> 00:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
everybody at with that representative
 
00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:47.480 align:start position:0%
howand I'm actually gonna call on you
 
00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960 align:start position:0%
first because you have an
 
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
amendment um so I uh I did amend it and
 
00:22:55.789 --> 00:22:55.799 align:start position:0%
I think I passed all my amendments
 
00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
around there I tried to T tried to
 
00:23:00.430 --> 00:23:00.440 align:start position:0%
simplify it I'm not trying to be onerous
 
00:23:01.510 --> 00:23:01.520 align:start position:0%
as a
 
00:23:04.029 --> 00:23:04.039 align:start position:0%
municipality doing requiring so much
 
00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
parking that you can't build anything I
 
00:23:08.710 --> 00:23:08.720 align:start position:0%
think the idea that municipalities don't
 
00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
have a good idea about what's going on
 
00:23:12.630 --> 00:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
with parking is definitely not true in
 
00:23:15.510 --> 00:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
my six years on the Town Council parking
 
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
probably was the biggest issue I ever
 
00:23:20.710 --> 00:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
talked about um so I tried to simplify
 
00:23:22.789 --> 00:23:22.799 align:start position:0%
and say you only needed under the
 
00:23:24.909 --> 00:23:24.919 align:start position:0%
statute the first part of it dealt with
 
00:23:28.990 --> 00:23:29.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing the uh the uh I think
 
00:23:32.230 --> 00:23:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's a studio and one bedroom and I cut
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
the requirement down to just one uh
 
00:23:38.669 --> 00:23:38.679 align:start position:0%
parking spot per per unit there and then
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
the second part dealt with
 
00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:43.200 align:start position:0%
multifam uh initially they said the
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
multif family requirement was 10 units I
 
00:23:48.669 --> 00:23:48.679 align:start position:0%
cut it down to five five is kind of a
 
00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
more natural Breaking Point with multif
 
00:23:52.950 --> 00:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
family the financing from four to five
 
00:23:55.750 --> 00:23:55.760 align:start position:0%
changes and a lot of Regulation changes
 
00:23:57.950 --> 00:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
and with that I also said you only need
 
00:24:01.230 --> 00:24:01.240 align:start position:0%
one space per unit in that five unit or
 
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
more development and then I said the
 
00:24:05.830 --> 00:24:05.840 align:start position:0%
next thing is that you can if you do
 
00:24:08.230 --> 00:24:08.240 align:start position:0%
off-site parking that can meet all your
 
00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
parking requirement the only reason I
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
really wanted that in there is um in in
 
00:24:16.950 --> 00:24:16.960 align:start position:0%
our case particularly in our downtown
 
00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:20.240 align:start position:0%
area uh you're subject to the ms4 permit
 
00:24:22.190 --> 00:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
that you get which is completely
 
00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:25.720 align:start position:0%
non-negotiable uh and for us uh when you
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
have all those impervious surfaces down
 
00:24:30.269 --> 00:24:30.279 align:start position:0%
there it becomes a it's just
 
00:24:32.909 --> 00:24:32.919 align:start position:0%
economically unfeasible for
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
redevelopment of a building to make them
 
00:24:38.310 --> 00:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
do the on-site and so we definitely want
 
00:24:41.789 --> 00:24:41.799 align:start position:0%
to do offsite but the offsite may
 
00:24:43.870 --> 00:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
actually in our case be structured
 
00:24:46.149 --> 00:24:46.159 align:start position:0%
parking and so in that case we just want
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
to have the municipality just wants the
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
ability to negotiate with our
 
00:24:54.149 --> 00:24:54.159 align:start position:0%
developers uh that we may do onsite we
 
00:24:56.510 --> 00:24:56.520 align:start position:0%
probably may want to think about a tiff
 
00:24:58.750 --> 00:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
and use the raised assessment kind of
 
00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:00.880 align:start position:0%
pay for it along with par with uh with
 
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:02.960 align:start position:0%
parking fees and so this would
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
facilitate I think that those
 
00:25:08.029 --> 00:25:08.039 align:start position:0%
conversation it doesn't put an onerous
 
00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
requirement on the developer but it also
 
00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
allows us to have a seat at the table to
 
00:25:15.310 --> 00:25:15.320 align:start position:0%
negotiate and so I made the changes in
 
00:25:16.669 --> 00:25:16.679 align:start position:0%
how much you required and then the
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
effective date I pushed over to
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
2026 the only reason I did that is
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
because right now if you're in SP2 town
 
00:25:25.510 --> 00:25:25.520 align:start position:0%
or you do your town meeting you don't
 
00:25:28.350 --> 00:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
have any ability to react and so this
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
this would give you time theoretically
 
00:25:34.029 --> 00:25:34.039 align:start position:0%
to put a warrant on uh I would suggest
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
that your municipality maybe looks at
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
what off-site parking would look like if
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
you need a tiff if you're going to do
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
parking impact fees what that would look
 
00:25:44.990 --> 00:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
like and it would give you time to react
 
00:25:46.750 --> 00:25:46.760 align:start position:0%
to the ordinance so that that that was
 
00:25:49.470 --> 00:25:49.480 align:start position:0%
my thoughts so um with regards to
 
00:25:50.789 --> 00:25:50.799 align:start position:0%
pushing the effective date out what
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
happens when a municipality does not
 
00:25:54.710 --> 00:25:54.720 align:start position:0%
vote for the change it it it is what it
 
00:25:57.630 --> 00:25:57.640 align:start position:0%
is right yeah yeah I'm just trying to
 
00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:58.760 align:start position:0%
give them
 
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
I think honestly uh besides the parking
 
00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:03.720 align:start position:0%
I really want you to look at financing
 
00:26:05.149 --> 00:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
and your planning department to kind of
 
00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
look at the development because it's not
 
00:26:08.190 --> 00:26:08.200 align:start position:0%
a mystery you probably are trying to
 
00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.120 align:start position:0%
figure out particularly if you're doing
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
structured parking which is brutally
 
00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:14.000 align:start position:0%
expensive how are you going to pay for
 
00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
it and I mean the idea really for the
 
00:26:18.590 --> 00:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
mun the idea that the municipality
 
00:26:20.830 --> 00:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't want development I hope is wrong
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
I mean we're really looking to maximize
 
00:26:24.710 --> 00:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
the value of the land so that when we
 
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:26.960 align:start position:0%
tax you we can kind of stabilize your
 
00:26:29.470 --> 00:26:29.480 align:start position:0%
your property tax rates so this is just
 
00:26:33.029 --> 00:26:33.039 align:start position:0%
a negotiating uh point I think so to
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
give you a little history on parking um
 
00:26:37.909 --> 00:26:37.919 align:start position:0%
last year the special committee on
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
housing had a bill relative to parking
 
00:26:43.830 --> 00:26:43.840 align:start position:0%
it was solely for residential but it
 
00:26:46.269 --> 00:26:46.279 align:start position:0%
would only allow one parking space per
 
00:26:49.149 --> 00:26:49.159 align:start position:0%
unit and it did not dis it did not have
 
00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
any more stipulations other than that
 
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
and that was passed out of the committee
 
00:26:54.549 --> 00:26:54.559 align:start position:0%
and actually went through the house on
 
00:26:57.070 --> 00:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
consent and then the Senate amended it
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
and added squatting and other other
 
00:27:02.830 --> 00:27:02.840 align:start position:0%
things onto the bill to be more creative
 
00:27:08.110 --> 00:27:08.120 align:start position:0%
um so the the area that was affected was
 
00:27:11.830 --> 00:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about um 674 67416
 
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:13.600 align:start position:0%
Senator Bradley was really interested in
 
00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
adding um Workforce housing and and
 
00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:20.360 align:start position:0%
other stuff to it I I personally think
 
00:27:22.669 --> 00:27:22.679 align:start position:0%
it muddies it up when we start
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
defining what uh what H what housing you
 
00:27:28.350 --> 00:27:28.360 align:start position:0%
can regulate parking in how many spaces
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
like I'd like at least consistency make
 
00:27:32.029 --> 00:27:32.039 align:start position:0%
it more clear I think the bill has
 
00:27:34.389 --> 00:27:34.399 align:start position:0%
drafted makes it clear but I know that
 
00:27:37.029 --> 00:27:37.039 align:start position:0%
um we might not be unanimous so I want
 
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:39.640 align:start position:0%
to know if there's like where we can
 
00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
move on it to get to a point I hate to
 
00:27:44.029 --> 00:27:44.039 align:start position:0%
word Smith but I was GNA say I like your
 
00:27:46.830 --> 00:27:46.840 align:start position:0%
wording better just one space per unit
 
00:27:49.190 --> 00:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
and you can use offsite to offset it I
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
think it's important to have the offsite
 
00:27:53.350 --> 00:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
being able to offset it just because in
 
00:27:56.950 --> 00:27:56.960 align:start position:0%
the situations I talked about if you
 
00:27:59.430 --> 00:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
have an MS four permit that's not
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
letting you do that makes it unviable
 
00:28:03.549 --> 00:28:03.559 align:start position:0%
for that developer you want them to be
 
00:28:06.430 --> 00:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
able to use offsite to to to do that
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
even again one spot per unit does sound
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
like a little but if you can't add any
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
impervious surface to it you really want
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
offsite so I think that's an important
 
00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
component so what about what about the
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
language of
 
00:28:22.909 --> 00:28:22.919 align:start position:0%
one spot per unit unless the developer
 
00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:25.480 align:start position:0%
can prove there's off-site parking
 
00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:29.789 align:start position:0%
can prove there's off-site parking
available

00:28:29.789 --> 00:28:29.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.799 --> 00:28:31.710 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:31.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:28:34.470 --> 00:28:34.480 align:start position:0%
Gibbs with reference to the provision on
 
00:28:37.710 --> 00:28:37.720 align:start position:0%
work Workforce housing um your Amendment
 
00:28:41.149 --> 00:28:41.159 align:start position:0%
provides one space per unit for studio
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
and one bedroom apartments why not just
 
00:28:48.549 --> 00:28:48.559 align:start position:0%
um make it clear or or I think simpler
 
00:28:51.549 --> 00:28:51.559 align:start position:0%
that one space per unit without limiting
 
00:28:53.470 --> 00:28:53.480 align:start position:0%
that to studio and one-bedroom
 
00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:55.360 align:start position:0%
apartments this a question I guess for
 
00:28:58.230 --> 00:28:58.240 align:start position:0%
representative Howen I think that's bad
 
00:28:59.630 --> 00:28:59.640 align:start position:0%
I noticed that too cuz what if you have
 
00:29:01.830 --> 00:29:01.840 align:start position:0%
a two-bedroom apartment and also by the
 
00:29:03.710 --> 00:29:03.720 align:start position:0%
way I left a hole there I said multif
 
00:29:05.230 --> 00:29:05.240 align:start position:0%
family is five what if you have a
 
00:29:08.029 --> 00:29:08.039 align:start position:0%
fourplex so the the one unit is that's
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
definitely much cleaner language one per
 
00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
unit makes a one per unit and then allow
 
00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:14.840 align:start position:0%
however you want to say offsite can can
 
00:29:17.830 --> 00:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
so just one per unit not specifying what
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
size yeah thank you representative
 
00:29:22.230 --> 00:29:22.240 align:start position:0%
Dumont and then representative Aaron
 
00:29:23.830 --> 00:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
does anybody see a problem with how
 
00:29:25.269 --> 00:29:25.279 align:start position:0%
local municipalities will interpret
 
00:29:27.549 --> 00:29:27.559 align:start position:0%
offsite I see there being a bunch
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
there's just a see that creating a lot
 
00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:31.000 align:start position:0%
of issues because some developer may
 
00:29:32.750 --> 00:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
think that a couple blocks down the road
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
is is is satisfying that need while
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
other municipalities are going to tell
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
you that it has to be a direct abutting
 
00:29:38.950 --> 00:29:38.960 align:start position:0%
property I think it's just going to
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
create a a problem of people
 
00:29:43.470 --> 00:29:43.480 align:start position:0%
understanding what the intent here was I
 
00:29:45.310 --> 00:29:45.320 align:start position:0%
truly believe that less is more with
 
00:29:48.549 --> 00:29:48.559 align:start position:0%
this um I get it and I and I and I would
 
00:29:50.149 --> 00:29:50.159 align:start position:0%
agree here I think it's a simple thing
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
but when it gets to the local level
 
00:29:52.669 --> 00:29:52.679 align:start position:0%
there's going to be
 
00:29:55.990 --> 00:29:56.000 align:start position:0%
problems represent Aon uh I'm very much
 
00:29:58.070 --> 00:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
in favor of this amendment uh
 
00:30:01.590 --> 00:30:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative Howland put forth because
 
00:30:05.909 --> 00:30:05.919 align:start position:0%
it at least has some parking requirement
 
00:30:09.389 --> 00:30:09.399 align:start position:0%
uh because my fear is that when you take
 
00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:11.240 align:start position:0%
away the parking requirement then
 
00:30:12.430 --> 00:30:12.440 align:start position:0%
they're just not going to put any
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
parking in and you'll have parking all
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
over the street uh and just create a
 
00:30:21.149 --> 00:30:21.159 align:start position:0%
mess so this is great and the details no
 
00:30:23.230 --> 00:30:23.240 align:start position:0%
problem okay represent Daxton and then
 
00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.269 align:start position:0%
problem okay represent Daxton and then
represent

00:30:24.269 --> 00:30:24.279 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:30:28.750 --> 00:30:28.760 align:start position:0%
buo uh I like the idea of the simpler
 
00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:30.200 align:start position:0%
the better it's going to be less
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
confusing for planning
 
00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
boards uh I generally am supportive of
 
00:30:37.830 --> 00:30:37.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of offsite parking but in my
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
experience that in my part of the world
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
where we have had
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
larger uh
 
00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
developments they have accept the
 
00:30:48.509 --> 00:30:48.519 align:start position:0%
planning boards have all accepted
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
off-site parking so you know maybe this
 
00:30:53.509 --> 00:30:53.519 align:start position:0%
is a problem I'm not aware of nobody had
 
00:30:56.269 --> 00:30:56.279 align:start position:0%
to Define it they just said we didn't
 
00:30:58.470 --> 00:30:58.480 align:start position:0%
have any rules and and and can see your
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
point coming over here to conquered so
 
00:31:01.950 --> 00:31:01.960 align:start position:0%
if you say we have off-site parking as
 
00:31:04.990 --> 00:31:05.000 align:start position:0%
members over at stores that kind of
 
00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:07.440 align:start position:0%
might be a stretch if you're developing
 
00:31:09.350 --> 00:31:09.360 align:start position:0%
a 4unit apartment building it's six
 
00:31:12.549 --> 00:31:12.559 align:start position:0%
blocks away so uh but I think less is
 
00:31:14.350 --> 00:31:14.360 align:start position:0%
more and I think the planning boards
 
00:31:16.029 --> 00:31:16.039 align:start position:0%
have some level of competence in
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
judgment I don't think you need to
 
00:31:22.110 --> 00:31:22.120 align:start position:0%
micromanage it represent buo yes thank
 
00:31:25.350 --> 00:31:25.360 align:start position:0%
you um so may maybe I I missed something
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
because um you know now now that there's
 
00:31:30.870 --> 00:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
this this amendment I I was honestly
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
very much in favor of the bill as it was
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
originally drafted and I mean you know
 
00:31:40.430 --> 00:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest with you uh you know
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
I I I really think that you know we're
 
00:31:44.509 --> 00:31:44.519 align:start position:0%
we're fretting about H is there not
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
going to be enough parking in New
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when the fact is as we already
 
00:31:49.669 --> 00:31:49.679 align:start position:0%
know it's a fact there is not enough
 
00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
housing in New Hampshire and the fact
 
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:53.480 align:start position:0%
that oh developer won't build enough
 
00:31:55.230 --> 00:31:55.240 align:start position:0%
parking I mean the developer has an
 
00:31:57.310 --> 00:31:57.320 align:start position:0%
incentive to build something that people
 
00:31:59.310 --> 00:31:59.320 align:start position:0%
want to live in and I mean I think that
 
00:32:00.710 --> 00:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
we don't need to pass a law to remind
 
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:02.440 align:start position:0%
people to breathe people will do it on
 
00:32:04.269 --> 00:32:04.279 align:start position:0%
their own I don't think we need to pass
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
a law saying well you know we need this
 
00:32:08.269 --> 00:32:08.279 align:start position:0%
minimum amount of parking maybe there
 
00:32:11.190 --> 00:32:11.200 align:start position:0%
are neighborhoods where infill is a
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
really really good idea maybe there are
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
already historic walkable neighborhoods
 
00:32:17.549 --> 00:32:17.559 align:start position:0%
to where shoehorning in a bunch of
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
parking is frankly not necessary so I
 
00:32:22.070 --> 00:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
think that given the fact where we are
 
00:32:24.350 --> 00:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
in the housing crisis I actually would
 
00:32:27.110 --> 00:32:27.120 align:start position:0%
favor the original unamended bill and if
 
00:32:29.909 --> 00:32:29.919 align:start position:0%
it becomes a we can walk it back later
 
00:32:31.990 --> 00:32:32.000 align:start position:0%
but I say let's let people build the
 
00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:34.440 align:start position:0%
housing that people want to buy first
 
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:35.549 align:start position:0%
housing that people want to buy first
represent

00:32:35.549 --> 00:32:35.559 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.360 align:start position:0%
miles thank you Mr chairman um I
 
00:32:41.269 --> 00:32:41.279 align:start position:0%
actually I Echo your comments Mr uh
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
representative buer um I think less is
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
more I was also very happy with the
 
00:32:49.629 --> 00:32:49.639 align:start position:0%
original bill and I
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
think I
 
00:32:55.590 --> 00:32:55.600 align:start position:0%
sorry respectfully I do think this
 
00:32:58.350 --> 00:32:58.360 align:start position:0%
muddies up the water and puts in puts
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
puts regulations back in where we as a
 
00:33:05.190 --> 00:33:05.200 align:start position:0%
committee our goal and what we promised
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
people was less regulations more freedom
 
00:33:11.509 --> 00:33:11.519 align:start position:0%
to build and I think the original bill
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
was was okay as it was so let let me um
 
00:33:18.549 --> 00:33:18.559 align:start position:0%
do it like an informal straw
 
00:33:22.470 --> 00:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
poll um my first question is going to be
 
00:33:24.549 --> 00:33:24.559 align:start position:0%
who is in favor of the bill
 
00:33:27.269 --> 00:33:27.279 align:start position:0%
unamended and then my next question is
 
00:33:30.750 --> 00:33:30.760 align:start position:0%
who would like to see the one space per
 
00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.350 align:start position:0%
who would like to see the one space per
unit

00:33:32.350 --> 00:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:33:35.629 --> 00:33:35.639 align:start position:0%
language representative Dumont one final
 
00:33:37.629 --> 00:33:37.639 align:start position:0%
question for you before that it's my
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this that it would
 
00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
affect parking regulations for all uses
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
not just residential commercial and
 
00:33:44.430 --> 00:33:44.440 align:start position:0%
residential yes so that not multif
 
00:33:46.070 --> 00:33:46.080 align:start position:0%
family commercial but a site plan for a
 
00:33:48.230 --> 00:33:48.240 align:start position:0%
strip mall or things of that nature yes
 
00:33:50.590 --> 00:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
so um what would need to happen is we
 
00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.590 align:start position:0%
so um what would need to happen is we
would

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:33:54.710 --> 00:33:54.720 align:start position:0%
do on the original
 
00:33:58.350 --> 00:33:58.360 align:start position:0%
Bill lines 9 through 20 we would amend
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
it to add the one space per unit and
 
00:34:03.470 --> 00:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
then after that we would keep the new
 
00:34:05.509 --> 00:34:05.519 align:start position:0%
section regarding commercial
 
00:34:08.550 --> 00:34:08.560 align:start position:0%
use as
 
00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
is representative
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um originally I
 
00:34:18.190 --> 00:34:18.200 align:start position:0%
supported the bill as written I didn't
 
00:34:20.389 --> 00:34:20.399 align:start position:0%
think it was necessary to require
 
00:34:23.470 --> 00:34:23.480 align:start position:0%
parking I figured Builders would build
 
00:34:26.069 --> 00:34:26.079 align:start position:0%
um what people were willing to live in
 
00:34:28.190 --> 00:34:28.200 align:start position:0%
and if people insisted on parking then
 
00:34:32.349 --> 00:34:32.359 align:start position:0%
they would build parking um but um after
 
00:34:34.230 --> 00:34:34.240 align:start position:0%
some private discussions particularly
 
00:34:37.190 --> 00:34:37.200 align:start position:0%
with representative Howland um on the
 
00:34:39.669 --> 00:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
difficulties that this might create um
 
00:34:39.679 --> 00:34:40.790 align:start position:0%
difficulties that this might create um
for

00:34:40.790 --> 00:34:40.800 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:34:44.589 --> 00:34:44.599 align:start position:0%
municipalities um I was willing to go
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
with um the um uh essentially with the
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
amendment that uh representative Helen
 
00:34:54.430 --> 00:34:54.440 align:start position:0%
proposed but learning Mak it just one
 
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
space per unit not making it more
 
00:34:58.910 --> 00:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
complicated um because if it was really
 
00:35:00.510 --> 00:35:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to cause problems for the
 
00:35:02.430 --> 00:35:02.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities that's not we want what
 
00:35:04.950 --> 00:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
we want to do
 
00:35:09.069 --> 00:35:09.079 align:start position:0%
either Howen so I after hearing my wiser
 
00:35:10.630 --> 00:35:10.640 align:start position:0%
planning board people talk about the
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
offsite they're they're they're right I
 
00:35:14.349 --> 00:35:14.359 align:start position:0%
mean the municipality is going to do
 
00:35:15.630 --> 00:35:15.640 align:start position:0%
while the planning board and then
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually up to whatever your local
 
00:35:19.230 --> 00:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
governing body is going to do that
 
00:35:21.390 --> 00:35:21.400 align:start position:0%
anyway I think with commercial or
 
00:35:23.109 --> 00:35:23.119 align:start position:0%
anything like that you're going to when
 
00:35:24.510 --> 00:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
you're looking at it how do you best
 
00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:27.800 align:start position:0%
work it so they I mean doing the Tiff
 
00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:29.960 align:start position:0%
all that is a separate issue and I agree
 
00:35:32.270 --> 00:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
if I muddy the waters and talk about up
 
00:35:34.470 --> 00:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
offsite then we're going to be how far
 
00:35:37.390 --> 00:35:37.400 align:start position:0%
budding the one space is just cleaner
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
with okay so
 
00:35:49.990 --> 00:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
um let me do a show of hands who's in
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill unamended raise your
 
00:35:58.510 --> 00:35:58.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:01.349 --> 00:36:01.359 align:start position:0%
okay who's in favor of um some sort of
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
language that would change lines 11
 
00:36:07.470 --> 00:36:07.480 align:start position:0%
through 20
 
00:36:11.069 --> 00:36:11.079 align:start position:0%
to um allow up to one space per
 
00:36:14.750 --> 00:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
unit and keeping the same keeping the
 
00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
language for the
 
00:36:21.750 --> 00:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:24.190 --> 00:36:24.200 align:start position:0%
hand who would vote for the bill as
 
00:36:26.910 --> 00:36:26.920 align:start position:0%
amended if this language is in there
 
00:36:30.069 --> 00:36:30.079 align:start position:0%
even if they don't necessarily like the
 
00:36:32.510 --> 00:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
language I think I know I think I know
 
00:36:35.230 --> 00:36:35.240 align:start position:0%
okay see that's see I no I I was
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
directing right at represent buolo so
 
00:36:40.270 --> 00:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
okay all right so I think so I think
 
00:36:43.150 --> 00:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
we're um at relative agreement so I'm G
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
to confir with representative Paige and
 
00:36:47.230 --> 00:36:47.240 align:start position:0%
probably get an amendment drafted um for
 
00:36:54.109 --> 00:36:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:59.910 --> 00:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
okay all right next up is um HB
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
577 my firstborn
 
00:37:08.510 --> 00:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
child um so I
 
00:37:14.589 --> 00:37:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
organized okay so I handed around um HP
 
00:37:21.550 --> 00:37:21.560 align:start position:0%
577 recommended edits so I'm just going
 
00:37:24.230 --> 00:37:24.240 align:start position:0%
to run through these real
 
00:37:29.710 --> 00:37:29.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:31.430 --> 00:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
this was b a lot of this was based on
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
testimony during the public hearing um
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
number one would amend lines um 15 to 17
 
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:41.880 align:start position:0%
that would um municipality adopt a
 
00:37:43.790 --> 00:37:43.800 align:start position:0%
zoning ordance pursuant to the authority
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
granted this chapter shall allow adus uh
 
00:37:50.910 --> 00:37:50.920 align:start position:0%
that permits single family dwelling
 
00:37:54.710 --> 00:37:54.720 align:start position:0%
um it it would basically say in any
 
00:37:57.230 --> 00:37:57.240 align:start position:0%
municipality that does not have zoning
 
00:37:59.950 --> 00:37:59.960 align:start position:0%
we do not need to require them to now
 
00:38:02.109 --> 00:38:02.119 align:start position:0%
create zoning which I do not want to do
 
00:38:04.030 --> 00:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
so the municipal association's looking
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
at me but yeah I don't want that either
 
00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
so um that's what that would do n um the
 
00:38:12.950 --> 00:38:12.960 align:start position:0%
second one is relative to square footage
 
00:38:16.390 --> 00:38:16.400 align:start position:0%
um HP 577 removes the existing language
 
00:38:19.430 --> 00:38:19.440 align:start position:0%
that would um require that a
 
00:38:21.230 --> 00:38:21.240 align:start position:0%
municipality may not restrict Adu to
 
00:38:23.829 --> 00:38:23.839 align:start position:0%
less than 750 square F feet um so this
 
00:38:26.150 --> 00:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
would this language here would just add
 
00:38:28.270 --> 00:38:28.280 align:start position:0%
in um
 
00:38:31.109 --> 00:38:31.119 align:start position:0%
add it back in to allow it to be 750 to
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
950 square
 
00:38:36.550 --> 00:38:36.560 align:start position:0%
feet and then the third component would
 
00:38:38.589 --> 00:38:38.599 align:start position:0%
be relative to short-term rental and I'm
 
00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
open to this but I think there was a
 
00:38:42.990 --> 00:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
conversation around um short-term
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
rentals um I want to give municipalities
 
00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:46.910 align:start position:0%
rentals um I want to give municipalities
the

00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:50.400 align:start position:0%
option um so I think the language that
 
00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.200 align:start position:0%
says nothing in the section prohibits a
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
municipality from regulating short-term
 
00:38:56.550 --> 00:38:56.560 align:start position:0%
rentals of less than 30 days allows them
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
the option um so you know um places like
 
00:39:01.829 --> 00:39:01.839 align:start position:0%
where represented page represents might
 
00:39:04.790 --> 00:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
have a different um utility for this
 
00:39:07.670 --> 00:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
than other areas of the state so um
 
00:39:09.950 --> 00:39:09.960 align:start position:0%
these are these are my proposals but I'm
 
00:39:12.510 --> 00:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
open to the committee's feedback on the
 
00:39:15.270 --> 00:39:15.280 align:start position:0%
language represent gont I just had a
 
00:39:17.390 --> 00:39:17.400 align:start position:0%
question about the square footage I
 
00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
always thought it was a funny thing to
 
00:39:20.470 --> 00:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
throw in there because typically a lot
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
has a building envelope and you can
 
00:39:23.589 --> 00:39:23.599 align:start position:0%
utilize the space that's within that
 
00:39:24.990 --> 00:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
building envelope so why are we trying
 
00:39:27.630 --> 00:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
to limit the size of an Adu if it is is
 
00:39:29.109 --> 00:39:29.119 align:start position:0%
an accessory dwelling you know why do I
 
00:39:32.750 --> 00:39:32.760 align:start position:0%
care how big somebody makes a well I I
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
understand and I support that concept
 
00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:35.640 align:start position:0%
but the
 
00:39:38.950 --> 00:39:38.960 align:start position:0%
but the definition of accessory means
 
00:39:42.190 --> 00:39:42.200 align:start position:0%
that it's like extra like it's like I
 
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:43.640 align:start position:0%
just think it would be weird to build an
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
Adu that's larger than the existing
 
00:39:48.829 --> 00:39:48.839 align:start position:0%
unit so I while I know it's your private
 
00:39:50.589 --> 00:39:50.599 align:start position:0%
property right like I you know I support
 
00:39:52.270 --> 00:39:52.280 align:start position:0%
that but I don't know it seems kind of
 
00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:55.040 align:start position:0%
odd to me but go ahead follow up on that
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't a simpler one just be that the
 
00:39:58.069 --> 00:39:58.079 align:start position:0%
accessory dwelling unit must be smaller
 
00:39:59.150 --> 00:39:59.160 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:40:02.790 --> 00:40:02.800 align:start position:0%
existing okay so if you're or not to
 
00:40:04.510 --> 00:40:04.520 align:start position:0%
exceed the square footage of the
 
00:40:07.470 --> 00:40:07.480 align:start position:0%
existing yeah yeah I said well well wait
 
00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:11.520 align:start position:0%
a okay so if you have a 3,000 foot house
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
and you want to build a 2,950 square
 
00:40:18.109 --> 00:40:18.119 align:start position:0%
foot Adu yeah what do I I mean to to
 
00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:20.680 align:start position:0%
each their own I really what I like
 
00:40:22.030 --> 00:40:22.040 align:start position:0%
versus what somebody else like are two
 
00:40:24.790 --> 00:40:24.800 align:start position:0%
different things I okay
 
00:40:27.630 --> 00:40:27.640 align:start position:0%
great okay represent Howen so believe it
 
00:40:29.109 --> 00:40:29.119 align:start position:0%
or not I actually agree with that I
 
00:40:30.870 --> 00:40:30.880 align:start position:0%
think you that the Adu is just
 
00:40:33.630 --> 00:40:33.640 align:start position:0%
subservient to the main house is fine if
 
00:40:37.030 --> 00:40:37.040 align:start position:0%
you can fit it within all of the your
 
00:40:39.270 --> 00:40:39.280 align:start position:0%
setbacks everything else why not all of
 
00:40:42.150 --> 00:40:42.160 align:start position:0%
the other regulations yeah okay well I I
 
00:40:44.109 --> 00:40:44.119 align:start position:0%
just know how the house is as well and I
 
00:40:46.589 --> 00:40:46.599 align:start position:0%
think this committee while I agree with
 
00:40:48.790 --> 00:40:48.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of what this committee is saying I
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
think that the House of Representatives
 
00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:52.800 align:start position:0%
might have an issue if we were to pass
 
00:40:53.910 --> 00:40:53.920 align:start position:0%
something like that through this
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
committee so that's just my political
 
00:40:57.790 --> 00:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
Acumen coming
 
00:40:59.270 --> 00:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
come in a sense here I don't know if
 
00:41:01.870 --> 00:41:01.880 align:start position:0%
necessarily people would like that very
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
much represent bolo no I mean I
 
00:41:06.270 --> 00:41:06.280 align:start position:0%
definitely I definitely respect the
 
00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:07.720 align:start position:0%
sentiment because you know I'd rather
 
00:41:09.950 --> 00:41:09.960 align:start position:0%
get half of a good thing than you know
 
00:41:12.109 --> 00:41:12.119 align:start position:0%
nothing at all if we're trying to be you
 
00:41:14.710 --> 00:41:14.720 align:start position:0%
know too ambitious but I really do think
 
00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
um and I definitely defer to your
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
political Acumen um but I mean it I
 
00:41:22.190 --> 00:41:22.200 align:start position:0%
think there's a bipartisan consensus
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
that we're in a housing crisis let's
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
send something ambitious and let's see
 
00:41:28.710 --> 00:41:28.720 align:start position:0%
if people are serious about actually
 
00:41:30.069 --> 00:41:30.079 align:start position:0%
addressing it I think something like
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
well it's accessory but it's smaller I
 
00:41:34.069 --> 00:41:34.079 align:start position:0%
think that's conceptually very easy to
 
00:41:35.829 --> 00:41:35.839 align:start position:0%
understand it doesn't over-regulate and
 
00:41:37.589 --> 00:41:37.599 align:start position:0%
it has the potential to actually create
 
00:41:39.550 --> 00:41:39.560 align:start position:0%
even more housing than we were
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
anticipating with this legislation I
 
00:41:43.550 --> 00:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
mean why not why not try
 
00:41:47.430 --> 00:41:47.440 align:start position:0%
it represent Aon if you build an Adu
 
00:41:49.550 --> 00:41:49.560 align:start position:0%
that's bigger than the main house and
 
00:41:52.150 --> 00:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
the main house becomes the
 
00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760 align:start position:0%
Adu and you're still within the
 
00:41:58.349 --> 00:41:58.359 align:start position:0%
regulations so this says Miss Burns can
 
00:42:00.109 --> 00:42:00.119 align:start position:0%
you come up and and talk about maybe
 
00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:07.990 --> 00:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
language I think I'm being the voice of
 
00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:09.349 align:start position:0%
language I think I'm being the voice of
reason

00:42:09.349 --> 00:42:09.359 align:start position:0%
reason
 
00:42:12.069 --> 00:42:12.079 align:start position:0%
here I hope my facial expressions in the
 
00:42:13.670 --> 00:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
back of the room weren't weren't too
 
00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.069 align:start position:0%
back of the room weren't weren't too
excitable

00:42:16.069 --> 00:42:16.079 align:start position:0%
excitable
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
um yes they were um when this bill when
 
00:42:23.309 --> 00:42:23.319 align:start position:0%
the original Adu bill was passed in I
 
00:42:24.349 --> 00:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
00:42:26.829 --> 00:42:26.839 align:start position:0%
2016 we did work very closely with the
 
00:42:28.990 --> 00:42:29.000 align:start position:0%
folks who passed the legislation to make
 
00:42:32.069 --> 00:42:32.079 align:start position:0%
it um you retain some local control
 
00:42:34.230 --> 00:42:34.240 align:start position:0%
ability but also to take to understand
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
that there was this will to have this
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
allowance of of adus on on single family
 
00:42:41.950 --> 00:42:41.960 align:start position:0%
properties we raised the increase in
 
00:42:44.349 --> 00:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
square footage issue in our letter to
 
00:42:46.349 --> 00:42:46.359 align:start position:0%
the committee for the exact reason
 
00:42:48.790 --> 00:42:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's been stated which is the idea
 
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
behind accessory dwelling units is that
 
00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:54.200 align:start position:0%
they be accessory to the main use of the
 
00:42:56.589 --> 00:42:56.599 align:start position:0%
property right and so if the main use of
 
00:42:59.030 --> 00:42:59.040 align:start position:0%
the property is a single family home
 
00:43:00.790 --> 00:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
then their accessor then their accessory
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
to that single family home use and
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
accessory uses are usually usually you
 
00:43:07.990 --> 00:43:08.000 align:start position:0%
know incidental and subordinate are the
 
00:43:10.470 --> 00:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
typical words that you see with respect
 
00:43:13.630 --> 00:43:13.640 align:start position:0%
to what is an accessory use and so there
 
00:43:16.950 --> 00:43:16.960 align:start position:0%
was an agreement on the 750 square foot
 
00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
um would be a reasonable incidental and
 
00:43:21.910 --> 00:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
subordinate uh structure size to the
 
00:43:25.430 --> 00:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
primary single family home use um
 
00:43:28.109 --> 00:43:28.119 align:start position:0%
certainly I understand uh the comments
 
00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:31.240 align:start position:0%
made uh you know wanting to have a an an
 
00:43:33.670 --> 00:43:33.680 align:start position:0%
aggressive uh Bill to send to the house
 
00:43:35.950 --> 00:43:35.960 align:start position:0%
and also the idea that well isn't it
 
00:43:38.390 --> 00:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
just accessory if it's smaller I don't
 
00:43:40.549 --> 00:43:40.559 align:start position:0%
think it's just specifically about it
 
00:43:43.270 --> 00:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
being just a tiny bit smaller than the
 
00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:45.280 align:start position:0%
single family home it's about it being a
 
00:43:47.470 --> 00:43:47.480 align:start position:0%
structure that is in fact not a single
 
00:43:50.190 --> 00:43:50.200 align:start position:0%
family home but is of the same type of
 
00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
use and fits in well with the existing
 
00:43:55.190 --> 00:43:55.200 align:start position:0%
property and the existing structure so
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
you have a smaller structure you as a
 
00:43:59.870 --> 00:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
residential use that is incidental and
 
00:44:02.670 --> 00:44:02.680 align:start position:0%
subordinate is accessory to the primary
 
00:44:05.670 --> 00:44:05.680 align:start position:0%
um home and that is how we settled on uh
 
00:44:08.950 --> 00:44:08.960 align:start position:0%
the 750 square foot all of those years
 
00:44:12.069 --> 00:44:12.079 align:start position:0%
ago I would say that based on what I
 
00:44:15.710 --> 00:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
have heard this morning uh the potential
 
00:44:18.870 --> 00:44:18.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions to amending the bill could
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
possibly even NH May would be willing to
 
00:44:22.630 --> 00:44:22.640 align:start position:0%
work with the committee on those
 
00:44:25.670 --> 00:44:25.680 align:start position:0%
suggestions and possibly even uh be able
 
00:44:28.030 --> 00:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
to change our position I to neutral if
 
00:44:30.349 --> 00:44:30.359 align:start position:0%
some of the suggestions were put into
 
00:44:32.470 --> 00:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
place as we did in 2016 with the
 
00:44:34.910 --> 00:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
original accessory dwelling unit Bill
 
00:44:36.750 --> 00:44:36.760 align:start position:0%
the only other comment that we had
 
00:44:40.470 --> 00:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
raised was that the current Adu statute
 
00:44:44.190 --> 00:44:44.200 align:start position:0%
does allow the municipality to
 
00:44:47.589 --> 00:44:47.599 align:start position:0%
allow one of the structures to be owner
 
00:44:50.670 --> 00:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
occupied um I know I did not hear that
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
suggestion raay but that is another
 
00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:54.760 align:start position:0%
suggestion uh that we would like to see
 
00:44:58.390 --> 00:44:58.400 align:start position:0%
retained in in current language but
 
00:45:00.630 --> 00:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
understand if that's not the will of the
 
00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:04.480 align:start position:0%
committee thank you yeah representative
 
00:45:06.950 --> 00:45:06.960 align:start position:0%
ryford okay I have two comments
 
00:45:09.790 --> 00:45:09.800 align:start position:0%
questions um fundamentally I agree with
 
00:45:12.349 --> 00:45:12.359 align:start position:0%
representative Aaron if I have a child
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
who wants to have an Adu on my property
 
00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:18.440 align:start position:0%
but my existing home is smaller and they
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
have four children and they need a
 
00:45:22.589 --> 00:45:22.599 align:start position:0%
bigger home why can I not stay in my
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
home and build a bigger one if it's if
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
it's my property and that would be
 
00:45:29.270 --> 00:45:29.280 align:start position:0%
considered an Adu second piece of it is
 
00:45:32.510 --> 00:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
are does this bill allow for if you have
 
00:45:36.069 --> 00:45:36.079 align:start position:0%
say an existing structure on your house
 
00:45:37.470 --> 00:45:37.480 align:start position:0%
like a barn you have the you have the
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
property you have a barn can you convert
 
00:45:42.750 --> 00:45:42.760 align:start position:0%
a barn into a home that would be
 
00:45:45.710 --> 00:45:45.720 align:start position:0%
considered an Adu if the structure is
 
00:45:48.549 --> 00:45:48.559 align:start position:0%
already there yes I I I absolutely you
 
00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:50.359 align:start position:0%
you just doesn't require you to build a
 
00:45:51.990 --> 00:45:52.000 align:start position:0%
structure from the ground up you might
 
00:45:54.510 --> 00:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
have a structure I have a giant shed um
 
00:45:57.270 --> 00:45:57.280 align:start position:0%
on my property um that um I could
 
00:45:59.510 --> 00:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
convert into an Adu if it if it met the
 
00:46:01.549 --> 00:46:01.559 align:start position:0%
other requirements of the statute and
 
00:46:03.510 --> 00:46:03.520 align:start position:0%
just with respect to to your first
 
00:46:05.230 --> 00:46:05.240 align:start position:0%
comment and and the discussion about the
 
00:46:06.790 --> 00:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
two structures and and how big they
 
00:46:09.630 --> 00:46:09.640 align:start position:0%
should be I I would suggest for your
 
00:46:13.349 --> 00:46:13.359 align:start position:0%
consideration that at that point if the
 
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:15.520 align:start position:0%
size of the second structure is allowed
 
00:46:17.549 --> 00:46:17.559 align:start position:0%
to be so substantial the same size
 
00:46:19.589 --> 00:46:19.599 align:start position:0%
substantially the same size bigger than
 
00:46:21.790 --> 00:46:21.800 align:start position:0%
the single family home really what this
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
bill becomes is a bill about two homes
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
on a lot so instead of being Adu bill
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
it's a bill about allowing two homes on
 
00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
a single lot so I just think it's a
 
00:46:36.630 --> 00:46:36.640 align:start position:0%
different policy bill at that point I I
 
00:46:39.150 --> 00:46:39.160 align:start position:0%
agree with your
 
00:46:41.430 --> 00:46:41.440 align:start position:0%
position uh representative Paige are
 
00:46:42.710 --> 00:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
there are these questions for Miss Burns
 
00:46:45.190 --> 00:46:45.200 align:start position:0%
or we okay thank you for your thank you
 
00:46:46.790 --> 00:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
for your testimony okay go ahead
 
00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:48.470 align:start position:0%
for your testimony okay go ahead
representative

00:46:48.470 --> 00:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
Gibbs and thank you Miss bur um isn't
 
00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:56.160 align:start position:0%
the question about the size of the Adu
 
00:46:59.190 --> 00:46:59.200 align:start position:0%
relative to size of the original house
 
00:47:02.309 --> 00:47:02.319 align:start position:0%
um more a question about the definition
 
00:47:05.349 --> 00:47:05.359 align:start position:0%
of the term accessory I mean the idea
 
00:47:07.309 --> 00:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
that it has to be smaller in order to be
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
an accessory um what difference does it
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
make in reality as opposed to whether or
 
00:47:15.870 --> 00:47:15.880 align:start position:0%
not it's an accessory I mean you can
 
00:47:19.349 --> 00:47:19.359 align:start position:0%
call it anything you want but if it fits
 
00:47:22.309 --> 00:47:22.319 align:start position:0%
on the lot and otherwise fits into
 
00:47:25.349 --> 00:47:25.359 align:start position:0%
whatever um aesthetic uh requirements
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
may be applied why does it matter
 
00:47:30.109 --> 00:47:30.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's bigger or smaller I think I
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
would go back to um what I said a few
 
00:47:35.230 --> 00:47:35.240 align:start position:0%
moments ago BEC to it at some point just
 
00:47:38.349 --> 00:47:38.359 align:start position:0%
becoming a an allowance for two homes on
 
00:47:40.870 --> 00:47:40.880 align:start position:0%
one law as opposed to a single family
 
00:47:43.710 --> 00:47:43.720 align:start position:0%
home and an accessory home that I I
 
00:47:45.870 --> 00:47:45.880 align:start position:0%
think I would just go back to that that
 
00:47:48.750 --> 00:47:48.760 align:start position:0%
being said I I do want to to say too
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
that even the existing law as well as uh
 
00:47:53.829 --> 00:47:53.839 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
00:47:57.270 --> 00:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
577 they don't restrict a municipality
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
from allowing larger Adu structures if
 
00:48:04.430 --> 00:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
they wished to if they wanted to Define
 
00:48:06.109 --> 00:48:06.119 align:start position:0%
that differently or allow that
 
00:48:07.710 --> 00:48:07.720 align:start position:0%
differently and of course when I say
 
00:48:10.470 --> 00:48:10.480 align:start position:0%
they uh most of our municipalities it's
 
00:48:13.069 --> 00:48:13.079 align:start position:0%
their Town meetings voting on these
 
00:48:15.230 --> 00:48:15.240 align:start position:0%
zoning amendments so a town meeting
 
00:48:18.870 --> 00:48:18.880 align:start position:0%
could adopt a different um a different
 
00:48:22.349 --> 00:48:22.359 align:start position:0%
ceiling if they wish to um
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I also I I also just realized that
 
00:48:30.030 --> 00:48:30.040 align:start position:0%
you may or may not want be supportive if
 
00:48:32.549 --> 00:48:32.559 align:start position:0%
we move out the effective date a year oh
 
00:48:34.109 --> 00:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
the moving out the effective date to
 
00:48:37.030 --> 00:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
give them time to adopt that would be
 
00:48:41.870 --> 00:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
that so you're you're just just to
 
00:48:48.470 --> 00:48:48.480 align:start position:0%
clarify if I if we make these changes
 
00:48:50.069 --> 00:48:50.079 align:start position:0%
nhma is switching to neutral on this
 
00:48:52.670 --> 00:48:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill I will discuss that with my board
 
00:48:55.190 --> 00:48:55.200 align:start position:0%
of directors I can have that discussion
 
00:48:57.470 --> 00:48:57.480 align:start position:0%
if these suggestions are put into place
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
and the bill
 
00:49:02.430 --> 00:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
becomes the bill retains local control
 
00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
and the ability for these to be
 
00:49:06.349 --> 00:49:06.359 align:start position:0%
regulated to be you know helpful for
 
00:49:08.789 --> 00:49:08.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing like with the added
 
00:49:10.150 --> 00:49:10.160 align:start position:0%
language potentially about short-term
 
00:49:12.910 --> 00:49:12.920 align:start position:0%
rentals okay representative
 
00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
ryford okay so if we're being specific
 
00:49:20.430 --> 00:49:20.440 align:start position:0%
on a square footage size so this is 950
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
Y and we adopt that as a state so say
 
00:49:25.870 --> 00:49:25.880 align:start position:0%
the bill goes through as is with 950 can
 
00:49:28.589 --> 00:49:28.599 align:start position:0%
towns change that to be their whatever
 
00:49:30.990 --> 00:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
their local requirement is because then
 
00:49:33.309 --> 00:49:33.319 align:start position:0%
we get into a situation where you have
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
50 million different sizes that a
 
00:49:37.630 --> 00:49:37.640 align:start position:0%
particular Town based on their
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
schematics would allow so even right now
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
a town could allow adus larger than 750
 
00:49:46.870 --> 00:49:46.880 align:start position:0%
feet but they can't have their local
 
00:49:48.750 --> 00:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
regulations say they have to be 600
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
square F feet so if I believe the way
 
00:49:55.109 --> 00:49:55.119 align:start position:0%
House Bill 577 is written is that 750
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
950 becomes the new
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
750 so they wouldn't be allowed to
 
00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:03.280 align:start position:0%
restrict them to smaller than 950t Lots
 
00:50:05.829 --> 00:50:05.839 align:start position:0%
I uh uh structures I believe that's the
 
00:50:08.470 --> 00:50:08.480 align:start position:0%
way the bill reads right now oh but they
 
00:50:10.789 --> 00:50:10.799 align:start position:0%
could go larger that's correct they
 
00:50:14.150 --> 00:50:14.160 align:start position:0%
could okay thank you yeah and and I I
 
00:50:15.990 --> 00:50:16.000 align:start position:0%
agree with Miss Burns that this
 
00:50:18.030 --> 00:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
committee can talk about having two
 
00:50:20.349 --> 00:50:20.359 align:start position:0%
homes on a single family lot and we have
 
00:50:22.829 --> 00:50:22.839 align:start position:0%
a whole another year for legislation so
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
representative buolo when you put that
 
00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:25.520 align:start position:0%
bill in next year which I'm sure you
 
00:50:28.150 --> 00:50:28.160 align:start position:0%
will um we will entertain that but I
 
00:50:31.510 --> 00:50:31.520 align:start position:0%
think in order to keep the Adu bill I
 
00:50:33.829 --> 00:50:33.839 align:start position:0%
think we should have the accessory
 
00:50:33.839 --> 00:50:34.829 align:start position:0%
think we should have the accessory
larger

00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
larger
 
00:50:37.829 --> 00:50:37.839 align:start position:0%
unit I just represent buio thank you M
 
00:50:40.030 --> 00:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
for thank you represent buo could could
 
00:50:42.349 --> 00:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
we maybe do something where okay maybe
 
00:50:44.589 --> 00:50:44.599 align:start position:0%
instead of not to exceed 950 sare ft to
 
00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:46.319 align:start position:0%
maybe kind of keep the scale and
 
00:50:50.030 --> 00:50:50.040 align:start position:0%
proportionality maybe say um I don't
 
00:50:53.549 --> 00:50:53.559 align:start position:0%
know 75% or 2/3 or something like that
 
00:50:55.190 --> 00:50:55.200 align:start position:0%
so that way it's definitely going to be
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
smaller and it's definitely going to be
 
00:50:58.309 --> 00:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
clear that it's you know smaller but
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
it'll still fit with a scale of whatever
 
00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:03.240 align:start position:0%
is there would that still be too too
 
00:51:05.910 --> 00:51:05.920 align:start position:0%
aggressive or representative paage did
 
00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:08.200 align:start position:0%
you have something oh in response to
 
00:51:10.470 --> 00:51:10.480 align:start position:0%
that yeah oh I was I was just going to
 
00:51:12.950 --> 00:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
Echo you as our chair saying I think we
 
00:51:15.789 --> 00:51:15.799 align:start position:0%
have to be aware of the political
 
00:51:18.990 --> 00:51:19.000 align:start position:0%
reality of getting this through so I'm
 
00:51:20.950 --> 00:51:20.960 align:start position:0%
my my take is that we should scale it to
 
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:23.960 align:start position:0%
what we think we can achieve
 
00:51:27.349 --> 00:51:27.359 align:start position:0%
so representative Dumont
 
00:51:29.349 --> 00:51:29.359 align:start position:0%
I do understand that and I appreciate it
 
00:51:30.510 --> 00:51:30.520 align:start position:0%
you know I think my point was made the
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
only I will say is you know I can get
 
00:51:33.789 --> 00:51:33.799 align:start position:0%
behind this an improvement is an
 
00:51:35.549 --> 00:51:35.559 align:start position:0%
improvement but you're not going to see
 
00:51:37.950 --> 00:51:37.960 align:start position:0%
any municipalities go larger just like
 
00:51:39.670 --> 00:51:39.680 align:start position:0%
for right now it's set at 750 square F
 
00:51:41.270 --> 00:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
feet that's that's where they're all at
 
00:51:42.789 --> 00:51:42.799 align:start position:0%
they're always going to take the Lesser
 
00:51:44.910 --> 00:51:44.920 align:start position:0%
size so I wouldn't be too ambitious and
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
and hope that somebody's going to go
 
00:51:47.829 --> 00:51:47.839 align:start position:0%
larger you set a square footage that's
 
00:51:49.910 --> 00:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
what it'll be well and and the key the
 
00:51:52.589 --> 00:51:52.599 align:start position:0%
key change remember with the 950 is it
 
00:51:55.349 --> 00:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
adds the extra bedroom right so like
 
00:51:56.870 --> 00:51:56.880 align:start position:0%
this I mean this is huge for the
 
00:51:58.470 --> 00:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
disability Community say you want a
 
00:52:00.270 --> 00:52:00.280 align:start position:0%
caretaker living in the same home as you
 
00:52:02.510 --> 00:52:02.520 align:start position:0%
like I mean there's a lot of great
 
00:52:04.670 --> 00:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
changes that come with 950 adding that
 
00:52:07.910 --> 00:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
extra bedroom um is huge so I while
 
00:52:10.030 --> 00:52:10.040 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go larger I think
 
00:52:13.109 --> 00:52:13.119 align:start position:0%
two bedroom adus are are are necessary I
 
00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:16.160 align:start position:0%
think in today's housing housing
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
climate so um represent
 
00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:21.880 align:start position:0%
page thank you are we ready to move on
 
00:52:24.630 --> 00:52:24.640 align:start position:0%
to a different topic quickly I'd like to
 
00:52:26.950 --> 00:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
talk about the short-term rental piece
 
00:52:30.829 --> 00:52:30.839 align:start position:0%
yeah um so I think um I appreciate the
 
00:52:32.789 --> 00:52:32.799 align:start position:0%
draft language that we have
 
00:52:35.150 --> 00:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
here and I appreciate your understanding
 
00:52:37.670 --> 00:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
of my of my district I mean I'll say
 
00:52:40.470 --> 00:52:40.480 align:start position:0%
canvasing this last summer was one of
 
00:52:42.470 --> 00:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
the saddest things in the world to be in
 
00:52:43.589 --> 00:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where I knew there had
 
00:52:45.549 --> 00:52:45.559 align:start position:0%
been a registered voter two years ago
 
00:52:47.549 --> 00:52:47.559 align:start position:0%
and door after door being a short-term
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
rental I mean it's it's that's the
 
00:52:52.950 --> 00:52:52.960 align:start position:0%
context in in which I come to this piece
 
00:52:55.630 --> 00:52:55.640 align:start position:0%
of it um and recognizing how my
 
00:52:57.150 --> 00:52:57.160 align:start position:0%
constituents feel about the way that's
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
transformed Our Town um so I think this
 
00:53:03.069 --> 00:53:03.079 align:start position:0%
is a good start I would love to see this
 
00:53:05.630 --> 00:53:05.640 align:start position:0%
um I would love to see this language be
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
more affirming of what municipalities
 
00:53:12.789 --> 00:53:12.799 align:start position:0%
can do um I think I would love to you
 
00:53:14.750 --> 00:53:14.760 align:start position:0%
know really clearly say that
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
municipalities can restrict um not just
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
that not just that we won't prohibit you
 
00:53:22.430 --> 00:53:22.440 align:start position:0%
know because we've run into the issues
 
00:53:24.430 --> 00:53:24.440 align:start position:0%
in Conway time and time again trying to
 
00:53:26.670 --> 00:53:26.680 align:start position:0%
place to regulate short-term rentals I'd
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
like to really clearly State what
 
00:53:31.270 --> 00:53:31.280 align:start position:0%
municipalities can do that we can
 
00:53:36.630 --> 00:53:36.640 align:start position:0%
restrict um you know um you know
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
uh uh I'm losing the word not tency but
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
you know less than um transient uh uh
 
00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
visitors of less than 30 days okay um
 
00:53:49.109 --> 00:53:49.119 align:start position:0%
whether we do that you know say they can
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
do it via deed restriction or what have
 
00:53:54.710 --> 00:53:54.720 align:start position:0%
you um the other piece for me here is
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
thinking about how folks
 
00:54:00.750 --> 00:54:00.760 align:start position:0%
um maybe downsizing into their Adu also
 
00:54:02.789 --> 00:54:02.799 align:start position:0%
thinking about the primary dwelling in
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
that equation because the goal is
 
00:54:06.990 --> 00:54:07.000 align:start position:0%
housing right our goal here is housing
 
00:54:08.349 --> 00:54:08.359 align:start position:0%
and so I want to make sure that we're
 
00:54:10.910 --> 00:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
not having someone move into their new
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
new Adu and then short-term renting
 
00:54:14.510 --> 00:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
their primary dwelling so those are my
 
00:54:16.030 --> 00:54:16.040 align:start position:0%
two concerns that I want to make sure we
 
00:54:17.349 --> 00:54:17.359 align:start position:0%
address in the final language of that
 
00:54:20.309 --> 00:54:20.319 align:start position:0%
piece but just want to get that out
 
00:54:25.309 --> 00:54:25.319 align:start position:0%
there okay I I think I I just this
 
00:54:27.069 --> 00:54:27.079 align:start position:0%
language was suggested to me but I'm I'm
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
certainly if there's a a more clear
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
sentence that would satisfy it feel free
 
00:54:34.990 --> 00:54:35.000 align:start position:0%
to let me know represent buo I was just
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
going to say I I like I like the
 
00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:38.640 align:start position:0%
language as drafted because it keeps
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
this focused on adus and doesn't turn
 
00:54:43.069 --> 00:54:43.079 align:start position:0%
this into a short-term rental bill so I
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
personally kind of like where it is one
 
00:54:48.230 --> 00:54:48.240 align:start position:0%
of the things I will say in defense of
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals I mean you know the
 
00:54:52.430 --> 00:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
fact is is New Hampshire you know makes
 
00:54:53.829 --> 00:54:53.839 align:start position:0%
a lot of money from tourism and it's a
 
00:54:55.630 --> 00:54:55.640 align:start position:0%
very important part of our economy and
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
the fact is is that especially in the
 
00:54:59.230 --> 00:54:59.240 align:start position:0%
North Country if we were to completely
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
say you know what everybody hates
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals let's get rid of them
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
all so they can be housing instead you
 
00:55:05.549 --> 00:55:05.559 align:start position:0%
really going to see this KnockOn effect
 
00:55:07.190 --> 00:55:07.200 align:start position:0%
or you're going to have a lot less
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
tourism so that's going to be a lot less
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
people visiting local businesses there
 
00:55:11.750 --> 00:55:11.760 align:start position:0%
going to be a lot less people going to
 
00:55:13.230 --> 00:55:13.240 align:start position:0%
local restaurants the other thing I'll
 
00:55:15.190 --> 00:55:15.200 align:start position:0%
say is that you know supply and demand
 
00:55:16.990 --> 00:55:17.000 align:start position:0%
if there are too many short-term rental
 
00:55:18.990 --> 00:55:19.000 align:start position:0%
units people will start converting those
 
00:55:21.270 --> 00:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
into long-term and it really becomes a
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
pain in the neck if you're doing a
 
00:55:24.069 --> 00:55:24.079 align:start position:0%
short-term rental and you got to change
 
00:55:25.870 --> 00:55:25.880 align:start position:0%
the sheets every time and you'd have to
 
00:55:28.150 --> 00:55:28.160 align:start position:0%
turn the unit there could be people who
 
00:55:29.789 --> 00:55:29.799 align:start position:0%
say you know what I'm going to put an
 
00:55:31.349 --> 00:55:31.359 align:start position:0%
Adu and I'm going to make it a
 
00:55:33.029 --> 00:55:33.039 align:start position:0%
short-term rental they do it for a
 
00:55:34.630 --> 00:55:34.640 align:start position:0%
little bit realize it sucks and then
 
00:55:36.470 --> 00:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to say you know what this
 
00:55:37.670 --> 00:55:37.680 align:start position:0%
is actually going to be long term and
 
00:55:38.789 --> 00:55:38.799 align:start position:0%
I'm going to have people in here for a
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
year and I'm going to have a year-long
 
00:55:41.910 --> 00:55:41.920 align:start position:0%
tenant so I think that you know although
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
I definitely sympathize with you know a
 
00:55:45.789 --> 00:55:45.799 align:start position:0%
lot of the negative consequences of
 
00:55:47.710 --> 00:55:47.720 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals I really think that
 
00:55:50.069 --> 00:55:50.079 align:start position:0%
we should be very light and we should be
 
00:55:52.069 --> 00:55:52.079 align:start position:0%
very gentle in terms of what we do as a
 
00:55:54.510 --> 00:55:54.520 align:start position:0%
committee in terms of restricting
 
00:55:57.870 --> 00:55:57.880 align:start position:0%
them represent Paige
 
00:56:00.510 --> 00:56:00.520 align:start position:0%
I I hear that perspective I'll say again
 
00:56:04.150 --> 00:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
from my very hyperlocal context
 
00:56:05.710 --> 00:56:05.720 align:start position:0%
especially with the potential changes
 
00:56:08.829 --> 00:56:08.839 align:start position:0%
around not not requiring one the primary
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
ding to be owner occupied I mean I get
 
00:56:14.950 --> 00:56:14.960 align:start position:0%
at least twice a month you know
 
00:56:17.710 --> 00:56:17.720 align:start position:0%
something in the mail from a company
 
00:56:19.069 --> 00:56:19.079 align:start position:0%
that wants to buy my house to use it for
 
00:56:21.670 --> 00:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
a short-term rental and the vast
 
00:56:24.270 --> 00:56:24.280 align:start position:0%
majority of our short-term rentals in
 
00:56:26.870 --> 00:56:26.880 align:start position:0%
Carol County are not own by people who
 
00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:30.160 align:start position:0%
live in Carroll County um so I think you
 
00:56:33.109 --> 00:56:33.119 align:start position:0%
know um my concern would be that both
 
00:56:35.430 --> 00:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
units end up that way and I will say in
 
00:56:36.589 --> 00:56:36.599 align:start position:0%
my community I don't know what it's like
 
00:56:38.230 --> 00:56:38.240 align:start position:0%
in Littleton but in my community it
 
00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:40.160 align:start position:0%
still seems the appetite for them is
 
00:56:42.430 --> 00:56:42.440 align:start position:0%
insatiable um I mean we have entire
 
00:56:44.069 --> 00:56:44.079 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods where you used to have
 
00:56:45.670 --> 00:56:45.680 align:start position:0%
kids biking around on the street that
 
00:56:48.990 --> 00:56:49.000 align:start position:0%
are now just party Villages so you know
 
00:56:50.750 --> 00:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's my that's where I'm coming from
 
00:56:54.150 --> 00:56:54.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
topic represent miles just a
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
clarification but isn't that something
 
00:57:03.710 --> 00:57:03.720 align:start position:0%
your own municipality zoning board can
 
00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:07.440 align:start position:0%
apply to that area to to rectify for
 
00:57:11.750 --> 00:57:11.760 align:start position:0%
that geographical location I'm genuinely
 
00:57:15.510 --> 00:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
asking the yes I will say it has been a
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
real struggle and we have continued to
 
00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:19.880 align:start position:0%
struggle with that we have been to court
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
many times um as we've tried to address
 
00:57:24.190 --> 00:57:24.200 align:start position:0%
that issue so what I am what I would
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
seek in this is very clear
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
um you know what what it says here what
 
00:57:31.430 --> 00:57:31.440 align:start position:0%
scares me about the language as drafted
 
00:57:33.029 --> 00:57:33.039 align:start position:0%
is that it just sort of says nothing
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
prohibits the mun municipality from
 
00:57:36.990 --> 00:57:37.000 align:start position:0%
regulating I would really like to see
 
00:57:39.670 --> 00:57:39.680 align:start position:0%
language affirming here are ways in
 
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:41.960 align:start position:0%
which municipalities can do this if that
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
makes sense it's a small tweak the
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
sentence that would say a municipality
 
00:57:48.630 --> 00:57:48.640 align:start position:0%
May um in a municipality and its
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
discretion May regulate the accessory
 
00:57:54.589 --> 00:57:54.599 align:start position:0%
dwelling unit not to be short-term
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
something like that okay just a fing it
 
00:57:59.470 --> 00:57:59.480 align:start position:0%
all right I think I can come up with
 
00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:01.470 align:start position:0%
all right I think I can come up with
that

00:58:01.470 --> 00:58:01.480 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
other other Concepts representative
 
00:58:07.789 --> 00:58:07.799 align:start position:0%
deont not a concept about short-term
 
00:58:09.270 --> 00:58:09.280 align:start position:0%
rental but I had a couple other comments
 
00:58:13.029 --> 00:58:13.039 align:start position:0%
go one um how does everybody feel about
 
00:58:14.630 --> 00:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh municipality not being able to
 
00:58:17.309 --> 00:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
restrict a secondary access um I've seen
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
a couple municipalities do that with the
 
00:58:22.150 --> 00:58:22.160 align:start position:0%
adus um some have ordinances particular
 
00:58:23.870 --> 00:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
that per lot you're only allowed one
 
00:58:26.309 --> 00:58:26.319 align:start position:0%
driveway which in my opinion causes an
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
issue for emergency vehicles but also
 
00:58:30.829 --> 00:58:30.839 align:start position:0%
depending on how you're utilizing
 
00:58:33.109 --> 00:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
that and something as simple as you know
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
municipality shall not prohibit a
 
00:58:36.670 --> 00:58:36.680 align:start position:0%
secondary access I think would
 
00:58:47.109 --> 00:58:47.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.750 --> 00:58:49.760 align:start position:0%
but representative Aaron I think that
 
00:58:51.910 --> 00:58:51.920 align:start position:0%
makes sense because one of the biggest
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
things in this bill is that you're
 
00:58:56.190 --> 00:58:56.200 align:start position:0%
allowing detached
 
00:58:59.430 --> 00:58:59.440 align:start position:0%
and that that's a that's a real big plus
 
00:59:01.950 --> 00:59:01.960 align:start position:0%
so you might want a separate driveway or
 
00:59:04.150 --> 00:59:04.160 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.829 align:start position:0%
something like
that

00:59:05.829 --> 00:59:05.839 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:59:08.190 --> 00:59:08.200 align:start position:0%
okay go ahead I'm G to add one other
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
thing that I would like to see taken out
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
would be on page two line 23 I don't
 
00:59:16.029 --> 00:59:16.039 align:start position:0%
think that we should be dictating
 
00:59:20.230 --> 00:59:20.240 align:start position:0%
Aesthetics I yeah I understand yeah I
 
00:59:23.990 --> 00:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
think uh Mr Mayberry said it best when I
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
think the idea is is you don't want want
 
00:59:30.230 --> 00:59:30.240 align:start position:0%
the Adu to look like a pirate ship when
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
your original unit looks like a colonial
 
00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
and I and I think that's the legislative
 
00:59:39.309 --> 00:59:39.319 align:start position:0%
intent I I can understand that but I I
 
00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:41.280 align:start position:0%
got to go back to what I like versus
 
00:59:42.510 --> 00:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
what the other side likes are going to
 
00:59:44.670 --> 00:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
be two different things yeah and I I
 
00:59:46.270 --> 00:59:46.280 align:start position:0%
just I always find it funny when you
 
00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
have board members telling people the
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
way that their house should look I I
 
00:59:52.190 --> 00:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
just I think that common sense and the
 
00:59:53.910 --> 00:59:53.920 align:start position:0%
market will really dictate that very
 
00:59:56.190 --> 00:59:56.200 align:start position:0%
well sure you're going to have one-offs
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
but you're going to have that no matter
 
01:00:02.230 --> 01:00:02.240 align:start position:0%
what okay represent Faxton I as the
 
01:00:04.870 --> 01:00:04.880 align:start position:0%
veteran of numerous zba and planning
 
01:00:08.589 --> 01:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
board hearings and nine years as a
 
01:00:12.630 --> 01:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
selectman uh I share that concern
 
01:00:14.470 --> 01:00:14.480 align:start position:0%
because while it seems perfectly
 
01:00:16.150 --> 01:00:16.160 align:start position:0%
reasonable in here we don't want a
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
pirate ship standing behind a two-story
 
01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:21.720 align:start position:0%
Colonial uh you haven't lived till
 
01:00:24.710 --> 01:00:24.720 align:start position:0%
you've been in a zoning Board hearing or
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
a planning board hearing where the
 
01:00:27.710 --> 01:00:27.720 align:start position:0%
argument is not whether you can build
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
the building or not but whether the
 
01:00:32.549 --> 01:00:32.559 align:start position:0%
doors will be green or
 
01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
blue uh and in my town that I live in we
 
01:00:38.470 --> 01:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
are there is a a Redevelopment going on
 
01:00:40.589 --> 01:00:40.599 align:start position:0%
of our former Woolen
 
01:00:44.670 --> 01:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
Mill uh and the the biggest complaint
 
01:00:47.510 --> 01:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
about it is many of the residents do not
 
01:00:51.390 --> 01:00:51.400 align:start position:0%
like the color of the roof which is by
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
black so you know I wouldn't want to
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
give that power to people to regulate
 
01:01:02.829 --> 01:01:02.839 align:start position:0%
that represent howand actually it was
 
01:01:05.950 --> 01:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
the shade of green actually down to the
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
shade of
 
01:01:10.029 --> 01:01:10.039 align:start position:0%
green okay so how does the committee
 
01:01:12.510 --> 01:01:12.520 align:start position:0%
feel about this aesthetic requirement
 
01:01:12.520 --> 01:01:14.069 align:start position:0%
feel about this aesthetic requirement
standard

01:01:14.069 --> 01:01:14.079 align:start position:0%
standard
 
01:01:17.029 --> 01:01:17.039 align:start position:0%
here okay let me let me ask show hands
 
01:01:19.190 --> 01:01:19.200 align:start position:0%
who's in support of the bill removing
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
the authority Miss's regul aesthetic
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
standards raise your
 
01:01:27.710 --> 01:01:27.720 align:start position:0%
hand who remove to remove remove the
 
01:01:31.750 --> 01:01:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:38.109 --> 01:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
it yeah okay your question again reverse
 
01:01:41.549 --> 01:01:41.559 align:start position:0%
no are you in favor of removing the the
 
01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
municipality's right to regulate
 
01:01:45.829 --> 01:01:45.839 align:start position:0%
aesthetic standards from of the
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
Adu if you're in favor of the removing
 
01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:54.470 --> 01:01:54.480 align:start position:0%
hand if you're opposed to
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
it letting them retain the ability raise
 
01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.630 align:start position:0%
it letting them retain the ability raise
your

01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:02:03.589 --> 01:02:03.599 align:start position:0%
hand okay representative Paige I I want
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
to add sort of a third category there
 
01:02:08.549 --> 01:02:08.559 align:start position:0%
which is please do which is also I don't
 
01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:10.400 align:start position:0%
want to derail the bill I don't want to
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
derail the bill so I I would be in favor
 
01:02:16.630 --> 01:02:16.640 align:start position:0%
of if of keeping it if we think that
 
01:02:18.470 --> 01:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
improves our chances of moving it
 
01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:20.480 align:start position:0%
through both the house and the Senate
 
01:02:24.829 --> 01:02:24.839 align:start position:0%
yeah that's my take I you know and and I
 
01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
really appreciate that this committee
 
01:02:28.230 --> 01:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
wants to move forward on a lot of this
 
01:02:30.029 --> 01:02:30.039 align:start position:0%
stuff and I hate to be the voice of
 
01:02:31.430 --> 01:02:31.440 align:start position:0%
reason here but I think that we should
 
01:02:34.269 --> 01:02:34.279 align:start position:0%
probably keep that part in the bill in
 
01:02:35.510 --> 01:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
order to get it through the house and
 
01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:38.720 align:start position:0%
the senate representative Dumont with
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
the show of hands I think it was there
 
01:02:42.190 --> 01:02:42.200 align:start position:0%
was a good amount of consent there I
 
01:02:44.190 --> 01:02:44.200 align:start position:0%
would be in favor of leaving alone with
 
01:02:46.150 --> 01:02:46.160 align:start position:0%
this bill so long as there's some other
 
01:02:48.910 --> 01:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
way to remove that Authority in the
 
01:02:51.670 --> 01:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
future I I don't see how in any of the
 
01:02:54.670 --> 01:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
zoning laws that was enacted Aesthetics
 
01:02:55.829 --> 01:02:55.839 align:start position:0%
being a part of that it was always
 
01:02:57.950 --> 01:02:57.960 align:start position:0%
always health and safety and it has gone
 
01:03:00.829 --> 01:03:00.839 align:start position:0%
to a whole new level I have seen and
 
01:03:02.029 --> 01:03:02.039 align:start position:0%
watched and sat through zoning board
 
01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
meetings where there was a topic about
 
01:03:06.750 --> 01:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
shutters it it it goes way too far and
 
01:03:08.510 --> 01:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
that has nothing to do with that that
 
01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:10.279 align:start position:0%
you know those properties being built
 
01:03:11.789 --> 01:03:11.799 align:start position:0%
well and this committee has already
 
01:03:15.269 --> 01:03:15.279 align:start position:0%
acted on a very important bill HB 399
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
that would establish a commission to
 
01:03:18.950 --> 01:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
study the zoning enabling act so we can
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
talk about did the legislature intend to
 
01:03:22.630 --> 01:03:22.640 align:start position:0%
give the responsibility of
 
01:03:24.430 --> 01:03:24.440 align:start position:0%
municipalities to regulate shutters in
 
01:03:26.829 --> 01:03:26.839 align:start position:0%
1925 I don't know but it's a it's
 
01:03:28.910 --> 01:03:28.920 align:start position:0%
something that we will be discussing as
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:35.430 --> 01:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
um that's all I'm going to say but I
 
01:03:36.990 --> 01:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying U
 
01:03:38.430 --> 01:03:38.440 align:start position:0%
representative bolo then representative
 
01:03:41.470 --> 01:03:41.480 align:start position:0%
Gibbs so one of my one of my concerns on
 
01:03:42.990 --> 01:03:43.000 align:start position:0%
on this and I mean you you already know
 
01:03:44.470 --> 01:03:44.480 align:start position:0%
which kind of you know points I'm going
 
01:03:46.829 --> 01:03:46.839 align:start position:0%
to Echo about this but maybe one of the
 
01:03:48.150 --> 01:03:48.160 align:start position:0%
ways where we could sort of keep
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
aesthetic standards in there if we
 
01:03:51.870 --> 01:03:51.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely must I I agree with
 
01:03:53.589 --> 01:03:53.599 align:start position:0%
representative dumont's comments I I
 
01:03:54.910 --> 01:03:54.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it should be in here and I
 
01:03:56.430 --> 01:03:56.440 align:start position:0%
don't think it's within purview of the
 
01:03:59.309 --> 01:03:59.319 align:start position:0%
authority granted to towns to regulate
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
um zoning but what I'm really concerned
 
01:04:04.870 --> 01:04:04.880 align:start position:0%
about is you know one of the best ways
 
01:04:06.349 --> 01:04:06.359 align:start position:0%
in my mind to build accessory dwelling
 
01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
units is if you use Innovative new
 
01:04:10.630 --> 01:04:10.640 align:start position:0%
construction techniques practices let's
 
01:04:12.349 --> 01:04:12.359 align:start position:0%
say you have prefabricated you know
 
01:04:13.750 --> 01:04:13.760 align:start position:0%
construction let's say you have some
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
kind of modular construction or
 
01:04:17.029 --> 01:04:17.039 align:start position:0%
something like that and municipalities
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
say you know what that's a really like
 
01:04:20.870 --> 01:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
cost-effective way to build adus and we
 
01:04:22.230 --> 01:04:22.240 align:start position:0%
actually hate adus and we don't want
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
them in our town at all but the
 
01:04:24.990 --> 01:04:25.000 align:start position:0%
legislature is forcing us to have them
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
let's use a aesthetic standards as a
 
01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
back way to prevent these things and say
 
01:04:31.309 --> 01:04:31.319 align:start position:0%
well you can't use these materials and
 
01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:32.640 align:start position:0%
you can't use this construction
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
technique and you can't do this you know
 
01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
XYZ so maybe a car out to where okay if
 
01:04:38.990 --> 01:04:39.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to have aesthetic standards
 
01:04:40.390 --> 01:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
maybe not talk about construction
 
01:04:41.750 --> 01:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
materials or techniques or something
 
01:04:43.230 --> 01:04:43.240 align:start position:0%
like that what what about just adding
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
the word a municipality May apply
 
01:04:49.349 --> 01:04:49.359 align:start position:0%
reasonable because here here's the thing
 
01:04:52.589 --> 01:04:52.599 align:start position:0%
reason here's I I I think I think there
 
01:04:53.710 --> 01:04:53.720 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:04:56.549 --> 01:04:56.559 align:start position:0%
clear definition for reasonable
 
01:04:59.309 --> 01:04:59.319 align:start position:0%
and I think in some ways maybe the
 
01:05:01.630 --> 01:05:01.640 align:start position:0%
courts will determine what reasonable is
 
01:05:04.069 --> 01:05:04.079 align:start position:0%
but I think if we get if the 18 of us
 
01:05:06.269 --> 01:05:06.279 align:start position:0%
got together and we're we're like that's
 
01:05:08.190 --> 01:05:08.200 align:start position:0%
not reasonable right like like a bunch
 
01:05:09.309 --> 01:05:09.319 align:start position:0%
of people would get together and be like
 
01:05:12.390 --> 01:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's not a reasonable aesthetic
 
01:05:14.630 --> 01:05:14.640 align:start position:0%
standard cuz what you're what you're
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
saying is unreasonable I think anybody
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
would think that maybe not a planning
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
board but that's up to the courts to
 
01:05:23.349 --> 01:05:23.359 align:start position:0%
decide I mean if you have to go to court
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
you're already putting a major break and
 
01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:26.720 align:start position:0%
impediment on construction because a lot
 
01:05:28.549 --> 01:05:28.559 align:start position:0%
of people do they want to sign up for a
 
01:05:30.549 --> 01:05:30.559 align:start position:0%
lawsuit no they want to build an
 
01:05:34.870 --> 01:05:34.880 align:start position:0%
Adu represent Aon I'm sorry represent
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
Gibs thank you
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
um well I would also prefer that the
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
local Authority not not have the
 
01:05:45.230 --> 01:05:45.240 align:start position:0%
authority to tell people what their
 
01:05:47.710 --> 01:05:47.720 align:start position:0%
building should look like uh and
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
certainly not have the authority to tell
 
01:05:51.670 --> 01:05:51.680 align:start position:0%
them what color the door should be or
 
01:05:53.589 --> 01:05:53.599 align:start position:0%
the roof should be or whether or not it
 
01:05:56.710 --> 01:05:56.720 align:start position:0%
should have shutters um I really think
 
01:05:59.990 --> 01:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's going way too far um nevertheless
 
01:06:02.630 --> 01:06:02.640 align:start position:0%
if we need the athletic standards in in
 
01:06:05.549 --> 01:06:05.559 align:start position:0%
the uh proposed bill in order to get it
 
01:06:08.589 --> 01:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
passed I would go along with
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
it represent Faxton
 
01:06:16.069 --> 01:06:16.079 align:start position:0%
so as previously stated I have severe
 
01:06:19.069 --> 01:06:19.079 align:start position:0%
concerns about the word Aesthetics in
 
01:06:23.990 --> 01:06:24.000 align:start position:0%
here however I think by trying to fix it
 
01:06:27.069 --> 01:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
by saying reasonable Aesthetics I think
 
01:06:29.750 --> 01:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
you've created a WPA project for
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
lawyers uh so I would I would prefer if
 
01:06:36.309 --> 01:06:36.319 align:start position:0%
if I have to go on the like what is the
 
01:06:39.910 --> 01:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
least bad of my choices leave it as is
 
01:06:42.630 --> 01:06:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay uh I think that if I was an
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
obstructionist select board or I was an
 
01:06:48.349 --> 01:06:48.359 align:start position:0%
obstructionist planning board I would
 
01:06:52.029 --> 01:06:52.039 align:start position:0%
grasp onto the aesthetic nature of this
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
and make it fundamentally impossible to
 
01:06:57.750 --> 01:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
build an
 
01:07:01.029 --> 01:07:01.039 align:start position:0%
Adu or so absurdly expensive and
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
inconvenient that it would it's and I
 
01:07:06.510 --> 01:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
think you know there's a sense of
 
01:07:08.910 --> 01:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
fairness for the most part in these
 
01:07:10.510 --> 01:07:10.520 align:start position:0%
things and maybe that'll where it'll get
 
01:07:12.150 --> 01:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
work if you're going to toss it where it
 
01:07:13.910 --> 01:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
has to get worked out in court if you
 
01:07:15.510 --> 01:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
really need Aesthetics in there to get
 
01:07:17.430 --> 01:07:17.440 align:start position:0%
enough votes to get it over the hump
 
01:07:20.430 --> 01:07:20.440 align:start position:0%
okay but I think I think you're leaving
 
01:07:22.750 --> 01:07:22.760 align:start position:0%
a big opportunity for an obstructionist
 
01:07:24.269 --> 01:07:24.279 align:start position:0%
planning board or select board to say
 
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
you know what blue houses are not
 
01:07:28.589 --> 01:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
aesthetically pleasing we want
 
01:07:30.549 --> 01:07:30.559 align:start position:0%
everything covered in Brick and I have
 
01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:33.359 align:start position:0%
just for the record I have lived in
 
01:07:36.549 --> 01:07:36.559 align:start position:0%
communities where in the South where
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
everything was required to be brick
 
01:07:42.870 --> 01:07:42.880 align:start position:0%
period the end so make it three times as
 
01:07:46.510 --> 01:07:46.520 align:start position:0%
expensive correct representative
 
01:07:49.269 --> 01:07:49.279 align:start position:0%
Grant Maybe I'm Wrong here but reading
 
01:07:53.150 --> 01:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
this um the mysticality May apply
 
01:07:56.029 --> 01:07:56.039 align:start position:0%
aesthetic standards only if it's applied
 
01:07:58.230 --> 01:07:58.240 align:start position:0%
those same standards to the original
 
01:08:00.630 --> 01:08:00.640 align:start position:0%
dwelling so if they didn't apply any
 
01:08:02.750 --> 01:08:02.760 align:start position:0%
standards to the original dwelling that
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
means they're out of luck at the way I'm
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
reading it yeah that's I yeah thank you
 
01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:09.960 align:start position:0%
for pointing that
 
01:08:13.029 --> 01:08:13.039 align:start position:0%
out represent Pig and then represent
 
01:08:16.030 --> 01:08:16.040 align:start position:0%
buo thank you I was just going to
 
01:08:18.669 --> 01:08:18.679 align:start position:0%
suggest that I think there's actually a
 
01:08:22.229 --> 01:08:22.239 align:start position:0%
a lot of um interest in members of both
 
01:08:24.870 --> 01:08:24.880 align:start position:0%
parties in this issue and that it's
 
01:08:26.910 --> 01:08:26.920 align:start position:0%
something we could revisit next year in
 
01:08:29.349 --> 01:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
new legislation I feel like our goal
 
01:08:31.390 --> 01:08:31.400 align:start position:0%
should be to get a good version of this
 
01:08:32.829 --> 01:08:32.839 align:start position:0%
bill through the best version we think
 
01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:36.759 align:start position:0%
we can get through um and sounds like we
 
01:08:39.470 --> 01:08:39.480 align:start position:0%
have a lot of or near consensus around
 
01:08:41.070 --> 01:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
some of the issues around the misuse of
 
01:08:42.430 --> 01:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
aesthetic standards so that would be
 
01:08:45.390 --> 01:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
great to revisit but I would personally
 
01:08:47.709 --> 01:08:47.719 align:start position:0%
say let's try to get it through
 
01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:49.759 align:start position:0%
represent buia I was just going to say
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
that's actually really really
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
interesting reading of the bill because
 
01:08:56.229 --> 01:08:56.239 align:start position:0%
if it says applied in the past tense so
 
01:08:58.349 --> 01:08:58.359 align:start position:0%
if the original building was built when
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
there were no aesthetic standards you
 
01:09:01.550 --> 01:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
would think it'd be grandfathered in
 
01:09:03.910 --> 01:09:03.920 align:start position:0%
with no aesthetic
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
standards I mean I you know does
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
everybody else read it that way that's
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.709 --> 01:09:16.719 align:start position:0%
it representative Dumont I'm just gonna
 
01:09:17.749 --> 01:09:17.759 align:start position:0%
say I'm glad you guys can read
 
01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislation like that because the boards
 
01:09:21.990 --> 01:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
can't I don't I don't know how how often
 
01:09:23.749 --> 01:09:23.759 align:start position:0%
you guys have gone to board meetings but
 
01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
the the these logical consensus don't
 
01:09:28.349 --> 01:09:28.359 align:start position:0%
normally happen uh there there's a lot
 
01:09:30.189 --> 01:09:30.199 align:start position:0%
of good people they're volunteers I
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
understand that but there's so
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
much I'll I'll leave it alone I think if
 
01:09:37.030 --> 01:09:37.040 align:start position:0%
we can push this forward fine I'm happy
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
with it it is definitely an improvement
 
01:09:41.669 --> 01:09:41.679 align:start position:0%
but I will say that is going to be an
 
01:09:45.189 --> 01:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
issue okay so to sum this
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
up I'm going to add this language about
 
01:09:50.470 --> 01:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
the adoption of
 
01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
zoning I'm going to add the language
 
01:09:54.030 --> 01:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
about the square
 
01:09:56.870 --> 01:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
footage I'm make a more clear sentence
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
about short-term
 
01:10:01.510 --> 01:10:01.520 align:start position:0%
rentals although Bob did you have
 
01:10:03.550 --> 01:10:03.560 align:start position:0%
something to add on
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:10.189 --> 01:10:10.199 align:start position:0%
up um I'm going to move out the
 
01:10:12.830 --> 01:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
effective date a
 
01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:17.470 align:start position:0%
effective date a
year

01:10:17.470 --> 01:10:17.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:21.110 --> 01:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay just put your um mic on I am Bob
 
01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
Quinn I'm the CEO of the New Hampshire
 
01:10:24.990 --> 01:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
Association of Realtors I haven't had a
 
01:10:27.270 --> 01:10:27.280 align:start position:0%
chance to look at the language regarding
 
01:10:30.590 --> 01:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals um this legislature
 
01:10:32.630 --> 01:10:32.640 align:start position:0%
has debated this issue for a number of
 
01:10:35.310 --> 01:10:35.320 align:start position:0%
years um has not come to any conclusions
 
01:10:38.630 --> 01:10:38.640 align:start position:0%
yet it has been litigated in court uh in
 
01:10:40.390 --> 01:10:40.400 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire time and time again both
 
01:10:42.149 --> 01:10:42.159 align:start position:0%
Superior Court as well as the Supreme
 
01:10:45.270 --> 01:10:45.280 align:start position:0%
Court what I read here would be a pretty
 
01:10:48.430 --> 01:10:48.440 align:start position:0%
overarching change in uh policy in the
 
01:10:52.390 --> 01:10:52.400 align:start position:0%
state so all I would suggest is a robust
 
01:10:56.910 --> 01:10:56.920 align:start position:0%
discussion uh prior to doing that
 
01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
the keep in mind that you know
 
01:11:01.830 --> 01:11:01.840 align:start position:0%
short-term rentals we do see that's a
 
01:11:03.990 --> 01:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
part of uh private property rights the
 
01:11:06.910 --> 01:11:06.920 align:start position:0%
ability to rent out so a lot of property
 
01:11:09.590 --> 01:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
owners do that in order to ensure that
 
01:11:11.669 --> 01:11:11.679 align:start position:0%
they can stay in their homes uh and to
 
01:11:14.630 --> 01:11:14.640 align:start position:0%
eliminate that as a possibility um we'll
 
01:11:17.110 --> 01:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
have some serious repercussions we think
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I don't I don't think
 
01:11:21.270 --> 01:11:21.280 align:start position:0%
anybody suggesting to deed restrict
 
01:11:23.390 --> 01:11:23.400 align:start position:0%
these I think I think what we're
 
01:11:24.910 --> 01:11:24.920 align:start position:0%
suggesting is giving the municipality
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
the option
 
01:11:28.990 --> 01:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
of regulating it and you not supportive
 
01:11:32.270 --> 01:11:32.280 align:start position:0%
of that it really does depend a lot on
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
the specific language okay um and whe
 
01:11:38.030 --> 01:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
and how you go about doing that the
 
01:11:39.950 --> 01:11:39.960 align:start position:0%
current statute right now does not
 
01:11:41.910 --> 01:11:41.920 align:start position:0%
mention vacation rentals or short-term
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
rentals or anything else and that
 
01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
statute has worked appropriately over
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
the past seven eight years so we're not
 
01:11:51.310 --> 01:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
entirely clear why that needs to change
 
01:11:53.950 --> 01:11:53.960 align:start position:0%
because we're going from attached to
 
01:11:56.270 --> 01:11:56.280 align:start position:0%
detached okay
 
01:11:59.149 --> 01:11:59.159 align:start position:0%
that's thank you that's helpful
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
you does anyone else have anything to
 
01:12:07.629 --> 01:12:07.639 align:start position:0%
add on this bill represent buo I was
 
01:12:09.470 --> 01:12:09.480 align:start position:0%
just kind of echo that that if this does
 
01:12:11.669 --> 01:12:11.679 align:start position:0%
become something that maybe rightly or
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
wrongly but in the minds of other
 
01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:14.840 align:start position:0%
Representatives becomes something that
 
01:12:16.870 --> 01:12:16.880 align:start position:0%
is not just an Adu bill but also a
 
01:12:19.350 --> 01:12:19.360 align:start position:0%
short-term rental bill you run the risk
 
01:12:20.830 --> 01:12:20.840 align:start position:0%
of losing votes that you would have
 
01:12:22.189 --> 01:12:22.199 align:start position:0%
otherwise got because you have
 
01:12:23.629 --> 01:12:23.639 align:start position:0%
Representatives that say no but I don't
 
01:12:31.390 --> 01:12:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.709 --> 01:12:34.719 align:start position:0%
okay represent Dumont for the sake of
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
beating a dead horse I'm going to throw
 
01:12:37.590 --> 01:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
out there one more time the secondary
 
01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:39.760 align:start position:0%
access does anybody have any any
 
01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
comments or concerns on that I can tell
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
you that it's a problem uh where I'm
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.990 --> 01:12:53.000 align:start position:0%
there okay can you send me a sentence or
 
01:12:55.629 --> 01:12:55.639 align:start position:0%
two on that
 
01:12:59.270 --> 01:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
all right I think we're good on this
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
one next one is HB 631 permitting
 
01:13:06.550 --> 01:13:06.560 align:start position:0%
Residential Building commercial zones by
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
right um I'll just start and say I
 
01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
support the concept of it um I think the
 
01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
home builders pointed out some clear
 
01:13:16.510 --> 01:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
problems with the bill I also believe
 
01:13:18.470 --> 01:13:18.480 align:start position:0%
there is
 
01:13:23.149 --> 01:13:23.159 align:start position:0%
um a more clean version of this concept
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
on the our across the wall have maybe a
 
01:13:29.629 --> 01:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
more clean version of this bill that um
 
01:13:33.910 --> 01:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we start with
 
01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
that as a skeleton and then work off of
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
that I think less is more with a bill
 
01:13:41.470 --> 01:13:41.480 align:start position:0%
like this um and I think this
 
01:13:43.910 --> 01:13:43.920 align:start position:0%
one is going into too much detail is
 
01:13:46.470 --> 01:13:46.480 align:start position:0%
muddying things up a little bit so
 
01:13:49.189 --> 01:13:49.199 align:start position:0%
I I'd love to hear what the committee
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
the committee feels represent Axton well
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
in light of your comment and our prior
 
01:13:57.470 --> 01:13:57.480 align:start position:0%
discussion would it be possible for the
 
01:13:59.590 --> 01:13:59.600 align:start position:0%
committee to set aside discussion of
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
this bill until we have the Senate Bill
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
available to us in its current whatever
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
its current form is to review the two
 
01:14:10.270 --> 01:14:10.280 align:start position:0%
side by
 
01:14:12.590 --> 01:14:12.600 align:start position:0%
side can somebody get me a bill number
 
01:14:18.350 --> 01:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.149 --> 01:14:22.159 align:start position:0%
number okay representative Dumont yeah
 
01:14:23.229 --> 01:14:23.239 align:start position:0%
the only thing I was going to add was
 
01:14:24.750 --> 01:14:24.760 align:start position:0%
just T out some of the points that were
 
01:14:26.030 --> 01:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
made in public hearing was definitely to
 
01:14:28.229 --> 01:14:28.239 align:start position:0%
create a concise definition commercial
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
is just that of everything four units
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
are larger whether it be again a strip
 
01:14:33.070 --> 01:14:33.080 align:start position:0%
mall or a multif family development or
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
an industrial complex certain towns have
 
01:14:37.669 --> 01:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
specific zoning that call out those
 
01:14:39.870 --> 01:14:39.880 align:start position:0%
commercial uses but not all towns so I
 
01:14:40.910 --> 01:14:40.920 align:start position:0%
just think it'd be very important to
 
01:14:43.149 --> 01:14:43.159 align:start position:0%
make sure that is clearly
 
01:14:46.950 --> 01:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
defined that
 
01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:48.960 align:start position:0%
0 all
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:56.350 --> 01:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
um yeah so what I um what I think I want
 
01:14:58.550 --> 01:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
to do is have a committee work session
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
on this bill next week after our public
 
01:15:04.629 --> 01:15:04.639 align:start position:0%
hearings is there any opposition to
 
01:15:09.510 --> 01:15:09.520 align:start position:0%
that um let's see when do we end next
 
01:15:14.149 --> 01:15:14.159 align:start position:0%
week I believe I believe it's two so we
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
can have a quick committee work session
 
01:15:17.310 --> 01:15:17.320 align:start position:0%
on that with with that version of the
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
bill and see and go from there does
 
01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
anybody disagree with
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
that all right so I will schedule that
 
01:15:29.030 --> 01:15:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and so the last bill I have on the
 
01:15:34.590 --> 01:15:34.600 align:start position:0%
agenda is um HB 685 which is relative to
 
01:15:36.030 --> 01:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing and residential
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
zones so I had handed uh out a uh a a
 
01:15:43.270 --> 01:15:43.280 align:start position:0%
redlined although it's not color it's
 
01:15:45.070 --> 01:15:45.080 align:start position:0%
not color coded but it's a Redline
 
01:15:46.189 --> 01:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
version of
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
685 and allow me just a minute or two to
 
01:15:51.990 --> 01:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
go over those uh recommended changes
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
so section 2 line 1314 States
 
01:15:57.149 --> 01:15:57.159 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding any provision of law to
 
01:15:59.590 --> 01:15:59.600 align:start position:0%
the contrary manufactured housing shall
 
01:16:02.950 --> 01:16:02.960 align:start position:0%
be permitted in zones with area zoned
 
01:16:12.470 --> 01:16:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:16.669 --> 01:16:16.679 align:start position:0%
um the term residential zoned areas is
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
imprecise so what I want to do is um
 
01:16:22.310 --> 01:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
switch it to land areas and lots and
 
01:16:26.590 --> 01:16:26.600 align:start position:0%
District zone to permit residential uses
 
01:16:29.470 --> 01:16:29.480 align:start position:0%
much shorter and more um
 
01:16:32.070 --> 01:16:32.080 align:start position:0%
clear number two is section two line
 
01:16:35.030 --> 01:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
1516 paragraph two doesn't address what
 
01:16:36.870 --> 01:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
happens if municipality fails to amend
 
01:16:38.990 --> 01:16:39.000 align:start position:0%
its zoning ordes so ensuring that a
 
01:16:41.229 --> 01:16:41.239 align:start position:0%
manufactured housing is treated as
 
01:16:43.470 --> 01:16:43.480 align:start position:0%
permitted in use in all man all
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
residential areas
 
01:16:49.110 --> 01:16:49.120 align:start position:0%
um just adding that language in there
 
01:16:58.590 --> 01:16:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.870 --> 01:16:59.880 align:start position:0%
I actually don't think we necessarily
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
need that line
 
01:17:03.750 --> 01:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
because if the municipality does not
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
amend their
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
zoning statute it's it is what it is the
 
01:17:10.590 --> 01:17:10.600 align:start position:0%
state over the state trumps the
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
municipali zoning ordinances on that
 
01:17:13.120 --> 01:17:14.149 align:start position:0%
municipali zoning ordinances on that
representative

01:17:14.149 --> 01:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:17:16.510 --> 01:17:16.520 align:start position:0%
Howen just to that point to the
 
01:17:18.870 --> 01:17:18.880 align:start position:0%
effective date is 60 days after passage
 
01:17:20.590 --> 01:17:20.600 align:start position:0%
so the municipality wouldn't have time
 
01:17:23.950 --> 01:17:23.960 align:start position:0%
to amend it yep so I would also so
 
01:17:25.709 --> 01:17:25.719 align:start position:0%
another amendment would be to move out
 
01:17:28.030 --> 01:17:28.040 align:start position:0%
the effective date but um I might
 
01:17:30.270 --> 01:17:30.280 align:start position:0%
actually want to scratch line
 
01:17:32.669 --> 01:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
1516 completely out of the next of the
 
01:17:35.790 --> 01:17:35.800 align:start position:0%
vill he giving them a year to comply in
 
01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.270 align:start position:0%
vill he giving them a year to comply in
line

01:17:37.270 --> 01:17:37.280 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
23 so who cares if it takes 60 days let
 
01:17:51.149 --> 01:17:51.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:57.270 --> 01:17:57.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:00.669 --> 01:18:00.679 align:start position:0%
goes they have a year it does say that
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:07.510 --> 01:18:07.520 align:start position:0%
said all municipalities shall amend
 
01:18:09.149 --> 01:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
their zoning hes to comply with the
 
01:18:10.709 --> 01:18:10.719 align:start position:0%
statute within six months the effective
 
01:18:13.750 --> 01:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
date my um my red line would change it
 
01:18:16.350 --> 01:18:16.360 align:start position:0%
to a year so even if the bill took
 
01:18:18.990 --> 01:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
effect 60 days after passage they would
 
01:18:20.350 --> 01:18:20.360 align:start position:0%
still have a full year to amend their
 
01:18:22.750 --> 01:18:22.760 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinances and even if they
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
didn't the that's the law I mean the
 
01:18:28.189 --> 01:18:28.199 align:start position:0%
that's what the state said so uh
 
01:18:28.199 --> 01:18:30.669 align:start position:0%
that's what the state said so uh
representative

01:18:30.669 --> 01:18:30.679 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:18:34.229 --> 01:18:34.239 align:start position:0%
Gibbs I would prefer to keep uh lines 15
 
01:18:37.310 --> 01:18:37.320 align:start position:0%
and 16 requiring that Municipal
 
01:18:39.350 --> 01:18:39.360 align:start position:0%
municipalities change their zoning
 
01:18:41.750 --> 01:18:41.760 align:start position:0%
ordinances and certainly you know give
 
01:18:44.390 --> 01:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
them a year to do it that's reasonable
 
01:18:46.550 --> 01:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
um if you don't do that I think you're
 
01:18:48.990 --> 01:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
inviting litigation and there's no need
 
01:18:51.950 --> 01:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
to invite any more litigation than
 
01:18:54.550 --> 01:18:54.560 align:start position:0%
necessary well I I I agree with that I
 
01:18:57.149 --> 01:18:57.159 align:start position:0%
think think there's other like things
 
01:18:59.510 --> 01:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
that we did last year for instance the
 
01:19:02.510 --> 01:19:02.520 align:start position:0%
parking we changed parking last year and
 
01:19:04.629 --> 01:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
now in March in Goffstown we're voting
 
01:19:07.550 --> 01:19:07.560 align:start position:0%
on amending our zoning ordinances to
 
01:19:10.470 --> 01:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
update with the state the state New
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
definition of what what they require for
 
01:19:15.669 --> 01:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
parking and the way I read it is even if
 
01:19:18.270 --> 01:19:18.280 align:start position:0%
that warrant didn't pass that would be
 
01:19:21.070 --> 01:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
the law anyways the the municipality
 
01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:22.400 align:start position:0%
would just have a conflicting with the
 
01:19:24.830 --> 01:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
law but in this situation the state law
 
01:19:26.390 --> 01:19:26.400 align:start position:0%
trumps the municipal
 
01:19:28.669 --> 01:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
orians that's what that that's how I'm
 
01:19:30.510 --> 01:19:30.520 align:start position:0%
reading it I don't think I don't think
 
01:19:34.110 --> 01:19:34.120 align:start position:0%
it would be very uh uous L litigation I
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
think that's pretty clear but go ahead
 
01:19:42.470 --> 01:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
repres I I agree um the problem is that
 
01:19:46.030 --> 01:19:46.040 align:start position:0%
if the municipality said no we have our
 
01:19:47.790 --> 01:19:47.800 align:start position:0%
we have our zoning ordinance and we're
 
01:19:51.950 --> 01:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
going to enforce it and then the um uh
 
01:19:54.390 --> 01:19:54.400 align:start position:0%
property owner would have to go to court
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um to say no the state law trumps and
 
01:20:00.669 --> 01:20:00.679 align:start position:0%
the state state law would Trump but you
 
01:20:05.510 --> 01:20:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:08.110 --> 01:20:08.120 align:start position:0%
it is anybody opposed with leaving it in
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
I mean I don't I don't necessarily think
 
01:20:12.270 --> 01:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
it's necessary but go ahead represent
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
Dumont I was going to say I'm fine with
 
01:20:15.669 --> 01:20:15.679 align:start position:0%
it either way I think that I think they
 
01:20:17.350 --> 01:20:17.360 align:start position:0%
both work fine I mean state law at the
 
01:20:18.910 --> 01:20:18.920 align:start position:0%
end of the day is what will take set
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
precedent so okay and then the last
 
01:20:23.790 --> 01:20:23.800 align:start position:0%
change I have in my red line is on line
 
01:20:26.229 --> 01:20:26.239 align:start position:0%
2526 it would Scratch Out represent
 
01:20:27.990 --> 01:20:28.000 align:start position:0%
Daxton asked during the public hearing
 
01:20:29.870 --> 01:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
he's like who's the State Department of
 
01:20:31.470 --> 01:20:31.480 align:start position:0%
Housing and Urban Development and I was
 
01:20:33.030 --> 01:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
like oh that's that's a good point and I
 
01:20:35.709 --> 01:20:35.719 align:start position:0%
don't really want to necessarily um rely
 
01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:37.440 align:start position:0%
on the federal government to do anything
 
01:20:40.189 --> 01:20:40.199 align:start position:0%
so um leaving them out of
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
the legislation and the the law would be
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
good so um kind of wondering what the
 
01:20:53.629 --> 01:20:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:56.950 --> 01:20:56.960 align:start position:0%
proposed representive Aon uh my concern
 
01:20:59.189 --> 01:20:59.199 align:start position:0%
with this bill is how many manufactured
 
01:21:02.590 --> 01:21:02.600 align:start position:0%
homes can you put on a lot because uh
 
01:21:06.030 --> 01:21:06.040 align:start position:0%
Charlestown has a lot of trailer parks
 
01:21:10.430 --> 01:21:10.440 align:start position:0%
and they have a huge tax problem so you
 
01:21:13.270 --> 01:21:13.280 align:start position:0%
need to be able to let a municipality
 
01:21:16.110 --> 01:21:16.120 align:start position:0%
decide no trailer
 
01:21:18.950 --> 01:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
parks so if you want to put a
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
manufactured home on your own lot that's
 
01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
fine no problem but if you want to put
 
01:21:28.870 --> 01:21:28.880 align:start position:0%
20 of them in there that should be uh up
 
01:21:31.270 --> 01:21:31.280 align:start position:0%
to the municipality to permit that right
 
01:21:32.790 --> 01:21:32.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what this bill does so it it
 
01:21:34.430 --> 01:21:34.440 align:start position:0%
updates the definition of manufactured
 
01:21:36.030 --> 01:21:36.040 align:start position:0%
housing on a permanent chassis but
 
01:21:38.189 --> 01:21:38.199 align:start position:0%
additionally this just says single
 
01:21:41.550 --> 01:21:41.560 align:start position:0%
family residentially zoned areas
 
01:21:44.350 --> 01:21:44.360 align:start position:0%
so if it Zone single family you couldn't
 
01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
put more than one on there that that
 
01:21:48.149 --> 01:21:48.159 align:start position:0%
makes sense so it that should alleviate
 
01:21:49.910 --> 01:21:49.920 align:start position:0%
your concern with that thank you
 
01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:51.350 align:start position:0%
your concern with that thank you
represent

01:21:51.350 --> 01:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
paig I'm supportive okay you're just
 
01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
asking for input
 
01:21:57.070 --> 01:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
he supportive with this
 
01:21:59.229 --> 01:21:59.239 align:start position:0%
amendment all right so I'm going to get
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
this drafted too and hopefully we can
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
get um this bill out next
 
01:22:09.390 --> 01:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
um next Tuesday so I'll probably pull it
 
01:22:11.350 --> 01:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
up during executive session at some
 
01:22:11.360 --> 01:22:13.070 align:start position:0%
up during executive session at some
point

01:22:13.070 --> 01:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:22:15.470 --> 01:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
um that's what I have
 
01:22:18.270 --> 01:22:18.280 align:start position:0%
for um bills for the work session I had
 
01:22:21.270 --> 01:22:21.280 align:start position:0%
a couple bills to exec I want to see
 
01:22:23.189 --> 01:22:23.199 align:start position:0%

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
309 I handed an amendment to the
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee earlier um 0342 is is there a
 
01:35:26.590 --> 01:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
second to that motion I second that
 
01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative mil seconds it so real
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
quickly um I thought we saw that there
 
01:35:35.310 --> 01:35:35.320 align:start position:0%
was um a little there was Merit to this
 
01:35:37.709 --> 01:35:37.719 align:start position:0%
um by requiring at least one
 
01:35:40.590 --> 01:35:40.600 align:start position:0%
non-electronic form of payment um this
 
01:35:44.350 --> 01:35:44.360 align:start position:0%
amendment would just add to lines um
 
01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
after after section one of the bill oh
 
01:35:49.070 --> 01:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
inserted by it would just replace
 
01:35:51.430 --> 01:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
section one of the bill um to say that
 
01:35:53.030 --> 01:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
the landlord shall allow at least at
 
01:35:54.709 --> 01:35:54.719 align:start position:0%
least one other non- electronic form of
 
01:35:56.750 --> 01:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
payment for the purposes of this section
 
01:35:59.470 --> 01:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
I just think it makes it more clear um
 
01:36:01.270 --> 01:36:01.280 align:start position:0%
and I think it addresses the concerns
 
01:36:03.109 --> 01:36:03.119 align:start position:0%
raised by the sponsor of the bill and it
 
01:36:05.470 --> 01:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
moves the bill forward so are there are
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:14.510 --> 01:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
amendment great represent paage just
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
noting my support I think this is just a
 
01:36:19.430 --> 01:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
clarification rather than a change in
 
01:36:24.149 --> 01:36:24.159 align:start position:0%
intent okay um so with that um we need
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
to I'll just do a show of hands for the
 
01:36:28.510 --> 01:36:28.520 align:start position:0%
amendment so you don't need to take a
 
01:36:32.189 --> 01:36:32.199 align:start position:0%
roll on this um all those in favor of
 
01:36:35.669 --> 01:36:35.679 align:start position:0%
adopting Amendment 2025 0342 raise your
 
01:36:35.679 --> 01:36:36.950 align:start position:0%
adopting Amendment 2025 0342 raise your
hand

01:36:36.950 --> 01:36:36.960 align:start position:0%
hand
 
01:36:40.510 --> 01:36:40.520 align:start position:0%
now those opposed all right we're uh
 
01:36:42.709 --> 01:36:42.719 align:start position:0%
that was adopted you can just make a
 
01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:46.040 align:start position:0%
note that that was adopted um 17 to
 
01:36:49.390 --> 01:36:49.400 align:start position:0%
Z and so now we're on the emotion motion
 
01:36:52.109 --> 01:36:52.119 align:start position:0%
of ought to pass as amended I made that
 
01:36:54.910 --> 01:36:54.920 align:start position:0%
motion it was second by represent miles

to open the executive session on HB 350
 
01:38:26.070 --> 01:38:26.080 align:start position:0%
1 and I would like to recognize
 
01:38:28.470 --> 01:38:28.480 align:start position:0%
representative Faxton for a
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
motion my motion would be itl is there a
 
01:38:33.950 --> 01:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
second representative Cole seconds it
 
01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.510 --> 01:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
ahead uh I don't think expanding the
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
notice to tenants to 60 days is
 
01:38:46.270 --> 01:38:46.280 align:start position:0%
necessary I think uh there's adequate
 
01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.310 align:start position:0%
necessary I think uh there's adequate
current

01:38:47.310 --> 01:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
protections and it may actually be in
 
01:38:53.589 --> 01:38:53.599 align:start position:0%
conflict with uh other parts of the
 
01:38:58.350 --> 01:38:58.360 align:start position:0%
landlord tenant law because the current
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
law as my understanding of it is I was
 
01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:03.480 align:start position:0%
trying to look it up quickly is that the
 
01:39:05.430 --> 01:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
notice to a tenant is
 
01:39:09.109 --> 01:39:09.119 align:start position:0%
actually uh determined by the length of
 
01:39:11.270 --> 01:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
the normal rental payment
 
01:39:14.350 --> 01:39:14.360 align:start position:0%
interval uh so if you have someone who
 
01:39:16.709 --> 01:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
rents on a weekly basis and those
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
tenants do exist in this state uh the
 
01:39:23.990 --> 01:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
the notice to them is one week uh if you
 
01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:27.199 align:start position:0%
have someone who rents semiannually or
 
01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:29.840 align:start position:0%
annually it would be that period of time
 
01:39:32.790 --> 01:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
so my concern is but if we adopted this
 
01:39:35.470 --> 01:39:35.480 align:start position:0%
you would be muddying the water in
 
01:39:37.550 --> 01:39:37.560 align:start position:0%
everything other than what we think of
 
01:39:40.950 --> 01:39:40.960 align:start position:0%
as a standard rental of 30
 
01:39:44.189 --> 01:39:44.199 align:start position:0%
days representative Reed thank you Mr
 
01:39:48.390 --> 01:39:48.400 align:start position:0%
chair um I am opposed to the itl motion
 
01:39:51.550 --> 01:39:51.560 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed because we currently um give
 
01:39:53.350 --> 01:39:53.360 align:start position:0%
tenants who are in month-to-month situ
 
01:39:56.189 --> 01:39:56.199 align:start position:0%
situations 30 days notice of a rent
 
01:39:59.589 --> 01:39:59.599 align:start position:0%
increase and uh of an
 
01:40:01.990 --> 01:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
eviction that has the potential and and
 
01:40:03.470 --> 01:40:03.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to remind everybody some
 
01:40:05.870 --> 01:40:05.880 align:start position:0%
people 70% of tenants are in
 
01:40:08.109 --> 01:40:08.119 align:start position:0%
month-to-month agreements some of those
 
01:40:11.390 --> 01:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
Agreements are over a decade or maybe
 
01:40:13.750 --> 01:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
you know two decades so it's not like
 
01:40:16.270 --> 01:40:16.280 align:start position:0%
you ended your lease and now
 
01:40:18.070 --> 01:40:18.080 align:start position:0%
everything's up in the air you may have
 
01:40:20.669 --> 01:40:20.679 align:start position:0%
been stable for years and years and all
 
01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
of a sudden your landlord wants to evict
 
01:40:25.510 --> 01:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
you now we just as the committee and as
 
01:40:28.149 --> 01:40:28.159 align:start position:0%
the entire body said that in some cases
 
01:40:30.350 --> 01:40:30.360 align:start position:0%
we want to give people 60 days notice we
 
01:40:33.510 --> 01:40:33.520 align:start position:0%
enshrined 60 days notice so I think that
 
01:40:36.270 --> 01:40:36.280 align:start position:0%
60-day notice should um in fact I think
 
01:40:37.790 --> 01:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
there was a press release that kind of
 
01:40:39.750 --> 01:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
implied that all evictions now had 60
 
01:40:41.950 --> 01:40:41.960 align:start position:0%
days notice and that was weird because
 
01:40:44.189 --> 01:40:44.199 align:start position:0%
that's not what we did as a body as I
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
recall but I think we should I think we
 
01:40:48.430 --> 01:40:48.440 align:start position:0%
should give everybody who were going to
 
01:40:50.430 --> 01:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
evict a 60-day notice because finding a
 
01:40:51.950 --> 01:40:51.960 align:start position:0%
new place especially in this market is
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
incredibly difficult
 
01:40:55.669 --> 01:40:55.679 align:start position:0%
and if there are any inconsistencies
 
01:40:58.390 --> 01:40:58.400 align:start position:0%
which I I actually don't think there are
 
01:40:59.950 --> 01:40:59.960 align:start position:0%
and the current 608 noes by the way
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
applies to six month leases um then I
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
think that that should be amended so I
 
01:41:09.870 --> 01:41:09.880 align:start position:0%
am in support in this 0.6% vacancy of
 
01:41:11.550 --> 01:41:11.560 align:start position:0%
giving people 60 days notice because
 
01:41:13.030 --> 01:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
it's going to take at least that long to
 
01:41:16.470 --> 01:41:16.480 align:start position:0%
find a cardboard box to live in well
 
01:41:19.750 --> 01:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your um for
 
01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
speaking on that I think you're
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
confusing a termination of lease with an
 
01:41:26.229 --> 01:41:26.239 align:start position:0%
eviction so I just want I just want to
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
clarify for the committee this is this
 
01:41:30.790 --> 01:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with the termination
 
01:41:34.030 --> 01:41:34.040 align:start position:0%
of lease that we just passed no I I I
 
01:41:35.350 --> 01:41:35.360 align:start position:0%
know it's a different bill and I
 
01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
understand the difference between the
 
01:41:38.830 --> 01:41:38.840 align:start position:0%
two bills this bill gives a 60-day
 
01:41:41.030 --> 01:41:41.040 align:start position:0%
notice of eviction for people who are
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
out of their lease specifically if
 
01:41:44.790 --> 01:41:44.800 align:start position:0%
you're in a month-to-month agreement and
 
01:41:47.070 --> 01:41:47.080 align:start position:0%
then the landlord evicts you for another
 
01:41:50.669 --> 01:41:50.679 align:start position:0%
cause we now having passed the house
 
01:41:52.790 --> 01:41:52.800 align:start position:0%
created a new cause of eviction so that
 
01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
60 notice that you give under the new
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
termination of lease or you know your
 
01:41:59.910 --> 01:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
that is a an eviction notice a 60-day
 
01:42:03.109 --> 01:42:03.119 align:start position:0%
eviction notice the cause is termination
 
01:42:04.589 --> 01:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
of lease the cause listed on the
 
01:42:06.669 --> 01:42:06.679 align:start position:0%
eviction notice is termination of lease
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
but it is a notice of eviction that they
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
get 60 days so now we have one cause of
 
01:42:13.390 --> 01:42:13.400 align:start position:0%
eviction that we're giving 60 days to a
 
01:42:15.310 --> 01:42:15.320 align:start position:0%
cause that we never had before and now
 
01:42:16.870 --> 01:42:16.880 align:start position:0%
we have all the other causes that we're
 
01:42:19.550 --> 01:42:19.560 align:start position:0%
not giving 60 days to and that 60 days
 
01:42:21.109 --> 01:42:21.119 align:start position:0%
apply the one that we just passed
 
01:42:23.709 --> 01:42:23.719 align:start position:0%
applies to even six-month leases
 
01:42:27.470 --> 01:42:27.480 align:start position:0%
so it's not even based on the the tency
 
01:42:30.790 --> 01:42:30.800 align:start position:0%
so having said that that's why I support
 
01:42:34.270 --> 01:42:34.280 align:start position:0%
it what was in a press release implied
 
01:42:36.310 --> 01:42:36.320 align:start position:0%
that we were giving tenets protections
 
01:42:39.229 --> 01:42:39.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:43.109 --> 01:42:43.119 align:start position:0%

01:43:57.109 --> 01:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
okay and the last bill I would like to
 
01:44:00.270 --> 01:44:00.280 align:start position:0%
EXA today is HB 628 relative to
 
01:44:01.870 --> 01:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
prohibiting landlords from
 
01:44:03.229 --> 01:44:03.239 align:start position:0%
discriminating against prospective
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
tenants holding certain vouchers under
 
01:44:06.589 --> 01:44:06.599 align:start position:0%
housing Choice Voucher Program I'd like
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
to call and represent bolo for a
 
01:44:11.669 --> 01:44:11.679 align:start position:0%
motion Mr chairman I move uh an
 
01:44:14.109 --> 01:44:14.119 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate is there a second
 
01:44:15.870 --> 01:44:15.880 align:start position:0%
second representative Cole seconds
 
01:44:17.030 --> 01:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
discussion go
 
01:44:20.030 --> 01:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
ahead yeah so on on this one I think
 
01:44:21.629 --> 01:44:21.639 align:start position:0%
this one will actually set up sort of an
 
01:44:24.750 --> 01:44:24.760 align:start position:0%
perverse incentive to raise rent or to
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
have um you know other costs passed on
 
01:44:29.750 --> 01:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
to other tenants um there was quite a
 
01:44:31.950 --> 01:44:31.960 align:start position:0%
bit of opposition when it came to
 
01:44:34.350 --> 01:44:34.360 align:start position:0%
testimony um it also forces landlords to
 
01:44:36.550 --> 01:44:36.560 align:start position:0%
sign a government contract and it could
 
01:44:38.149 --> 01:44:38.159 align:start position:0%
lead to an increase in rents with a
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
reduction in
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
quality um so I I really think that uh
 
01:44:45.149 --> 01:44:45.159 align:start position:0%
it really should be up to landlords
 
01:44:46.510 --> 01:44:46.520 align:start position:0%
themselves to decide whether or not they
 
01:44:48.990 --> 01:44:49.000 align:start position:0%
want to get involved with um you know
 
01:44:50.990 --> 01:44:51.000 align:start position:0%
some of these voucher
 
01:44:53.669 --> 01:44:53.679 align:start position:0%
programs representative howand
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
so so I actually brought this up because
 
01:44:58.350 --> 01:44:58.360 align:start position:0%
there was no sponsor and we've run into
 
01:45:00.270 --> 01:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
an issue when we did our Workforce
 
01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.229 align:start position:0%
an issue when we did our Workforce
housing

01:45:01.229 --> 01:45:01.239 align:start position:0%
housing
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
overlay and it's I think what was
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
brought up is like somebody who had the
 
01:45:08.430 --> 01:45:08.440 align:start position:0%
voucher didn't have enough money to pay
 
01:45:11.030 --> 01:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
for what the market rate rent was and
 
01:45:14.310 --> 01:45:14.320 align:start position:0%
that the the ATT tenant uh couldn't pay
 
01:45:16.149 --> 01:45:16.159 align:start position:0%
the difference and I went to Hud's
 
01:45:17.910 --> 01:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
website and that they said they could it
 
01:45:20.310 --> 01:45:20.320 align:start position:0%
may different on different vouchers HUD
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
definitely doesn't want to do that cuz
 
01:45:23.669 --> 01:45:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's inflationary in terms of like
 
01:45:26.310 --> 01:45:26.320 align:start position:0%
rental rates if you start saying okay
 
01:45:28.470 --> 01:45:28.480 align:start position:0%
you can pay $50 more than your voucher
 
01:45:31.070 --> 01:45:31.080 align:start position:0%
then it'll raise the local area rents
 
01:45:33.669 --> 01:45:33.679 align:start position:0%
why I brought this up is that um
 
01:45:37.830 --> 01:45:37.840 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing rental statute and uh
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
fair market rental which is the top of
 
01:45:42.950 --> 01:45:42.960 align:start position:0%
the voucher they're not calculated the
 
01:45:45.430 --> 01:45:45.440 align:start position:0%
same the fair market rent which the
 
01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:49.119 align:start position:0%
voucher is done is 40% of the median uh
 
01:45:52.070 --> 01:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
rents in your area and then the
 
01:45:54.430 --> 01:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
workforce hous is based on your
 
01:45:56.669 --> 01:45:56.679 align:start position:0%
percentage of area median income and
 
01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
what we've seen right now because local
 
01:46:01.629 --> 01:46:01.639 align:start position:0%
rents are really high believe it or not
 
01:46:03.589 --> 01:46:03.599 align:start position:0%
the fair market rent which is the
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
voucher is higher than is for the uh
 
01:46:10.430 --> 01:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
Workforce standard um I had it down in
 
01:46:14.070 --> 01:46:14.080 align:start position:0%
here with uh I wrote the number down in
 
01:46:16.550 --> 01:46:16.560 align:start position:0%
my notes it's about call it
 
01:46:19.030 --> 01:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
1950 for fair market the top of the
 
01:46:21.430 --> 01:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
voucher right now in straford County but
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
when you do like Workforce housing it's
 
01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
only like 1,800 and so for us we were in
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
this perverse situation which one of
 
01:46:31.950 --> 01:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
these do we use when we put our
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
Workforce housing which were requiring a
 
01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:36.199 align:start position:0%
certain amount to be in statute or into
 
01:46:39.030 --> 01:46:39.040 align:start position:0%
our local ordinance and so we we didn't
 
01:46:43.030 --> 01:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
want to not use the voucher and we
 
01:46:44.910 --> 01:46:44.920 align:start position:0%
wanted to be in compliance with the
 
01:46:47.270 --> 01:46:47.280 align:start position:0%
workforce we ended up going and do as
 
01:46:49.709 --> 01:46:49.719 align:start position:0%
well has gone with fair market rental
 
01:46:51.430 --> 01:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
just because if it changes then we
 
01:46:52.910 --> 01:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say you can't accept the
 
01:46:55.669 --> 01:46:55.679 align:start position:0%
voucher and so it really creates
 
01:46:57.430 --> 01:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
uncertainty and I can see from your
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
faces that it's increas causing
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
uncertainty there it's really weird
 
01:47:02.950 --> 01:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
because the two standards are not the
 
01:47:04.790 --> 01:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
same so in essence when we did the
 
01:47:07.310 --> 01:47:07.320 align:start position:0%
workforce housing overlay and we used
 
01:47:10.149 --> 01:47:10.159 align:start position:0%
fair market rent we could rent to
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
everybody with a voucher and not be in
 
01:47:14.229 --> 01:47:14.239 align:start position:0%
compliance with our Workforce housing
 
01:47:17.189 --> 01:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
statute so I just if we have a notebook
 
01:47:19.390 --> 01:47:19.400 align:start position:0%
of things to look at for like next term
 
01:47:20.790 --> 01:47:20.800 align:start position:0%
that's something that maybe we would
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
want to look up and that's why I brought
 
01:47:26.550 --> 01:47:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:27.709 --> 01:47:27.719 align:start position:0%
representative we have a whole another
 
01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:29.920 align:start position:0%
year to file house bills so not even
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
next term sorry I mean I I just wanted
 
01:47:34.790 --> 01:47:34.800 align:start position:0%
to have it on the table that's why I
 
01:47:35.790 --> 01:47:35.800 align:start position:0%
brought it up great thank you
 
01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:37.270 align:start position:0%
brought it up great thank you
representative

01:47:37.270 --> 01:47:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you Mr chair um I just want
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
to add to the discussion um what I said
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh during our last discussion on this
 
01:47:49.709 --> 01:47:49.719 align:start position:0%
bill and that is that by discriminating
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
uh against people with vouchers um uh
 
01:47:55.629 --> 01:47:55.639 align:start position:0%
the landlord is thereby discriminating
 
01:47:57.310 --> 01:47:57.320 align:start position:0%
against families with children and
 
01:47:59.629 --> 01:47:59.639 align:start position:0%
people with
 
01:48:02.149 --> 01:48:02.159 align:start position:0%
disabilities let representative I I
 
01:48:04.390 --> 01:48:04.400 align:start position:0%
don't understand your line of
 
01:48:06.350 --> 01:48:06.360 align:start position:0%
questioning during the public hearing
 
01:48:08.629 --> 01:48:08.639 align:start position:0%
because th those don't have to be mutual
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
exclusive not every person that has a
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
voucher has children and not every
 
01:48:14.510 --> 01:48:14.520 align:start position:0%
person that has a voucher is disabled
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
they are disabled people that don't have
 
01:48:17.750 --> 01:48:17.760 align:start position:0%
vouchers that cannot be discriminated
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
against there are be there are you can't
 
01:48:22.229 --> 01:48:22.239 align:start position:0%
discriminate already in law based on
 
01:48:26.350 --> 01:48:26.360 align:start position:0%
famili familiar status so I'm I'm trying
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
I was trying to be patient during the
 
01:48:29.669 --> 01:48:29.679 align:start position:0%
public hearing but I really was confused
 
01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
what your what your point was there uh
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
my point was that a discriminatory
 
01:48:37.629 --> 01:48:37.639 align:start position:0%
effect is
 
01:48:40.870 --> 01:48:40.880 align:start position:0%
discrimination and because there are
 
01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:43.159 align:start position:0%
more PE more families with children and
 
01:48:45.510 --> 01:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
more people with disabilities who have
 
01:48:48.510 --> 01:48:48.520 align:start position:0%
vouchers there's a discriminatory effect
 
01:48:50.910 --> 01:48:50.920 align:start position:0%
in against families with children and
 
01:48:52.950 --> 01:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
against people with disabilities by
 
01:48:54.830 --> 01:48:54.840 align:start position:0%
discriminating against
 
01:48:58.030 --> 01:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
vouchers thank you representative
 
01:49:01.870 --> 01:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
Reed thank you Mr chair um I'm grateful
 
01:49:02.950 --> 01:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
for the
 
01:49:05.390 --> 01:49:05.400 align:start position:0%
conversation that uh rep buolo and rep
 
01:49:07.990 --> 01:49:08.000 align:start position:0%
Howen started having around rent seeking
 
01:49:10.310 --> 01:49:10.320 align:start position:0%
Behavior which is I guess unfortunately
 
01:49:12.510 --> 01:49:12.520 align:start position:0%
a pun but I brought it up during the
 
01:49:15.229 --> 01:49:15.239 align:start position:0%
hearing and rent-seeking behavior is
 
01:49:18.149 --> 01:49:18.159 align:start position:0%
when the private Market takes advantage
 
01:49:20.470 --> 01:49:20.480 align:start position:0%
of either a handout or another
 
01:49:23.669 --> 01:49:23.679 align:start position:0%
guaranteed um source of income and
 
01:49:27.350 --> 01:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
raises prices to take advantage of that
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
that's rent-seeking behavior and um it's
 
01:49:33.430 --> 01:49:33.440 align:start position:0%
true that when you have some sort of
 
01:49:37.350 --> 01:49:37.360 align:start position:0%
public handout if you don't put a cap
 
01:49:39.149 --> 01:49:39.159 align:start position:0%
then people the private Market will
 
01:49:40.750 --> 01:49:40.760 align:start position:0%
engage in rent-seeking behavior and that
 
01:49:43.990 --> 01:49:44.000 align:start position:0%
will be inflationary so it in because of
 
01:49:45.709 --> 01:49:45.719 align:start position:0%
that logic I would have suggested that
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
you all go with the workforce housing
 
01:49:50.030 --> 01:49:50.040 align:start position:0%
not the fair market um I was like why
 
01:49:52.750 --> 01:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
did you do that so I I'm appreciative of
 
01:49:56.629 --> 01:49:56.639 align:start position:0%
of that um and that problem having said
 
01:49:58.270 --> 01:49:58.280 align:start position:0%
that there are landlords in fact
 
01:50:00.390 --> 01:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
landlords who have testified before us
 
01:50:03.589 --> 01:50:03.599 align:start position:0%
who in my own town have engaged because
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
they do take vouchers in that exact rent
 
01:50:07.310 --> 01:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
seeking Behavior and the more the
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
voucher goes up the more they raise the
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
rent right and they raise it to just
 
01:50:13.350 --> 01:50:13.360 align:start position:0%
enough above the difference that the
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
people can afford constantly every
 
01:50:16.830 --> 01:50:16.840 align:start position:0%
single time even though their costs
 
01:50:19.070 --> 01:50:19.080 align:start position:0%
haven't gone up so that is a problem
 
01:50:20.589 --> 01:50:20.599 align:start position:0%
that needs to be dealt with anytime you
 
01:50:24.070 --> 01:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
create a a a program that gives people
 
01:50:27.229 --> 01:50:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh monetary assistance for a particular
 
01:50:29.709 --> 01:50:29.719 align:start position:0%
item having said that I am still in
 
01:50:32.910 --> 01:50:32.920 align:start position:0%
favor of the bill um the way I would put
 
01:50:34.310 --> 01:50:34.320 align:start position:0%
it and I think representative Gibbs is
 
01:50:36.070 --> 01:50:36.080 align:start position:0%
trying to get to this point but we heard
 
01:50:37.589 --> 01:50:37.599 align:start position:0%
from a different landlord not the one
 
01:50:39.870 --> 01:50:39.880 align:start position:0%
that I just referenced we heard a
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
comment from that landlord directly
 
01:50:45.990 --> 01:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
saying that if you take away our ability
 
01:50:48.310 --> 01:50:48.320 align:start position:0%
to discriminate on the basis of
 
01:50:51.470 --> 01:50:51.480 align:start position:0%
vouchers we then would not legally be
 
01:50:53.629 --> 01:50:53.639 align:start position:0%
able to determine who fits in our
 
01:50:55.270 --> 01:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
community and those were the words he
 
01:50:58.669 --> 01:50:58.679 align:start position:0%
used so that is basically admitting that
 
01:51:00.950 --> 01:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
he wants to engage and other I'm meaning
 
01:51:02.149 --> 01:51:02.159 align:start position:0%
it generally because there are other
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
landlords I'm not all landlords but
 
01:51:05.830 --> 01:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
there are landlords out there who want
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
to engage in what we currently consider
 
01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:09.390 align:start position:0%
to engage in what we currently consider
illegal

01:51:09.390 --> 01:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
illegal
 
01:51:11.830 --> 01:51:11.840 align:start position:0%
discrimination and the only legal tool
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
they currently have is to discriminate
 
01:51:16.350 --> 01:51:16.360 align:start position:0%
on the form of payment and so for that
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
reason I support the bill although I do
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
acknowledge the rent sinking Behavior
 
01:51:20.159 --> 01:51:23.430 align:start position:0%

04:01:42.830 --> 04:01:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:43.670 --> 04:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
to to try to override what is in essence
 
04:02:49.910 --> 04:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
of bad bad zoning and so I mean I my
 
04:02:51.670 --> 04:02:51.680 align:start position:0%
mind is always
 
04:02:54.510 --> 04:02:54.520 align:start position:0%
like I know no zoning ordinance is
 
04:02:56.550 --> 04:02:56.560 align:start position:0%
perfect but you want to try to keep the
 
04:02:58.189 --> 04:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
number of variances to a minimum if
 
04:02:59.670 --> 04:02:59.680 align:start position:0%
you're doing a good job if you have a
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
lot of variances coming in then fix your
 
04:03:05.510 --> 04:03:05.520 align:start position:0%
zoning ordinance and so when I the key
 
04:03:09.389 --> 04:03:09.399 align:start position:0%
thing that I came through with the the
 
04:03:14.070 --> 04:03:14.080 align:start position:0%
uh thing that came to us is that it uh
 
04:03:15.590 --> 04:03:15.600 align:start position:0%
Property Owners shall be allowed to
 
04:03:17.269 --> 04:03:17.279 align:start position:0%
build on their property without seeking
 
04:03:19.950 --> 04:03:19.960 align:start position:0%
a variance and so when I read it what
 
04:03:22.229 --> 04:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
they're really trying to say is that the
 
04:03:24.950 --> 04:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
houses around them are a certain way and
 
04:03:26.630 --> 04:03:26.640 align:start position:0%
they want the right to do what people
 
04:03:28.309 --> 04:03:28.319 align:start position:0%
did in that neighborhood clearly
 
04:03:30.590 --> 04:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
something changed in the zoning that
 
04:03:31.830 --> 04:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
wasn't really
 
04:03:34.830 --> 04:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
effective so I I tried to grab somewhat
 
04:03:37.950 --> 04:03:37.960 align:start position:0%
off of what was in our partners bill
 
04:03:41.309 --> 04:03:41.319 align:start position:0%
which is that uh that patterns of zoning
 
04:03:43.870 --> 04:03:43.880 align:start position:0%
and so just the basic concept I said is
 
04:03:46.830 --> 04:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
that uh if you allow the governing body
 
04:03:49.030 --> 04:03:49.040 align:start position:0%
to put in an ordinance that says land
 
04:03:51.309 --> 04:03:51.319 align:start position:0%
owners are allowed to build on smaller
 
04:03:54.309 --> 04:03:54.319 align:start position:0%
Lots if the massing and fronting are
 
04:03:55.510 --> 04:03:55.520 align:start position:0%
consistent with the existing
 
04:03:59.510 --> 04:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood is what the idea is um the
 
04:04:01.510 --> 04:04:01.520 align:start position:0%
couple of challenges I had in there is
 
04:04:03.590 --> 04:04:03.600 align:start position:0%
that you'd have to figure out what the
 
04:04:07.309 --> 04:04:07.319 align:start position:0%
massing the the in that um enabling
 
04:04:08.870 --> 04:04:08.880 align:start position:0%
legislation they would have to put in
 
04:04:12.030 --> 04:04:12.040 align:start position:0%
what are permitted massing and and
 
04:04:14.269 --> 04:04:14.279 align:start position:0%
frontages and then the second
 
04:04:15.630 --> 04:04:15.640 align:start position:0%
thing which we already discussed which
 
04:04:18.510 --> 04:04:18.520 align:start position:0%
is more problematic is what exactly
 
04:04:21.110 --> 04:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
constitutes a neighborhood I'm a little
 
04:04:24.189 --> 04:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
nervous if you're going over zones and
 
04:04:26.110 --> 04:04:26.120 align:start position:0%
you're saying well this is a huge thing
 
04:04:28.389 --> 04:04:28.399 align:start position:0%
I'm allowed here and this I'm not can I
 
04:04:30.910 --> 04:04:30.920 align:start position:0%
allow it so so I think that's enough for
 
04:04:33.550 --> 04:04:33.560 align:start position:0%
my my sense and I'll just throw it out
 
04:05:07.710 --> 04:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:09.670 --> 04:05:09.680 align:start position:0%
I just think a th000 ft is pretty big
 
04:05:12.149 --> 04:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
it's like you know and again I I just I
 
04:05:15.389 --> 04:05:15.399 align:start position:0%
mean I talked to somebody who's uh the
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
chair of of Enfield and he said do it
 
04:05:20.309 --> 04:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
like three houses on either side or
 
04:05:22.870 --> 04:05:22.880 align:start position:0%
something like that I I'm not quite I
 
04:05:24.269 --> 04:05:24.279 align:start position:0%
mean that's a sticking point to me
 
04:05:24.279 --> 04:05:25.469 align:start position:0%
mean that's a sticking point to me
exactly

04:05:25.469 --> 04:05:25.479 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
04:05:27.469 --> 04:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
defining what you're allowing I was
 
04:05:29.670 --> 04:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
going to say within a Zone because I I
 
04:05:33.389 --> 04:05:33.399 align:start position:0%
think um in my mind we have one in
 
04:05:36.830 --> 04:05:36.840 align:start position:0%
Durham that is the faculty neighborhood
 
04:05:40.070 --> 04:05:40.080 align:start position:0%
and it had much smaller lots and you
 
04:05:44.550 --> 04:05:44.560 align:start position:0%
can't do that anywhere else so so I'm
 
04:05:45.790 --> 04:05:45.800 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of stuck I'm looking for
 
04:05:47.590 --> 04:05:47.600 align:start position:0%
guidance but wouldn't a Zone be bigger
 
04:05:51.189 --> 04:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
than a th000 ft it could be
 
04:05:53.710 --> 04:05:53.720 align:start position:0%
yeah but you've already kind of defined
 
04:06:00.429 --> 04:06:00.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:03.389 --> 04:06:03.399 align:start position:0%
so it has to be something specific
 
04:06:06.429 --> 04:06:06.439 align:start position:0%
that's clear enough um and I don't know
 
04:06:10.389 --> 04:06:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:13.149 --> 04:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
me yeah I would say that I would agree I
 
04:06:15.189 --> 04:06:15.199 align:start position:0%
think that you have to have some nomial
 
04:06:16.750 --> 04:06:16.760 align:start position:0%
number only because of what we talked
 
04:06:19.229 --> 04:06:19.239 align:start position:0%
about before at least in Hudson we have
 
04:06:20.950 --> 04:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of zones that they just threw a
 
04:06:23.030 --> 04:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
line down in the middle of neighborhoods
 
04:06:24.429 --> 04:06:24.439 align:start position:0%
or they were just you know they were
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
drone drawn all over the place they
 
04:06:29.070 --> 04:06:29.080 align:start position:0%
didn't actually run in any matter that
 
04:06:31.429 --> 04:06:31.439 align:start position:0%
made sense so for me that's where I was
 
04:06:32.630 --> 04:06:32.640 align:start position:0%
looking at that I think that that's
 
04:06:34.269 --> 04:06:34.279 align:start position:0%
where this creates a concern is where
 
04:06:36.149 --> 04:06:36.159 align:start position:0%
you have on one hand the neighborhood
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
was built a certain way and fits that
 
04:06:39.429 --> 04:06:39.439 align:start position:0%
zone or they and they drew a line right
 
04:06:41.469 --> 04:06:41.479 align:start position:0%
through it and the guy next door is now
 
04:06:43.110 --> 04:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
stuck conforming to something that
 
04:06:45.269 --> 04:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
really does fit in the neighborhood per
 
04:06:47.950 --> 04:06:47.960 align:start position:0%
se so since I have it saying that this
 
04:06:49.790 --> 04:06:49.800 align:start position:0%
is enabling and your local governing
 
04:06:51.790 --> 04:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
body is going to do that they could set
 
04:06:54.510 --> 04:06:54.520 align:start position:0%
that because I think the best person to
 
04:06:56.110 --> 04:06:56.120 align:start position:0%
the best group to decide what a
 
04:06:58.990 --> 04:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
neighborhood is is likely your local
 
04:07:01.269 --> 04:07:01.279 align:start position:0%
municipality so if they set what the
 
04:07:03.750 --> 04:07:03.760 align:start position:0%
standard is I mean it could be in some
 
04:07:06.269 --> 04:07:06.279 align:start position:0%
some municipalities a neighborhood may
 
04:07:08.830 --> 04:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
be 500 feet in some neighborhoods it may
 
04:07:11.349 --> 04:07:11.359 align:start position:0%
be a th000 feet so I think what you'd
 
04:07:14.710 --> 04:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
ask is in the legis in the ordinance it
 
04:07:18.670 --> 04:07:18.680 align:start position:0%
would designate what that area is as
 
04:07:20.349 --> 04:07:20.359 align:start position:0%
well and then what that meant in terms
 
04:07:23.110 --> 04:07:23.120 align:start position:0%
of massing and Frontage but isn't this
 
04:07:24.750 --> 04:07:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill intended to limit what the
 
04:07:28.750 --> 04:07:28.760 align:start position:0%
municipality can do that that is to say
 
04:07:31.349 --> 04:07:31.359 align:start position:0%
we have to allow more density than the
 
04:07:34.109 --> 04:07:34.119 align:start position:0%
municipality might otherwise
 
04:07:37.510 --> 04:07:37.520 align:start position:0%
allow it is and I think what we're I'm
 
04:07:40.590 --> 04:07:40.600 align:start position:0%
so in my brain what I was thinking is we
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
have another piece of legislation that's
 
04:07:44.630 --> 04:07:44.640 align:start position:0%
saying that in res residential zones you
 
04:07:44.640 --> 04:07:45.469 align:start position:0%
saying that in res residential zones you
can't

04:07:45.469 --> 04:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
can't
 
04:07:49.349 --> 04:07:49.359 align:start position:0%
do uh more than half an acre but in a
 
04:07:51.550 --> 04:07:51.560 align:start position:0%
lot of our residential zones a half an
 
04:07:53.870 --> 04:07:53.880 align:start position:0%
acre is really really big and so what
 
04:07:56.550 --> 04:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking at is a way not to
 
04:07:59.990 --> 04:08:00.000 align:start position:0%
get a variance but a way that you can as
 
04:08:02.229 --> 04:08:02.239 align:start position:0%
long as you as long as you look like the
 
04:08:03.590 --> 04:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
rest of the neighborhood you can build
 
04:08:05.429 --> 04:08:05.439 align:start position:0%
on a smaller lot so this is supposed to
 
04:08:08.710 --> 04:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
allow you to do more than you could ex
 
04:08:10.910 --> 04:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
exact exactly that but you need
 
04:08:14.070 --> 04:08:14.080 align:start position:0%
something specific to De to find the
 
04:08:16.630 --> 04:08:16.640 align:start position:0%
area that you intend to cover and just
 
04:08:18.109 --> 04:08:18.119 align:start position:0%
to say
 
04:08:20.870 --> 04:08:20.880 align:start position:0%
neighborhood it's too
 
04:08:22.950 --> 04:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
wishy-washy um you're going to have
 
04:08:25.790 --> 04:08:25.800 align:start position:0%
endless argument about that and honestly
 
04:08:28.429 --> 04:08:28.439 align:start position:0%
it will allow the municipality to Define
 
04:08:30.309 --> 04:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods in such a way that it
 
04:08:32.950 --> 04:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
would limit the density anyway so I I
 
04:08:34.269 --> 04:08:34.279 align:start position:0%
have to say I think that there would be
 
04:08:37.309 --> 04:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:40.590 --> 04:08:40.600 align:start position:0%
that I I I would Echo representative
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
Gibbs comments um I I think that's a
 
04:08:44.349 --> 04:08:44.359 align:start position:0%
that's a good point you know one of the
 
04:08:45.750 --> 04:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
ways cuz I'm I'm thinking about
 
04:08:48.229 --> 04:08:48.239 align:start position:0%
ultimately what is the goal of this bill
 
04:08:50.670 --> 04:08:50.680 align:start position:0%
and what this bill wants to allow is if
 
04:08:52.109 --> 04:08:52.119 align:start position:0%
you have a lot that let's say was
 
04:08:54.790 --> 04:08:54.800 align:start position:0%
subdivided back in the day and then you
 
04:08:58.070 --> 04:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
had new zoning or zoning imposed and now
 
04:08:59.630 --> 04:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
you have this lot which is ex
 
04:09:02.870 --> 04:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
essentially undevelopable so a a way to
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
put those lots back into use to where
 
04:09:07.910 --> 04:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
they can be used in a way that is
 
04:09:10.510 --> 04:09:10.520 align:start position:0%
similar to what is already there so I
 
04:09:12.149 --> 04:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
was thinking about what if what if
 
04:09:13.389 --> 04:09:13.399 align:start position:0%
instead of doing the neighborhood
 
04:09:17.149 --> 04:09:17.159 align:start position:0%
density kind of test maybe keep that as
 
04:09:19.109 --> 04:09:19.119 align:start position:0%
a test maybe even with you know
 
04:09:21.469 --> 04:09:21.479 align:start position:0%
Municipal municipality weighing in on it
 
04:09:24.710 --> 04:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
but then also have a separate way that
 
04:09:28.870 --> 04:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
you can get to um density Conformity
 
04:09:30.670 --> 04:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
without a variance and I was thinking of
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
two different ways one of which is to
 
04:09:36.070 --> 04:09:36.080 align:start position:0%
say well if you have an AB budding lot
 
04:09:37.710 --> 04:09:37.720 align:start position:0%
that has a certain amount of density
 
04:09:39.389 --> 04:09:39.399 align:start position:0%
then you can also build on your
 
04:09:42.030 --> 04:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
neighboring lot as long as your density
 
04:09:44.189 --> 04:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
does not exceed what your neighbor
 
04:09:47.229 --> 04:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
already has so that would automatically
 
04:09:49.109 --> 04:09:49.119 align:start position:0%
whatever your neighbor has would be
 
04:09:51.070 --> 04:09:51.080 align:start position:0%
something in the neighborhood so you
 
04:09:53.309 --> 04:09:53.319 align:start position:0%
would automatically as of right be very
 
04:09:55.070 --> 04:09:55.080 align:start position:0%
easy to figure out this is the max
 
04:09:56.429 --> 04:09:56.439 align:start position:0%
density I can have on this and
 
04:09:58.670 --> 04:09:58.680 align:start position:0%
presumably that developed lot was you
 
04:09:59.990 --> 04:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
know developed you know in Conformity
 
04:10:01.349 --> 04:10:01.359 align:start position:0%
with the neighborhood the second thing
 
04:10:05.229 --> 04:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
you could do is you could also say um
 
04:10:08.550 --> 04:10:08.560 align:start position:0%
you are allowed to have the density as
 
04:10:11.550 --> 04:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
was allowed when the lot was first
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
subdivided well on your your first um
 
04:10:17.389 --> 04:10:17.399 align:start position:0%
suggestion um why does it have to be an
 
04:10:19.830 --> 04:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
udding lot I mean it seems to make more
 
04:10:23.429 --> 04:10:23.439 align:start position:0%
sense to me to say um the nearby three
 
04:10:25.590 --> 04:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
or four Lots which I think the a thou
 
04:10:27.750 --> 04:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
the thousand foot area would cover
 
04:10:30.229 --> 04:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
rather than just you know by Chance the
 
04:10:32.830 --> 04:10:32.840 align:start position:0%
abing lot matches or it doesn't match
 
04:10:35.950 --> 04:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
that doesn't seem very fair and
 
04:10:38.870 --> 04:10:38.880 align:start position:0%
then how it was when it was originally
 
04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
subdivided it might take a lot of effort
 
04:10:43.389 --> 04:10:43.399 align:start position:0%
to find that out you know it might have
 
04:10:44.349 --> 04:10:44.359 align:start position:0%
been done in
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
1920 and it would take a lot of
 
04:10:48.830 --> 04:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
searching through the records to find
 
04:10:50.950 --> 04:10:50.960 align:start position:0%
that and also it was a different world
 
04:10:54.950 --> 04:10:54.960 align:start position:0%
in 1920 I don't know that we really that
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
we want to put all of that weight on
 
04:11:01.349 --> 04:11:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:03.550 --> 04:11:03.560 align:start position:0%
1920 so I like a lot of the points have
 
04:11:04.590 --> 04:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
been brought up one of the thing that I
 
04:11:06.149 --> 04:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
would like the the subcommittee to
 
04:11:08.790 --> 04:11:08.800 align:start position:0%
consider is lots that weren't subdivided
 
04:11:10.790 --> 04:11:10.800 align:start position:0%
but lie within those neighborhoods that
 
04:11:12.750 --> 04:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
maybe now if they were to build today
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
they're only able to get one but you may
 
04:11:16.189 --> 04:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
able to get two or three homes out of
 
04:11:18.429 --> 04:11:18.439 align:start position:0%
that which would really help the the the
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
housing crisis that we're in um so for
 
04:11:23.229 --> 04:11:23.239 align:start position:0%
me I wouldn't tie it to just existing
 
04:11:25.910 --> 04:11:25.920 align:start position:0%
Lots I would tie it to kind of what my
 
04:11:27.870 --> 04:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
view of the original Bill's intent was
 
04:11:30.189 --> 04:11:30.199 align:start position:0%
to say that if there's land within this
 
04:11:32.550 --> 04:11:32.560 align:start position:0%
neighborhood that you can make conform
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
to the neighborhood then you should be
 
04:11:36.030 --> 04:11:36.040 align:start position:0%
allowed to build on it based on those on
 
04:11:38.550 --> 04:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
those on that density uh for me I think
 
04:11:40.149 --> 04:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
the thousand feet will throw at a couple
 
04:11:42.309 --> 04:11:42.319 align:start position:0%
things uh I think a th000 feet is a lot
 
04:11:44.109 --> 04:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
smaller when you when you hear it it
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
sounds like a very far distance when you
 
04:11:47.349 --> 04:11:47.359 align:start position:0%
actually drive it or walk down the road
 
04:11:50.309 --> 04:11:50.319 align:start position:0%
it's not very far um I would say that
 
04:11:52.109 --> 04:11:52.119 align:start position:0%
you almost run it like a buffer where
 
04:11:53.790 --> 04:11:53.800 align:start position:0%
you say 1,000 feet from the property
 
04:11:56.469 --> 04:11:56.479 align:start position:0%
lines instead of just a a random uh dot
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
that you're throwing on on a map um I
 
04:12:01.109 --> 04:12:01.119 align:start position:0%
would say that it has to go with uh lot
 
04:12:03.790 --> 04:12:03.800 align:start position:0%
size and Frontage not just because
 
04:12:05.990 --> 04:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
without Frontage the lot size doesn't
 
04:12:08.510 --> 04:12:08.520 align:start position:0%
mean anything in my Appo in my opinion
 
04:12:09.630 --> 04:12:09.640 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing that I would
 
04:12:11.189 --> 04:12:11.199 align:start position:0%
say is that I think it that Conformity
 
04:12:13.389 --> 04:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
should be based on a majority I I don't
 
04:12:17.349 --> 04:12:17.359 align:start position:0%
think 90% um I don't think 90% is fair
 
04:12:18.910 --> 04:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
quite frankly originally I was thinking
 
04:12:20.389 --> 04:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
onethird but I didn't think that would
 
04:12:22.389 --> 04:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
get too much traction so I could agree
 
04:12:25.109 --> 04:12:25.119 align:start position:0%
on a majority and then as for who
 
04:12:27.910 --> 04:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
controls it in line 16 I think it should
 
04:12:29.830 --> 04:12:29.840 align:start position:0%
be based on the zoning administrator or
 
04:12:32.030 --> 04:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
permit technician uh because that would
 
04:12:33.870 --> 04:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
be the the department that would have to
 
04:12:36.590 --> 04:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
check that box off anyways um and then
 
04:12:38.830 --> 04:12:38.840 align:start position:0%
that way when somebody files for this it
 
04:12:40.910 --> 04:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
just simply it goes through staff
 
04:12:45.349 --> 04:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
approval those are good ideas I age so I
 
04:12:47.429 --> 04:12:47.439 align:start position:0%
I to to your point of like looking at
 
04:12:49.309 --> 04:12:49.319 align:start position:0%
what the it was when it was first sub I
 
04:12:50.790 --> 04:12:50.800 align:start position:0%
asked that question because I was like
 
04:12:53.189 --> 04:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
what if we did it in like 19 and they
 
04:12:54.950 --> 04:12:54.960 align:start position:0%
actually pulled it right up it was the
 
04:12:56.710 --> 04:12:56.720 align:start position:0%
town does have records of all that you
 
04:12:58.790 --> 04:12:58.800 align:start position:0%
do keep records of all your zoning so
 
04:13:01.510 --> 04:13:01.520 align:start position:0%
you could answer that and I I assumed
 
04:13:03.670 --> 04:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
that you would go back to kind of what
 
04:13:06.349 --> 04:13:06.359 align:start position:0%
was the most permissive uh when it was
 
04:13:09.550 --> 04:13:09.560 align:start position:0%
done but I do like your idea if you said
 
04:13:11.750 --> 04:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
you you could go back and find out what
 
04:13:14.429 --> 04:13:14.439 align:start position:0%
what the ordinance that allowed the
 
04:13:18.469 --> 04:13:18.479 align:start position:0%
majority of the the the in your buffer
 
04:13:21.830 --> 04:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
zone that that that would be permitted
 
04:13:23.590 --> 04:13:23.600 align:start position:0%
and that it had to meet though but it
 
04:13:24.990 --> 04:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
had to meet those requirements it had to
 
04:13:27.070 --> 04:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
meet the frontage and it had to meet the
 
04:13:27.080 --> 04:13:28.229 align:start position:0%
meet the frontage and it had to meet the
lot

04:13:28.229 --> 04:13:28.239 align:start position:0%
lot
 
04:13:30.510 --> 04:13:30.520 align:start position:0%
size that makes that makes a lot of
 
04:13:32.070 --> 04:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
sense and I think the idea of making it
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
a th000 feet from the property line is
 
04:13:36.790 --> 04:13:36.800 align:start position:0%
also a good idea because that specifies
 
04:13:39.349 --> 04:13:39.359 align:start position:0%
exactly where it is whereas the end of
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
the house might be different for each
 
04:13:42.790 --> 04:13:42.800 align:start position:0%
Builder but the property line is the
 
04:13:42.800 --> 04:13:45.710 align:start position:0%
Builder but the property line is the
proper

04:13:45.710 --> 04:13:45.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:48.070 --> 04:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
line yeah and I just wanted to mention a
 
04:13:49.590 --> 04:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
th000 ft that's that's less than a
 
04:13:52.149 --> 04:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
quarter mile that's pretty pretty tight
 
04:13:53.389 --> 04:13:53.399 align:start position:0%
I can tell you like up in the North
 
04:13:55.670 --> 04:13:55.680 align:start position:0%
Country I mean 1,000 ft I mean you're
 
04:13:57.070 --> 04:13:57.080 align:start position:0%
going to be still in the same
 
04:14:00.030 --> 04:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhood in most places so I I I
 
04:14:01.550 --> 04:14:01.560 align:start position:0%
think it's I think it's pretty tight one
 
04:14:03.990 --> 04:14:04.000 align:start position:0%
of one of my suggestions and I like your
 
04:14:05.389 --> 04:14:05.399 align:start position:0%
you know where you're thinking um in
 
04:14:07.550 --> 04:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
terms of um representative Dumont with
 
04:14:09.510 --> 04:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
the with the zoning administrator and
 
04:14:11.990 --> 04:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
the majority um you know of the
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
properties within that thous foot radius
 
04:14:16.830 --> 04:14:16.840 align:start position:0%
from the property line um so I I what I
 
04:14:19.389 --> 04:14:19.399 align:start position:0%
was proposing was let's have different
 
04:14:22.710 --> 04:14:22.720 align:start position:0%
ways to check this box we can have one
 
04:14:25.670 --> 04:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
way that you can satisfy this by The
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
Neighborhood um you know existing
 
04:14:30.830 --> 04:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
density and then another one by what was
 
04:14:34.030 --> 04:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
allowed historically you know that way
 
04:14:37.229 --> 04:14:37.239 align:start position:0%
you have um you know more than more than
 
04:14:39.910 --> 04:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
one way to easily discern whether or not
 
04:14:39.920 --> 04:14:40.670 align:start position:0%
one way to easily discern whether or not
it's

04:14:40.670 --> 04:14:40.680 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:14:43.990 --> 04:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
allowed so can I ask you so back to this
 
04:14:45.950 --> 04:14:45.960 align:start position:0%
because I I do like the idea that it
 
04:14:47.950 --> 04:14:47.960 align:start position:0%
just goes to like it's administrative
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
approval rather than you have to go back
 
04:14:51.990 --> 04:14:52.000 align:start position:0%
to the planning board so would you be
 
04:14:55.630 --> 04:14:55.640 align:start position:0%
okay that if we said yes you could use
 
04:14:57.830 --> 04:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
ex I I think you're saying you're AB
 
04:15:00.830 --> 04:15:00.840 align:start position:0%
budding is a good one with me AB budding
 
04:15:04.590 --> 04:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
historically what the majority of the
 
04:15:06.429 --> 04:15:06.439 align:start position:0%
neighborhood and I'm fine with your
 
04:15:08.510 --> 04:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
thousand feet even though as we move to
 
04:15:10.510 --> 04:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
like Portsmith a th000 feet gets to be
 
04:15:14.510 --> 04:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
really big but that either existing or
 
04:15:16.229 --> 04:15:16.239 align:start position:0%
you know AB budding or historically it
 
04:15:17.950 --> 04:15:17.960 align:start position:0%
was okay it could go to administrative
 
04:15:19.710 --> 04:15:19.720 align:start position:0%
but it was approved by your local
 
04:15:23.550 --> 04:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
governing body are you okay with
 
04:15:26.109 --> 04:15:26.119 align:start position:0%
that so you saying for them to develop a
 
04:15:27.670 --> 04:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
policy Within These within these
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
standards and for their approval um I I
 
04:15:32.990 --> 04:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
mean I would say that if if that was the
 
04:15:35.229 --> 04:15:35.239 align:start position:0%
way the majority here felt then I would
 
04:15:36.630 --> 04:15:36.640 align:start position:0%
be okay with that because I think that's
 
04:15:38.429 --> 04:15:38.439 align:start position:0%
a step in the right direction but I
 
04:15:40.349 --> 04:15:40.359 align:start position:0%
think what this bill's intent was is to
 
04:15:43.950 --> 04:15:43.960 align:start position:0%
say you guys tried it and it didn't work
 
04:15:46.229 --> 04:15:46.239 align:start position:0%
here's a here's a solution from from our
 
04:15:49.830 --> 04:15:49.840 align:start position:0%
point of view um so I'm kind of up in
 
04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
the air I guess on that on that part of
 
04:15:53.269 --> 04:15:53.279 align:start position:0%
it because I'm just not sure that you'll
 
04:15:55.269 --> 04:15:55.279 align:start position:0%
see them adopting it that's that's my
 
04:15:55.279 --> 04:15:57.349 align:start position:0%
see them adopting it that's that's my
only

04:15:57.349 --> 04:15:57.359 align:start position:0%
only
 
04:16:01.030 --> 04:16:01.040 align:start position:0%
thing do we maybe want to for because I
 
04:16:02.990 --> 04:16:03.000 align:start position:0%
I think what you're getting at is a
 
04:16:05.429 --> 04:16:05.439 align:start position:0%
th000 feet is too much for for your part
 
04:16:08.830 --> 04:16:08.840 align:start position:0%
of the state yeah so what if we do a
 
04:16:12.189 --> 04:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
compromise where I mean th000 ft works
 
04:16:14.990 --> 04:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
great you know where I am but maybe say
 
04:16:18.189 --> 04:16:18.199 align:start position:0%
if it's a um you know if it's a town
 
04:16:20.990 --> 04:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
that has a per capita density above a
 
04:16:22.630 --> 04:16:22.640 align:start position:0%
certain amount or if it's a census
 
04:16:24.830 --> 04:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
designated urban area or something
 
04:16:28.070 --> 04:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
tighten it up a little bit would that
 
04:16:31.229 --> 04:16:31.239 align:start position:0%
help yeah I'm I just don't know what the
 
04:16:32.469 --> 04:16:32.479 align:start position:0%
I feel like I'm throwing a dart I don't
 
04:16:34.070 --> 04:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
know what the number is for me I think
 
04:16:35.670 --> 04:16:35.680 align:start position:0%
that over complicates it I'll be I'll be
 
04:16:38.269 --> 04:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
right up front with you um I I got to
 
04:16:39.990 --> 04:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stand strong and I don't
 
04:16:42.510 --> 04:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
think that a th000 ft is a lot I will
 
04:16:44.910 --> 04:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
even at as in one of Hudson's most dense
 
04:16:46.389 --> 04:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and I talk to you about
 
04:16:48.189 --> 04:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
this is is our traditional residential
 
04:16:50.870 --> 04:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
which is 90 ft of Frontage so we're
 
04:16:52.790 --> 04:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
talking about 10 homes that you're that
 
04:16:54.910 --> 04:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
you're going by that's less than a
 
04:16:57.429 --> 04:16:57.439 align:start position:0%
street in most cases so for me it that
 
04:16:59.469 --> 04:16:59.479 align:start position:0%
fits the neighborhood and you know I
 
04:17:01.870 --> 04:17:01.880 align:start position:0%
brought up an example earlier uh to
 
04:17:05.510 --> 04:17:05.520 align:start position:0%
represent Howland that in Hudson we had
 
04:17:07.750 --> 04:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
a case where they just drew a business
 
04:17:09.149 --> 04:17:09.159 align:start position:0%
district line right through tra
 
04:17:11.070 --> 04:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
traditional residential and if that
 
04:17:13.830 --> 04:17:13.840 align:start position:0%
person was to not be owed to go outside
 
04:17:15.670 --> 04:17:15.680 align:start position:0%
of the zone and and compile this
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
information they would have had to
 
04:17:18.630 --> 04:17:18.640 align:start position:0%
either put a gas station or a multif
 
04:17:20.990 --> 04:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
family development inside a traditional
 
04:17:22.750 --> 04:17:22.760 align:start position:0%
residential Zone just because somebody
 
04:17:24.030 --> 04:17:24.040 align:start position:0%
threw a line through the middle of the
 
04:17:26.149 --> 04:17:26.159 align:start position:0%
neighborhood per se so that's why I
 
04:17:27.870 --> 04:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
think it's important to have that
 
04:17:30.189 --> 04:17:30.199 align:start position:0%
thousand feet in my mind I would
 
04:17:32.189 --> 04:17:32.199 align:start position:0%
recommend sticking with a thousand feet
 
04:17:34.670 --> 04:17:34.680 align:start position:0%
that sounds reasonable it isn't that big
 
04:17:37.030 --> 04:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
I I don't think I mean I I mean
 
04:17:38.590 --> 04:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
ultimately we're just trying to get
 
04:17:40.590 --> 04:17:40.600 align:start position:0%
houses on smaller Lots isn't that what
 
04:17:43.269 --> 04:17:43.279 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do
 
04:17:45.870 --> 04:17:45.880 align:start position:0%
I think for this one it's to make houses
 
04:17:48.030 --> 04:17:48.040 align:start position:0%
conform uh to the neighborhood so I
 
04:17:49.590 --> 04:17:49.600 align:start position:0%
don't know I mean yeah they essentially
 
04:17:50.790 --> 04:17:50.800 align:start position:0%
I guess they would be smaller than what
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
they're what they're asking for today
 
04:17:54.630 --> 04:17:54.640 align:start position:0%
but really you're just making them the
 
04:17:56.670 --> 04:17:56.680 align:start position:0%
same as what's already there yeah I mean
 
04:17:59.309 --> 04:17:59.319 align:start position:0%
again as I my point about that too you
 
04:18:02.590 --> 04:18:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's the lot is smaller but if you
 
04:18:04.870 --> 04:18:04.880 align:start position:0%
do control the massing and the frontage
 
04:18:07.469 --> 04:18:07.479 align:start position:0%
it'll fit within the neighborhood right
 
04:18:10.590 --> 04:18:10.600 align:start position:0%
so it's like as long as the house can so
 
04:18:12.950 --> 04:18:12.960 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a really small a
 
04:18:15.510 --> 04:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
lot you may not be able to build your
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
3,000 ft house there but you could fit a
 
04:18:21.750 --> 04:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
1200t house that's situated with the
 
04:18:23.950 --> 04:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
right front edge and it it would fit
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
right in it's just a smaller
 
04:18:27.910 --> 04:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
house yeah to that point that's exactly
 
04:18:29.790 --> 04:18:29.800 align:start position:0%
what I envisioned is that with the same
 
04:18:31.229 --> 04:18:31.239 align:start position:0%
density in Frontage you're going to have
 
04:18:33.109 --> 04:18:33.119 align:start position:0%
similar building envelopes which would
 
04:18:34.550 --> 04:18:34.560 align:start position:0%
then dictate the size of the house that
 
04:18:36.550 --> 04:18:36.560 align:start position:0%
could be put on
 
04:18:39.550 --> 04:18:39.560 align:start position:0%
there see if I can tie this all together
 
04:18:40.830 --> 04:18:40.840 align:start position:0%
because I think what I really want to do
 
04:18:43.750 --> 04:18:43.760 align:start position:0%
is to try to write it up and then we can
 
04:18:46.389 --> 04:18:46.399 align:start position:0%
look at it and you guys can do the fun
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
of word smithing so so let me just
 
04:18:51.590 --> 04:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
clarify would this be the state is
 
04:18:53.870 --> 04:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
dictating you have to do this or is it
 
04:18:56.269 --> 04:18:56.279 align:start position:0%
like would you go you want the
 
04:18:59.309 --> 04:18:59.319 align:start position:0%
municipality to adopt
 
04:19:01.630 --> 04:19:01.640 align:start position:0%
this I think we're saying the state is
 
04:19:04.870 --> 04:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
saying you have to do this okay I would
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
say since in essence a variance the
 
04:19:09.469 --> 04:19:09.479 align:start position:0%
criteria for variance is set by the
 
04:19:11.349 --> 04:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
state that there can't be a reason why
 
04:19:13.670 --> 04:19:13.680 align:start position:0%
the state gives an alternative to that
 
04:19:16.990 --> 04:19:17.000 align:start position:0%
okay so it's state mandated let me start
 
04:19:21.990 --> 04:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
with that uh number two is that uh the
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
criteria for uh for doing it uh is that
 
04:19:31.830 --> 04:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
it has to be consistent with the the
 
04:19:33.630 --> 04:19:33.640 align:start position:0%
majority of the
 
04:19:37.830 --> 04:19:37.840 align:start position:0%
existing uh homes in the neighborhood
 
04:19:39.590 --> 04:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
which we're defining as a th000 square
 
04:19:42.990 --> 04:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
feet a th000 square feet I I to % of
 
04:19:44.469 --> 04:19:44.479 align:start position:0%
Gibbs point I would just eliminate the
 
04:19:46.189 --> 04:19:46.199 align:start position:0%
word I me and not that I'm saying get
 
04:19:47.590 --> 04:19:47.600 align:start position:0%
away from the but just eliminate the
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
word and say within a th a th000 feet of
 
04:19:52.590 --> 04:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
the property lines th000 feet of
 
04:19:57.950 --> 04:19:57.960 align:start position:0%
property line that's good and then to
 
04:20:03.349 --> 04:20:03.359 align:start position:0%
yours uh point it uh H it you could use
 
04:20:05.790 --> 04:20:05.800 align:start position:0%
either because you had two criteria it
 
04:20:08.870 --> 04:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
was either within 1,000 ft what was the
 
04:20:10.550 --> 04:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
majority of the property is within a
 
04:20:13.630 --> 04:20:13.640 align:start position:0%
th000 square ft of the
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
property line within a th000 ft I think
 
04:20:18.830 --> 04:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
making a th000 sareet too complicated
 
04:20:22.070 --> 04:20:22.080 align:start position:0%
th000 ft or that you could show
 
04:20:24.550 --> 04:20:24.560 align:start position:0%
historically that in the past it was
 
04:20:27.590 --> 04:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
allowed in zoning is that does that
 
04:20:38.030 --> 04:20:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:40.990 --> 04:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
yes in terms of historic um you know
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
neighborhoods and what was you know
 
04:20:44.309 --> 04:20:44.319 align:start position:0%
allowed historically in terms of
 
04:20:45.870 --> 04:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
historic preservation I mean you are
 
04:20:47.469 --> 04:20:47.479 align:start position:0%
literally going to what the historic
 
04:20:50.229 --> 04:20:50.239 align:start position:0%
standards were so at least in terms of
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
density not in terms of building quality
 
04:20:54.349 --> 04:20:54.359 align:start position:0%
or anything like that okay I I think I
 
04:20:56.070 --> 04:20:56.080 align:start position:0%
got is there any I mean I think that
 
04:20:58.070 --> 04:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
does that cover it the only thing that I
 
04:20:59.349 --> 04:20:59.359 align:start position:0%
would like to make sure that's in there
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
from my perspective is that it should
 
04:21:03.030 --> 04:21:03.040 align:start position:0%
you know line 16 should read the local
 
04:21:05.189 --> 04:21:05.199 align:start position:0%
zoning administrator or permit
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
technician um I only throw Perman
 
04:21:08.269 --> 04:21:08.279 align:start position:0%
technician in there because I know some
 
04:21:09.790 --> 04:21:09.800 align:start position:0%
towns have somebody that goes through
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
all those documents Hudson has a zoning
 
04:21:13.149 --> 04:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
administrator um the local zoning
 
04:21:14.790 --> 04:21:14.800 align:start position:0%
administrator perit technician shall be
 
04:21:16.670 --> 04:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for verifying that the
 
04:21:19.550 --> 04:21:19.560 align:start position:0%
proposed building um um
 
04:21:21.750 --> 04:21:21.760 align:start position:0%
Lots uh conform to the density
 
04:21:23.630 --> 04:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
requirements under this section okay
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
that's good I like that because that
 
04:21:28.469 --> 04:21:28.479 align:start position:0%
means then theoretically as long as you
 
04:21:30.750 --> 04:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
can if you put in your
 
04:21:33.670 --> 04:21:33.680 align:start position:0%
application that administrator checks
 
04:21:35.830 --> 04:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
and says it's okay then you can build it
 
04:21:35.840 --> 04:21:38.990 align:start position:0%
and says it's okay then you can build it
right

04:21:38.990 --> 04:21:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:41.830 --> 04:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that c so I'll write this
 
04:21:44.950 --> 04:21:44.960 align:start position:0%
up and I'll uh I guess the best thing
 
04:21:47.149 --> 04:21:47.159 align:start position:0%
I'm supposed to do is send it to Joe
 
04:21:51.070 --> 04:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
yeah and then ask him how he wants us we
 
04:21:53.309 --> 04:21:53.319 align:start position:0%
probably should meet one more time just
 
04:21:56.349 --> 04:21:56.359 align:start position:0%
to look over it and yeah you could do a
 
04:21:58.070 --> 04:21:58.080 align:start position:0%
a first read or you could do a you know
 
04:22:00.070 --> 04:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
a reading a vote um typically on the
 
04:22:02.309 --> 04:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
local level we have a first read of that
 
04:22:04.510 --> 04:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
final uh document and then we vote after
 
04:22:06.269 --> 04:22:06.279 align:start position:0%
but however everybody sees fit we're the
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
same we do like we actually we're more
 
04:22:10.189 --> 04:22:10.199 align:start position:0%
painful we do first read and second read
 
04:22:11.990 --> 04:22:12.000 align:start position:0%
but nonetheless I want to make sure
 
04:22:13.870 --> 04:22:13.880 align:start position:0%
everybody that we got the language right
 
04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
before we do any voting I like that all
 
04:22:19.950 --> 04:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
right I think that was it record time
 
04:22:19.960 --> 04:22:22.590 align:start position:0%
right I think that was it record time
thank

04:22:22.590 --> 04:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:26.229 --> 04:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
you um so are we going to meet after the
 
04:22:29.830 --> 04:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
next um housing committee
 
04:22:33.469 --> 04:22:33.479 align:start position:0%
meeting I have to ask the boss how this
 
04:22:36.189 --> 04:22:36.199 align:start position:0%
actually operates but at least let me
 
04:22:38.030 --> 04:22:38.040 align:start position:0%
put together the language every and
 
04:22:39.790 --> 04:22:39.800 align:start position:0%
everything and then I'll ask him how he
 
04:22:41.790 --> 04:22:41.800 align:start position:0%
wants to approach when we meet because I
 
04:22:42.910 --> 04:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
don't know what the meeting schedule's
 
04:22:44.710 --> 04:22:44.720 align:start position:0%
going to be
 
04:22:47.349 --> 04:22:47.359 align:start position:0%
like yeah and I just like to add that um
 
04:22:49.429 --> 04:22:49.439 align:start position:0%
meeting after the main committee
 
04:22:52.910 --> 04:22:52.920 align:start position:0%
meetings works really well for me um so
 
04:22:54.269 --> 04:22:54.279 align:start position:0%
I'd like to continue that although
 
04:22:55.990 --> 04:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
hopefully maybe tighten it our lunch
 
04:22:59.189 --> 04:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
break up a little bit I I have great
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
respect for all of you that are
 
04:23:02.950 --> 04:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
gainfully employed and that we try to
 
04:23:04.790 --> 04:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
make it as efficient as humanly possible
 
04:23:06.870 --> 04:23:06.880 align:start position:0%
so I'll try with
 
04:23:09.630 --> 04:23:09.640 align:start position:0%
that and the next meeting is scheduled
 
04:23:11.830 --> 04:23:11.840 align:start position:0%
for for the 18th so it could be after
 
04:23:11.840 --> 04:23:13.590 align:start position:0%
for for the 18th so it could be after
that

04:23:13.590 --> 04:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:23:13.600 --> 04:23:41.429 align:start position:0%
that
I'll

04:23:41.429 --> 04:23:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:41.439 --> 04:24:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
ask

04:24:11.349 --> 04:24:11.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.359 --> 04:24:41.309 align:start position:0%
 
e

04:24:41.309 --> 04:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
